        "title": "Trump begins speaking with impeachment lawyer, even as he scrambles to build defense team",
        "body_text": "Former President Donald Trump is still working to assemble a full legal team for his Senate impeachment trial, people familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday, even as he has begun to craft a defense strategy with Butch Bowers, the South Carolina lawyer who has agreed to represent him in the historic proceedings.\n Bowers -- a respected lawyer from Columbia, South Carolina, who once worked in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush -- has been in conversation with Trump in recent days, according to two people familiar with the matter. Bowers was connected to Trump by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is also helping to add new lawyers to the team.\n RELATED: Biden tells CNN Trump's impeachment trial 'has to happen'\n Charlie Condon, a former South Carolina attorney general who now works in private practice in Charleston, has been approached about joining the legal team, two people familiar with the matter said. In a brief statement to CNN on Monday evening, Condon wrote: \"I am not representing former President Trump. Thanks.\"\n A spokesman for the former President declined to comment on any additions to Trump's legal team.\n But with just two weeks before the substance of the trial is set to get underway, Trump is still struggling to find other lawyers to join his team, people familiar with the matter said. Some law firms have raised questions about whether they would be paid and other layers have expressed a reluctance to associate themselves with the deadly insurrection of the US Capitol on January 6, the people said.\n News of Trump's struggles to secure counsel comes the same day that House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of the former President's second impeachment trial. They walked across the Capitol on Monday evening and read on the Senate floor the charge against him, the first president in history to be impeached twice.\n The contours of Trump's Senate trial are starting to take shape as the ceremonial elements get underway, with the Senate's longest-serving Democrat expected to preside over the trial and Democrats still weighing whether to pursue witnesses during proceedings that could take up a chunk of February.\n Asked if he thinks Trump's defense team will want to call witnesses, Graham, a close ally of Trump, said he did not know, adding, \"I can't imagine who you'd call\" and noting that the House did not have anyone testify in their impeachment proceedings.\n The South Carolina Republican argued for dismissing the trial based on a \"constitutional lack of jurisdiction.\"\n Graham said he talked to Trump on Sunday, while the former President was golfing in Florida.\n Asked about Trump's mindset and preparations ahead of his second impeachment trial, Graham said, \"Well, I think he'd like to get it over with.\" He said he \"wouldn't think\" Trump would come back from Florida for the proceedings, again emphasizing the desire for a quick trial.\n The exact time frame of the trial itself, which will begin the week of February 8, is also unknown, but multiple impeachment managers have said they don't think it will go as long as the 21 days of Trump's trial in 2020. The expectation is still, however, that it will take up much of February and wrap up by month's end, if not sooner.\n The second impeachment is also expected to differ from the first in another key way. Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n Instead, Vermont Democraict Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, is expected to preside, the sources said. The Constitution says the chief justice presides when the person facing trial is the current president of the United States, but senators preside in other cases, one source said.\n CNN's Caroline Kelly and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Election technology company Dominion sues Giuliani for $1.3 billion over 'Big Lie' about election fraud",
        "body_text": "An election technology company that has been the focus of consistent conspiracy theories by Donald Trump and his allies has sued the former President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani for defamation after he pushed the \"Big Lie\" about election fraud on his podcast and TV appearances.\n Dominion Voting Systems is seeking more than $1.3 billion in damages.\n \"Just as Giuliani and his allies intended, the Big Lie went viral on social media as people tweeted, retweeted, and raged that Dominion had stolen their votes. While some lies -- little lies -- flare up on social media and die with the next news cycle, the Big Lie was different,\" lawyers for Dominion wrote in the lawsuit, filed in DC District Court on Monday morning. \"The harm to Dominion's business and reputation is unprecedented and irreparable because of how fervently millions of people believe it.\"\n The lawsuit notes that while Giuliani spread falsehoods about Dominion being owned by Venezuelan communists and corrupting the election, he did not make those claims in lawsuits he pushed on behalf of Trump.\n \"Dominion's defamation lawsuit for $1.3B will allow me to investigate their history, finances, and practices fully and completely,\" Giuliani told CNN in a statement Monday. \"The amount being asked for is, quite obviously, intended to frighten people of faint heart. It is another act of intimidation by the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech, as well as the ability of lawyers to defend their clients vigorously.\"\n He said he will \"investigate a countersuit against them for violating these Constitutional rights.\"\n This is the second defamation lawsuit Dominion has filed in recent weeks seeking to recoup its losses following the Trump post-election disinformation campaign. The vote auditing company previously sued lawyer Sidney Powell, who pushed similar claims alongside Giuliani. The Powell lawsuit is still in its earliest stage.\n Dominion has positioned itself in recent weeks as a major voice to push back against Trump's false election claims and the insurrection of the Capitol by his followers who hoped to overturn Joe Biden's win.\n In the lawsuit Monday, the company focused on how Giuliani continued to claim without evidence that Dominion aided election fraud even after he received a cease-and-desist letter. The Canadian-founded company details how listeners of Giuliani reacted by amplifying online his message of a stolen election. The former mayor of New York and well-known prosecutor repeated his claims on podcasts and his radio show and YouTube shows. He also used his platform in recent months to make money pitching cigars, a conservative alternative to the AARP and the sale of gold coins, the lawsuit says.\n Giuliani also appeared on TV networks OANN, Fox and Fox Business to make accusations of election fraud, the lawsuit notes.\n Dominion also details how on January 6 -- hours before a crowd of Trump supporters in Washington violently overran the Capitol -- Giuliani continued to push claims of election fraud about Dominion in tweets, on a YouTube appearance and in his own speech at the event. Giuliani said at the rally, without evidence, that he knew of an expert who had examined Dominion voting machines and saw changed votes, concluding, \"This election was stolen,\" according to the complaint.\n Dominion sent Giuliani a second letter, asking for a retraction on January 10, the company says.\n \"Giuliani has not retracted his false claims about Dominion, and many of his false and defamatory television and radio appearances and tweets remain available online to a global internet audience. Indeed, to this day, he continues to double down on the Big Lie,\" the lawsuit noted.\n Dominion said it is now distrusted by millions of American voters and its employees have been harassed. The company believes hundreds of its contracts with states and localities are now in jeopardy and that the business projects a loss of profits in the next five years of $200 million, according to the lawsuit.\n Tom Clare, a lawyer for the company, said it may seek to depose Giuliani as part of the lawsuit.\n When asked on a call with the media Monday if Dominion plans to sue Trump himself, Clare said, \"We're not ruling anybody out.\"\n Previously, when Dominion sued Powell, the company said it was planning to bring additional lawsuits and was also looking at possibly suing media organizations that gave platforms to election disinformation. Clare said the same thing about Trump then -- that the company hadn't ruled out anyone yet as it plans additional litigation.\n \"There are a number of individuals and media companies that we think are complicit. They said them in their own voice, in their own personalities and in print, and they provided a platform,\" Clare said previously, after the Powell lawsuit was filed on January 8.\n \"There will be others\" sued, Clare said on Monday.\n This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "body_text": "Colombia's FARC political party, formed after the guerilla group with the same acronym was disbanded, has announced that it is is changing its name to \"Comunes,\" or \"Commons\" in English.\n \"I want to inform Colombia and the international community that from today we will bear the name #Comunes, because we are a party of common people working for a just country with well-being for common people,\" Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, the party's leader, tweeted on Sunday.\n The change signals a shift away from the country's history of more than 50 years of armed conflict, which killed at least 220,000 people, including many civilians.\n \"It is time to create a great coalition of forces with all the democrats in the country,\" Londo\u00f1o also said on Twitter. \"To build a Front that finishes consolidating Peace, giving satisfaction to all the victims, the uprooted, and thus being able to advance towards the construction of a just and democratic Colombia.\"\n The decision to change the name was made at a party gathering in the city of Medell\u00edn from Friday through Sunday. The party must now register the new name with the National Electoral Council.\n Formed in 1964, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) aimed to overthrow the government, redistribute wealth and fight inequality. Over the years, it was also accused of drug trafficking, bombings, murder, extortion and kidnappings. Several attempts at a peace deal between FARC and the government failed over the years until a final accord was signed in November, 2016.\n As part of the deal, members of the newly formed FARC party were granted seats in Congress. The demobilized guerillas decided to continue using the FARC acronym, but changed it to mean \"Common Alternative Revolutionary Force\" instead of the original \"Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\"\n However, Londo\u00f1o has told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol in the past that he believed this was a mistake, because the name FARC would always be associated with history of violence and would not allow the party to have a real voice in Colombia's politics.\n Congressional elections are set to take place on March 13, 2022.",

        "body_text": "An important heads-up for iPhone owners: Apple is warning customers that its smartphones could interfere with medical devices, including pacemakers.\n In a notice published on Apple's support page Saturday, the company expanded upon previously issued safety information, warning users that iPhones contain magnets and radios that emit electromagnetic fields, both of which \"may interfere\" with medical devices such as implanted pacemakers and defibrillators.\n The Saturday notice specifically warns users about \"the magnets inside\" all four iPhone 12 models, as well as MagSafe accessories. Apple (AAPL) notes that iPhone 12 versions contain more magnets than prior iPhone models, but it also said they don't pose a greater risk of magnetic interference with medical devices than earlier models.\n Apple said in the update that medical devices can contain sensors that may react to magnets or radio waves that come in close proximity. The company recommends keeping iPhones and MagSafe chargers a \"safe distance\" away from medical devices \u2014 which it defines as more than 6 inches apart, or 15 inches apart when wirelessly charging.\n When Apple unveiled the iPhone 12 last fall, the company also announced the return of MagSafe \u2014 formerly a beloved MacBook feature \u2014 for the iPhone. Customers can buy MagSafe charging docks to wirelessly juice-up their devices, and other magnetic accessories including cases and wallets that attach to the back of the phones.\n Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it is now expanding on the safety guidance. But the Heart Rhythm Journal released a report earlier this month claiming that the magnets in the iPhone 12 that make it compatible with MagSafe accessories could interfere with an implanted defibrillator.\n Health experts have long cautioned not to use or hold cellphones too close to implanted medical devices \u2014 for example, warning people not to store them in shirt pockets.\n \"Consult your physician and medical device manufacturer for information specific to your medical device and whether you need to maintain a safe distance of separation between your medical device and iPhone or any MagSafe accessories,\" Apple said in the notice. \"Manufacturers often provide recommendations on the safe use of their devices around wireless or magnetic products to prevent possible interference.\"\n If a customer feels like their iPhone 12 or MagSafe charger is interfering with their medical device, they should stop using them, Apple said.\n Another thing iPhone 12 users should be aware of when using MagSafe chargers: Avoid placing credit cards, security badges, passports or key FOBs between your phone and your MagSafe charger, as the magnets might damage magnetic strips or RFID chips in these items, Apple warns. If you have a phone case that holds such items, be sure to remove them before wirelessly charging your device.",

        "body_text": "The House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial Monday evening after they walked across the Capitol and delivered to the Senate the charge against Trump, the first president in history to be impeached twice.\n Wearing black masks and walking two-by-two through the very halls where rioters had overtaken the Capitol earlier this month in a deadly siege, the impeachment managers were led into the Senate chamber by the lead impeachment manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who read the article of impeachment.\n The contours of Trump's Senate trial are starting to take shape as the ceremonial elements got underway, with the Senate's longest-serving Democrat expected to preside over the trial and Democrats still weighing whether to pursue witnesses during proceedings that could take up a chunk of February.\n Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding like he did for Trump's first impeachment trial, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, is expected to preside, the sources said. The Constitution says the chief justice presides when the person facing trial is the current president of the United States, but senators preside in other cases, one source said.\n As the fourth Senate impeachment trial of a president in US history gets underway, there are still two big questions looming over the Democrats' impeachment case: Whether they will seek witnesses and how long the trial will take. The answers to both are still not known yet, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n But if the House impeachment managers seek witnesses, they want them to be cooperative, rather than threaten to fight in court over executive privilege, a snag that hampered Democrats' efforts to seek witnesses the first time around.\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did not answer Monday whether he was open to having witnesses appear as part of Trump's impeachment trial, saying that \"hopefully\" Democrats would be able to negotiate with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on the structure of proceedings.\n \"We'll see what happens. We don't know what the requests are on either side yet, of the managers or the defense,\" the New York Democrat said.\n Trump is still working on filling out his legal team, and one lawyer who had been approached declined to join on Monday. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he spoke to Trump on Sunday while the former President was golfing in Florida.\n Asked about Trump's mindset and preparations ahead of his second impeachment trial, Graham said, \"Well, I think he'd like to get it over with.\" Graham said he \"wouldn't think\" Trump would come back from Florida for the proceedings, again emphasizing the desire for a quick trial.\n The exact time frame of the trial itself, which will begin the week of February 8, is also unknown, but multiple impeachment managers have said they don't think it will go as long as the 21 days of Trump's trial in 2020. The expectation is still, however, that it will take up much of February and wrap up by month's end, if not sooner.\n While the delivery of the impeachment article kicked off the trial Monday evening, though the substance of the arguments are still two weeks away, while the Senate turns back to confirming President Joe Biden's Cabinet and potentially taking up the President's Covid-19 relief package.\n As the managers lined up to walk to the Senate, Raskin turned around to face the other impeachment managers, patted his chest and said, \"Proud of you guys.\"\n The likelihood that Leahy will oversee the trial has raised questions about whether he will also be eligible to vote, but constitutional experts say that nothing would stop him from doing so.\n \"He's a sitting senator, he still gets to vote. Nothing in the Constitution would preclude him from voting,\" said Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri law professor who has written extensively about impeachment.\n Leahy told reporters Monday that he's \"up to the responsibility\" of presiding, and his role will be to make sure \"the procedures are followed.\"\n \"I'm not presenting the evidence, I'm making sure the procedures are followed,\" Leahy said when asked about being a frequent critic of the former President. \"I don't think there's any senator who over the 40-plus years I've been here would say I'm anything but impartial in ruling on procedure.\"\n The Vermont Democrat declined to say when the decision was made that he would preside over the Senate trial. Asked Monday if Roberts had turned down an invitation to preside, Leahy said: \"You can ask the chief justice that.\"\n Roberts, however, declined to comment. \"The chief justice has no comment,\" Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.\n The scheduling leading up to the trial's arguments was resolved Friday after a week's worth of uncertainty over when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would send the article to the Senate, thanks to a deal reached between Senate leaders.\n Under the agreement, Trump's legal team and the House managers will have two weeks to exchange pre-trial briefs before arguments begin. Senators will be sworn in as jurors on Tuesday.\n The deal gives something to both Schumer and McConnell, who are still at odds over a power-sharing agreement in the 50-50 Senate.\n The schedule gives Trump's legal team time to prepare for the trial. Trump is still working to assemble a full legal team, people familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday, even as he has begun to craft a defense strategy with Butch Bowers, the South Carolina lawyer who has agreed to represent him in the historic proceedings.\n Bowers, a respected lawyer from Columbia, South Carolina, who once worked in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, has been in conversation with Trump in recent days, according to two people familiar with the matter. Bowers was connected to Trump by Graham, who is also helping to add new lawyers to the team.\n Charlie Condon, a former South Carolina attorney general, has been approached about joining the legal team, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. In a brief statement to CNN on Monday evening, Condon wrote: \"I am not representing former President Trump. Thanks.\"\n For Schumer and the Biden administration, the two-week break allows for more of Biden's Cabinet to be confirmed, as all other Senate business will stop once the trial gets underway, after Republicans rejected agreeing to split the Senate's days.\n Biden told CNN on Monday that the impeachment trial \"has to happen,\" in his most extensive remarks on the matter since Trump was impeached earlier this month.\n Republicans increasingly believe there's virtually no path to Trump's conviction in the Senate, which would require 17 GOP members to join with Democrats for a two-thirds vote. They've argued both that the trial itself is unconstitutional because Trump is no longer President -- legal scholars disagree, though there's no precedent -- and that pushing forward with impeachment now is divisive.\n \"I think it's time to move on from this impeachment trial,\" said Sen. Roger Marshall, the newly elected Republican from Kansas. \"The impeachment trial is unconstitutional.\"\n But Democrats argue there has to be accountability for the former President after he incited the rioters who ransacked the Capitol on January 6 in an effort to stop Congress from enacting a peaceful transfer of power.\n \"It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or any official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then defeat Congress' impeachment powers by simply resigning, so as to avoid accountability and a vote to disqualify them from future office,\" Schumer said Monday.\n Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Trump when the House voted earlier this month to charge him with a single article, incitement of insurrection. A handful of Senate Republicans are likely to vote to convict him, too, even if it's short of the number required to convict him and bar him from running for office again.\n Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican who voted to convict Trump in the first impeachment trial, said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday that it was \"pretty clear\" that holding the trial was constitutional, pushing back on the argument coming from some of his Senate GOP colleagues that would give them a reason to acquit Trump.\n \"I believe that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense. If not, what is?\" Romney said of Trump's actions inciting the pro-Trump mob that attacked the Capitol.\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Monday.\n CNN's Joan Biskupic, Jeff Zeleny, Ali Zaslav, Annie Grayer, Kristin Wilson, Ryan Nobles, Jessica Dean and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

        "title": "How one city missed warning after warning until its health system collapsed",
        "body_text": "It's waiting hours in line to buy an oxygen tank -- only to find there's none left. For some, it's rushing from hospital to hospital with a sick spouse or parent -- only to find there are no beds available. For others, it's waiting outside of hospitals for news of a loved one -- only to hear they could not be saved.\n For the medical workers, it's frantic 36-hour shifts. For the gravediggers, it's moving the tons of dirt required to create 20,000 more graves.\n For the dead, it's the \"vertical\" burial, with bodies stacked atop each other in the increasingly crowded cemeteries of Manaus, Brazil.\n This is the heartbreak of a city whose health care system has collapsed. And it isn't the first time \u2014 in less than a year, this isolated city at the core of the Brazilian rainforest is witnessing its second coronavirus wave, a shock to the many who thought its first wave was so widespread that herd immunity must be the result.\n Manaus is the capital and largest city in the state of Amazonas. It has over 30 public and private hospitals, catering to numerous remote indigenous and small communities around the area. But the logistics of getting there -- and supplying those hospitals -- can be complicated. With road connections limited, most approaches to the city are by air or river.\n The coronavirus first tore through Manaus like wildfire in April 2020, creating such a vast surge of cases that scientists speculated it might result in herd immunity. Politicians seized on the idea, hopeful they would be able to avoid economically damaging lockdowns in the future.\n But in September 2020, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a highly regarded Brazilian research institute for public health, recommended that the city impose movement and business restrictions. Manaus was beginning to experience a second wave of the disease, it said. But the city did not impose one.\n \"We gave 13 alerts, and a very alarming one in mid-December, saying that the situation was getting very serious. Everyone was making fun of the studies and warnings, especially the President Jair Bolsonaro,\" says Jesem Orellana, researcher at Fiocruz.\n Orellana adds that both the state and federal government used the theory of herd immunity to back up their relaxed measures. \"They all talked about herd immunity, and an environment was created for this discourse to crystallize, and the measures to relax. That feeling may have been responsible for this relaxation of people's behavior.\"\n A few months later, by late December, the surging number of recorded Covid-19 deaths and cases in Manaus was undeniable. Amazonas state governor Wilson Lima acquiesced to expert advice, announcing new lockdown measures. But these were fiercely denounced by protesters who echoed Brazilian Bolsonaro's urging to keep the country's economy running. Lima quickly backed down and celebrations rang.\n In an exclusive interview with CNN, Manaus mayor David Almeida now blames those protest gatherings and unfettered year-end celebrations for the current spike in cases, which has brought the city to a total of over 248,000 cases and more than 7,050 deaths.\n \"We are paying the price for this disobedience, these protests from the end of last year. A lot of people need to be held accountable for this,\" said Almeida, who took office earlier this month. \"During the New Year celebrations, it was precisely the party promoters who were the vectors for this transmission, this propagation and this rise in cases.\"\n Starting Monday, the state of Amazonas will now go into a seven-day lockdown.\n By early January, it became clear that the city was on the verge of running out of oxygen -- critical for patients with severe cases of Covid-19.\n A company named White Martins, which supplied hospitals in Manaus with oxygen, emailed officials from both Amazonas state and the federal Health Ministry by January 8, warning that shortages loomed, according to a report by Brazil's Solicitor General.\n Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello visited Manaus January 11, and the federal government sent supplemental oxygen on January 12 -- but it was not enough.\n According to the attorney general's report, Pazuello also encouraged medical professionals to adopt a supposed \"early treatment\" kit against Covid-19 that combines drugs including hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin -- neither of which have been proven as effective treatments for Covid-19. He has since denied doing this.\n The day after his departure, a crisis exploded. Just as predicted, oxygen shortages pushed the city's healthcare system into collapse last week, forcing authorities to airlift patients to other states. Local media described patients dying of asphyxiation. Preliminary numbers released by the Federal Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating the crisis, attribute 29 deaths so far due to the oxygen shortages. That number is expected to increase as the investigation continues.\n \"The reality is that there's a lower supply of oxygen,\" Pazuello acknowledged later. \"Not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen.\"\n The shortages persist today. Last week, CNN counted around 40 people in line to buy or replace oxygen cylinders from one private supplier, some frustrated, others anxious.\n \"There was no preparation from the state for this new surge,\" Joseney Costa Vicente, 49, told CNN as he tried to buy oxygen for his mother, who is 69 and has tested positive for Covid-19. He spent 16 hours in a hospital with no oxygen or medical attention, he says, before the family decided to care for her at home.\n \"It makes me angry. We feel really upset and outraged with this whole situation.\"\n Eliane Rodrigues, 49, says at times she's had to wait more than 12 hours to buy oxygen. Everyone in her house has tested positive for Covid-19, and her mother, 71, is in the worst shape.\n Fatigued and stressed as they are, many believe it's better to care for the sick at home than send them to a hospital.\n \"We don't trust the government,\" Rodrigues says, fearing having to take her mother to a hospital. \"We're afraid there will be more death than life there.\"\n Hospitals remain stretched to the limit. Over 530 people are still waiting for a hospital bed, according to the Amazonas State Health Secretary.\n CNN visited three hospitals that said they could accept no more patients. People waited outside frantically hoping to find space to hospitalize their loved ones, some screaming and crying.\n At one hospital's doors, staff and a security guard worked to ensure that no one entered without authorization, but were unable to provide even basic information to panicked relatives waiting for updates on patients.\n Waiting outside, Amanda da Silva Monteiro told CNN that no one had been able to locate her father, 71, for two days since his hospitalization with Covid-19.\n \"My dad is a working man. I have the right to know if he's alive or dead,\" da Silva Monteiro told CNN. \"Every day we're here but they don't give us any information.\"\n Who is responsible for letting this lethal crisis boil over? Unpreparedness and political upheaval have been blamed for the current situation in Manaus. A clear disconnect between the local and federal governments has also created turmoil since the pandemic began last year.\n The office of General Prosecutor Augusto Aras has called for an investigation into the Health Ministry's response to warnings about Manaus' oxygen shortages, as well as investigations into Amazonas state governor Lima, former Manaus mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto and current mayor Almeida.\n But the federal government rejects responsibility for allowing oxygen shortages to reach such critical lows -- and blames the government of Amazonas state instead. Brazil's vice president Hamilton Mour\u00e3o said earlier this month that -- despite multiple warnings from scientists -- there was no way to predict the collapse of Manaus' health system. Pazuello himself denies that his ministry failed to act effectively, and Bolsonaro has accused the state government of mismanaging federal funds.\n The Amazonas state government, in turn, has blamed the logistical challenges of rapidly resupplying this isolated city. On Sunday, the State Health Department told CNN that it was making \"every effort, with the assistance of the Federal Government, to address the difficulties encountered in the oxygen supply logistics,\" including deploying planes, helicopters and speedboats loaded with more oxygen cylinders.\n For his part, Almeida says the city government is not responsible for the current crisis. Though all hospitals have been overrun with Covid-19 cases, he notes that city-run hospitals did not suffer as extreme oxygen shortages as state hospitals.\n His month in office \"feels more like a year,\" he adds.\n Amazonas state authorities say they will soon open two more hospitals, one with federal support, to increase the city's available bedcount. Pazuello, the Health Minister, has returned to Manaus and this time, he will stay \"as long as necessary\" to get the city's health system back on track, he says.\n But many Manaus residents have little confidence left in authorities to respond to the coronavirus -- and emerging variants of the virus pose additional levels of complication and potential threat.\n Luan Matos de Menezes, a 26-year-old ICU doctor, describes what he sees today as an even worse version of what the city suffered last year.\n \"What's happening is really serious. You can tell that patients' conditions are much more critical than in the first wave. It's much more grave than in other parts of the country. The deaths are much quicker. The number of serious infections is much higher than in the first wave, and the patients are younger.\" says Menezes.\n \"Yesterday I had a 24-year-old guy die in my ICU. I've got patients who are 32 and 29. Young patients who are in very critical condition.\"\n Tired and frustrated, Matos de Menezes says he blames both authorities and the Manaus community for failing to learn last year's lessons, and for clinging to unproven theories instead of following scientific recommendation.\n \"So you have a community that thinks it's safe based on a false (theory of) herd immunity and based on ineffective medicines for Covid-19, in addition to a new variant that is more transmissible and more serious that is circulating in the community... You had the recipe to make this catastrophe happen.\"\n And at every level, Brazilian officials failed to take preventative action in time, he concludes, attributing the slow response to a reluctance to damage the economy.\n \"A vaccine that starts off late, a lockdown that started late. Done in the name of a God that is called money, in the name of shop owners' greed, in the name of businessmen's greed. Until they realize that they are going to get sick and there won't be a place to get treatment here and money won't buy life.\"\n Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that Amazonas state will lock down for seven days on Monday, instead of ten.\n Marcia Reverdosa reported from Manaus, Brazil.

        "title": "Sarah Sanders' run for Arkansas governor to test value of ties to Trump ",
        "body_text": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday became the first of what could be a wave of Republicans from former President Donald Trump's inner circle to chart a political future, launching her bid for Arkansas governor.\n The move positions Arkansas as a test of how engaged Trump, who publicly encouraged Sanders to run for governor, will be in his post-presidency in clashes over the direction of the Republican Party, as aides, allies and family members seek to carry on his legacy.\n Through his Save America PAC, Trump announced his endorsement of his former press secretary Monday night.\n \"Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct. Sarah is strong on Borders, tough on Crime, and fully supports the Second Amendment and our great law enforcement officers,\" Trump said in the statement.\n \"She loves our Military and Veterans -- and her home state of Arkansas. Sarah will be a GREAT Governor, and she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\"\n Her entrance into the race comes amid buzz about potential Senate runs by Trump family members, including daughter Ivanka Trump against incumbent Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida and daughter-in-law Lara Trump for the seat of retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr.\n The Arkansas race for governor will also gauge how appealing Republican primary voters find personal connections to Trump and his presidency -- especially in a field with other well-known conservative contenders who have also aligned themselves with the former president.\n The contest already features two statewide officials who have strongly backed Trump in Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a former congressman who at one point was considered but passed over for the secretary of the Army post in Trump's administration, and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a conservative who sided with Trump in court battles, including a lawsuit challenging the 2020 election results.\n Sanders, too, has deep personal ties in Arkansas: Her father Mike Huckabee spent more than a decade as governor before launching his failed 2008 and 2016 presidential bids.\n Griffin welcomed Sanders to the race by finding room to her right, pointing out that her announcement video called for something Arkansas had already done in defunding sanctuary cities, and noting that her proposal to lower the state's income tax stops short of his call to eliminate it altogether.\n \"I think there's a lot to talk about other than personalities, and I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk a whole lot about ideas and substance. And at the end of the day, that's what makes the difference in Arkansans' lives,\" Griffin said in an interview Monday.\n Sanders, 38, is a long-time Republican operative who became Trump's White House press secretary, a role in which she made a number of misleading and false statements from the briefing room podium. She left the White House in 2019, with Trump publicly urging her to run for governor of Arkansas.\n She announced her candidacy in a video posted on Twitter Monday morning. \"With the radical left now in charge of Washington, your governor is your last line of defense. In fact, your governor must be on the front line,\" she said.\n Trump's orbit welcomed Sanders to the race Monday. \"You're going to win and you will be great,\" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted.\n \"I'm all in to support her campaign to become next governor of Arkansas,\" former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. \"Integrity and hard work. Take it from a Kansan -- she will do Arkansans a good turn!\"\n Griffin, a former George W. Bush White House staffer, said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if Trump campaigns for Sanders. But he downplayed the importance of their personal connection, saying his own record -- including time opposing former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Joe Biden's policies while in Congress, as well as implementing Trump-backed policies in Arkansas -- could better meet the current political moment.\n \"I supported Trump and Trump's policies; she did too. Great. She worked for him -- that's great. I worked for President Bush at the White House. I have a history of fighting the Obama-Biden agenda when I was in Congress, so that will be particularly relevant now,\" Griffin said.\n \"For me, this is just about a clear choice of who's ready on day one to lead Arkansas,\" he said. \"And I think you can look at it 100 different ways. In every instance, I'm ready on day one. And no one else is.\"\n Neither Griffin nor Rutledge has criticized Trump, or Sanders' association with the former president. In a statement, Rutledge touted her support for Trump's \"de-regulatory agenda at every level\" and said Sanders and her family are long-time friends. She said Arkansas needs \"a leader with a proven record of accomplishments against the liberal left.\" Sanders' campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n That the Arkansas Republican gubernatorial primary features three high-profile candidates sprinting to the right underscores how much the state has shifted since Bill Clinton was governor; until a decade ago, the state featured two Democratic senators.\n Skip Rutherford, a longtime Clinton aide and the dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service, said it'll lead to a \"bloody\" primary pitting longtime veterans of Arkansas GOP politics against each other.\n \"This one is going to be stand-up-and-take-names primary,\" he said. \"In the past, my friends on the Republican side have had the luxury of having one candidate to support. As I told someone the other day, welcome to growth, welcome to having to pick sides.\"\n CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden raises the bar on vaccines and suggests US will get to 1.5 million a day",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden said Monday that he expects that the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more vaccinations than its target of 1 million per day in his first 100 days in office. He said that the US could surpass that initial target in about three weeks.\n \"I'm quite confident that we will be in a position within the next three weeks or so to be vaccinating people at the range of 1 million a day or in excess of that,\" he told reporters, clarifying that he was referring to 100 million shots, not necessarily 100 million people, since some of the vaccines require more than one shot.\n Biden said the key factors in ramping up vaccinations are having enough vaccine, having enough syringes and other necessary equipment and having enough people administering them. He said his administration is working to produce additional vaccinators -- people who can administer the vaccine.\n \"I think with the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbor and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,\" he said.\n Soon after Biden's briefing, a White House official told CNN that the administration's official goal still remains 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office.\n It's a goal that the White House still views as \"ambitious but achievable,\" the official said, but they also anticipate that plenty of things could go wrong given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. However, the official stressed that the hope now was to surpass that original goal of 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days.\n Describing Biden as an \"optimist,\" the official also said the President has been pushing his Covid team to aim for progress beyond their initial goal of 100 million vaccines doses in 100 days.\n Biden's announcement came the same day that officials for Pfizer and Moderna said it will take time to scale up manufacturing for their vaccines.\n Moderna President Dr. Stephen Hoge relayed that vaccine makers have an obligation to maintain quality and consistency as they scale up capacity.\n \"That's the frustrating thing about scaling up,\" Hoge said.\n The increase in vaccinations will not necessarily move the target timeline for getting vaccines to anyone in the US who wants one.\n The President said that he thinks anyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get it by this spring, a target date similar to one set under the Trump administration.\n Biden's commitment to ramp up coronavirus vaccinations comes among a larger list of efforts discussed the White House on Monday to address the coronavirus pandemic.\n Biden signed a presidential proclamation on Monday reinstating the travel restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic for individuals traveling to the United States from the Schengen Area in Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil and South Africa.\n And speaking to reporters, Biden also referenced the importance of creating a forum where Americans \"can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for eight hours -- being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy and get your name on the list(.)\"\n But the new efforts come amid ongoing confusion and urgent concerns across different states over the country's coronavirus vaccine supply and distribution.\n Earlier Monday, New York City Health Commissioner David Chokshi told CNN that the city \"does not have enough doses\" of Covid-19 vaccine to \"be able to meet the demand we know exists among New Yorkers.\"\n Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said Florida's capacity far outweighs the amount of vaccine they have been given by the federal government. And Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker similarly said that the state is \"setting up the capacity to administer far more doses, then we are currently receiving or projecting to receive from the (federal government).\"\n Over the last two days, both Biden's top spokeswoman, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said they did not know the what the current coronavirus vaccine supply levels are. Both blamed the Trump administration for the problem.\n But speaking to press on Monday, Biden claimed that his administration does know how many coronavirus vaccines are available in the US. However, he did not disclose any concrete numbers.\n \"(W)e are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine. And in very short order. As you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was out being held in abeyance are available. Now that we're here, we've been around a week or so, we now have that,\" Biden said. \"And we've gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will in fact produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road.\"\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's MJ Lee contributed to this report.",

        "title": "John Roberts ducks the spotlight by skipping the second Trump impeachment trial",
        "body_text": "Chief Justice John Roberts has long been a student of history, but this is one part of history -- presiding at the second trial of Donald Trump -- he can do without.\n Roberts apparently believes the Constitution offers him a reprieve from another ordeal with Trump, a man who challenged judicial integrity, declared he could get his way at the Supreme Court and then called the justices \"totally incompetent and weak\" when he failed to prevail.\n Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and the president pro tempore of the chamber, will preside for Trump's second impeachment trial.\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview on MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" on Monday that \"it was up to John Roberts whether he wanted to preside with a president who's no longer sitting. ... And he doesn't want to do it.\" The New York Democrat noted that the Constitution appears to suggest \"the chief justice presides for a sitting president.\"\n The terms of the Constitution dictate that \"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\" And last year at this time, the robed Roberts sat high on the Senate dais for the trial of then-President Trump.\n It was clearly his constitutional duty, although at some turns Roberts made plain that he did not find it a pleasant one. This time, the jurist who oversees a court that forbids cameras, who bristles at breaches of decorum and who strives to project a neutral image, will avoid the public scrutiny and role of referee at what is an inherently political affair.\n Since the US House of Representatives impeached Trump on January 13, Roberts has declined multiple requests for comment on his responsibility, if any, for a trial after Trump left office on January 20.\n Leahy had earlier said that \"the first choice\" for presiding officer would be the chief justice, and he would not reveal on Monday when it became clear that the duty would fall to him, telling reporters only that he was \"up to the responsibility.\"\n Roberts had no comment on Monday on Leahy's announcement of his role or dealings with senators.\n Roberts' task last year was largely ministerial, but it had its dramatic moments. In one after-midnight episode, the chief justice warned dueling lawyers for the President and US House to stop attacking each other and respect Senate decorum.\n He cited a 1905 Senate impeachment trial in which \"one of the managers used the word 'pettifogging,' and the presiding officer said the word ought not have been used.\" Roberts wearily added, \"I don't think we need to aspire of that high a standard, but I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are.\"\n Roberts then had to read, verbatim as per custom, loaded questions related to the Trump charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The chief justice refused Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul's attempt to force him to reveal the name of the whistleblower who had alerted congressional investigators to Trump's Ukrainian telephone call attaching political strings to US security aid.\n Then there was the question Roberts read aloud from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren that began: \"At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding [and] Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence, contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court ... ?\"\n Such assertions aside, Roberts, a 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush, has tried to maintain public confidence in the high court and his leadership. He wants the nine justices to be seen as neutral, even as the six Republican appointees generally vote conservative and the three Democratic appointees generally vote liberal.\n \"We should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability. But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable,\" Roberts wrote in his annual year-end report at the close of 2019, as he was headed for the first Senate trial of Trump.\n Only three presidents in American history have been impeached and subject to Senate trial. In addition to Trump in 2020, President Bill Clinton was tried in 1999 and President Andrew Johnson in 1868. All three were acquitted by the Senate; it takes a two-thirds vote to convict.\n Never has a former president been impeached, although other former officials have been impeached and subject to Senate proceedings. The US House impeached Trump for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\n Although the relevant provision has never been tested, many scholars read the Constitution to require a presiding chief justice only for \"the President,\" that is, the sitting president.\n They note that the framers designated the chief justice, rather than any senator or the vice president, who under the Constitution serves as the Senate president, to avoid a natural conflict of interest. If a sitting president were convicted and removed, the vice president would succeed him. No such situation would exist for a former president out of office.\n Leahy, who has served in the Senate since 1975, vowed to ensure proper procedures were followed and reminded reporters that he has \"presided over hundreds of hours\" during his Senate tenure.\n When Roberts ended the trial last year, on February 5, he said he had \"attempted to carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting,\" and he told senators he hoped that the next time he saw them would be \"under happier circumstances.\"\n For now, it will not involve Donald Trump.\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referenced the Constitution's terms about the Senate trial. The passage reads, \"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\"",

        "body_text": "Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\nHow does a country recover from four years of virulent acrimony? The urgent need to heal America's divisions, to \"end this uncivil war,\" stood at the center of President Joe Biden's stirring inaugural speech. He implored Americans to \"open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.\"\n The sentiment is not just lofty and moving, it is pragmatic and necessary. A country that cannot resolve its disagreements peacefully cannot succeed. A nation that cannot come together to tackle grave crises is inevitably destined to grow weaker.\n But winged words, appeals to national unity and national greatness, however inspiring, do not erase the reality of a country so divided that not only have political leaders in Washington found it increasingly difficult to work together in a time of crisis, but across the land, family members and former friends have grown apart over political differences.\n And now, a country with more urgent problems than it has front burners, is about to live through yet another jaw-clenching experience. With the House of Representatives formally delivering to the Senate the article of impeachment against former president Donald Trump on Monday evening, the clock starts ticking toward a February 9 trial sure to raise the temperature that only just started coming down after Trump, the chief stoker of flames, at last exited the stage.\n All the while, new information about Trump's efforts to overturn the election continue to emerge. According to The New York Times, he considered replacing the acting attorney general with a Trump loyalist and using the Department of Justice to flip the election outcome in Georgia. He also, according to the Wall Street Journal, pressured the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Biden's win.\n Evidence of his unprecedented transgressions keeps mounting, and with this new information comes new questions: Are national reconciliation and a presidential impeachment trial mutually exclusive? Is the second Trump impeachment compatible with Biden's exhortation to healing?\n In the short run, the impeachment trial is likely to intensify the very emotions Biden seeks to calm. But genuine reconciliation requires arriving at a common truth, a common reality. We cannot sing \"Kumbaya,\" or \"Amazing Grace,\"and hope that our teary eyes are lastingly followed by soothed souls.\n What America needs is a truth and reconciliation process, the method countries that went to war against themselves have used. But there's a reason truth comes before reconciliation.\n Eventually, when Trump's hold on the Republican Party eases -- when all those who insist on perpetuating the big lie and defending a man who brought so many once-unthinkable calamities upon the nation either become weaker or tire of promoting lies -- the United States should set up a nonpartisan panel to preside over a national reckoning of what transpired over the past four years.\n But we're not there yet. And the impeachment trial, which offers the possibility of beginning the process, is unlikely to offer that much needed national journey to a shared fact-based reality.\n For now, too many in the Congress still defend the former president despite having witnessed firsthand far more than just the January 6 assault on the Capitol that was at least instigated by the president, or his monthslong effort to overturn an election that he reportedly acknowledged he lost within the privacy of the Oval Office.\n Over the course of four years, the members of Congress and the American people watched a president drive a bulldozer through the fraying bonds that held the nation together. Remember his former defense secretary, James Mattis, denouncing Trump as a threat to the Constitution months before the election?\n \"Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people,\" he lamented. \"He tries to divide us.\" Trump had just used the military to crush a peaceful protest in order to stage a grotesque photo op.\n During his presidency, Trump didn't just try to divide America, he attacked the foundations of the country, stoked extremism and cuddled neo-Nazis and racists. \"Very fine people,\" he called people on both sides after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville during the first year of his presidency. And in his final weeks in office, he told his insurrectionist mob of supporters at the Capitol, \"We love you.\"\n Trump didn't just rend the nation asunder and he didn't just show his disdain for the Constitution and free press even before taking office with his verbal battering of the media, \"the enemy of the people.\" He did much more damage.\n During his self-dealing administration, possibly the most corrupt in US history, based on his over 3,700 conflicts of interest reported by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, he personally interfered not only with the independence of the judiciary, but with efforts to save lives during a global pandemic.\n Trump's bizarre combination of interference and negligence prevented the country from mounting an effective defense against the pandemic, resulting in a death toll that will likely soon top half a million Americans, far more than died during World War II. We don't know how many of them would be alive if Trump had behaved differently, or if anyone else had been president. But some, probably many, of the deaths would not have occurred without Trump's negligence.\n It is also likely that the five people who died at the Capitol on January 6 would be alive today if Trump had acted differently.\n These are only some of the facts that Americans will eventually come to accept about his deadly, poisonous presidency. When that happens, when there's truth, there can be genuine reconciliation.\n If there's an uncharacteristic upsurge of courage among Republicans, the Senate trial might surprise us and make progress toward that moment. But for now, some Republican leaders who briefly acknowledged reality about Trump's culpability in the Capitol riot are already backtracking. But the trial proceedings should illuminate the undeniable truth and eventually it will help us heal.\n Impeachment managers should call witnesses, including fellow members of Congress who felt the threat of Trump's rampaging goons. It will also be important to hear from officials like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who can describe the pressure he felt from Trump's insistence that he \"find\" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in his state, and others who were pressured or lost their jobs because of Trump's machinations. Above all, Americans should hear from those with direct knowledge of Trump's involvement in the coup attempt of January 6.\n The trial will help establish the record for when willingness to face the truth arrives.\n Until then, Biden will have to plant seeds of unity one by one, program by program, hoping that as he works to repair the devastation caused by Trump's destructive rule, he can strengthen American democracy enough to withstand the next assault, whether from Trump or from one of his acolytes.\n Soaring speeches may soften some hardened hearts, but they're not enough to open everyone's eyes to unpleasant truths, or to stiffen the spines of politicians calculating what's best for them rather than for the country.",

        "title": "Proximity to power: What the West Wing office layout says about the Biden administration",
        "body_text": "It's an adage in any high-pressure office: proximity is power. Nowhere is that more true than the West Wing.\n President Joe Biden begins his term with a team of seasoned Washington operators whose placement inside the building provides clues to who will be close at hand in moments of crisis and who is most likely to encounter the President when he's working from his office.\n Unlike his predecessor, who professed a love for governing by chaos and whose aides were constantly jockeying for face-time, Biden appears more likely to go by-the-book. Officials say his meetings are run more traditionally, with a set list of attendees and usually an agenda.\n And the door to the Oval Office won't be kept open for aides to drop in, as in the Trump-era. Traditional gatekeepers such as the chief of staff and an executive assistant will have the kind of control over Biden's schedule that didn't exist during periods of President Donald Trump's tenure.\n But the opportunity that comes with a choice workspace remains. And the value of prime White House real estate is even higher, considering how many aides are working remotely during the pandemic.\n It's not about whether the offices afford a majestic view of Washington, considering many of the work spaces have little to no external views at all. Instead, the proximity to the Oval Office offers an unspoken nod to the hierarchy surrounding the President.\n Office space can also be used to elevate a particular official or issue critical to the President's agenda. Biden has placed Jeff Zients, his Covid response coordinator, in an office on the second floor, lending stature to his role in combating the pandemic.\n Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, senior advisers to Biden who are longtime members of his inner circle, are setting up shop in small offices just steps from the Oval Office and the President's private dining room. They take over rooms once occupied by advisers such as Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon during the Trump administration, David Axelrod during President Barack Obama's and George Stephanopoulos when Bill Clinton was president.\n At the end of the hall, Ron Klain, the chief of staff, has a corner office with a fireplace and an outdoor terrace. Aside from the Oval Office, it's the most spacious office in the West Wing. Vice President Kamala Harris also has a large office just next door, along with far more spacious quarters in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which sits next to the White House.\n Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and Bruce Reed, who serve as deputy chiefs of staff, also sit in the narrow alcoves with close access to the Oval Office.\n Situated right outside the Oval Office are staff who act as Biden's personal aides and manage the room's operation, including the \"director of Oval Office operations\" -- a position once held by Trump's former bodyguard.\n In the other \"corner offices\" on the first floor of the West Wing are the national security adviser and the press secretary. Both frequently attend meetings with the President.\n Ordinarily, their deputies and assistants would crowd the desks outside their offices. Yet the coronavirus pandemic has altered how the building is filled.\n Gone are the days of aides stuffing into offices for brain-storming sessions or meetings. The Biden administration is taking the pandemic remarkably seriously -- far more so than the last occupants of these offices -- and many advisers are not allowed in the West Wing.\n The pandemic has scattered some key aides who would ordinarily work from the West Wing to other parts of the White House campus, officials said, with myriad Covid-19 precautions in place, including regular testing, universal masking and other safety measures.\n \"Additional aides are working from home and using a variety of tools to stay in touch and carry out their work,\" a White House official told CNN.\n The White House counsel, the directors of the National Economic Council, office of legislative affairs and domestic policy are all expected to be on the second floor of the West Wing, along with those heading up the fight against coronavirus.\n Unlike in the Trump administration, no family members will occupy formal roles or offices in the West Wing. And unlike in the Clinton administration, the first lady will not have a West Wing office. Jill Biden will work from the traditional first lady's quarters in the East Wing of the White House.\n Some alumni from the Obama administration may find the West Wing looks slightly different from when they left four years ago. Under Trump, the carpets were changed out, walls were painted and some of the hardware was refreshed during a renovation early in his term. Air conditioning and heating systems were also replaced.\n But the scale of the space has remained the same. Aside from the offices in the corners of the building, the working spaces are minuscule -- particularly for officials accustomed to more spacious conditions.",

He acknowledged the effect it could have on his legislative agenda and Cabinet nominees but said there would be \"a worse effect if it didn't happen.\"\n Biden told CNN he believed the outcome would be different if Trump had six months left in his term, but said he doesn't think 17 Republican senators will vote to convict Trump.\n \"The Senate has changed since I was there, but it hasn't changed that much,\" Biden said.\n His comments came the same night the House impeachment managers formally triggered the start of Trump's second impeachment trial after they walked across the Capitol and began reading on the Senate floor the charge against Trump, the first president in history to be impeached twice.\n The trial has loomed large over Biden's early days in office as he's sought to strike an uneasy balance between supporting it trial and pushing a message of unity. CNN previously reported that Biden and his team were initially cold on starting his administration -- which Biden pledged would \"turn the page\" on Trump -- with a focus on the former President.\n But as more alarming details came into focus about the Capitol attack, early discussions among Biden advisers of taking an active role in slowing or trying to somehow manage impeachment were abandoned, aides said, as they've become well aware that trying to do so could divide Democrats.\n Biden's comments to CNN Monday evening build on a statement he released earlier this month that called the House impeachment vote \"a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience.\"\n \"This nation also remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\" Biden said at the time. \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\"\n The contours of Trump's Senate trial are starting to take shape as the ceremonial elements get underway, with the Senate's longest-serving Democrat expected to preside over the trial and Democrats still weighing whether to pursue witnesses during proceedings that could take up a chunk of February.\n Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding like he did for Trump's first impeachment trial, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, is expected to preside, the sources said. The Constitution says the chief justice presides when the person facing trial is the current president of the United States, but senators preside in other cases, one source said.\n As the fourth Senate impeachment trial of a president in US history gets underway, there are still two big looming questions over the Democrats' impeachment case: Whether they will seek witnesses and how long the trial will take. The answers to both are still not known yet, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n Meanwhile, the Biden administration still has a long list of nominations to be confirmed in the US Senate and Republicans already casting doubt on the need for another massive Covid-19 relief package.\n This story has been updated with additional information.\n CNN's Paul LeBlanc, Jeremy Herb and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "title": "In the nearly 232-year history of the US Senate there have only been 11 Black senators ",
        "body_text": "Congress set a new diversity record this year with its highest-ever number of women and racial minorities, including 60 Black lawmakers.\n But that's mostly in the House.\n People of color have historically had a tougher time getting elected to the Senate. Newly elected Raphael Warnock is only the 11th Black US senator since the Senate convened for the first time in 1789. Only two of those have been women. And with the departure of Kamala Harris, the number of Black female US senators is now at zero.\n Voters in urban congressional districts tend to be more diverse and politically progressive, driving the higher number of minorities in the House. But that has had little effect on the number of Black senators.\n \"Black US Senate candidates, and especially Black politically progressive Democratic candidates, have found it difficult to get traction and win statewide elections due to the default political conservatism in White majority regions of the US,\" says Karlos Hill, chair of African-American studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n From slavery and Jim Crow laws to suppression of minority voters, Black political candidates have long faced stumbling blocks. Hiram Revels, the first Black US senator, took office in the late 1800s as part of a wave of African American  lawmakers during the Reconstruction era, but he was elected by the Mississippi legislature, not the state's voters.\n Decades of voter suppression has limited Black voting power in the South, says Tobin Miller Shearer, director of African-American studies at the university of Montana.\n Shearer also cites the \"incomplete legacy of the 15th Amendment,\" which granted everyone the right to vote but was undermined by states in the deep South which disfranchised Black voters through literacy tests, property ownership requirements and other racist measures.\n It wasn't until 1965 that these discriminatory voting practices were outlawed by the federal Voting Rights Act.\n Half a century later Black voters in the South are wielding new power, thanks in part to a push by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and other organizers to register new voters and combat voter suppression.\n \"Black candidates can compete and win competitive statewide races if they are able to effectively mobilize the Black electorate,\" Hill says. \"If the momentum created by Abrams and Warnock's recipe for mobilizing the Black electorate can be sustained, we could begin to see more Black representation in the US Senate. Only time will tell.\"\n Here are the 11 Black US senators:\n Hiram Revels was a former barber and minister who served in the US Senate from 1870-1871.\n Mississippi lawmakers chose him to fill a vacant seat, although he faced fierce opposition from his future colleagues who questioned his citizenship. Their argument was based on a 1857 Supreme Court case that ruled African Americans could not become citizens of the United States.\n Born a free man in 1827 -- the slavery era -- he was an army chaplain during the Civil War, working at churches in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana. After the war ended, he settled in Natchez, Mississippi, where he was an elder at the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and built a reputation as a respected community leader.\n Mississippi was seeking readmission to representation in the US Congress and needed to fill two Senate seats that had been unoccupied  since 1861, when it seceded from the Union. Revels was offered the shorter of  two terms -- one set to expire in March 1871.\n Revels took the oath of office 22 days after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, which held that Americans could not be denied the right to vote based on their race. Revels was \"the 15th Amendment in flesh and blood,\" civil rights activist Wendell Phillips said.\n Sen. Blanche K. Bruce of Mississippi was the first African American to serve a full term in the US Senate.\n Born into slavery, he could not attend school, so he sneaked in some lessons from a tutor hired for his master's son. He escaped at the beginning of the Civil War and taught Black students in Missouri before moving to Mississippi, where he held several jobs, including a county sheriff and tax collector.\n Like Revels, he was elected to the US senate by the Mississippi state legislature, not voters. Bruce served from 1875 to 1881.\n The former slave later became a plantation owner, and lived a privileged life that was a far cry from that of his Black constituents. Despite moving in elite circles, he fought for the rights of freed slaves and was a strong advocate for Black war veterans.  But Black people in Mississippi questioned his commitment to their plight.\n Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts was the first African American elected to the US Senate by popular vote. He's also credited with integrating the Senate barbershop with his first haircut on Capitol Hill after his win.\n The former World War II Army veteran graduated from Howard University and then attended law school at Boston University. He served two full terms in the Senate, from 1967 to 1979.\n Brooke did not consider himself a trailblazing politician and maintained that he represented all his constituents.  \"I do not intend to be a national leader of the Negro people. I intend to do my job as a senator from Massachusetts,\" he once declared. He died in 2015 at the age of 95.\n Carol Moseley Braun shattered barriers as the first Black female US senator.\n Moseley Braun was also the first woman to serve on the powerful Finance Committee after Democrat Tom Daschle gave up his seat to create a spot for her.\n The Democrat from Illinois served only one term, from 1993 to 1999. Before joining the Senate, she was a prosecutor in the office of the United States Attorney in Chicago and assistant majority leader in the Illinois House of Representatives.\n She defeated both the Democratic incumbent and the Republican challenger for a seat in the US Senate, becoming the first female senator from Illinois as well. But she lost her bid for reelection to the Senate and unsuccessfully ran for president in 2004.\n \"I cannot escape the fact that I come to the Senate as a symbol of hope and change,\" she said shortly after being sworn in. \"Nor would I want to, because my presence in and of itself will change the US Senate.\"\n In the nearly three decades since, there has only been one other female Black senator: Kamala Harris.\n Barack Obama was the fifth Black US senator and only the third one elected by voters.\n He took the oath of office in January 2005 after serving in the Illinois state senate for almost eight years.  Obama served one term in the Senate before running for President in 2008.\n A former community organizer in Chicago and the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review, Obama made history again as the first Black President of the United States. He became the 44th President and served two terms.\n Roland Burris was appointed in 2008 to fill President Obama's vacated seat in the US Senate.\n Before taking on that role, Burris was the first African American to win a statewide election when he was elected comptroller of Illinois in 1978. After serving as comptroller for over a decade, he became attorney general of Illinois.\n He served in the Senate until November 2010, when voters chose his successor in a special election. Citing fundraising difficulties, Burris chose to retire instead of running for a full term.\n In 2013 Tim Scott of South Carolina became the first African American US senator from the deep South since Reconstruction. The former entrepreneur worked in insurance and real estate, and served in the US House of Representatives before joining the Senate.\n He was appointed US senator in January 2013 after the resignation of his predecessor, then was elected to a full term in 2016.\n The lifelong resident of South Carolina has marveled at his family's remarkable journey, considering his grandfather once dropped out of school to pick cotton.\n \"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" he said last year.\n William Cowan was appointed to fill John Kerry's seat after Kerry resigned in 2013 to become secretary of state.\n Before his appointment, Cowan was a partner in a law firm and served as chief of staff to Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.\n His appointment in February 2013, a month after Scott, marked the first time two African Americans served in the US Senate simultaneously.\n Cowan spent less than six months in the Senate and chose not to run in a special election to decide who would serve the remainder of Kerry's term.\n Democrat Edward J. Markey won that race and has since been re-elected twice.\n Cory Booker was the first African American to represent New Jersey in the US Senate.\n He was the popular mayor of Newark, the state's largest city, before he joined the Senate after a special election in October 2013 following the death of Frank Lautenberg. The next year he was elected to a full term.\n The former Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School graduate unsuccessfully ran for President in 2020 but was later reelected to the Senate.\n Kamala Harris was the first Black woman to represent California in the US senate when she took office in January 2017. But she was making history long before then.\n She was the first Black person and first woman elected district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California, a position she held until 2016.\n And she's still shattering glass ceilings. This month, she was sworn in as Vice President of the United States -- the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American to hold that post.\n Many advocates had called for a Black woman to replace her, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom instead appointed Alex Padilla, California's first Latino senator. While historic, it leaves no Black women in the upper chamber of the US Congress.\n \"When you think about the history of this country, of the challenges that exist for African Americans ... this is a real blow to the African-American community, to African-American women, to women in general,\" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said.\n Rev. Raphael Warnock's win in a Georgia runoff election earlier this month played a big role in highlighting the growing power of Black voters in the South.\n Like Revels, his path to the US Senate followed a key role in a pulpit of the Black church. Warnock is a senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King served as co-pastor. Black voters in Atlanta and its suburbs turned out in big numbers to help him win.\n In his victory speech, Warnock reflected on his mother's teenage days picking cotton to in rural Georgia. He acknowledged how far the nation has come.\n \"Because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\" he said.\n Along with Booker and Scott, he is one of three African Americans in the current Senate.",

        "title": "Supreme Court dismisses emoluments cases against Trump",
        "body_text": "The Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a case concerning whether former President Donald Trump violated provisions of the Constitution that bar a president from profiting from a foreign government.\n The court instructed the lower courts to wipe away previous lower court opinions that went against Trump because he is no longer in office. It leaves unresolved a novel question raised in the case because Trump, unlike other presidents, did not use a blind trust when he assumed the presidency, but instead continued to retain an interest in his businesses and let those businesses take money from foreign and domestic governments.\n RELATED: Why the Supreme Court didn't want to hear the Trump emoluments case\n The order was issued without comment or dissent.\n There were two cases covering the issue before the justices. One was initiated by lawyers for Maryland and Washington, DC, who argued Trump violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign and domestic governments through the Trump International Hotel in DC. They said they were disadvantaged in competing for business from foreign and state officials who may choose to do business with entities in which the President had a financial interest in order to curry favor.\n A second case was brought by various members of the hospitality industry who own or work in hotels or restaurants in New York and Washington, who also argued they were put at a competitive disadvantage.\n Deepak Gupta, one of the attorneys challenging Trump in the disputes, said on Twitter following the court's decision that he wasn't surprised the case was dismissed as moot after Trump left office, adding it's \"disappointing that Trump ran out the clock.\"\n \"I'm proud of the work we did to ensure the Constitution's anti-corruption norms weren't forgotten,\" he wrote.\n The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which had a part in the cases against Trump, said on Monday that the lawsuits \"made the American people aware for four years of the pervasive corruption that came from a president maintaining a global business and taking benefits and payments from foreign and domestic governments.\"\n \"Only Trump losing the presidency and leaving office ended these corrupt constitutional violations stopped these groundbreaking lawsuits,\" Noah Bookbinder, the group's executive director, said in a statement.\n At the center of the case was the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which has faced few judicial interpretations since it was written almost 250 years ago.\n The Emoluments Clause prohibits a president from receiving an \"emolument\" or profit from any \"King, Prince, or foreign state\" unless Congress consents. The so-called domestic emoluments clause entitles a president to receive a salary and benefits fixed in advance by Congress, but prohibits him from receiving \"any other emolument from the United States.\"\n \"The Supreme Court's procedural order not only wipes away two lower court rulings, but it also orders dismissal of the entire dispute -- leaving for some other time resolution of the many questions Trump's conduct raised about the Emoluments Clause,\" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.\n \"Ordinarily, the Court pursues such a step only when the prevailing party moots a case while the appeal is pending -- as opposed to here, where the disputes became moot because Trump's term ended,\" he added. \"Today's orders suggest that the court is increasingly willing to invoke this doctrine to avoid highly charged political disputes, even if the mootness wasn't caused by the parties that won below.\"\n A lower court had allowed 38 subpoenas that were served on five federal agencies that demanded information about money spent by those agencies at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC.\n In court papers, lawyers for Trump's Department of Justice had argued the lower court in the case brought by Maryland and DC \"fundamentally erred in permitting this unprecedented and extraordinary lawsuit to proceed\" and called the alleged injury \"attenuated and speculative.\"\n DC Attorney General Karl Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a joint statement on Monday that their case \"will serve as precedent that will help stop anyone else from using the presidency or other federal office for personal financial gain the way that President Trump has over the past four years.\"\n Former Office of Government Ethics chief Walter Shaub blasted the court's decision as \"insane\" in a tweet, arguing the emolument cases were not moot, as the court said.\n \"(Trump) still has the money. When any other federal employee violates the emoluments clause they have to forfeit the money,\" Shaub wrote.\n This story has been updated with additional detail and reaction.",

        "title": "Budweiser is skipping the Super Bowl for the first time in nearly four decades",
        "body_text": "Budweiser's Clydesdale horses have become synonymous with the Super Bowl. But this year, they're getting a rest: For the first time in 37 years, the beer company isn't advertising during the Super Bowl.\n Instead, Budweiser is shifting the money that would've been spent on the commercial slot \u2014 a reported $5.6 million for the February 7 event \u2014 to support \"critical Covid-19 vaccine awareness\" with donations and future ad campaigns, the company said Monday.\n The pandemic forced Budweiser to rethink its marketing approach, vice president of marketing Monica Rustgi told CNN Business, as the alcohol industry reeled from the sudden shutdown of bars, restaurants and big events. The brand wanted to \"be proactive\" in promoting vaccine awareness since it will eventually lead back to normalcy, she said in an interview.\n Ahead of the game, Budweiser is also rolling out a new online ad this week narrated by \"Parks and Recreation\" actress Rashida Jones, highlighting people coping with the virus and a group of healthcare workers that were among the first people in the US to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. It's also giving away free beer on a dedicated website.\n Confusion about the vaccine is rampant with 60% of Americans saying they don't know when or where to get it, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Half of respondents said they were \"frustrated\" and nearly a quarter felt \"angry\" about the vaccine's rollout with 60% rating their state government's performance on vaccines as fair or poor.\n Anheuser-Busch's other brands, like Bud Light and Michelob Ultra, will air four minutes' worth of ads during the Super Bowl. But the absence of Budweiser, including in the pre- and post-game show, is something Rustgi expects people to notice.\n \"Some people might wonder why were not showing up at the Super Bowl, but we will just show up in a different way,\" she said.\n Budweiser isn't the only big company skipping this year's game. Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) both announced in recent weeks they won't be buying ads during Super Bowl LV.\n The sports spectacle has been \"struggling to attract the degree of advertising demand it usually draws\" because of the pandemic's economic affects on company's bottom lines, said research firm eMarketer. For example, Coca-Cola recently slashed 2,000 jobs as it grapples with a decline in revenue from lost sales in restaurants. Pepsi said it would rather focus its marketing efforts on its sponsored Super Bowl halftime show.\n EMarketer also reported that companies are \"carefully considering the financial costs associated\" with a pricey Super Bowl ad because some are worried the game might have smaller ratings compared to previous years because the pandemic is preventing people from holding viewing parties.\n CBS (VIAC) has sold a significant amount of its ad inventory for this year's game, sources familiar tell CNN Business. That signals some difficulty for the broadcaster. In 2019, Fox reportedly sold out of its ad inventory by Thanksgiving \u2014 more than two months before the game.\n Still, some are bullish on the event because it's usually the year's most-watched TV broadcast.\n Last year's Super Bowl on Fox averaged a whopping 102 million viewers. The game's ratings towered over the second highest-rated broadcast of 2020, which was the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. That raked in 73 million viewers across several networks.\n Mark Read, CEO of the world's largest advertising firm WPP (WPP), told CNN Business that Budweiser's move \"says more about the mood in the country than it does about the value of the Super Bowl as a marketing platform.\"\n \"Obviously brands need to speak to consumers in the right tone and are rightly worried about getting this wrong, but I have no doubt that the Super Bowl will remain the year's biggest sports and advertising event,\" he said.",

        "body_text": "The image from President Joe Biden's inauguration of Sen. Bernie Sanders sitting with his legs crossed wearing brown and white gloves made a splash on the internet. Now, one lucky bidder can own a crocheted doll made as a tribute to Sanders' inauguration meme.\n The unique doll is up for auction on eBay, with the seller, Tobey King, promising 100% of the profits to Meals on Wheels America.\n \"I was talking with another crafter friend who told me Bernie had just sold some hoodies and donated all the proceeds to Meals on Wheels Vermont, and I knew that that is what I wanted to do with the doll I made,\" said King, owner of Tobey Time Crochet. \"With the attention it was getting I was hopeful Meals on Wheels would get a good donation.\"\n The starting bid for the handmade doll Saturday was only 99 cents, but by Monday the item had more than 149 bids with bidding above $15,000. The auction ends Tuesday afternoon.\n \"Senator Sanders has long been one of Meals on Wheels' biggest advocates, and it's incredible to see how his unexpected moment in the spotlight is inspiring others to join the fight to address senior hunger and isolation, as well,\" Jenny Young, vice president of communications for Meals on Wheels America, told CNN.\n Last week, the Sanders campaign store started selling sweatshirts featuring the photo that inspired the countless memes, and all the proceeds are going to Meals on Wheels programs in Sanders' home state of Vermont.\n Young told CNN that Meals on Wheels America is an official eBay charity and that King selected the organization to receive 100% of the sale.\n \"Amid the pandemic, the demand for Meals on Wheels has skyrocketed as more vulnerable older adults find themselves homebound and in need of this vital lifeline,\" said Young in a statement. \"The awareness for our cause is needed now more than ever, and on behalf of the entire nationwide network, we greatly appreciate the support.\"\n Just like the meme of Sanders, King's design and photos of her handmade doll went viral last week when she posted pictures of her creation on social media. She told CNN it took her seven hours to crochet the 9-inch doll that is made to sit. A tiny wooden bench will be included with the doll.\n King, from Corpus Christi, Texas, patterned it off a previous doll she made of Sanders when he ran for president in 2020. This time, she added the now-famous brown and white knit mittens along with a blue felt face mask.\n \"I just really like and support Bernie,\" said King, 46, who has been crocheting for eight years. \"I think he's great.\"\n The mother of two started crocheting, according to her website, when she quit her job to be a stay-at-home mom. She started making scarves and clothes before deciding to try her hand at making a doll for her daughter. King has since made dolls inspired by famous people ranging from the singer Selena to the cast of \"The Golden Girls.\"\n While the Sanders doll is being sold for charity, King is also selling the crochet pattern on her Etsy store so anyone can make their own collector's item.\n \"The attention that my Bernie doll and I have received is unbelievable,\" said King. \"I'm overwhelmed with gratitude.\"\n CNN's Kelly McCleary contributed to this report.",

Black will remain as the firm's chairman, Apollo said.\n Black said in his continued role as chairman he looks forward to \"focusing on strategic planning, growth initiatives, investment opportunities and supporting Apollo, which has been my life's work, in whatever ways I can.\"\n In a separate announcement, Apollo said it found no evidence of wrongdoing in Black's past relationship with Epstein, an accused sex trafficker who hanged himself in jail in 2019.\n \"The findings of the report are consistent with statements made by Mr. Black and Apollo regarding the prior relationship,\" Apollo said in a statement.\n The probe conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, which it says involved reviewing more than 60,000 documents and interviewing more than 20 people, found that Black's payments to Epstein totaled $158 million from 2012 to 2017. It also found that Apollo never did business with Epstein and he never invested in Apollo-managed funds.\n Black's last payment to Epstein was made in April 2017; in 2018, Epstein repaid a portion of two loans that were outstanding to Black but never repaid the balance, the report said. \"Black and Epstein ceased communications in or around the fall of 2018, prior to the renewed public revelations of Epstein's conduct and Epstein's arrest and suicide.\"\n Black called for the independent review in October of last year, saying it was \"the best way to assure all of our stakeholders that they have all of the relevant facts, and I look forward to cooperating fully,\" according to an Apollo spokesperson.\n In a letter to investors provided to CNN in October, Black expressed that he deeply regretted his involvement with Epstein.\n \"With the benefit of hindsight \u2014 and knowing everything that has come to light about Epstein's despicable conduct more than fifteen years ago \u2014 I deeply regret having had any involvement with him,\" Black stated in the letter.\n Black stated that his relationship only involved professional services that included \"estate planning, tax and philanthropic endeavors\" as well as occasional meets at Epstein's townhouse to conduct business, as he says, Epstein didn't have a separate office.\n In a letter to investors on Monday, Black said he had pledged $200 million toward initiatives that help survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking \u2014 one way he can \"begin to address the grievous error\" of having maintained a professional relationship with Epstein.",

        "title": "The strange but true reason why GameStop's stock keeps surging",
        "body_text": "GameStop is expected to lose money this year and next year. Sales growth is sluggish as fewer gamers need to go to stores \u2014 or even shop online \u2014 when they can download new titles directly from their consoles, PCs, phones or tablets.  So why are shares of the video game retailer up more than 275% so far in 2021?\n The company can thank a loyal group of investors on Reddit who continue to back the stock even as many others on Wall Street have argued that the shares are overvalued and due for a sharp decline.\n The stock was extremely volatile on Monday, and it was halted several times. Shares more than doubled at one point, and finished the day 18% higher.\n Posters on the WallStreetBets subreddit have been touting the company aggressively. That appears to have helped fuel a so-called short squeeze in GameStop (GME) stock.\n A large number of investors have bet against GameStop recently by borrowing shares and selling them with the hopes that they can then repurchase the stock at a lower price and pocket the difference.\n That's a risky strategy: If a stock suddenly spikes higher, short sellers may have to rush en masse to buy back shares or risk losing their shirts. The more that a shorted stock goes up, the bigger the losses become if a short seller doesn't buy back (or cover) their position. That creates the squeeze.\n Citron Research, an investing firm that often identifies stocks it thinks are overvalued and therefore could be good short-selling candidates, has learned the hard way what can happen when investors squeeze a stock higher.\n Citron founder Andrew Left called GameStop a \"failing mall-based retailer\" in a report earlier this month and then predicted that the stock would plunge to $20 in a video he posted to Twitter on Thursday. At the time, GameStop was trading around $40. The stock surged to $65 by Friday and is now trading around $100.\n Left has now given up on shorting GameStop, citing harassment by the stock's backers.\n He also tweeted last week that \"too many people\" were hacking Citron's Twitter feed, causing him to delay the posting of his video, which was originally planned for Wednesday. Left was not immediately available for further comment.\n The victory for GameStop's vocal bulls on Reddit shows how dangerous it is for investors to bet against stocks that have a significant cult following. BlackBerry (BB), another favorite among Reddit's WSB followers, has also surged this year.\n Some gleeful GameStop investors are even looking to cash in by selling merchandise touting the stock rally.\n JonesTrading chief market strategist Mike O'Rourke noted in a report Monday that there is now a commemorative patch listed on Etsy that celebrates the GameStop stock spike. More than 100 have been sold so far.\n To be sure, GameStop does have some upside beyond the Reddit love.\n Despite its name, the retailer doesn't sell only games. GameStop is also popular with fans of pop culture collectibles, such as Star Wars toys and Funko (FNKO) figurines, which help attract shoppers who aren't hardcore gamers to visit the brick and mortar shops.\n GameStop announced earlier this month that same-store sales rose nearly 5% during the 2020 holiday season and that digital sales skyrocketed more than 300%.\n Overall sales were still down though, due primarily to temporary store closures as a result of a spike in Covid-19 cases in December as well as supply disruptions due to strong demand for new PS5 and Xbox Series X.consoles from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n GameStop had no comment for this story, but the firm is making some changes as it attempts to become a more digitally-focused retailer.\n The company announced earlier this month that Ryan Cohen, founder of online pet supply store Chewy, is now on GameStop's board along with two other former Chewy executives. Cohen's RC Ventures is one of the largest investors in GameStop.\n \"The three new directors collectively bring deep expertise in e-commerce, online marketing, finance and strategic planning to GameStop,\" the company said in a press release about the board moves.\n Still, some investing experts are worried that the rise in GameStop has gone too far too fast and could be yet another sign of speculative mania in what has suddenly become a frothy overall market.\n \"Generally speaking, stocks with high short interest have been some of the top performers this year,\" said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group in a report earlier this month.\n The Bespoke report also noted that struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), mall owner Macerich (MAC) and hard hit movie theater operator AMC (AMC) are other examples of heavily shorted stocks that are up substantially in 2021.",

        "title": "Looming impeachment trial renews trauma of the Trump years",
        "body_text": "Five days into America's restored political normality, the stark delivery of an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate was a flashback to the horror of the Capitol insurrection and the trauma of the last four years.\n Everything about Monday's ritual -- in which House impeachment managers traversed corridors through which lawmakers had fled a pro-Trump mob less than three weeks ago -- was discomforting.\n Rep. Jamie Raskin offered a breathtaking reminder of just how close more than two centuries of American democracy had come to a fatal fracture when he read out the sole charge against the former president.\n \"Resolved, that Donald John Trump, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors ... Article One, Incitement of Insurrection,\" the Maryland Democrat read, charging the accused in simple, surreal language of \"inciting violence against the government of the United States.\"\n Inside the chamber awaiting Raskin's solemn delegation were the senators themselves -- who will in effect be both the jury for Trump's trial and witnesses to his offense -- seated in a courtroom that is literally a crime scene.\n Television pictures of Trump fans storming the Capitol and chasing police officers in their Make America Great Again hats have become familiar by repetition. But the impeachment article's vivid description of the outrage seemed to shock all over again in the ringing tones of Raskin, whose own recent tragedy, the loss of 25-year-old son Tommy, added an extra layer of poignancy.\n The ceremony was by no means a familiar event -- having taken place only four times in US history. But the fact that many television viewers have now seen it unfold three times in just over 20 years is testimony to a polarized age.\n And the sight of impeachment managers wearing black masks offered an almost medieval mood to a foreboding slice of history and hinted at the national pandemic crisis unfolding outside the Capitol -- which forms another dark dimension to Trump's legacy.\n What was most strange was that the president, who is the subject of the Constitution-based ouster attempt, was not up the road in the White House. He's not even president anymore! And he is besmirched by the historic stain of a double impeachment.\n Another odd wrinkle of history is that the impeached president's successor, Joe Biden, is already in the White House, seeking to heal Americans and the nation's divides and rolling out policies at a rapid clip -- like any other new commander in chief cursed by Franklin Roosevelt's first 100 days yardstick.\n Biden's sheer conventionality has made the events of the Trump presidency seem more distant than they actually are. But like an episode of national post-traumatic stress disorder, Monday evening's grave theater brought it all back.\n Many Republicans, most of whom are not likely to vote to convict Trump over his effective coup attempt, didn't show up at the desks that rioters had searched when they breached the Capitol on January 6.\n They weren't the only ones missing. Chief Justice John Roberts was replaced by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the president pro tempore of the chamber, who will also be in the chair when the trial begins on February 9. The chief justice -- apparently citing the fact that Trump is no longer in the White House -- obviously has no desire to make his own dubious history by presiding over two presidential trials.\n The absence of many Republicans reflects the awful choices that the former president, has yet again, inflicted on his party. While several GOP senators, such as Utah's Mitt Romney, have hinted that they may vote to convict Trump, it seems increasingly unlikely that there are 17 GOP votes to build the two-thirds majority needed to convict him and ban him from future federal office.\n As with the ex-President's previous impeachment over his attempt to get Ukraine to interfere in the election to damage Biden, some Republicans are citing quickly concocted procedural objections so they don't have to rationalize his behavior. They insist, against strong evidence, that a former office holder and private citizen is immune from impeachment trials.\n Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, is less inventive. He says the trial is \"stupid\" -- choosing to argue that the real threat to national unity is not Trump's behavior but an accounting of his culpability that might dissuade future presidents from sacking the Capitol on the way out of the Oval Office.\n Biden appears resigned to the damage the trial will do to his swift hopes of enacting his emergency Covid-19 rescue plan.\n \"I think it has to happen,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins in the West Wing on Monday, but he predicted that the GOP would not vote to hold his predecessor accountable for a historic crime against US democracy.\n Such an outcome would be seen as gross negligence by many Americans who watched in horror as Trump tried to steal the election and then attempted to torch democracy when he couldn't. But given the Republican Party's four years of abetting his criminality, this is an unsurprising coda to the most tumultuous presidency in American history.",

        "title": "Coronavirus variant first spotted in Brazil found in the US for the first time",
        "body_text": "Even with the number of Covid-19 cases coming down, scientists are worrying about variants of the novel coronavirus -- one of which has been detected in the United States for the first time.\n The new variant was discovered recently in a US patient who had traveled from Brazil, officials in Minnesota said Monday. It is the first known case of the P.1 variant reaching the United States. P.1 is one of four variants being closely watched by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \"The emergence of this variant raises concerns of a potential increase in transmissibility or propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals,\" the CDC says on its website.\n It's been the most common variant of the virus detected in a surge of cases seen in and around Manaus, the largest city in Brazil's Amazon region.\n There's no evidence it causes more severe disease, however.\n Another strain, first discovered in the United Kingdom, is also more transmissible.\n The CDC has warned that the country could see \"rapid growth\" in its spread in early 2021. This B.1.1.7 strain has already been detected in 24 US states.\n And there's \"a realistic possibility\" that B.1.1.7 could be deadlier than other variants, a UK report said.\n Another strain, first detected in South Africa, is concerning because scientists have said current Covid-19 vaccines might not be as effective against it. That strain has been found in more than 20 other countries, though it has not yet been detected in the US.\n Public health officials are extremely concerned about the variants, Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and CNN analyst, told CNN.\n \"We've seen what happens in other countries that have actually had coronavirus under relatively good control, then these variants took over and they had explosive spread of the virus, and then overwhelmed hospitals,\" she said.\n Wen said the circulation of virus variants underscores the need to increase vaccinations and perform more genomic surveillance.\n Two doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine are \"expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date,\" the vaccine maker said.\n There was \"no significant impact\" on the vaccine's effectiveness against the strain first found in the UK. But there may be somewhat less effectiveness against the strain first detected in South Africa.\n \"The efficacy might be reduced somewhat, but it may still be very effective,\" said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center. \"Hopefully, the vaccine will still be 70-80% effective.\"\n Moderna said it's developing a new Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against the variant first spotted in South Africa. The company plans to first test the vaccine in the lab and in a small Phase 1 clinical trial in the US.\n Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine candidate is being tested in Brazil, South Africa and the United States  and results might provide insight into how well it works against emerging new variants, one of its developers told CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the Coronavirus Fact vs Fiction podcast.\n The company has said that it could share its Phase 3 trial data as early as this week.\n \"It'll give us insights not only into whether or not this vaccine candidate is effective, but it'll also give us insights into whether or not the variants that are circulating in South Africa might be a problem for vaccines,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch, who is the director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.\n First, the good news: In 48 states, the averages of new Covid-19 cases have dropped significantly over the past seven days. And every state improved its rate of vaccinations.\n Now the bad news: The US is still averaging more than 170,000 new infections a day. And Covid-19 has killed an average of 3,088 people a day over the past week in the US -- more deaths each day than the 9/11 attacks.\n January is on track to be Covid-19's deadliest month in the US.\n At least 73,259 deaths have been reported this month, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University. That's more than one death every 30 seconds.\n Now it's a race between vaccines and variants, as health experts say the US must speed up shots before a highly contagious strain of coronavirus spreads more rapidly.\n President Joe Biden on Monday raised the bar on his promise that 100 million shots will be given in his first 100 days in office -- a goal that has been criticized by some as too modest.\n \"We need to do better than a million shots per day,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine at George Washington University.\n \"We need to do better. We need to vaccinate about 2 million people a day. That should be the goal.\"\n Biden told reporters he thinks 1.5 million vaccinations can soon be done each day.\n Biden said the key factors in ramping up vaccinations are having enough vaccine, syringes and other necessary equipment and enough people administering them. He said his administration is working to produce additional vaccinators -- people who can administer the vaccine.\n Dr. Vivek Murthy, Biden's nominee for US surgeon general, had said Sunday the goal of a million doses a day is \"a floor. It's not a ceiling.\"\n \"And that's going to take a lot of work -- work dispelling misinformation, working on the supply, increasing distribution channels,\" Murthy said.\n Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines require a second dose three to four weeks after the first. And most of the shots given now are first doses, Reiner said.\n \"As we go forward, more and more shots every day will be the second vaccination,\" he said.\n \"So the number of new vaccinations is going to start to drop until we get to a point in the not-too-distant future where every day the shots that are given are 50% follow-up and 50% new vaccinations.\"\n According to the CDC's website, 19.2 million people have received a first dose and 3.3 million have been fully inoculated with a second.\n A little more than 1% of all Americans have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.\n \"We're looking at probably middle of the summer, end of the summer before the average, healthy, young American has access to vaccination,\" said infectious disease expert Dr. Celine Gounder.\n And with the B.1.1.7 variant spreading in the US, it's up the public to take personal responsibility to stop it's spread. \"The best way to prevent the emergence of new variants is to do all of the things we've been talking about for months,\" Gounder said.\n That includes keeping your distance from others and wearing a mask anytime you might be near someone who doesn't live with you.\n \"The more you let the virus spread, the more it mutates, the more variants you'll have,\" Gounder said.\n Some people have started wearing two masks at once. When asked whether that would help, Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC's \"Today\" show that it probably would.\n \"I mean, this is a physical covering to prevent droplets and virus to get in,\" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n \"So if you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective. And that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N95.\"\n Send us your questions for President Biden's Covid-19 team\n In a sign of progress, one of hardest hit states is lifting regional stay-at-home orders Monday.\n \"We are turning a critical corner,\" said Dr. Tom\u00e1s Arag\u00f3n, director of the California Department of Public Health.\n The orders applied to Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley and Bay Area regions, affecting more than 90% of the state's population.\n The mandate was triggered when ICU capacity in a region fell below 15%. The four-week ICU capacity projections for these regions are now above 15%, the state reported.\n \"Californians heard the urgent message to stay home as much as possible and accepted that challenge to slow the surge and save lives,\" Arag\u00f3n said.\n \"Together, we changed our activities knowing our short-term sacrifices would lead to longer-term gains,\" he said.\n \"Covid-19 is still here and still deadly, so our work is not over, but it's important to recognize our collective actions saved lives.\"\n CNN's Amanda Watts, John Bonifeld, Maggie Fox, Elizabeth Cohen, Deidre McPhillips, Lauren Mascarenhas, Amanda Sealy and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Federal prosecutors have charged a man in connection to the riot and insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, after a Washington, DC, airport police officer helped identify him.\n In an affidavit filed in federal court, a special agent with the US Capitol Police says the man, John Lolos, was identified by a Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority police officer after Lolos was kicked off a Delta flight the afternoon of January 8 at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The crew had decided to turn the plane around while it was taxiing, according to the agent, because Lolos was causing a disturbance by \"continuously yelling 'Trump 2020!'\"\n The police officer, identified only as Officer Braddock, witnessed Lolos being escorted off the flight, according to the affidavit.\n \"Officer Braddock was alerted to LOLOS's activity and witnessed him return to the gate from the airplane, but did not detain or arrest LOLOS when he returned to the gate,\" the affidavit says. \"Delta booked LOLOS a later flight to his destination, and LOLOS continued to wait at the gate.\"\n About 45 minutes later, Braddock was scrolling through his Instagram feed when he saw a video showing rioters inside the Capitol building, the affidavit says. The video showed a man exiting a Capitol doorway, and Braddock identified him as the same man he saw get kicked off the flight, the agent said.\n \"During the video LOLOS can be seen exiting the U.S. Capitol doorway, wearing the same shirt he was wearing the (at) the airport, and was waiving a red 'Trump 2020 Keep American Great' flag hooked together with the United States flag, yelling 'we did it, yeah!'\" the agent wrote. During the arrest, the agent found the flags seen in the video among Lolos' possessions, according to the affidavit.\n Braddock notified officers from the Capitol Police Dignitary Protection Division -- who were already at the airport on other assignments -- about Lolos. They then approached Lolos, according to the affidavit, and, \"informed LOLOS that he was being detained and was not free to leave at that point.\"\n The US Capitol Police special agent then placed him under arrest, according to the affidavit.\n Lolos has since been charged with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricting building without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds on January 6.\n An attorney for Lolos was not listed in federal court records and CNN has been unable to contact Lolos for comment. CNN also reached out to Delta for comment but has not yet received a response.",

        "body_text": "C.J. Diegel scrolled down the Arizona Secretary of State's website until he saw the box for \"no party affiliation.\" He clicked it, ending his lifelong registration as an Arizona Republican, in just seconds.\n Diegel had hoped that his state party, after seeing the US Capitol insurrection earlier this month, would reverse course away from Donald Trump.\n But it didn't.\n \"Arizona Republicans took Donald Trump's side,\" said Diegel, a married father of two and Air Force veteran. \"It has to stop. Those people don't represent what being conservative in Arizona means and I finally had to had to say, 'No, I don't want to be associated with the Arizona Republican Party.'\"\n Diegel is one of more than 9,292 Republicans who requested to change their party registration from Republican to independent, Democrat or Libertarian since the Capitol riot, according to numbers compiled by the Arizona Secretary of State's office from January 6 through January 24. The numbers, while a small percentage of overall GOP registration in Arizona, are a snapshot of how voters are reacting to the Republican civil war taking place in the swing state.\n The Arizona Republican Party shows no sign it will slow moves further to the right, dictated by the whims of the former president, even after a bruising election for Republicans in the state. Voters flipped Arizona to Democrats in the presidential election for the first time since Bill Clinton won the state in 1996. And Democrat Mark Kelly defeated Republican Martha McSally in the US Senate race.\n \"The America First agenda is alive and well,\" the state's GOP chair Kelli Ward said in a video released Monday. \"Are we going to continue to be an America first Arizona or are we going back to the dark days before Donald Trump? Luckily for us, we are blessed, we going forward as an America First state.\"\n \"I look forward to keeping Arizona great and Making America Great Again!\" she concluded.\n Those electoral losses matter little to Barbara Wyllie and Corky Haynes, who dubbed themselves the \"Grassroot Grandmas.\" Both lifelong Arizona Republicans, they were among the more than 1,000 members of the Arizona Republican Party in Phoenix for the state party meeting Saturday.\n \"However Trump rolls is how the Republican party's gonna roll. This is the Trump Republican Party,\" said Wyllie. \"And the RINOs [Republican In Name Only] will fall off.\"\n Inside the meeting, the Arizona Republican Party voted to publicly punish Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain; Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey; and former Sen. Jeff Flake. The trio of Republicans -- all of whom attended the inauguration of President Joe Biden just days before -- were formally censured for what the party described as a variety of \"failures.\"\n Ducey was censured for imposing emergency rules as Covid-19 gripped Arizona, saying those emergency orders to contain the virus violated the Constitution and amounted to the governor enacting \"dictatorial powers.\"\n McCain, who endorsed Biden during the election, was censured for supporting \"leftist causes\" and failing to support Trump.\n Flake was condemned for also supporting Biden in the election.\n Ducey's political director, Sara Mueller, discounted the power of the state party's move to censure the sitting governor.\n \"These resolutions are of no consequence whatsoever, and the people behind them have lost whatever little moral authority they may have once had,\" said Mueller.\n After the censure votes, Flake tweeted a picture of himself, McCain and Ducey at Wednesday's inaugural ceremonies, writing, \"Good company.\"\n McCain called the censure a \"badge of honor.\"\n \"It is a high honor to be included in a group of Arizonans who have served our state and our nation so well... and who, like my late husband John, have been censured by the AZGOP,\" she tweeted, making note of how the late senator was censured in 2014 by the state GOP for what it then described as a liberal record.\n Outside the AZ GOP meeting, Wyllie said she voted for the late Sen. John McCain but now regretted it.\n The \"Grassroot Grandmas\" proudly showed CNN a picture they had taken with Trump during his term. \"We're here to increase the Republican Party by making it a MAGA party,\" Haynes said while wearing a \"Trump\" shirt.\n When asked exactly how following Trump, after his loss in Arizona would increase GOP membership, Wyllie said, \"I don't honestly know. But I will be with him, wherever he goes, however he goes.\" The women then pivoted to conspiratorial lies that Trump and the Democratic senators did not win their seats, despite the overwhelming facts against their illegitimate claims.\n \"I am shocked that self-described, life-long conservatives have abandoned their self-proclaimed principles for loyalty to one person, Donald Trump,\" said Kirk Adams, the former Arizona Speaker of the House and former adviser to Ducey. \"Will see more of this in the coming months? Or will this party go down the rabbit hole of loyalty? Perhaps this fever will break. But if it doesn't, it spells bad news for Republicans seeking office in this state.\"\n Ward appeared publicly unconcerned about any warnings from moderates, as she spoke to the assembled Arizona Republicans at the Dream City Church in Phoenix. The venue was closed to nearly all reporters, except for a few hand-selected outlets, including CNN.\n Ward, who has embraced far-right conspiracies about the legitimacy of Arizona's election results, ended her speech ahead of her re-election vote with, \"Make America Great Again!\" She then introduced a recorded audio message from Trump, where the former president told members, \"I give her my complete and total endorsement.\"\n Ward defeated her challenger by three points in two rounds of voting.\n Meanwhile, establishment Arizona Republicans are stepping away from the official party apparatus, hoping to delegitimize the party and attempt to work around it for future elections.\n Adams, the well-known former Arizona representative, said Ward and the state party \"has been feeding the public a steady diet of QAnon-ic conspiracies.\" For the first time in 20 years, Adams said he will not be an elected precinct committeeman in the state Republican Party.\n \"I don't want to be a part of the dumpster fire,\" he said.\n Multiple Arizona Republicans say the political battle against the Ward-led Republicans will take place at the precinct level, working the grassroots and eventually blocking and tackling at the party level. That is unglamorous work, but it's urgently needed, stresses Glenn Hamer, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party and now-CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce.\n Referencing the more than 9,200 Republicans who left the party since January 6, Hamer fears the political outcome for Republicans.\n \"This party is being run by a fringe, essentially calling for a purge,\" Hamer said. \"This is a party that lost the White House, two Senate races, and shows no interest in bringing people together and certainly no interest in expanding the base of Republicans. It's turned into the circular firing squad.\"\n \"If ignored, the state will go from purple to blue pretty quickly,\" he added.\n That is a nightmare scenario for some of those who represent the future of the Arizona Republican Party. In many ways, Arizona state senator T.J. Shope embodies a potential \"big-tent\" future Republican party for the swing state. Raised in a rural part of Arizona, Shope is the son of a Mexican-born mother and local grocery chain owner. The 35-year-old wears an Arizona belt buckle, western hat and boots, with an eye to increasing the tent for the next generation of Republicans.\n \"I wear a different hat than the guy in the horns,\" joked Shope, referencing the Capitol rioter from Arizona who was widely photographed, then arrested, for storming the Capitol wearing an animal headdress with horns.\n \"We have to turn the page,\" Shope said. \"If the emphasis continues to be on 2020, then we're probably not going to win in 2022. And then we're probably going to end up more like Colorado than we do perennial toss up states like Ohio or Florida. People need to realize it only took Colorado one or two cycles to go from a reliably Republican state to a reliably Democratic state, and that can happen anywhere.\"",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nThe House voted to impeach President Donald Trump on January 14, but waited until Monday to complete the next step in the process -- having House managers read the single article of impeachment aloud on the House floor and then walking it over to the Senate.\n But the Senate impeachment trial itself won't get underway for two more weeks as senators get to work filling up Joe Biden's Cabinet and -- perhaps -- giving him the tools he needs to lead the country through the pandemic. (Here's where things stand on that.)\n Roberts' court also declined Monday to hear whether Trump's hotels in DC and New York accepting money from foreign governments violated the Constitution's emoluments clause -- because the question about a president being enriched by foreigners is moot since voters have already shown Trump the door. Read more about emoluments.\n \"I think so many are getting confused by the fact that we're doing this,\" said Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, the Indiana Republican.\n It seems clear there will be Republicans who support convicting Trump in the first-ever post-presidential impeachment -- Utah Sen. and former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney? Maine Sen. Susan Collins? Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse? -- but the number, for now, appears to be on track to fall well short of the necessary 17 to reach the necessary two-thirds majority.\n \"And, you know, if we're going to have unity in our country, I think it's important to recognize the need for accountability, for truth and justice,\" he said on Fox News Sunday, arguing there is a need for a Senate trial.\n Arizona, which used to be the home of modern conservatism, is an instructive example. The state party reelected Trump follower Kelli Ward to run the state party despite Trump's loss there, going 0-2 in recent US Senate races and shrinking party registrations. Arizona is at least purple but the party is not seeking middle ground. In addition to keeping Ward as its leader, party members voted to publicly censure Cindy McCain, widow of former Sen. John McCain, and former Sen. Jeff Flake, for supporting Biden, as well as Gov. Doug Ducey for enacting Covid restrictions.\n Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz told reporters Monday that he plans to fly to Wyoming to personally campaign against Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, maintaining her leadership role. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he has concerns about her leadership capability.\n For Trump, whether he remains a national political pariah could be affecting his home life.

Some of the snow will be very heavy, with rates of up to 2 inches an hour, says the Weather Prediction Center.\n \"If these snow totals materialize, they would be very rare for Iowa,\" the National Weather Service in Des Moines wrote.\n \"On average, single daily snowfalls of a foot or more only historically occur every 15 to 20 years.\"\n Check the local forecast\n If a foot of snow falls in Des Moines in a day, it will only be the 10th time a foot or more has fallen since 1884. The last time they saw this much snow in a day was in 2004.\n \"Snow in the Midwest is not rare,\" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers who spent years forecasting snow in the Plains. What makes this system rare is how much is expected to fall in one day.\n Des Moines is much more likely to see over a foot of snow build over two or three days.\n \"This storm with such a wide area of 12 to 18 inches may stretch road-clearing assets thin,\" said Myers. \"Be ready to be stuck a few days.\"\n Outside of Iowa, snow over 4 inches is expected from Kansas to Michigan.\n It isn't just snow that may cause problems. Ice could accumulate just south of the snow stretching from Kansas to New Jersey. Up to a tenth of an inch of ice with localized spots up to a quarter inch could form.\n \"Travel may quickly become hazardous across portions of this region,\" according to the prediction center.\n Rain will fall across the Southeast, where daily temperatures will surge above average. Severe storms may develop across the Mississippi River Valley, including eastern Arkansas and western Tennessee\n Another system is forecast to push through the West Coast region Tuesday into Wednesday.\n \"The midweek system aligning with an atmospheric moisture surge has the potential to dump an extreme amount of precipitation, potentially flirting with snowfall duration records, in portions of southern California and the western Great Basin,\" said Jenn Varian, a weather service meteorologist in Las Vegas.\n The Sierra Nevada is anticipated to take the brunt of the moisture with this system, said Varian, but additional spillover could be possible depending on storm heights.\n The mountain crests could see anywhere from 60 to 100 inches of snow Tuesday evening through Friday morning.\n Northwestern California, as of Monday, looks likely to see the most rainfall. \"Moisture plumes with AR (atmospheric river) events are always tricky and may not know more details until the event begins to unfold,\" said the San Francisco National Weather Service office.\n Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere -- like rivers in the sky -- that transport water vapor, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n Forecast rain totals from Tuesday through Thursday night range from 2.5 to 4.5  inches in the lower elevation locations. In comparison, the hills could see 6 to 8 inches, maybe even isolated amounts of 10 to 13 inches of rainfall.\n \"Heavy rainfall may lead to debris flows and flash flooding in and near recent burn areas,\" the National Weather Service in San Francisco warned. Those near these areas need to be ready in case evacuation is necessary.\n Ahead of this midweek system, much of the region will deal with stiff winds. High-wind warnings and advisories are posted from Los Angeles to Phoenix.\n Tuesday into Wednesday, winds could gust as high as 60 mph across portions of California.\n CNN meteorolgist Taylor Ward contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A man who claims he was struck by a police cruiser in Tacoma, Washington -- an incident that sparked a weekend protest -- said he will recover from his injuries \"but emotionally and mentally, I'm forever scarred.\"\n About 150 people gathered in downtown Tacoma on Sunday to protest the city's police department after an officer drove into a crowd Saturday night, police public information officer Wendy Haddow told CNN.\n Two people were taken to the hospital following the incident, according to the Pierce County Force Investigation Team (PCFIT), which is now leading the investigation. None of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening and at least one person has since been released.\n Tavon Williams, of nearby Spanaway, said he was among the injured.\n Williams told CNN on Monday the incident left both of his legs bruised and covered in lacerations and he has cuts and bruises on his feet, neck, elbow and head. Williams said he was hospitalized overnight and released Sunday.\n \"The people that (were) out there, (they weren't) harming anybody and for the police to come to actually harm people and then leave ... (I feel) so violated and I just want my justice,\" he said, adding that he was not part of a group that had been striking the officer's car on Saturday before it drove through the crowd.\n CNN has reached out to PCFIT and the Tacoma mayor's office for comment on Wlliams' account. The mayor's office directed CNN to PCFIT.\n Tacoma police identified Khanh Phan as the patrol officer involved in Saturday's incident. The 58-year-old has been a member of the Tacoma Police Department for nearly 30 years, police said.\n He \"was placed on paid administrative leave per department policy on the evening of January 23 immediately following the incident,\" police said in a statement.\n Some of the protesters Sunday night blocked streets with signs and traffic cones near where the incident occurred, police said. Others overturned trash cans and lit the contents on fire, while a few smashed windows of cars and buildings.\n Officials are still working to assess the damage, Haddow said in an email to CNN.\n According to Haddow, employees of South Sound 911 Records had to be evacuated from their building after the windows were broken out. No arrests were made during the protest, but two people were arrested leading up to it, Haddow said.\n Along with other police units, the officer was responding to reports of an incident at the intersection of South 9th and Pacific Avenue around 6:20 p.m. on Saturday, a press release from police said.\n Once on scene, the officers found a number of vehicles and approximately 100 people blocking the intersection, which they began to clear \"for the safety of those gathered and people trying to use the street,\" the release said.\n As the officers worked to clear the street, a crowd formed around the officer's vehicle and began pounding on the windows, police spokesperson Haddow told The News Tribune.\n \"He was afraid they would break his glass,\" she said, prompting him to speed away from the scene, the News Tribune reported.\n Lights and sirens were activated as the crowd continued to surround the vehicle, the release said. The officer inside the SUV tried backing up, but according to the release was not able to because of the crowd.\n \"Fearing for his safety,\" the release said, \"the officer drove forward striking one individual and may have impacted others,\" while trying to get out of the \"unsafe position.\" Once the officer was \"at a point of safety,\" he called for medical aid the release said.\n The News Tribune reported one person sustained a laceration in the collision and was transported to a local hospital.\n Williams said he had gone to the intersection to shoot some video of the gathered crowd and cars. He isn't sure when police showed up to the scene, but insists he wasn't part of the group banging on the police car.\n \"The cops didn't say anything, I didn't hear no commands over the bullhorn,\" Williams told CNN.\n \"I was filming, and I had my back to the (police) car because I wasn't aware of what was going on. I heard sirens...by the time I looked around I was on the ground under the car with the other guy that was trampled under it.\"\n In at least one graphic video of the incident that was circulating on social media, the police vehicle with lights and sirens on can be seen slowly moving closer to the crowd gathered in front of the vehicle.\n An engine is heard revving in the background and the vehicle backs up before accelerating forward into the crowd, knocking several people to the ground.\n The vehicle then slows down slightly, as it appears to bounce while driving over something, before continuing through the intersection. The back tires of the vehicle can be seen rolling over someone lying in the street.\n A second video shot at the scene shows a white car doing donuts in the middle of the intersection and driving off just as officers arrive, moments before the police vehicle is seen driving through the crowd.\n In another video, the sound of an engine revving is followed by a series of thuds and an individual exclaiming twice, \"Damn, they're hitting a cop car.\"\n Moments later, an engine is heard revving again and people scatter and begin to scream, \"Oh my God! Oh my God!\" repeatedly. A few seconds later a smaller crowd is seen forming around what appears to be someone laying on the ground.\n Mayor Victoria Woodards said in a statement she is \"deeply concerned\" by the incident.\n \"As a use of deadly force, this incident is being taken very seriously and the scene has appropriately been turned over to the Pierce County Force Investigation Team for independent investigation,\" the mayor said.\n \"While we await more information, I want the community to know that I am deeply concerned and praying for everyone who was impacted by last night's events,\" Woodards said. \"I continue to be proud of Tacoma's long-standing reputation as a place of strong, nonviolent advocacy and activism.\"\n The mayor has called on the city manager and police chief to hold everyone involved accountable in the incident.\n City Manager Elizabeth Pauli told CNN affiliate KING that videos she watched of the incident were \"horrific.\"\n \"I was horrified, those videos are very difficult to watch,\" Pauli said. \"I feel concern for the individual that was run over. I feel concern for those that witnessed that event. I feel concern for our officers that are involved.\"\n Interim Police Chief Mike Ake said in a press release \"I am concerned that our department is experiencing another use of deadly force incident.\"\n \"I send my thoughts to anyone who was injured in tonight's event and am committed to our Department's full cooperation in the independent investigation and to assess the actions of the department's response during the incident,\" Ake said.\n The Community Police Advisory Board will hold a special meeting Monday night at 6 p.m. PST to discuss the incident, a tweet from police said.\n Williams said he wanted to speak with the mayor about what occurred.\n \"I just want to talk to someone that's an official because this is not right ... at the end of the day, it's not right,\" Williams said.\n CNN's Carma Hassan, Claudia Dominguez and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n Today in business news: GameStop' shares are soaring, Budweiser is skipping the Super Bowl and Coke with Coffee is just the chaos we need right now. Let's get into it.\n Leave it to a Reddit day-trading mob to inflate a stock based on little more than spite.\n GameStop is up more than 450% so far this year. The stock was extremely volatile on Monday \u2014 up 145% at one point and finishing the day 18% higher.\n Even though the company is expected to lose money this year and next \u2014 because gamers can download new titles directly without going to the mall to buy them \u2014 there's a spirited group of investors on the\u00a0WallStreetBets subreddit\u00a0propping the stock up.\n Why? Because, the internet. Reddit is home to hordes of day traders who are doing battle with short sellers, aka investors who place bets that a stock will crash.\n One of those short sellers is Citron Research, whose founder last week called GameStop a \"failing mall-based retailer\" and mocked the online traders fueling the stock's rise. At the time, GameStop was trading around $40, and the Citron founder predicted it would crash to $20. Those Reddit traders pounced, and the stock surged. It's now trading around $100.\n Note to short sellers: I didn't think I needed to say this in 2021, but internet mobs are unpredictable, ruthless, and relentless. The victory for GameStop's Reddit bulls underscores the risk of betting against stocks \u2014 like GameStop and BlackBerry, another Reddit fave \u2014\u00a0\u00a0that have a cult following. Never underestimate the collective power of bored Millennials with Robinhood accounts.\n This year, the Budweiser Clydesdales, like so many of us, are staying home.\n For the first time in 37 years, Budweiser is skipping the Super Bowl. Rather than spending millions of dollars on ads in which puppies and horses\u00a0become\u00a0BFFs, Bud is funding Covid-19 vaccine awareness.\n The\u00a0Super Bowl\u00a0is, in normal times, a massive opportunity for companies that can afford a commercial spot. And Budweiser's creative team pulls out all the stops to make tiny masterpieces\u00a0(I literally can't with the puppy-Clydesdale commercial from 2014.)\n Budweiser isn't the only big company skipping this year's game. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are also declining to buy ads.\n And it makes sense, both for the bottom line and for the optics. For example, Coca-Cola recently cut 2,000 jobs because of declining revenue. It'd be a bad look to lay people off and then spend $5 million on an ad. The beverage companies are reading\u00a0the room \u2014 America is living through a trauma, and no amount of \"buy the world a Coke\" kumbaya is going to change that.\n If you miss the classic commercials, I recommend rewatching that\u00a0puppy ad about five times in a row.\u00a0Maybe those Budweiser frogs from the mid-90s, too.\n \u2014 CNN founder Ted Turner\n CNN was only five years old when Ted Turner recruited Larry King to join the network. \"I had no idea if CNN would be successful,\" King later wrote. \"But I liked Ted and figured it would be fun to go along for the ride.\"\u00a0 The legendary journalist and longtime CNN host died Saturday at age 87.\n Google Maps will soon display Covid-19 vaccination sites.

        "title": "'Carrying Tommy in my heart': Amid personal tragedy, Raskin leads House's impeachment case",
        "body_text": "Rep. Jamie Raskin fled the House chamber on January 6 alongside his colleagues as a mob was gaining on the Capitol, but his mind was focused on the office down the hall where his daughter and son-in-law were in hiding.\n Just a day earlier, Raskin's family had buried his 25-year-old son, Tommy. Raskin's daughter Tabitha, 23, and his oldest daughter's husband, Hank, had accompanied the Maryland Democrat to the Capitol that Wednesday to watch as he defended President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College win on the House floor.\n Now his family was in danger, hiding in Majority Whip Steny Hoyer's ceremonial office as insurrectionists surrounded the House chamber. Raskin's chief of staff, Julie Tagen, who was with Tabitha and Hank, barricaded the door and grabbed a bronze bust as a weapon in case anyone broke in.\n It was roughly an hour before Capitol Police rescued them and they were reunited with Raskin, he said in a wide-ranging interview. The ordeal only added to the trauma that the Raskin family has endured since his son Tommy died by suicide on December 31.\n For Raskin, the unimaginable personal tragedy is coming at the exact moment of his biggest professional triumph in Congress. Raskin was one of the Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi picked to defend the certification of Biden's victory, and following the House's impeachment of former President Donald Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol, Pelosi named him as the House's lead impeachment manager.\n The events that led to the President's second impeachment are personal to Raskin.\n \"I picked a helluva time for take your daughter to work day,\" Raskin said, recalling the events of January 6. \"After an extremely long and dreadful day I was able to send Tabitha and Hank home after 9:30 or 10 p.m. I hugged them and said to Tabitha, 'I promise it wouldn't be like this the next time you come to the Capitol.' And she said, 'Dad there isn't gonna be a next time.'\"\n Raskin paused for a long moment, collecting his thoughts.\n \"These people have poisoned something precious in our political system,\" he said, \"and we have to recapture and defend democracy with everything we have.\"\n On Monday evening, Raskin led the nine impeachment managers across the same corridor in the Capitol that had been filled with ransacking rioters earlier this month. They walked onto the floor of the Senate, and Raskin read aloud the single article of impeachment on the floor: incitement of insurrection.\n \"It's a solemn, awesome ability,\" Raskin said of his role. \"It was also something I had to discuss with my family. But we are going to see this through.\"\n Raskin's success in making a case to Republicans remains to be seen. Seventeen Republican senators would have to vote to convict Trump to keep him from ever running for office again. And it's not clear that any case -- no matter how it is prepared -- would be enough to convince them. Many Republicans have already argued that a former President can't be convicted once he's out of office -- which Democrats and many legal experts say is not the case.\n Raskin has tried his best to keep focused on the task in front of him since his son's death. Lawmakers and aides who have worked closely with Raskin say that Tommy's memory has provided a kind of fuel for the congressman to keep going through hours-long prep sessions, votes and floor debates. After Tommy's death, Raskin and his wife, Sarah Bloom Raskin, wrote a moving tribute to Tommy and all the people he had inspired. Tommy was \"an anti-war activist, a badass autodidact moral philosopher and progressive humanist libertarian, and a passionate vegan,\" they said.\n In his 20s, Tommy suffered from \"a blindingly painful and merciless 'disease called depression,'\" Raskin and his wife wrote. \"He left us this farewell note on New Year's Eve day: 'Please forgive me. My illness won today. Please look after each other, the animals, and the global poor for me. All my love, Tommy.'\"\n Raskin would have been forgiven for stepping away after his son's death, even with his role defending the Electoral College a week away. But Raskin said he's taken his son's departing message to heart to help him push forward.\n \"Tommy left us a note,\" Raskin said. \"He didn't have anything in there about take some time off.\"\n The outpouring of support the family has received has been overwhelming, Raskin said. They've heard from Tommy's former classmates at Harvard Law School and Montgomery Blair High School about what a vibrant force he was, even at a young age. They received calls both from Biden, who lost his son Beau in 2015, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Bill and Hillary Clinton, Republicans like Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien all called and described how they were touched by the life Tommy led.\n \"I was carrying Tommy in my heart the entire time,\" Raskin said of his work on January 6. \"Because of that, as terrified as I was for the kids and our republic, I felt emboldened and encouraged by the strength and the values of my son.\"\n The role of lead impeachment manager is one Raskin has prepared for his whole career. Raskin was a constitutional law professor at American University's law school for more than two decades before turning to politics. He served first as a state representative in Maryland and then was elected to Congress in 2016.\n Raskin said that his decision to first get into politics in 2006 was a family one: Everyone took a vote. His kids, he said, were a big part of his campaigns.\n In Congress, Raskin played a significant role in the first impeachment of Trump in 2019 as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including filling in for House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler to defend the impeachment resolution before the House Rules Committee when Nadler had a family emergency. But Raskin wasn't among those chosen as a manager to prosecute that case against Trump in the Senate the last time around.\n Rep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat and one of the nine impeachment managers, said it was fitting Raskin that is a manager for the upcoming trial instead of the first one, because there's more of a focus now on the constitutional issues that are in Raskin's wheelhouse.\n \"To experience the kind of grief and loss that he experienced, and still have the same core drive and sense of purpose to save our republic is just incredible,\" said Neguse, who is close to Raskin. \"It's inspiring -- it's inspired me, it's inspired the fellow managers and I certainly think it's been an inspiration across the country, certainly to members on both sides.\"\n Still, the rigor in which Raskin has pursued this round of impeachment has left his colleagues worried for their friend. The bond between impeachment managers is beyond just professional. Several of the members are close personal friends with Raskin. Some of them served as witnesses to Raskin's grief in the days just after his son had died.\n When the new Congress was sworn in January 3, three days after Tommy's death, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a close friend of Raskin's, didn't want to let Raskin out of his sight. Along with Neguse, the three men spent the afternoon in Hoyer's ceremonial office where members shuffled in to pay their respects.\n On a few occasions, Cicilline said he thought maybe he'd leave to give Raskin some space, but he said he couldn't stand the idea of leaving Raskin alone. In the hours that unfolded, Cicilline watched as Raskin recounted one story after another about Tommy, telling his colleagues that Tommy had been both brilliant and too good for this world, a teacher and a student of the world. Tommy had been teaching a course and at the end of his semester, he had graded papers and written to each student that he had made a donation to a charity aligned with something each student had been interested in.\n \"In those moments when Jamie broke down, and you just realize that all the brilliance of Jamie Raskin and all the dedication to the Constitution and the responsibilities we have as members of Congress -- none of that can soothe his pain,\" said Cicilline, another of the nine impeachment managers.\n Behind the scenes, those working closely with Raskin describe a driven but democratic leader. People close to the process describe prep sessions that include Raskin starting with staff first before moving to members. Meetings always end, sources say, with Raskin thanking everyone for their around-the-clock work.\n Raskin is used to being busy in Congress. He serves on five committees -- far surpassing most members' assignments. But leading an impeachment trial amid a personal tragedy is a new challenge.\n \"That kind of pouring yourself into this important work for our country, at a time when you could be focused on your own incredibly (speechless) heartbreak, tells you all you need to know about him,\" said Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, another Democratic impeachment manager.\n Still, those involved told CNN that Raskin has maintained his zeal for intellectual curiosity, running meetings like breakout sessions in a law seminar.  At one recent trial prep session, Raskin requested staff look up the philosophical origins of labeling a crowd a mob, knowing off the top of his head the author who had led the research.\n \"We end up having so many very, very intense discussions, the nine of us, all of us being lawyers, and I almost get a feeling the same way I did in law school,\" said Del. Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands, another impeachment manager -- who also was one of Raskin's students in law school. \"He's able to really tease out people's thoughts, contextualize them, summarize them, put it back out to the group and see what their thoughts are.\"\n Plaskett said Raskin is one of the reasons she's on the House's impeachment team: He played a significant role in her decision out of law school to become a prosecutor rather than take a higher-paying job, which ultimately led her to Congress.\n In the days since Tommy's death, colleagues say they have made it clear to Raskin that at any point if he feels overwhelmed by the task ahead, they are ready to step in.\n \"The thing I worry about is below all that courage and strength and intellect is a man who lost his son,\" Cicilline said, adding that he personally told Raskin to call on him if and when he needs a moment to breathe. Ahead of his testimony before the House Rules Committee last week, Raskin took Cicilline up on his offer, asking him to speak instead.\n \"I felt very honored,\" Cicilline said. \"I worry about him as a friend.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.",

Brady's parents are both 76 years old, and his mom is a breast cancer survivor.\n \"For the first two games when I was in the hospital, I didn't even care if they were playing much less missing game,\" Brady said. \"It was a matter of life and death. Just like anybody goes into the hospital, it's serious stuff. And Tommy fought through it, and so now it's just in the rearview mirror.\"\n Brady's interview comes toward the end of a very different football season. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the NFL had to implement a handful of Covid-19 protocols, including a ban on gatherings outside of team facilities and a mandate that team personnel wear personal protective equipment at all times while in a team facility or traveling.\n Teams were given a stern reminder that they must follow the health and safety protocols already in place or risk the financial consequences and competitive imbalance that would come from missing games.\n Now that he and his wife have recovered, Brady said they do plan to attend the upcoming Super Bowl to watch their son and the Buccaneers go head-to-head with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n \"We're healthy, we're happy,\" he said, \"and everything is good.\"\n The game is set for February 7 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, meaning the Buccaneers will be the first team to play in a Super Bowl in their home stadium.\n CNN's Leah Asmelash, Kevin Dotson, Steve Almasy Amir Vera contributed to this report.",

        "title": "McConnell allows Senate power-sharing deal to advance after fight with Democrats over filibuster ",
        "body_text": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Monday that he will allow the 50-50 Senate to officially organize so Democrats can take control of key committees in the chamber after a weeklong battle with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over the rights of the minority to stall legislation.\n The breakthrough came as GOP leaders were eagerly looking for a way out of a potential crisis that would have stymied the Senate committee process indefinitely, after McConnell pointed to recent comments made by two Democratic senators about their long-standing opposition to gutting the filibuster as sufficient to ease his concerns.\n Schumer for days had rejected the GOP leader's demands, saying Monday afternoon: \"We are not letting McConnell dictate how the Senate operates.\"\n On Monday evening, McConnell relented after two moderate Democratic senators -- who have long opposed gutting the filibuster -- reiterated their views, allowing him to argue that they were sufficient to resolve his concerns since Democrats would lack the votes to change the rules.\n \"With these assurances, I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent,\" the Kentucky Republican said.\n Yet McConnell didn't receive any written assurances from Democrats that they would never touch the filibuster, and Schumer's office argued that the GOP leader got little from the stalemate.\n In response, Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman said in a statement: \"We're glad Senator McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand.\"\n McConnell's announcement is significant because the stalemate has prevented Senate committees from officially organizing, meaning Republicans still control key committees since the chamber is operating under the rules of the last Congress when the GOP was in charge.\n Schumer has demanded that the Senate agree to the 2001 rules during the last 50-50 Senate when the chamber's committees had equal representation of both parties, and tie votes on legislation and nominations would go to the floor.\n McConnell signaled Monday night he would agree to that as well.\n It was clear GOP leaders were eager to find a way out of the logjam. After two moderate Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, reaffirmed their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, Republicans suggested that could be enough to pave a way for a deal -- even though the two Democrats have long held that view.\n Sens. John Thune, the Republican whip, and Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership, each told CNN that they believed those comments could be enough to avoid the logjam.\n Cornyn called them \"promising commitments.\"\n \"I know the pressure that Schumer is under by the crazies on his side,\" Cornyn said. \"I'm little more optimistic than I was Friday that it will be worked out.\" The Texas Republican  said that he also was concerned that if the fight over the power-sharing agreement drags out, Democrats may \"lose their minds\" and dismantle the filibuster to pass the resolution in order to let the chamber officially organize.\n \"That's not a good development for anybody -- not for the institution,\" he said.\n Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said an agreement had to happen \"pretty soon\" because \"these committees are dysfunctional because they don't have chairman, ratios and all that stuff.\"\n He added: \"But if we could have a couple of Dems that would be willing to say something in a very public way and sort of sign a blood oath that they won't, I think that would help a lot.\"\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Monday.",

        "body_text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom praised his state's efforts to rein in the coronavirus pandemic Monday as he lifted California's regional stay-at-home orders, insisting that the decision was based on science and data -- and had nothing to do with the political effort underway to recall him.\n \"It's just complete utter nonsense,\" the Democrat said during a news conference Monday when asked whether the Republican-led recall launched last year had a bearing on the state's decision to end the orders, which have been in place since early December. \"Let's just dispense with that fundamental foundational nonsense.\"\n The lifting of the regional orders means that outdoor dining may resume, and hair and hair salons are permitted to reopen with very limited indoor capacity -- though many other indoor business activities will still be restricted as the state reverts to its color-coded tier-based system for assessing the threat by county. The vast majority of California counties are still within the most restrictive purple tier, and counties are permitted to impose stricter guidelines if they choose to do so.\n \"Today we can lay claim to seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to case numbers,\" Newsom said Monday during an update on the crisis. He noted that the 14-day positivity rate in California has now dropped to 9.4%\n \"We are not out of the woods. We are seeing a flattening of the curve,\" he said. \"Everything that should be up is up. Everything that should be down is down. Case rates, positivity rates, hospitalizations, ICUs -- testing starting to go back up, as well as vaccination rates in this state -- but we are not out of the woods.\"\n The effort to recall Newsom began last year, fueled by anger about the restrictions he had put in place to control the virus, but it gained steam as prominent state Republicans threw their weight behind both the organizing and fundraising efforts.\n Recall proponents must gather 1.5 million signatures, which are due March 17. Leaders of the recall say they have gathered more than a million signatures. The most current report from the California secretary of state's office said 723,783 signatures had been submitted and 410,087 had been verified as of January 6.\n Recall proponents, who argue on their website that Newsom \"continues to destroy the lives and businesses of hardworking Californians,\" questioned his motives Monday for lifting the stay-at-home orders when cases are still high and there is rising concern about new variants of the virus.\n \"The recall effort against Gov. Gavin Newsom has reached critical mass and continues to build momentum,\" said Orrin Heatlie, who launched the recall effort. \"So he's now taking steps to loosen the screws on those held captive to maintain what grasp he still holds on the state.\"\n California officials said they were able to lift the regional stay-at-home order from early December for the remaining regions that were under lockdown  -- populous areas like Southern California, the Bay Area and the San Joaquin Valley --  because the state's four-week projections finally show that intensive care unit capacity will be above 15%.\n During California's deadly surge, the state added some 4,100 health care workers to the ranks to handle the influx of patients, but Newsom stressed Monday that the state is still in a challenging period in terms of case numbers and deaths. The state has confirmed 3.1 million cases so far and more than 37,000 deaths. But Newsom touted the fact that California has administered more than 40 million Covid-19 tests since the pandemic began.\n As in many other states throughout the country, the demand for the Covid-19 vaccines is vastly outstripping the supply. During a vaccine adviser panel meeting last week, state epidemiologist Erica Pan said that at the current pace California is receiving doses, it could be June before the state is able to vaccinate the majority of residents who are 65 and older and currently eligible for the vaccine.\n Addressing the mounting frustration among Californians who have been unable to book vaccination appointments, Newsom noted that California had tripled the pace of vaccinations between January 4 and January 15. He also clarified that the state will approach vaccinations the same way an airline would board a plane, calling certain priority groups like first class and business class first but beginning to usher the rest of the passengers on board without waiting for those top-priority groups to complete the boarding process.\n The state is currently vaccinating health care workers and those who are 65 and older, while also \"prioritizing\" farmworkers, emergency workers and teachers, depending on the vaccine supply in a given area -- but the ease of even making an appointment to get the vaccine for those priority groups has varied wildly depending on each locality. State officials said Monday that there will be \"a single statewide standard and movement through the tiers\" to account for the confusion that has mounted over several weeks.\n State officials also started a pilot program in San Diego and Los Angeles counties for a system called My Turn that will alert Californians when they are eligible and allow them to schedule appointments. Providers will be able to share data with the state about the number of vaccines received and administered through the same system, in an effort to reduce the lag in data reporting. The state worked with companies like Salesforce, Skedulo and Accenture to develop the system, which will be launched statewide within a few weeks.\n Newsom also said doses that have been given to providers who have not yet used at least 65% of their available supply over a week will be reallocated if the provider does not submit a plan for using the remaining vaccines to inoculate priority populations within four days of being notified by the state.",

        "body_text": "A short-form video app that competes with the Chinese version of TikTok is preparing for what is expected to be the world's largest initial public offering since the coronavirus pandemic began.\n The company, whose name means \"fast hand\" in Chinese, plans to issue about 365 million shares priced between 105 and 115 Hong Kong dollars ($13.55 and $14.84). At the top of that range, it would raise 42 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $5.4 billion. Issuing more shares in an over-allotment option could bring its haul to $6.2 billion.\n That puts Kuaishou on track to become the largest IPO since Saudi Aramco shattered records with a nearly $30 billion raise in December 2019, according to data provider Refinitiv. It would also be the world's largest tech IPO since Uber (UBER) raised more than $8 billion in May 2019, according to Refinitiv data.\n Kuaishou is an app where users can film short-form videos and live stream content. It gets most of its revenue from the live-streaming business, where users can buy virtual items and present them as gifts to their favorite hosts. Live-streaming transactions accounted for 84% of revenue in 2019, according to a prospectus filed to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It also makes money off of online advertising.\n The company expects to price its shares by the end of this week, and list them on February 5.\n Kuaishou did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment from CNN Business.\n Even so, that's far short of industry leader ByteDance. The company's Douyin app \u2014 the Chinese version of TikTok \u2014 had more than 600 million daily users in August, according to the company.\n The listing also comes at a time when Chinese tech companies face intense regulatory scrutiny in China. Alibaba, Tencent and other big internet firms that operate popular apps and services have been warned in recent weeks about creating monopolies and abusing consumer data for profit.\n And Jack Ma's Ant Group, Alibaba's financial affiliate, saw its own mega IPO scuttled by regulators late last year just days before it was set to start trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong. It would have been the biggest share sale in history.\n In its prospectus, Kuaishou mentioned \"the fact that the internet business is highly regulated in China\" as a potential risk.\n Ten cornerstone investors have already pledged to invest $2.45 billion in Kuaishou. They include Temasek, BlackRock, GIC, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Fidelity and Invesco. The deal's sponsors include Bank of America Securities, Morgan Stanley, and China Renaissance.\n The IPO would also be a big deal for Hong Kong, which has spent the last year reinventing itself as a hot market for Chinese tech firms.\n Since 2019, Alibaba, (BABA) NetEase  (NTES)and JD.com (JD) have all held secondary listings in the Asian financial hub. The city also made changes last year intended to attract even more companies. Index compiler Hang Seng Indexes, for example, launched a Nasdaq-like technology index to track the largest tech firms that trade in the city.",

        "body_text": "Ruth Ben-Ghiat (@ruthbenghiat), a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, is professor of history at New York University and the author of \"Strongmen: From Mussolini to the Present.\" The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n \"We won this election and we won it by a landslide,\" said Donald Trump at his \"Save America\" rally on January 6, which incited the assault on the Capitol. This is Trump's \"Big Lie,\" a brazen falsehood with momentous consequences.\n Trump's accusation that \"radical left\" Democrats stole his victory is certainly a whopper. But the focus on his Big Lie misses something fundamental about how propaganda works. A leader's Big Lie has no power and makes little sense on its own. It has traction only if the public has been fed many, many smaller lies. It relies on a larger network of falsehoods told by the leader and reinforced by his government officials and compliant media.\n The Big Lie works because it is part of an established alternate belief system -- an edifice of lies, assembled piece by piece.\n Trump, a leader of authoritarian intentions and tendencies, had disadvantages with respect to the foreign autocrats he so admires. He had no state media, like China's Xi Jinping. He could not rule by decree, like Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n. He had to govern and run for reelection in an open society with a relatively robust free press. Moreover, although he succeeded in making journalists into hate objects for many of his followers, he could not revoke or destroy the First Amendment.\n So Trump took a different tack, unleashing a barrage of disinformation common in authoritarian states but without precedent in the history of the American presidency. He told more than 30,000 documented lies in public (30,573 was The Washington Post's final tally), on Twitter, at rallies and in interviews. If taken as an average, it would come out to 21 lies per day over his four-year term.\n Let's break down the smaller lies that prepared Trump's followers to accept the Big Lie. Each of these was highly damaging and consequential, and most were repeated endlessly by Trump and his co-conspirators in and out of government and replicated on social media, right-wing TV and radio, and more.\n Some were not expressed directly by Trump but were connected to the personality cult he built -- though he did make overt claims that he would \"save the United States,\" and pronounced that \"I alone\" can fix the country's ills (an allegedly fraudulent election system among them). Personality cults enable the spread of propaganda by allowing an autocrat to forge a special bond with followers, one based on faith and emotion rather than reason. Put simply, they believe -- and help amplify -- his lies because they believe in him.\n Indeed, Trump's claims to a unique competence to rescue America got an assist from a cadre of evangelical Christian preachers, authors, and government officials, former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders among them, who contended that he ruled by divine benediction -- that God installed him to do His will. This encouraged followers to believe that Trump's destiny was to stay in office, priming them for the moment when Trump's asserted that a second term was rightfully his.\n The events of January 6 cannot be understood without this structure of blind belief and all the small lies that supported it. For his supporters, Trump was a victim of the \"Deep State\" and other enemies -- his reelection had been foiled by their treachery, so it was up to his believers to fight back, to fix a rigged system with the only tool left: direct action.\n The Big Lie seemed convincing because Trump had been lying about American elections for years. He started drumming up suspicion about rigged elections in 2016, when it looked like he would lose to Hillary Clinton. The ensuing four years of relentless propaganda aimed to erase all confidence in this fundamental institution of democracy.\n It's not surprising that Trump's lying had a dramatic uptick in 2020, when he was campaigning for reelection during a pandemic that he mismanaged with lethal results. He needed to discredit the main thing that threatened his power -- the vote. He worked overtime to throw doubt on every single aspect of voting. He told lies about dead people voting, about fraudulent mail-in ballots, about votes illegally counted, not counted at all, or invented.\n In his January 6 speech, he falsely accused Democrats of pulling \"suitcases of ballots out from under a table.\" He lied that the news media had declared Biden the winner even though \"they still don't have any idea what the votes are.\"\n Focusing only on the Big Lie misses the big picture. It fails to convey the scope and gravity of the institutionalized lying that was Trump's biggest weapon. And it obscures the way minds were worn down, day after day, by one lie after another after another. Trump's aim in his ceaseless lying was to get his followers to trust him alone as the arbiter of reality and to distrust everyone and everything else -- especially the democratic system that stood in the way of his amassing sufficient power to become untouchable.\n It's the authoritarian way. While Trump is now gone from the White House, millions of his supporters still cling fiercely to his lies. Each lie deserves our attention as we seek to combat the mass disinformation that threatens our democracy.",

        "title": "Could Trump derail his impeachment trial?",
        "body_text": "Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on \"CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\" on weekends.\nOnce again, Donald Trump has thrown the legal and political system into uncharted waters. This time, the novel question is this: Can the US Senate try and convict a former president? While there is some disagreement among legal scholars, the answer must be yes, both as a matter of law and common sense.\n The issue already has caused a split within the Republican Party. Several Republican senators have come out against trying a former president, while Sen. Mitt Romney and a group of former Republican officials and lawyers have taken the contrary position. Democrats appear to be united in favor of trying the former President.\n First and foremost: This has happened before. On March 2, 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned under political pressure after a House committee uncovered evidence of corruption. Later that day, the House impeached him on charges of \"criminally disregarding his duty as Secretary of War and basely prostituting his high office to his lust for private gain.\"\n The Senate held Belknap's impeachment trial in August 1876 (and ultimately acquitted him).  Granted, Belknap was a non-presidential official, but that distinction carries no particular legal or logical significance. And of course, 1876 was a long time ago -- but the legal principle is the same.\n Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig, a leading proponent of the argument that a former president cannot be impeached or tried, has argued (in largely conclusory fashion) that \"the Senate's only power under the Constitution is to convict -- or not -- an incumbent president.\" But I believe that Luttig is wrong. Article I of the Constitution specifically empowers the Senate to do two separate things: remove a convicted official from his position and disqualify an official from holding future federal office. The latter punishment still could apply to a former officeholder like Trump.\n Indeed, it would defy common sense if the Senate were powerless to hold a former president accountable through impeachment and trial. If that were the case, the end days of any president's term could devolve into a zero-consequence free-for-all, once it became impracticable for the Senate to complete an impeachment proceeding before the natural end of tenure on January 20.\n And if the Senate actually were powerless to impeach or try an official who has left office, then the constitutional disqualification power would be rendered effectively moot. Any official facing near-certain conviction could simply resign from office before the Senate impeached him and imposed the disqualification penalty, and then run for office again at will.\n But the merits of the argument about whether a former president can be impeached and tried are only the starting point. Things get really messy when we consider how a legal challenge might play out.\n First and foremost, who might formally decide the issue? It seems clear that if the Senate itself decides, the trial will go forward, given that Democrats currently control the Senate (and at least one Republican, Sen. Romney, agrees with their position).\n But Trump himself, or perhaps a group of Republican senators, could try to appeal the issue to the federal courts. If that happens, then the first question is, which court gets the case first? It seems unlikely that the case could go directly to the US Supreme Court, which has \"original jurisdiction\" only over disputes involving two or more states or cases involving ambassadors or other \"public ministers.\" Neither applies here.\n In the fastest-moving scenario, the case could start in the federal district (trial-level) court and skip the intermediate court of appeals under an obscure rule that allows direct appeal to the Supreme Court. The rule applies only if the court decides that \"the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice\" and \"require(s) immediate determination.\"\n In that situation, time would be tight. The substantive portion of the Senate trial is set to begin in two weeks, on February 9. Even if a legal challenge reaches the courts tomorrow, it would be a tight squeeze to get resolution before February 9. And if Trump (or another party raising a challenge) files a lawsuit even closer to February 9, things get even more difficult. If a lawsuit is pending on February 9, does the Senate hold off and await a court decision? Or does the Senate plow ahead in the absence of a final ruling?\n Beyond the complications of a timing issue lies the difficult question of whether the federal courts would even agree to rule on the case at all. On one hand, the issue is of monumental importance, and the Constitution itself is ambiguous enough to call out for a definitive ruling. On the other hand, federal courts tend to avoid ruling on what they deem \"political questions,\" preferring instead to leave such issues to political actors in other branches of government.\n Keep an eye on this dispute. Its resolution could complicate, or even derail, Trump's upcoming impeachment trial. But if the Senate -- and potentially the courts -- reach the proper conclusion, Trump's trial will proceed and a clear message will be sent: Abuse of power, even during a president's final days in office, simply cannot be tolerated.\n Now, your questions:\n Yes. The Article of Impeachment voted by the House of Representatives focuses primarily on the Capitol insurrection of January 6. But it also specifically encompasses the events leading up to the insurrection, including Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" enough votes to swing the state's election outcome to Trump.\n Consistent with that allegation, the House impeachment managers could decide to introduce as evidence recent revelations about Trump's effort to pressure Justice Department officials to assist in his effort to overturn the results of the Georgia election. The argument would be that Trump's pressure campaign on DOJ was part and parcel of his larger effort to steal the election as a whole, which inevitably culminated with the January 6 Capitol attack.\n President Biden has used his power to issue executive orders aggressively during his first days in office to enact new policies relating to immigration, environmental policy and other issues.\n The new president's power to reverse or rescind a prior president's executive orders is broad but not unlimited. The Supreme Court addressed this precise issue in its 2020 ruling on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was created by executive order by President Barack Obama in 2012. Trump tried to rescind the program, but the court blocked his effort, holding that, while a president has broad authority to rescind executive orders or to issue new ones, the president's action cannot be \"arbitrary and capricious.\" That means, essentially, that there must be some minimal, reasonable process and consideration of policy objectives. The legal bar isn't high, but it's also not a free-for-all.",

        "body_text": "For the first time in 25 years, the distinctive vocals of South Korean superstar Kim Kwang-seok will be heard on national television singing new material.\n It's a feat made all the more extraordinary because the famous folk singer is dead.\n National broadcaster SBS plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to bring Kim's voice back to life on a new program, \"Competition of the Century: AI vs Human,\" to air later this week.\n It's not the first time AI has been used to revive a famous singer in South Korea.\n In December, music channel Mnet aired \"One More Time,\" a show that used AI and holograms of late artists to pay tribute to their work.\n And, on New Year's Eve, K-Pop superstars BTS performed online with an AI version of singer Shin Hae-chul, who died after surgery in 2014.\n Recent AI performances have excited fans of their music and the technology, but others have raised concerns about the ethics and legalities of resurrecting the voices of the dead. The creation of new works -- or revived voices -- by AI also raises copyright issues. Who is considered the owner? The creator of the AI program or the AI system itself?\n Kim was aged just 31 when he died in 1996 at the peak of his career after a string of hits including \"A Letter From a Private,\" \"Song of My Life\" and \"In the Wilderness.\"\n His death was considered to be so shocking that some have never accepted the official cause of suicide, instead choosing to believe conspiracy theories that he was murdered.\n Decades later, fans still gather in a street named in his honor near his childhood home in the city of Daegu, though this year's tributes were mostly held online due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n Murals of the artist gaze over the street, where tourists sit on benches shaped like guitars and listen to musicians playing his greatest hits.\n So, when national broadcaster SBS announced that it was using AI to recreate the Kim's voice on a new program set to air this month, it sent fans into a frenzy.\n \"The recovered voice sounds very much alike him, as if Kim recorded it alive,\" said Kim Jou-yeon, a Kim fan for 30 years.\n It even impressed a young fan Park Hye-hyun, who was just two years old when Kim died. \"One of my wishes was to hear more songs in Kim's voice ... I had tears,\" she said.\n SBS Producer Nam Sang-moon said the idea for an AI versus human competition came to him after he watched world champion Lee Se-dol take on South Korean AI program HanDol in the ancient strategy game of Go in 2019.\n Surprisingly, Lee won one of their three matches.\n Just a month earlier, Lee had announced his retirement from professional Go competition, saying AI was \"an entity that cannot be defeated.\"\n Go requires two players to place black and white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Each competitor tries to claim the most territory by surrounding their opponent's pieces so they're removed from the board.\n Lee's game against HanDol reminded Nam of Lee's earlier match against AlphaGo, an AI program developed by Google DeepMind, in 2016. That time, AlphaGo won four out of five games, and afterward Lee said he had \"misjudged\" the machine's capabilities.\n \"Lee-AlphaGo was a big shock followed by short but huge interest in AI, which is still being developed somewhere, but we're unfamiliar with it yet,\" SBS producer Nam said in a phone interview.\n Nam sensed the Korean public was ready for an update and began pulling together the six-part AI competition series, including the AI performance from the late Kim Kwang-seok.\n The audio AI company behind Kim's reincarnated voice is Supertone, a South Korean startup founded in 2020 that provides AI audio solutions for content creators, according to co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Choi Hee-doo.\n \"For example, BTS is really busy these days, and it'd be unfortunate if they can't participate in content due to lack of time. So, if BTS uses our technology when making games or audiobooks or dubbing an animation, for instance, they wouldn't necessarily have to record in person,\" Choi said.\n Supertone's Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) technology learns voices by listening to multiple songs with corresponding notes and lyrics, Choi explained.\n The system learned 100 songs by 20 singers before it was given 10 Kim Kwang-seok songs to learn. It now knows his voice well enough to mimic the singer's unique style and pronunciation, Choi said.\n In the SBS show, the AI Kim won't be competing against a human singer -- he'll be singing a duet with one. \"We revived Kim Kwang-seok to show the capability of it,\" said Nam, the show's producer.\n Instead, Ock Joo-hyun, the former leader singer of girl band Fin.K.L, will be taking on the AI machine. Just as the AI system learned Kim's voice, it will be trained to mimic her, too.\n While some may consider a competition between an AI singer and a human as harmless fun, others warn the technology poses threats that need to be addressed by stricter guidelines and regulations.\n Tech-savvy South Korea is considered to be at the forefront of AI technology, but there are calls for more regulation.\n Within days of the launch of a petition last week, more than 376,000 people had put their signature to calls for tougher punishments for the creators of deepfake videos, particularly those that use the faces of female celebrities for pornography.\n Amsterdam-based researchers Deeptrace counted more than 14,000 deepfake videos online in 2019, and found that almost all of them -- 96% -- were non-consensual deepfake pornography using the images of female celebrities, many from South Korea.\n Replicating someone's voice also poses serious risks, especially if fake audio is used in misinformation campaigns and fraud.  In 2019, scammers convinced an executive to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to an account, by faking the voice of his boss using audio software.\n \"Every year, we see about $470 million in fraud losses, including from wire transfer and phone scams. It's a massive scale,\" Vijay Balasubramaniyan, the CEO and co-founder of Pindrop, told CNN last year.\n Worldwide, nations and organizations are calling for legal reform, ethical guidelines and social agreements to prevent the misuse of AI.\n UNESCO is working with its 193 member states to lay the ethical foundations for regulating the technology. Last September, it released a draft of its \"Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence.\" The final report is expected to be presented to the UNESCO's General Conference later this year.\n In December, South Korea's Ministry of Science and Information, Communication Technology released the \"National AI Ethical Guideline,\"  a document that lays out basic standards for people involved in the development and application of AI. It says AI should be \"developed and used in accord with its purpose and intention as a tool for human life, and that process should also be ethical.\"\n Supertone's Chief Technology Officer Heo Hoon said he supports laws to regulate the industry. He said to mitigate the current risks the company doesn't deal directly with the public, preferring to work with businesses that share its ethics.\n \"We are clearly aware of the possibility of our technology being misused when in hands of the public,\" Heo said. \"I think reviving the voice of the deceased would bring backlash, which hopefully would begin a social debate and conclusively lead to legislation.\"\n The company has built a level of protection into its recordings by marking the audio as being produced by its AI, though casual listeners are unlikely to know.\n \"We have watermarking technology, which is an information planted in audio, that can't be heard, but tracks where it was made and how it's being distributed,\" Heo said.\n The use of AI to create works traditionally produced by human creativity raises the issue of ownership. If AI creates the works, does the program hold the copyright, or does it belong to the programmer?\n Lawyer Ko Hwan-kyoung, an expert in AI and data protection, said the issue needs to be addressed as AI becomes more advanced.\n \"What's interesting about AI is that it's evolving to a level where it can write and compose by studying datas,\" Ko said.\n Last year, singer Hayeon released \"Eyes on You,\" a single composed by an AI program.  Human producers later refined the song, according to her record label, Enterarts.\n Elsewhere, AI has been used to create news stories, books and even art. Typically, the creator is considered to own the work, but in the case of AI it's less clear.\n \"Are we going to acknowledge AI as legal entity with legal personality like humans, and grant copyright?\" Ko, the lawyer, asked. \"We need necessary regulation that guarantees human safety, not an excessive one that hinders development of AI technology.\"\n In the case of  Kim Kwang-seok, producer Nam said SBS gained the consent of Kim's family to reproduce his voice before proceeding with the show.\n SBS paid a one-off fee to his family for featuring his voice in the show, as they did with other cast members, Nam said. Parts of the show will be published on YouTube after it airs, but neither SBS nor Supertone plan to release Kim's song as a single.\n \"We've agreed not to officially release the songs introduced in the show,\" Supertone's Choi said.\n So for now, Kim fans will have to be content with playing the old songs recorded by the real singer at a microphone more than 20 years ago.\n Son Somi in Seoul also contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Monday evening he was extremely worried by former President Donald Trump's dangerous April suggestion that ingesting disinfectant could possibly be used to treat Covid-19.\n \"I just said, 'Oh my goodness gracious.' I could just see what's going to happen,\" Fauci told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"Out Front\" of Trump's suggestion.\n \"You're going to have people who hear that from the President and they're going to start doing dangerous and foolish things, which is the reason why, immediately, those of us who were not there said, 'This is something you should not do.' Be very explicit. The (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) came out, I think, the next day and put in one of their publications, 'Do not do this.'\"\n At an April White House news conference, Trump had mused about whether disinfectants could be used to treat the virus in humans -- asking whether there is \"a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.\"\n He later falsely claimed he was being sarcastic and that he was prompting officials to look into the effect of disinfectant on hands -- not through ingestion or injection. But the comments prompted cleaning product companies and state health officials to issue warnings about the dangers of their ingestion.\n And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said at the time that his state fielded hundreds of calls from people across Maryland asking whether injecting or ingesting disinfectants was an effective way to combat coronavirus.\n Fauci recalled Monday evening that Trump had been getting a mix of \"good information and bad information\" on the pandemic.\n \"Unfortunately, the concept of anecdotal as opposed to science-driven information seemed to prevail,\" he said. \"I took no great pleasure out of contradicting the President, but I had to get out just to maintain my own integrity, but also to stand up for science that the data did not show what they were claiming.\"\n As a result of his willingness to openly refute Trump, Fauci has faced numerous threats to his personal safety -- something he says has given him a look at \"the depth of the divisiveness\" in the US.\n This includes \"somebody sending me an envelope with powder that explodes in my face to scare me and my family,\" Fauci said Monday. And while the substance turned out to be a harmless powder, Fauci explained, \"My children were very, very distraught by that.\"\n \"And that's more painful to me than somebody -- some jerk -- threatening my life,\" he said.\n The US Capitol insurrection earlier this month, Fauci assessed, was that same divisiveness \"in its ultimate.\"\n \"It's purely a reflection of divisiveness that is so deep that it's disturbing. And to me as a person who, you know, I don't want to seem melodramatic, who loves our country, I just see that as being nothing but destructive and it's very scary,\" he said.\n Fauci's comments Monday evening build on his openness in recent days to talk about his rocky relationship with the last administration.\n At the White House last week, he touted President Joe Biden's approach to the pandemic, explaining: \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is -- let the science speak. It is somewhat of a liberating feeling.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information Monday.",

        "title": "Covid-19 masks: Which mask is best for you, and when to use it",
        "body_text": "Think of masks as the newest trendy accessory that can save your life -- and the lives of those you love.\n But instead of what pattern, logo or slogan you display, choose your mask based on its effectiveness against the deadly coronavirus in the environment you are in.\n Guidelines on how to help you make that choice should be out by midspring, according to Jonathan Szalajda, deputy director at the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, which is part of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Working closely with government agencies, industry stakeholders and ASTM International, an international technical standards organization, the standards will apply to filter efficiency, sizing and fit, cleaning and recommended period of use or reuse.\n For now, here's a breakdown of respirators and masks based on current scientific knowledge, and what experts are saying on how to best use them.\n Made from fibers woven with an electrical charge that can trap errant particles -- like a sock that sticks to your pants in the dryer -- studies have shown N95-type respirators are currently at the top of the line when it comes to filtering large and small particles. Masks in this category are also known as \"filtering facepiece respirators\" or \"disposable respirators.\"\n What would happen if every American wore an N95-type mask for four weeks in risky settings like being indoors?\n \"It would stop the epidemic,\" Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n N95 respirators come in many sizes to accommodate various face shapes. When fitted to the wearer's face and worn properly, N95-type masks can trap 95% of particles around 0.3 microns, studies have shown. SARS CoV-2 can be as small as 0.1 micron in diameter -- that's about 4 millionths of an inch.\n While it may seem that N95 filters would miss the tiny Covid particles, that's not so. Most bits of virus exit the lungs encased inside larger respiratory droplets, typically much bigger than 0.3 microns.\n Even those that become aerosolized are easily captured. Due to a natural phenomenon called Brownian motion, such minute particles don't travel in straight lines. Instead they bounce around in a zigzag fashion and are easily caught in the N95's electrostatic filter.\n While some experts are calling for a nationwide rollout of N95 masks, such masks are currently reserved for health care professionals on the front lines of caring for Covid-19 patients. That's partly due to a shortage of such masks, which are designed to be worn once and discarded, but also due to the training needed to fit and wear the mask properly.\n \"In a health care setting, there's an advantage because there's a degree of sophisticated training to inform people how to properly wear respirators which doesn't exist in a public setting,\" NPPTL's Szalajda said.\n According to the CDC, a few other respirators also meet or exceed the 95% efficacy level: the N99, N100, R95, R99, R100, P95, P99 and P100 masks. Some of these devices -- which can look like gas masks -- have received an emergency use authorization and can be used in nonsurgical settings during shortages of N95 masks.\n The N95 mask -- and its sisters and brothers -- is best fitted to a person's unique facial contours on a bare face to keep the seal tight. Then the mask must be worn properly, despite the fact that such high filtration can make breathing more difficult. N95-type masks have a much higher breathing resistance than simple surgical or fabric masks.\n \"I've seen people with a full beard wearing the N95, or they're wearing the 95 upside down,  or they just have it over their mouth and not their nose and mouth because it's easier to breathe when you're not covering your nose,\" Szalajda said.\n Note: Beware of N95 masks with exhalation valves in them, since those valves put your airflow back into the environment. Also beware of knockoff N95s being sold on the internet and at some commercial stores.\n The CDC's NIOSH lists dozens of counterfeit masks being sold as N95 or NIOSH-approved masks on its website, and offers the following advice on how to be sure you are not buying a fraudulent product:\n NIOSH-approved respirators carry an approval label on or within the packaging of the respirator and on the mask itself.NIOSH-approved respirators will always have one of the following designations: N95, N99, N100, R95, R99, R100, P95, P99 or P100.You can verify the approval number on the agency's equipment list or trusted-source page to determine if the respirator has been approved by NIOSH.\n In response to the spread of new, more contagious variants of the coronavirus, some European countries are mandating the use of FFP1 and FFP2 masks -- which stand for \"filtering facepiece respirator.\"\n Note: The \"P\" means the mask is strongly resistant to oil and can be used to protect against nonoily and oily aerosols. In comparison, the \"N\" on N95 means the mask is not resistant to oil and can't be used in an oil droplet environment (such as drilling for oil).\n An FFP1 filter has a minimum filtration efficiency of 80%, an FFP2 is 94% effective and a FFP3 is 99% effective against airborne infectious diseases.\n Last week the German state of Bavaria mandated that citizens use FFP2 masks when shopping in stores and traveling on public transport. The German government then followed that lead, requiring everyone in the country to wear either FFP1 or FFP2 masks while at work, in shops or traveling on public transport.\n France is also requiring citizens to leave homemade masks behind. Now single-use surgical FFP1 masks and more protective FFP2 filtering facepiece respirators are required in all public places. France is also allowing people to use commercial fabric masks certified to filter 90% of particles greater than or equal to 3 microns. Citizens are told to look for the \"filtration guarantee\" logo when buying such masks.\n The KN95 masks, which are certified via Chinese standards, also filter out and capture 95% of 0.3 micron particles. But there are differences: Filter layers of N95 respirators were \"8-fold thicker and had 2-fold higher dipole charge density than that of KN95 respirators,\" a study published in December found.\n These KN95 masks are not certified by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, but a few manufacturers of KN95 masks have been given emergency use approval to be used in health care settings in the US.\n The company 3M, which makes many filtering facepiece respirators, put out a document comparing N95 and European FFP2 respirators to the Chinese KN95, the Australia-New Zealand P2, the Korean 1st Class and the Japanese DS2 and found all of them \"similar\" in regard to \"filtering non-oil-based particles such as those resulting from wildfires, PM (small particle) 2.5 air pollution, volcanic eruptions, or bioaerosols (e.g. viruses).\n \"However, prior to selecting a respirator,\" the 3M document said, \"users should consult their local respiratory protection regulations and requirements or check with their local public health authorities for selection guidance.\"\n Designed to be used by surgeons and other health care professionals, surgical-grade masks are loose-fitting, disposable devices meant to \"help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose,\" according to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n They do not \"filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures,\" the FDA stressed.\n \"Surgical masks weren't meant to perform the functions of the respirator,\" said NPPTL's Szalajda. \"They're not intended to be protection from inhalation particles but from contact with body fluids.\"\n True medical-grade masks are made of three layers of nonwoven fabric typically made from plastic. The colored top layer of fabric is made of medical-grade spunbond polypropylene, which is a resin polymer heat-bonded into a weblike structure.\n Surgical masks are one-time use only, and if they are soiled or breathing becomes difficult, the mask should be carefully discarded and replaced, the FDA said.\n The most common mask in use among the general public today is a fabric mask, often homemade. Effectiveness depends on the type of fabric used and the number of layers of cloth. These masks can be as little as 26% effective.\n According to the CDC, \"multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts have demonstrated superior performance compared to single layers of cloth with lower thread counts, in some cases filtering nearly 50% of fine particles less than 1 micron.\"\n That's good news -- studies have detected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in aerosols between 1 and 4 microns.\n A study published last September examined the ability of cotton, polyester and silk to repeal moisture when used in masks or as mask inserts.\n \"We found that silk face coverings repelled droplets in spray tests as well as disposable single-use surgical masks,\" the authors wrote, adding that silk masks \"can be more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are re-useable via cleaning.\"\n Whatever the fabric, look for a tight weave, according to studies. Use the light test to check the weave: If you can easily see the outline of the individual fibers when you hold up the mask to the light, it's not likely to be effective.\n You can also add filters to your fabric mask, according to the CDC. Some are made from polypropylene, the plastic that produces static cling; others from silver or copper, which have antimicrobial properties. Studies on the effectiveness of inserts, however, are rare, so guidance is limited.\n To up their odds, people have begun layering fabric masks over surgical ones for added protection.\n President Joseph R. Biden has been seen wearing two masks on numerous occasions. On Inauguration Day, Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten Glezman, took a selfie double-masking and inaugural poet Amanda Gorman wore a surgical mask beneath her Prada version.\n It's a behavior advocated by Joseph Allen, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the school's Healthy Buildings program.\n \"A surgical mask with a cloth mask on top of it can get you over 91% removal efficiency for particles,\" Allen recently told Dr. Gupta's team.\n It makes good sense to double mask, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, now chief medical adviser to Biden.\n \"If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective and that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N95.\" Fauci told NBC's Savannah Guthrie.\n But pay attention to fit on any mask, Allen told CNN last fall. \"You want the mask to go over the bridge of the nose, below the chin and be flush on the face, resting along the skin.\"\n Certain items fail to provide a sufficient barrier against Covid-19 and other viruses and should not be worn as a means of significant protection, according to the CDC.\n Don't wear scarfs or knitted ski masks as a protective measure, the CDC says. Do not wear a face shield without a mask, the agency advises, as it won't protect against tiny airborne droplets that can float under and inside the shield. And forget bandanas and neck gaiters.\n A 2020 study by Duke University looked at 14 commonly available face coverings. Not surprisingly, the fitted N95 was judged most effective, followed by three-layer surgical masks. But the study found folded bandanas, knitted masks and neck gaiters did not offer much protection at all.\n In fact, gaiter masks, also known as neck fleeces, actually increased the transmission of respiratory droplets.\n CNN's Keri Enriquez and Eliza Mackintosh contributed to this story.",

        "title": "What Rob Portman's retirement *really* tells us",
        "body_text": "Nothing in American politics happens in a vacuum.\n That includes the surprise retirement announcement by Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman on Monday.\n Portman's retirement is rightly understood as simply the latest piece of evidence that being a so-called establishment Republican -- or, really -- anything but a die-hard Trump Republican -- is no fun at all.\n \"Congress is no place for a sensible Republican anymore,\" tweeted Brendan Buck, a former top aide to speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, in the wake of the Portman news.\n It's hard to argue against Buck's point. In October 2020, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who, like Portman, had developed a reputation in the Senate as a pragmatist, announced he wouldn't run again in 2022. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, who is the very picture of country-club Republicanism, is also not running for another term next November.\n And that series of retirement decisions follows several years of House Republicans walking away from Washington. As David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report, a handicapping tipsheet, noted way back in July 2020:\n \"Fact: when President Trump took office in January 2017, there were 241 Republicans in the House. Since then, 115 (48%) have either retired, resigned, been defeated or are retiring in 2020.\"\n It's not hard to connect the dots. And just in case you can't, well, Portman did.\n \"I don't think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,\" he said in his retirement announcement.\n Put yourself in Portman's shoes. He just spent four years under a Republican president with whom he disagreed on, well, a whole lot. And now, if he ran again, he would face the very real possibility of a Trump-backed primary challenge -- maybe from Rep. Jim Jordan -- that even if he won would have damaged him politically.\n And for what? A party that is barely recognizable from the one Portman has served in for much of the past three decades.",

        "title": "Why the Supreme Court didn't want to hear the Trump emoluments cases and what it means going forward",
        "body_text": "Early in the Trump administration, a novel dispute arose concerning whether the President had violated the Constitution by illegally profiting from his business ventures while in public office.\n It triggered a fierce debate about a provision of the Constitution that most lawyers knew little about and laymen couldn't pronounce: The Emoluments Clause.\n But on Monday, with President Donald Trump no longer in office, the dispute fizzled. That's because the Supreme Court dismissed the two cases in front of it and wiped away appeals court opinions that went against the former President because he is no longer in office.\n The court's action raises the question of how the justices will deal with a myriad of other lawsuits and disputes concerning the now-former President, and whether Trump's side may prevail simply because he ran out the clock and courts allowed him to do so.\n One emoluments case was originally brought by lawyers for Washington, DC, and Maryland, who argued Trump violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign and domestic governments through the Trump International Hotel. Another was brought by various members of the hospitality industry who own or work in hotels and restaurants who argued they were also at a competitive disadvantage because Trump had not used a blind trust when he assumed the presidency but instead continued to retain an interest in his businesses.\n In dismissing the lawsuits Monday, no justice noted a dissent suggesting they all believed that there was no case or controversy remaining because Trump is no longer in office.\n Although the case at hand died and appeals court opinions that went against the President were vacated, DC Attorney General Karl Racine, who was behind one of the challenges, said all was not lost for his side.\n \"Our lawsuit demonstrated for the first time that the Emoluments Clauses, centuries-old anti-corruption protections embedded in the Constitution, can be enforced and that those clauses mean federal officials cannot accept anything of value from foreign or domestic governments,\" Racine said.\n \"The Supreme Court's decision,\" he added, which wiped away an appeals court opinion, \"did not disturb the landmark district court decisions establishing this critical precedent.\"\n But still, subpoenas that would have gone forward to explore some of Trump's financial dealings will now not go forward.\n That will come as a relief for some federal judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals who dissented months ago when the lawsuit was allowed to proceed calling it a \"litigative assault upon this and future presidents.\"\n Whether the judge, J. Harvie Wilkinson, was correct, is now an open question waiting for a similar dispute that may never come.\n The justices haven't acted yet on a case concerning whether Trump violated the First Amendment back in 2017 when he blocked followers from his Twitter account. Just before leaving office, Trump's Justice Department argued the dispute should be considered moot and a lower court opinion that went against Trump should be wiped away under the same legal doctrine the court cited in vacating the emoluments cases.\n But John Elwood of Arnold & Porter, who argues frequently before the Supreme Court, suggested in his own Twitter feed that even without Trump in office (or even on Twitter at this point), the court may choose not to vacate a lower court opinion that went against Trump because President Joe Biden also has a personal account. Elwood suggested that there may still be a case or controversy in play as it impacts other government officials and that the justices may leave the lower court opinion that went against Trump on the books.\n \"Given unsettled questions, [there] may be some reluctance to let [the] Executive Branch eliminate adverse precedent,\" Elwood tweeted.\n Future presidents, of course, will likely have Twitter and other social media accounts.\n Katie Fallow, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute that sued Trump, also said that the case was moot. But she made that argument based on the fact that Trump's \"repeated violations\" of Twitter's terms of service led the company to eventually shut down his account. She told the justices in a filing that they should not vacate the appeals court decision.\n \"Here, the public interest in preventing impermissible viewpoint discrimination in government-operated social media accounts weighs heavily in favor of keeping the Second Circuit's judgment in place,\" Fallow wrote in court papers.\n The court also didn't act Monday on cases concerning Trump policies dealing with immigration and abortion referrals, among other issues. Those fall into a different category, because the Biden administration may rescind the rules and regulations at hand.\n But a high-profile case the justices have been sitting on since October deals with an issue that is critical to Trump. His personal lawyers asked the justices to put on hold a lower court opinion that allowed a subpoena for his tax records to go forward in an investigation being run by a New York prosecutor. The justices have so far said nothing, and now, Trump is no longer in the White House. The court could have acted while Trump was President, but chose not to do so.\n Did Trump successfully run out the clock? He may have outrun one clock, but the justices are well aware of something else. The Manhattan prosecutor may ultimately prevail in his objective of obtaining the documents, now that Trump is simply an ordinary citizen.",

        "title": "Biden lifts transgender military ban",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden signed an executive order to repeal a Trump-era ban on most transgender\u00a0Americans joining the\u00a0military on Monday alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n \"This is reinstating a position that the previous commanders and, as well as the secretaries, have supported. And what I'm doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform,\" Biden said, speaking from the Oval Office just before signing the executive order.\n President Donald Trump's ban has been rebuked by the Democrat-led House of Representatives and condemned by LGBTQ activists as discriminatory. Austin voiced his support for overturning the ban in his Senate confirmation hearing last week.\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that cases in which transgender service members were discharged from the military because of their gender identity would be reexamined.\n \"No one will be separated or\u00a0discharged from the military or\u00a0denied reenlistment on the basis\u00a0of gender identity, and for\u00a0those transgender service members who were\u00a0discharged or separated because of gender\u00a0identity, their cases will be\u00a0reexamined,\" Psaki said during a White House briefing.\n \"President Biden believes gender\u00a0identity should not be a bar to\u00a0military service and that\u00a0America's strength is found in\u00a0its diversity,\" Psaki said. \"America is stronger around the\u00a0world when it is inclusive.\"\n Biden had a meeting late Monday morning with Austin, Vice President Kamala Harris and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, according to the White House. Later on Monday, Harris ceremonially swore in Austin as Defense secretary in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.\n Harris and Austin are the first two Black people to hold their respective positions, and their joint appearance underscores the record diversity of Biden's administration. Austin is the first Black secretary of defense, and Harris is the first Black vice president, as well as the first woman and first South Asian to hold the position.\n Austin addressed the ban in his confirmation hearing on Friday and told the Senate Armed Services Committee: \"I truly believe, senator, that as I said in my opening statement, that if you're fit and you're qualified to serve and you can maintain the standards, you should be allowed to serve.\"\n He was confirmed by the Senate later that day, after being granted a congressional waiver to serve in his post because he was assuming the post before waiting seven years after active-duty service. Austin was the second member of Biden's Cabinet to be confirmed by the Senate, following Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.\n Trump\u00a0first announced\u00a0the ban on Twitter in July 2017, arguing transgender people in the military would lead to \"tremendous medical costs and disruption.\"\n The policy, later officially released\u00a0by then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis in 2018, blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from serving with limited exceptions. The policy specifies individuals without the condition can serve, but only if they do so according to the sex they were assigned at birth.\n Trump's ban reversed a policy initially approved by the Defense Department under former President Barack Obama, which was still under final review, that would have allowed transgender individuals to openly serve in the military.\n The\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0allowed Trump's transgender military ban to go into effect in January 2019. The House of Representatives passed a resolution in March of that year expressing opposition to Trump's ban, describing it as discriminatory and saying it was based on \"flawed scientific and medical claims.\"\n \"We're thrilled that the Biden administration has moved forward to place this garbage policy into the dustbin of history,\" Sasha Buchert, a transgender military veteran and senior attorney at LGBTQ legal advocacy group Lambda Legal, told CNN on Monday.\n Human Rights Campaign president Alphonso David praised Biden's move.\n \"The greatest military in the world will again value readiness over bias, and qualifications over discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n CNN's Arlette Saenz and Donald Judd contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Stimulus checks, unemployment and more: Here's the aid that's coming from Washington -- and what might be coming soon",
        "body_text": "There's lots of talk of all the federal assistance going to Americans and small businesses in need. But while some is already approved, not all of it is out the door yet -- and some of it is still just at the proposal stage.\n What's already in many people's bank accounts or on the way is money from the $900 billion relief deal Congress passed in December. It included a new round of stimulus checks, beefed-up unemployment benefits, additional housing and nutrition assistance and money to fight the coronavirus.\n President Joe Biden signed executive orders last week that will further augment food benefits, ensure more eligible Americans get their stimulus payments, provide protections for federal workers, and extend housing and student loan payment relief.\n But Biden is pushing Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion package with even more funding for those measures -- including $1,400 in additional stimulus cash -- as well as other provisions to help needy Americans. Some Democrats want his package to be even more generous, while Republicans are balking at the increased spending. It's not clear when a deal might get done or what a final version will look like.\n Here's what you can expect to see, and when.\n Lawmakers agreed last month to send $600 stimulus checks to individuals earning less than $75,000 a year and double that to married couples making less than $150,000 annually. They are also getting $600 per child under the age of 17. The payments phase out for people making more money.\n More than 100 millions Americans have already received the payments via direct deposit, as of January 8, according to the Internal Revenue Service's most recent data. The payments started going out on December 29 and were scheduled to continue being sent through January 15. Those eligible who don't automatically receive the money will have to claim it on their 2020 tax returns, according to the agency.\n The President also wants to help those who never got the original $1,200 checks that Congress approved last spring. He signed an executive order Friday that directs the Treasury Department to consider taking a series of actions to reach the estimated 8 million people who may miss out on their stimulus payments because they don't normally file taxes.\n Meanwhile, Biden wants to send Americans an additional $1,400, for a total of $2,000, as part of his massive relief package. The new payments would also go to adult dependents who were left out of the earlier rounds, like some children over the age of 17.\n However, it will be a while before anyone sees those funds -- if they ever do. The plan must first make its way through Congress, where opposition is already forming.\n Laid-off workers will receive $300 weekly boosts to their jobless payments through mid-March, thanks to Congress' December package.\n The deal also extended two key pandemic jobless programs -- providing 11 more weeks of payments to freelancers, independent contractors, the self-employed and certain people affected by the pandemic, as well as to those who exhausted their regular state benefits.\n Many states have already implemented these provisions, though some are continuing to program the changes into their systems. Those who exhausted their benefits before the end of December typically have to wait the longest to restart receiving payments.\n As part of his relief proposal, Biden wants to increase the federal enhancement to $400 a week and extend it and the pandemic programs through September.\n Congress extended eviction protection until the end of this month and provided $25 billion in rental assistance for individuals who lost their sources of income during the pandemic.\n The President took action on his first day in office to help struggling homeowners and renters. He signed an executive order that called on several federal departments and agencies to extend their bans on evictions and foreclosures for those affected by the coronavirus until at least the end of March.\n Biden's relief proposal calls for giving an additional $25 billion in rental assistance to low- and moderate-income households. Another $5 billion would be set aside to help struggling renters pay their utility bills. Biden is also calling for $5 billion to help states and localities assist those at risk of experiencing homelessness.\n The plan would extend the federal eviction moratorium to September 30, as well as allow people with federally guaranteed mortgages to apply for forbearance until that date.\n The December deal raised SNAP benefits by 15% for six months but did not expand eligibility for food stamps.\n It also expanded the Pandemic-EBT program to families with children under age 6 who receive food stamps, deeming them \"enrolled\" in child care and eligible for benefits. The program provides money to low-income families in lieu of the free and reduced-price meals that children would have received in school.\n The package sent $400 million to food banks and food pantries through The Emergency Food Assistance Program. And it provided $175 million for nutrition services for seniors, such as Meals on Wheels, and $13 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which serves more than 700,000 older Americans monthly.\n As part of his $1.9 trillion plan, Biden would extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits through September, instead of having it expire in June. He would invest another $3 billion to help women, infants and children secure food, and would give US territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. And he would partner with restaurants to provide food to needy Americans and jobs to laid-off restaurant workers.\n Biden took action to bolster nutrition assistance in his first week in office. He signed an executive order Friday calling for the Department of Agriculture to consider enhancing Pandemic-EBT benefits by 15%, which would give a family with three children more than $100 in additional support every two months.\n Also, the order directs the department to consider allowing states to boost food stamp benefits for about 12 million Americans who did not benefit from an earlier increase in emergency allotments included in the congressional relief packages. The order would bump up benefits for a family of four by 15% to 20% per month.\n Congress' package did not extend the paid sick and family leave benefits that lawmakers had approved in March.\n Biden's relief proposal would reinstate that provision, which expired at the end of last year, until September 30. Also, it would broaden the benefits to workers excluded from the original program, including those employed at businesses with more than 500 employees and fewer than 50, as well as federal workers who didn't qualify.\n Also, he is calling for people who are sick or quarantining, or caring for children whose schools are closed, to receive 14 weeks of paid leave. The government would reimburse employers with fewer than 500 workers for the full cost of providing the leave.\n As part of his $1.9 trillion plan, Biden would boost the child tax credit to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those between ages 6 and 17 for a year. The credit could be paid monthly and would be made fully refundable.\n Democratic lawmakers have already started drafting legislation on this measure.\n The President also proposes raising the maximum earned income tax credit for a year to nearly $1,500 for childless adults, increasing the income limit for the credit to about $21,000 and broadening the age range of eligibility to cover older workers.\n And he is calling for expanding the child care tax credit for one year so that families will get back as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13.\n One of the executive orders Biden signed on his first day directed the Department of Education to extend the suspension of federal student loan payments and interest. Borrowers will not have to make payments until October 1 at the earliest, extending the already unprecedented pause on payments by eight months.\n In December, Congress reopened the Paycheck Protection Program so that some of the hardest-hit small businesses can apply for second loans.\n The government restarted approving loans on January 11 and made 60,000 during the first week, when it provided exclusive access to small lenders in underserved communities that had trouble accessing the program last year.\n The second loans are limited to those with fewer than 300 employees that have seen drops of at least 25% of their revenue during the first, second or third quarter of 2020. The amount a borrower can receive is reduced from $10 million to $2 million, but businesses have more flexibility on how they can spend the money. Lawmakers also simplified the forgiveness process for loans under $150,000.\n Congress carved out $12 billion for minority-owned businesses and expanded eligibility to more nonprofits, as well as local newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters.\n Biden's package would provide $15 billion to create a new grant program for small business owners, separate from the Paycheck Protection Program.\n He also proposes investing $35 billion in some state, local, tribal and nonprofit financing programs that make low-interest loans and provide venture capital to entrepreneurs.\n Among the most controversial measures in Biden's $1.9 trillion plan is his call to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and to end the tipped minimum wage and the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities.\n He's already started laying the groundwork for this in the federal government. His executive order on Friday sets the stage for requiring contractors to pay a $15 hourly minimum wage and to provide emergency paid leave by the end of his first 100 days. It also directs agencies to determine which federal workers are earning less than that minimum and develop recommendations to promote bringing them up to $15 an hour.\n Currently, the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.\n CNN's Katie Lobosco and Anna Bahney contributed to this story.",

        "title": "What to do, and not do, before and after your Covid vaccine shot",
        "body_text": "It's an all-out sprint to get Americans vaccinated against the deadly novel coronavirus. As you prepare to get your shot, here are 10 actions experts suggest doing -- and avoiding.\n Social media is rife with disinformation about both Covid-19 and the vaccines that are available to prevent it.\n If you have doubts about the vaccine, get educated -- the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is just one of many trusted organizations with vetted, science-based facts about the virus and available vaccines.\n Reinfection with Covid-19 is definitively possible, the CDC says, so everyone needs to get a coronavirus vaccination, including those who have already had the illness.\n If you have tested positive for Covid-19 or been exposed to someone who has the illness, you should not go to the vaccination site to get your shot until your symptoms and isolation period have passed, said Dr. Michael Ison, a professor in the division of infectious diseases and organ transplantation at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.\n \"Quite simply, you don't want to get people who are waiting in line sick. You don't want to get the health care staff sick,\" Ison said.\n A growing number of people are becoming coronavirus \"long-haulers\" -- people who continue to suffer fatigue, brain fog, aches, pains, headaches and more for months after the virus has left their systems.\n \"We think long-haul symptoms are not due to active virus infection, but to prolonged inflammatory responses to the virus,\" Hotez said.\n Wait at least 14 days before or after getting another vaccine, including a flu or shingles shot, to get a Covid-19 vaccination, the CDC says.\n However, if you inadvertently did get another vaccine within that two-week time frame, you should complete the Covid-19 series on schedule. As more information on how vaccines interact becomes available, the CDC says it may update this guidance.\n It's rare, but a few people have had moderate-to-severe allergic reactions after being given the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines, so be sure to tell the nurse at the vaccination site about any past allergic reactions.\n The CDC requires that everyone receiving a coronavirus vaccination wait 15 minutes in their car before driving away. If you have a history of severe allergic reactions, you'll be required to wait 30 minutes in your car to be sure you're safe to drive. Both are a minor inconvenience, experts say, compared to the dangers of an adverse reaction of dizziness or worse while driving.\n If you have a serious reaction after leaving the vaccination site call 911, the CDC suggests. All reactions can be reported to a smartphone-based app called V-safe or the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS.\n Common reactions to the vaccine are soreness and swelling at the injection site. Sometimes, more typically after the second shot, people may experience such Covid-like signs as fever, fatigue, headache and chills.\n Getting a second shot of the vaccine is needed to be sure that you have protection, according to Baylor's Hotez.\n \"In looking at the Phase 1, Phase 2 data, what I saw with a single dose is some people had high levels of virus-neutralizing antibody, others were nonresponders,\" he said. \"So the major reason for the second dose is to get everybody to respond. If you just get a single dose, you don't really know where you stand.\"\n Pfizer-BioNTech doses should be given 21 days apart, the CDC says, while the second dose of Moderna is administered 28 days after the first. Do not get your second dose early, but if you have trouble scheduling, waiting a few days after the due date -- and perhaps longer -- for either vaccine should not be an issue, the CDC says.\n Continue to wear your masks and practice appropriate social distancing after both your first and second doses of vaccine, the CDC says. The first dose will not produce enough of an immune response to protect you or others. The second dose should provide approximately 95% protection within one to two weeks after administration, depending on the vaccine.\n However, the CDC says, even after you are fully vaccinated you may still be a silent carrier of the coronavirus.\n \"We ... don't yet know whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to other people,\" the CDC says.\n So to protect others, continue to wear a mask over your nose and mouth, stay at least 6 feet away from others, avoid crowds and crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, and wash your hands often for at least 20 full seconds.\n CNN's Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden's authority is on the line already in first full week of presidency",
        "body_text": "As his first full week in the White House begins, Joe Biden already faces critical early tests of a presidency premised on political compromise and uniting Washington to fight the pandemic.\n The President's team Sunday appealed for two things that may ultimately be elusive: time to stand up an aggressive attempt to finally turn around the Covid-19 nightmare and Republican buy-in for his $1.9 trillion economic relief plan.\n In the week ahead, Biden is expected to unleash a new blitz of executive actions to deliver momentum to his new administration -- on Monday, for instance, removing the ban on transgender people serving in the military.\n The President plans to move aggressively later in the week, taking steps to boost US workers, address racial inequality and combat climate change.\n But true, lasting change and the nation's hopes of finally overcoming the pandemic will rely on Biden's ability to leverage years of experience to forge common ground in the scorched earth of the capital.\n The task gets tougher by the day, partly due to the unprecedented challenge of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, which will begin in two weeks. The Republican Party is tearing itself apart in the post-Trump era, narrowing political space for GOP lawmakers who might think about helping a new Democratic President in a time of crisis. And on the Sunday talk shows, there appeared to be much less appetite for compromise among rival lawmakers than in the Oval Office.\n It's a tough reality that Biden, who follows a President who often ignored the coronavirus crisis, is already parrying questions about whether his vow to deliver 100 million vaccine doses in 100 days is sufficiently ambitious.\n But it's a measure of the desperation in the country, with normal life an increasingly distant memory, amid worrying new warnings about more infectious and possibly more deadly viral strains.\n Xavier Becerra, Biden's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, on Sunday addressed tension between the President's push for urgent action to fight Covid-19 and the fact it will take months for improvements to show.\n \"I believe President Biden is making it very clear, the plane is in a nosedive, and we have got to pull it up. And you aren't going to do that overnight. But we're going to pull it up,\" Becerra said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on a day when the US death toll of the out-of-control disaster approached 420,000.\n Speaking to Dana Bash, Becerra was unable to answer the question everyone wants to know: how much longer will it be until sufficient supplies of vaccines bring the days of social distancing to an end? Already, hopes of deliverance for the country by early summer look premature.\n White House chief of staff Ron Klain defended Biden's 100 million target \u2014 which means only 50 million people will be fully vaccinated, given the two-dose regimen, during the period in question \u2014 as \"a very bold and ambitious goal.\"\n And he tried to clear up confusion of the administration's own making after the government's top infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, contradicted claims by anonymous White House sources that the new administration had to start from \"scratch\" on a vaccine distribution plan after being left nothing by Trump.\n \"As everyone in America has seen \u2014 the way in which people get vaccine is chaotic, it's very limited,\" Klain told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n Stepping up the White House effort to swiftly pass the pandemic rescue bill, Brian Deese, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, hosted a call with as many as 16 senators Sunday afternoon. Eight Democrats and eight Republicans were invited in a core group of power players who will be crucial to Biden's ambitions of bipartisan action on many fronts.\n There was strong agreement on the need to push hard on money for vaccine distribution, Jared Bernstein, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN's Pamela Brown on \"Newsroom\" Sunday.\n \"That doesn't mean everybody is going to agree on every detail,\" Bernstein said, before billing Biden \u2014 who served in the Senate for more than three decades \u2014 as the key cog in the process in the coming days.\n \"Joe Biden has a long history with working on those types of negotiations.\"\n The extent of the new President's task was made clear when Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the GOP senators seen as open to compromise, appeared to raise questions about the speed and the size of the economic rescue bid.\n \"How has the first $900 billion we just passed a couple weeks ago, how has that been distributed? Most of it hasn't yet,\" Romney said on \"State of the Union.\"\n \"It's important we don't borrow hundreds of billions, actually trillions of dollars from the Chinese for things that are not absolutely necessary. This is a time to act with prudence and care.\"\n GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement on Sunday evening that she, too, had reservations about the Biden plan and wanted it to be better targeted.\n \"It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope,\" Collins said.\n Given the urgency of the situation, Democrats are already prepping a plan to use a rare and controversial procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans try to block it or water it down. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told donors on a Thursday Zoom call that she was ready to pass the bill in two weeks using the tactic, a source told CNN.\n The problem with using reconciliation to pass the bill with narrow Democratic majorities is that it could scupper Biden's hopes of a bipartisan plan and set back his longer-term plans for defusing the poison in Washington. But the search for support from Republicans could also force the new President to dilute his ambitions for the Covid-relief measure and make it less successful \u2014 a serious consideration at the start of a presidency that will be defined by his capacity to end the pandemic and restore the economy.\n The willingness of some Republicans to demonstrate good faith to Biden's overtures is also in question. Several top members of Congress have already accused him of trashing his own calls for unity in his inaugural address by taking executive orders like rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting construction of Trump's border wall.\n Such objections, however, reflect a disregard for the results of the election. Biden won a clear victory in the Electoral College and amassed seven million more votes than Trump, so he can claim a mandate for his early actions.\n The mood between the parties is hardly being improved by an increasingly tense spat between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, over how the 50-50 chamber will operate.\n Biden's aspirations are challenged by an extraordinary confluence of political forces boiling in his first few days in office, all of which were in evidence on a clarifying weekend that predicted the year's political themes.\n House Democrats will deliver the sole article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Monday, alleging incitement of insurrection. That will set off a ceremonial process that will culminate in the trial beginning the week of February 8. The more time that passes, the less likely it seems that there will be 17 Republican senators ready to supply the two-thirds majority needed to convict the former President and ban him from future public office.\n \"I think the trial is stupid. I think it's counterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n Rubio is one of the Republicans who faces a new twist of an old dilemma about Trump. Are their political interests best served by voting to punish the former President for inciting an insurrection against Congress and an attempt to steal the election? Or is Trump's power in the party still so strong that they invite a backlash by convicting the former President?\n Rubio is up for reelection in 2022 and is already having to deal with questions about whether he fears a primary challenge from the ex-President's daughter, Ivanka.\n Romney told CNN that he believed Trump's behavior inciting a mob was an impeachable offense. But GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the issue was \"moot\" because he believed it was unconstitutional to try a former President who was impeached -- an emerging argument among GOP lawmakers.\n But one of the Democratic House impeachment managers, Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, said on \"State of the Union\" that Trump must play a price for actions that have no parallel in American history.\n \"It's an extraordinarily heinous presidential crime. And we must move forward,\" said Dean.",

        "body_text": "A federal judge in Texas on Monday asked the Biden administration to clarify its 100-day pause on deportations as he considers a lawsuit to block the moratorium.\n Over the weekend, Texas, which is suing the Biden administration, submitted a Fox News report to the court that cited an internal email instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to \"release them all, immediately.\"\n The Justice Department submitted the correspondence, which originated in the Houston field office, on Monday afternoon. An official appears to notify the workforce about the moratorium announced the previous day, telling them to \"stop all removals\" as of midnight, but that email is later followed by another official calling for the directive to be retracted immediately.\n \"Please direct your supervisors to follow the memorandum issued. Operational guidance is being developed and will be issued in the coming days,\" the email reads, adding: \"Any questions on removals, releases, and/or arrests that we cannot determine fit squarely into the directive will be forwarded up through me to HQ for further discussion and decisions.\"\n Earlier Monday, the Justice Department told the court that some undocumented immigrants with removal orders had been released from custody, but as part of separate litigation relating to Covid-19. The Department of Homeland Security has discretion in who it releases, DOJ added.\n \"There are going to be times that the Department of Homeland Security uses its discretion in manners that Texas disagrees... Texas has different views about immigration policy than the current administration,\" said DOJ attorney Adam Kirschner.\n Judge Drew Tipton asked the DOJ to confirm whether the email, cited by Fox, existed and to turn it over to the court, if so. \"News reports aren't evidence,\" Tipton said.\n The back-and-forth stems from a lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton shortly after President Joe Biden took office, challenging one of Biden's early immigration actions: a pause on deportations.\n In his complaint, Paxton cited an 11th-hour agreement between Texas and the Trump administration that required the DHS to consult with the state before making changes and allowing buy in from states on policy making. Texas says it will incur costs if undocumented immigrants are not removed.\n In a filing over the weekend, the Biden Justice Department pushed back against Paxton's claims, calling the agreements, signed by then-second in command at Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli, \"invalid\" and \"unenforceable.\"\n \"Texas seeks extraordinary relief to enforce an invalid contract that illegitimately purports to assign to the State the federal government's plenary authority over immigration enforcement to states and counties,\" the filing reads.\n \"The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") lacked authority to cede control over federal immigration policy to Texas, and Texas has no power to demand specific performance of that contract in the form of a nationwide temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"),\" it continues.\n The administration also argued that Texas failed to show that it will be harmed by the moratorium and lacks standing.\n The moratorium covers most deportations but excludes individuals who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, have waived rights to remain in the US or who've been determined removable by the acting director, according to an agency memo. The pause is intended to allow time for an internal review.\n In a statement Friday, ICE confirmed it initiated its 100-day pause on deportations, barring exceptions.\n Tipton didn't indicate how he'd rule on the matter and when.\n This story has been updated with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement emails.",

Silver's petition had been pending before the justices for several weeks and they discussed it most recently at their private conference last Friday.\n Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the order.\n In advising the justices to deny the appeal from Silver, a Democrat, former Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall argued that he engaged in \"multiple schemes to use his political positions to enrich himself.\" In one example, the government alleges Silver accepted thousands of dollars from two real estate developers in exchange for taking official action that benefited developers.\n In court papers asking the justices to take up his case, Silver's lawyer argued his conviction \"places every state official at the mercy of federal prosecutors seeking to criminalize lawful political conduct that offends them, with only a jury's speculation about the official's inner thoughts standing between the official and a federal penitentiary.\"\n The former speaker argued that his conviction is invalid because it lacks proof of an \"agreed upon exchange.\"\n \"Every public official risks indictment if they show any favoritism to a donor or a constituent who has taken the official out to lunch,\" Meir Feder, one of Silver's lawyers, told the court.\n Silver, while serving as speaker, also earned outside income as an attorney in private practice as permitted by New York law. He was indicted in 2015, charging that some of his law practice income amounted to bribes in violation of the honest services fraud statute.\n In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled against the government for using vague federal criminals against government officials.\n Silver is currently serving a 78-month prison sentence, which will be followed by two years of supervised release.\n Former President Donald Trump had considered pardoning Silver before leaving office, The New York Times reported.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Google Maps will soon display locations that offer Covid-19 vaccinations, further bolstering awareness of the virus \u2014 and how to avoid it.\n The feature is rolling out in the coming weeks, beginning in four states: Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Google (GOOGL) announced Monday that searches for \"vaccines near me\" have increased five fold since the beginning of the year and it's implementing this feature to ensure it's \"providing locally relevant answers.\"\n The results, which will also be shown in search results in designated information panels, include details about whether an appointment is required, if the vaccine is only available to certain groups and if there's a drive-thru. Google said it's working with \"authoritative sources\" for the information, including local governments and retail pharmacies. Information about vaccine sites will roll out to other states and countries later.\n Confusion about the vaccine is rampant with 60% of Americans saying they don't know when or where to get it, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Vaccine availability in the United States has also been problematic with President Joe Biden urging patience that the rollout will soon be improved. He's ultimately aiming to deliver 100 million doses of the vaccine in his first 100 days iin office.\n It's the latest change to Google Maps in relation to the pandemic. In September, the Maps app began displaying seven-day averages of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people.\n Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also said Monday that the company is donating $100 million in ad grants to CDC Foundation, the World Health Organization and other nonprofits to run \"critical public service health announcements\" about the virus. \"We recognize that getting vaccines to people is a complex problem to solve, and we're committed to doing our part,\" he said.\n Certain parts of Google facilities, including parking lots and open spaces, in California, New York and Washington will also be opened for vaccination efforts and administration. It's the latest corporate conglomerate to help improve the vaccine roll out, with Starbucks (SBUX), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) offering similar efforts in recent weeks.",

As part of a multi-year deal, WWE Network will launch on Peacock on March 18 with more than 17,000 hours of new and old wrestling content.\n WWE Network will be available on Peacock for $4.99 a month, or $9.99 without ads. That price includes access to pay-per-view events such as \"Fastlane,\" \"Summerslam\" and the granddaddy of all wrestling showdowns, \"Wrestlemania.\" WWE fans will also get access to original series.\n This agreement won't impact the shows \"Raw\" on USA Network or \"Smackdown\" on Fox, which have separate deals and will continue to air as usual. But fans who want to stream WWE Network content in the US will have to get a Peacock subscription. The WWE Network will continue to operate on its own overseas.\n NBCUniversal wouldn't reveal the exact length of the deal or financial details, but the Wall Street Journal reported it's a five-year contract \"valued at more than $1 billion.\"\n Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal and WWE (WWE) will \"share details on managing customer accounts\" for current WWE Network subscribers closer to the Peacock launch in March.\n \"NBCUniversal has a long-standing relationship with WWE that began nearly 30 years ago with Monday Night Raw on USA,\"  Rick Cordella, Peacock's executive vice president and chief revenue officer, said in a statement. \"WWE has always tapped into the cultural zeitgeist with spectacular live events and larger-than-life characters, and we are thrilled to be the exclusive home for WWE Network.\"\n The deal is significant for Peacock because the WWE boasts an incredibly loyal fan base and two highly rated shows with \"Raw and Smackdown.\" NBC is hoping the the news will entice wrestling fans will jump over to Peacock, which launched this summer.\n The deal also further solidifies Peacock's reputation as a streaming service for live sports \u2014 or in the WWE's case, sports entertainment.\n Meanwhile, NBC Sports announced on Friday that it will shut down its sports cable channel, NBC Sports Network, and that Peacock will carry some of that programming starting in 2022. Peacock currently airs many Premier League soccer games and other sports content.",

        "body_text": "A GOP Ohio lawmaker who asked a racist question last year about whether \"the colored population\" was contracting Covid-19 at higher rates because of poor hygiene has been tapped to lead the state Senate's health panel.\n State Sen. Stephen Huffman was appointed by Senate President Matt Huffman, his cousin, this month to the position on the committee that reviews legislation about health care and human services despite a racist exchange with a Black health expert in June.\n \"I understand African Americans have a higher incidence of chronic conditions and that makes them more susceptible to death from Covid. But why does it not make them more susceptible just to get Covid?\" Huffman had asked during the testimony.\n \"Could it just be that African Americans or the colored population do not wash their hands as well as other groups? Or wear a mask? Or do not socially distance themselves? Could that be the explanation for why the higher incidence?\"\n The witness at the hearing where Huffman asked the question, Angela Dawson, who serves as the executive director of the Ohio Commission on Minority Health, quickly dismissed his assertion, saying emphatically: \"That is not the opinion of leading medical experts in this country.\"\n After a firestorm around his comments, Huffman apologized.\n News of Huffman's appointment to the the Ohio Senate's health panel drew swift rebukes from lawmakers across the state.\n State Rep. Catherine Ingram, a Democrat, said Huffman's \"racist and problematic remarks\" shows he is unfit to chair a committee that impacts Black residents and called for his appointment to immediately be rescinded.\n \"Sen. Huffman has shown he is unable to view the health concerns of Black Ohioans in an unbiased and fact-based manner, therefore leaving him unqualified to serve as committee chair,\" Ingram wrote in a statement last week. \"Serving as chair would give the senator the ability to decide which bills make it to the floor and potentially codify racial prejudice into law.\"\n Tony Bishop, executive director of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, said Thursday the group demands a committee leader who \"understands and can help enact health policy that addresses inequities in our state without political influence.\" And if the Senate's leadership will not replace Huffman as chairman, they expect him \"to use his position to improve the health of Ohio's African American population\" by working with the caucus to pass legislation that address health disparities in the state.\n \"Although the senator's comments were deeply offensive, we hope that he has learned from his mistake and moves to right the systemic wrongs that are being perpetrated in the state of Ohio,\" Bishop told The Columbus Dispatch.\n \"As one of the few doctors in the legislature, I'm proud to (be) named chair of the Ohio Senate Health Committee,\" Huffman said in a statement to CNN when asked about calls for his appointment to be rescinded and his message to Black constituents who are concerned about his appointment in light of his past remarks.\n \"I'm also proud of my decades of work treating people in communities of color. In our state's effort to help understand why Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting African Americans, more than seven months ago, I asked an awkwardly worded question that unfortunately hurt many people,\" Huffman said. \"I immediately apologized and have been working to heal any harm caused. Over the last several months I've participated in classes on diversity and inclusion and I've discussed this issue with my African American colleagues in the legislature as well as African American healthcare leaders in my district to identify ways the medical community can better help underserved populations.\n \"Covid-19 is killing Ohioans and I will focus the efforts of the Senate Health Committee on how to protect everyone, of every race, from the deadly effects of this pandemic.\"\n John Fortney, press secretary and senior communications adviser for the Ohio Senate Majority Caucus, told CNN in a statement Monday that Huffman is \"a medical doctor and highly qualified\" to chair the committee.\n \"He has a long record of providing healthcare to minority neighborhoods and has joined multiple mission trips at his own expense to treat those from disadvantaged countries,\" Fortney said. \"He apologized months ago for asking a clumsy and awkwardly worded question. Sincere apologies deserve sincere forgiveness, and not the perpetual politically weaponized judgement of the cancel culture.\"\n TeamHealth, a hospital management firm that employed Huffman as a part-time physician, confirmed in June that Huffman had been fired from that position.\n \"Dr. Huffman's comments are wholly inconsistent with our values and commitment to creating a tolerant and diverse workplace,\" a spokesman for TeamHealth said in a statement.\n This story has been updated to include a statement from Huffman.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Twitter on Monday launched Birdwatch, an experiment that relies on the social network's users to provide context to tweets and to combat misinformation.\n The tool, which Twitter (TWTR) described as a community-driven pilot project, allows participating users in the United States to create \"notes\" for a given tweet that will exist for now on a separate part of Twitter's website. Notes that contribute to a consensus on whether a post is misleading may \"eventually\" be shown directly on tweets, the company said in a blog post.\n Twitter did not say, however, whether tweets that receive notes may lead to removal or other consequences; the intent behind the tool, it said, is for users to be able to respond quickly to a fast-spreading claim.\n Birdwatch's approach flips Twitter's existing model of moderation, in which Twitter itself labels content. It also places more power (or burden, potentially) in the hands of users, much in the way Wikipedia or reddit are platforms whose communities are self-governed by users.\n Twitter users have played a role before in flagging potentially problematic tweets to the company, but this move makes users even more involved in the content moderation process.\n \"We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying,\" Twitter VP of Product Keith Coleman said in the blog post.\n To participate in the project, users must first register with Birdwatch, have a verified email address and phone number with a \"trusted\" US wireless carrier, and have a Twitter record free of policy violations. Data generated by the pilot project will be shared with researchers, the company said.\n NBC News and Fox News were first to report Birdwatch's launch.\n A permanent shift to user-driven content moderation would be a significant pivot for Twitter. The company acknowledged Monday that it could raise thorny questions about how to ensure the new system is not abused by malicious actors.\n Birdwatch plans to address those concerns, at least initially, with a ranking system for contextual notes. If a note has received enough ratings indicating it is helpful, it may be displayed at the top of the list, Twitter said.\n Twitter added that its pilot project follows interviews with more than 100 users who expressed interest in a more nuanced way to evaluate tweets.\n But while other platforms appear to have developed thriving systems for community governance in the past, there are also key differences. Reddit, for example, is organized into sub-communities that are each moderated by volunteer administrators who can establish group rules and enforce them by directly removing content.\n Wikipedia, meanwhile, keeps track of changes to its encyclopedia articles; while occasionally rogue users can make unauthorized edits to a page, those changes are often quickly rolled back to a prior version.\n It is less clear how Twitter plans to address instances of abuse, including potential efforts by some users to flag accurate tweets as misleading or by overloading a notes thread with misinformation.\n \"We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this \u2014 from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn't dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors,\" Coleman wrote. \"We'll be focused on these things throughout the pilot.\"",

        "title": "Former Trump officials and other GOP lawyers urge senators to 'consider the evidence' in impeachment trial",
        "body_text": "With the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump set to begin in February, nine prominent Republican lawyers, including two former officials in the Trump administration, have signed a letter urging GOP senators to \"consider the evidence\" before deciding how to vote on conviction.\n The letter, obtained by CNN and organized by the nonprofit Republicans for the Rule of Law, is addressed to Republican senators and calls the impeachment article passed by the House a \"grave accusation\" and says the trial is \"not the time for petty, partisan politics.\"\n \"We urge every Senator to consider the evidence presented by the House without prejudice or political tint, and with an open mind,\" reads the letter. \"We particularly urge that, if the evidence supports a vote to convict the former president and disqualify him from future office, no Senator let partisan or electoral considerations alter that conclusion.\"\n Among the signatories are former Trump officials John Mitnick, former general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, and Robert B. Shanks, the general counsel for the Peace Corps from 2017 to 2020 and a former Justice Department official under President Ronald Reagan.\n Mitnick was fired in 2019 after pushing back on a White House proposal to release undocumented immigrants into sanctuary cities.\n \"For national security and the rule of law, it is necessary that former President Trump be held accountable for inciting the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol, the aim of which was to prevent the Congress from carrying out its constitutional function to count the votes of the Electoral College,\" Mitnick told CNN.\n Both Mitnick and Shanks say they support convicting Trump. Last October, they both endorsed Joe Biden for President in a statement organized by the anti-Trump group Defending Democracy Together and signed by over 70 former lawmakers and national security officials in past Republican administrations.\n The letter does not take a position on whether Trump should be convicted. Republicans for the Rule of Law is run by Republican operative Sarah Longwell and former Weekly Standard editor William Kristol. The group is affiliated with Defending Democracy Together and has advocated for positions in opposition to Trump, including running TV ads during the previous impeachment investigation calling on Republicans to seek out the facts.\n \"I think that for me, at least, the importance of this letter is to try to make the point that we are at a seminal moment in American history,\" Shanks told CNN. \"No President has ever tried through force, threat of force, intimidation, to prevent a free and fair election from being consummated. It just demands consequences.\"\n Many of the lawyers who signed the letter served under previous Republican presidents, and several are members of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal organization.\n Among the names are former Justice Department officials Charles Fried (under Reagan), Donald Ayer and Stuart Gerson (under George H.W. Bush), and Peter Keisler (under George W. Bush); former George W. Bush Homeland Security official Paul Rosenzweig; former Reagan White House lawyer Alan Raul; and Marisa Maleck, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n The letter is the latest example of how influential Republicans are lobbying senators ahead of the impeachment trial. The effort includes multiple former Trump administration officials, donors, former members of Congress, and current and former Capitol Hill aides -- all encouraging Republican senators to vote to convict Trump. A set of talking points circulating among Republicans charges that \"it is difficult to find a more anti-conservative outburst by a U.S. president than Donald Trump the last two months.\"\n For Trump to be convicted, 17 Republican senators would have to join all 50 Democrats. While no Republican has publicly declared their intent to support conviction, several have denounced Trump's actions surrounding the January 6 attack on the Capitol. On the other hand, an increasing number of Senate Republicans have said they oppose convicting Trump, and loyalists to Trump have argued in the conservative media against taking a stand against the former President.\n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, has signaled his openness to vote for conviction.\n In a deal struck Friday between McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the ceremonial functions of the impeachment trial will occur this week, with the articles being presented to the Senate on Monday and senators being sworn in as jurors on Tuesday. Then the trial will pause, while the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial itself to begin.\n Some of the debate among Republicans in the Senate concerns whether it is constitutional to convict a former President who has already left office. Republican senators who have said they will vote to acquit cite a Jan. 12 op-ed in The Washington Post by former federal judge and conservative legal luminary J. Michael Luttig, who writes that an impeachment trial after Trump left office would be unconstitutional.\n \"I think a lot of people would like a reason not to convict,\" said a former Republican Senate staffer.\n But other Republican legal experts are pushing back with GOP senators.\n \"It feels like the weight of the energy in Washington with legal conservatives is pretty strongly in favor of impeachment,\" said Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to the Senate Republican conference who has reached out to senators himself.\n And Mitnick told CNN that he concurs with a recent letter signed by more than 150 constitutional scholars arguing the Senate can convict a former federal official who has been impeached by the House.\n \"Despite the expiration of President Trump's term of office, the Senate may lawfully take up the article of impeachment, try and convict him, and disqualify him from holding future office,\" Mitnick said.\n CNN's Manu Raju contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Biden signs executive order aimed at strengthening American manufacturing",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden signed an executive order Monday aimed at boosting American manufacturing, setting in motion a process to fulfill his campaign pledge to strengthen the federal government's Buy American rules.\n Similar executive orders signed by former President Donald Trump had little effect because his administration waited to formalize changes until his second to last day in office. By contrast, Biden has set a 180-day deadline to deliver on fundamental change to the process, according to an administration official.\n \"I've long said that I don't accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can keep union jobs from growing here in America,\" Biden said at a news conference before signing the order.\n The order follows others Biden signed last week directing additional relief to the neediest Americans, as well as starting the process of raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and workers to $15 an hour.\n The President signed 30 orders in his first three days in office, some of them reversing Trump's policies. Additional orders are expected this week with a series of themed days covering racial equity, climate, health care and immigration.\n The President \"believes we can rebuild the vitality of American manufacturing and our industrial strength. A big piece of that is centered around the idea that when we use taxpayer money to rebuild America, we buy American and we support American jobs,\" the administration official said Sunday on a call with reporters.\n Currently, a patchwork of federal rules requires that a portion of government spending on things like infrastructure, vehicles and other equipment is restricted to goods that are made in the United States. But there are loopholes depending on the material, the amount of the purchase, and what qualifies as American made.\n Biden's executive order will change how domestic content is defined and measured for qualifying products as well as increase the required threshold. It will also create a senior position at the Office of Management and Budget to oversee the process by which contractors can apply for waivers from the Buy American rules, with the goal of reducing the number of waivers granted.\n The administration will also create a public website that will post all waiver requests and direct agencies to proactively connect with small American manufacturers that are often left out of the process.\n The manufacturing sector didn't get the boost Trump repeatedly promised. The number of manufacturing jobs grew during the first two years of his administration -- though at roughly the same pace as they did under President Barack Obama -- but then slowed in 2019 after the boost from the Republican-backed tax cuts wore off and as Trump's China tariffs created uncertainty for businesses.\n The pandemic hit manufacturing hard as the rest of the economy slowed down. The sector is still down 543,000\u00a0jobs since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \"Trump talked about buying American and hiring American a lot, but his executive orders didn't amount to much at all,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.\n \"There's an opening here for Joe Biden to really be a 'Made in America' president,\" he added.\n Paul said he's eager to see Biden close the loopholes in the current federal procurement process as well as follow through on his campaign promise to purchase $400 billion in American-made goods and materials for infrastructure projects.\n Biden's Buy American policy may concern some foreign trading partners. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday that \"it might jeopardize the very strong an integrated supply chains that exist between our two countries.\"\n Many of America's allies were hit with tariffs under the Trump administration. While Biden has also pledged to take a tough stance on trade and crack down on unfair trading practices, he has reiterated a commitment to do so in partnership with America's allies -- unlike his predecessor, who mostly acted unilaterally when it came to imposing tariffs.\n \"We remain very committed to working with partners and allies to modernize international trade rules to make sure that we can use our taxpayer dollars to stir investments in our own countries,\" the Biden administration official said.",

It will be a great way for people to enjoy our area and to have some fun.\"\n The town of Honobia, Oklahoma, already has an annual Bigfoot festival each October, so Humphrey said he is hoping hunting season could coincide with the celebration.\n In addition, Humphrey hopes to secure at least $25,000 that can be used as a bounty for the first person to trap the creature.\n \"Again, the overall goal is to get people to our area to enjoy the natural beauty and to have a great time,\" Humphrey said, \"and if they find Bigfoot while they're at it, well hey, that's just an even bigger prize.\"",

Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in Biden's favor, according to the paper.\n Rosen demanded to hear the news straight from Trump, the Times said, and arranged a meeting on the evening of January 3 -- the same day that Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state official to find enough votes for him to win Georgia, came to light.\n Clark declined to comment for this report.\n Clark is no longer at the department -- which could present a problem for Horowitz if he wants to talk to the lawyer, according to Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general.\n The inspector general \"doesn't have (testimonial) subpoena power for people who are outside of government and so they may run into a little bit of a wall if Clark, for example, decides not to cooperate,\" Bromwich said.\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Horowitz to launch a probe on Saturday, writing in a tweet that it was \"unconscionable a Trump Justice Department leader would conspire to subvert the people's will.\"\n This story has been updated with Clark's response.\n CNN's Caroline Kelly, Zack Cohen and David Shortell contributed to this report.",

Discussions are taking place about deploying thousands of US troops to help with the vaccination efforts, according to four officials familiar with the talks who said a plan could be unveiled by the end of the week.\n The discussions are at an early stage and no decisions have been made yet, the officials cautioned. One official, when pressed for an estimate, said that as many as 10,000 troops could be deployed as part of the effort.\n Such a deployment could start with medical units that have been on standby orders for some time and have deployed in recent months to some of the hardest hit areas, one official said. The clock is already ticking on Biden's first 100 days in office with the goal of delivering 100 million vaccine shots within that timeframe.\n \"It's all about how we can get better involved in the vaccinations,\" another official told CNN. \"Planning efforts are ongoing, but there are no decisions.\"\n It's unclear at this point if the plan would involve the use of active-duty troops, National Guardsmen, or some combination. Any plan will require that an approved request be sent from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to the Department of Defense, a process that takes time.\n \"I think with the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,\" Biden said on Monday. \"But we have to meet that goal of 1 million a day, and everything points that we're going to have a) enough vaccine, b) enough syringes, and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, [and] inject into your arm the vaccine.\"\n Biden also stressed the important of needing more people to administer the vaccine.\n Nationwide, 31 states are already using their National Guard to help administer vaccines, involving 23,000 troops, director of the National Guard Bureau Gen. Daniel Hokanson said Monday.\n \"We stand ready to assist in any way that we can to make sure that we can really help as much as possible. And that's related not only to the state plans but also related to Operation Warp Speed,\" said Hokanson.\n CNN previously reported that 25,000 National Guard troops had been deployed to Washington to provide security for Biden's inauguration and over 5,000 will stay in the city through March.\n In his first message to the military, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin stressed that his top priority was the battle against coronavirus.\n \"Doing my job means helping our country get control of the pandemic, which has killed more than 400,000 Americans. You have already come to the aid of our Nation's health care professionals. You can expect that mission to continue. But we must help the Federal Government move further and faster to eradicate the devastating effects of the coronavirus,\" he wrote on Friday, the day he was confirmed as defense secretary.\n Last week, Biden described the fight against the pandemic as a \"wartime effort\" and vowed to use the Defense Production Act to direct all federal agencies and private industries to produce everything needed to protect Americans from the virus.\n \"Our national plan launches a full-scale wartime effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment, syringes, needles, you name it,\" Biden said. \"And when I say wartime, people kind of look at me like 'wartime?' Well, as I said last night, 400,000 Americans have died. That's more than have died in all of World War II. 400,000. This is a wartime undertaking.\"",

The US Federal Aviation Administration defines an ADIZ as \"a designated area of airspace over land or water within which a country requires the immediate and positive identification, location, and air traffic control of aircraft in the interest of the country's national security.\"\n While the frequency of such drills has increased in recent years, the timing and the composition of the latest formations -- mostly fighter jets and bombers -- appeared intended to send a message to the new administration in Washington.\n Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.\n Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed that Beijing will never allow the island to become independent and has refused to rule out the use of force if necessary.\n In a statement Saturday, the Biden administration urged Beijing to stop trying to intimidate Taiwan and promised support for the democratic government in Taipei.\n \"We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives,\" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said, adding that US-Taiwan ties are deepening and Washington remains committed to the island's self-rule.\n The US showed a strong commitment to Taiwan's defense during the Trump administration, approving the sale of advanced military hardware to Taipei, including F-16 fighter jets, while sending high-level envoys to the island, both moves that angered Beijing.\n In an early show of support from the Biden administration toward the island, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's inauguration last week. It was the first such official invitation to a representative of the Taipei government since 1979, when Washington established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing. On the same day, Beijing announced sanctions against outgoing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other high-ranking officials under Trump, accusing them of \"prejudice and hatred against China.\"\n Besides backing Taiwan, State Department spokesman Price said on Saturday that Washington would also stand with other Indo-Pacific friends and allies, as China ramps up its military activities in the region.\n In a display of that solidarity, a US Navy aircraft carrier strike group entered the South China Sea at the weekend, the first deployment during the Biden administration of one of the 100,000-ton warships with its contingent of more than 60 aircraft.\n A US Navy statement said the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its guided-missile cruiser and destroyer escorts were on a scheduled deployment to uphold freedom of the seas in the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, almost all of which China claims as its sovereign territory.\n \"With two-thirds of the world's trade traveling through this very important region, it is vital that we maintain our presence and continue to promote the rules-based order,\" Rear Adm. Doug Verissimo, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said in a statement.\n But at the close of 2020, China said military movements like that of the Roosevelt strike group inflamed tensions.\n \"Some countries outside the region come from afar to flex their military muscles, ignite confrontations, and create tensions in the South China Sea, which is the root reason for the 'militarization' of this region,\" Defense Ministry spokesperson Senior Col. Tan Kefei said at a regular press briefing.\n Last year, the US Navy sent two of its aircraft carriers, the world's largest warships, into the South China Sea on two occasions for dual exercises, something it had not done in the previous six years.\n Washington also regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, most recently in December. They involve US warships steaming within the 12-nautical mile limit of coastlines that nations can claim as their territorial waters.\n On Friday, Beijing gave another indication of how it can tighten its control over waters it claims in the region, passing a new law that authorizes its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels.\n The law, which takes effect February 1, also allows the coast guard to demolish foreign structures built on Chinese-claimed reefs and islands and for it to set up exclusion zones to keep foreign vessels out.\n The law could not only increase chances of confrontation between China and other South China Sea claimants -- which include Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan -- but also in the East China Sea, where China and Japan contest sovereignty over an island group known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China.\n On its English-language news website on Monday, China's military specifically referred to the Japanese-controlled islands when announcing enactment of the law, with a headline saying it safeguards Beijing's sovereignty over the uninhabited rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo.\n \"The new coastguard law shows China's clear attitude and determination to safeguard its sovereignty,\" the report said, citing Lu Yaodong, a research fellow with the Institute of Japanese Studies under the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n \"Regular patrols near the Diaoyu Islands will be guaranteed by the legislation,\" Lu was quoted as saying.\n Chinese vessels spent record amounts of time in the waters around the islands last year, drawing condemnation from Tokyo. Washington has repeatedly said the islands are covered by the US-Japan mutual defense treaty, which would obligate the US to respond to any Chinese action against Japanese ships there.",

        "title": "Fossilized skull reveals how crested dinosaur got its fancy headgear",
        "body_text": "First discovered in 1922 and best known for its distinctive crest, Parasaurolophus is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs -- a staple of childhood books and a background player in the Jurassic Park movie franchise.\n An exceptionally well-preserved fossilized skull found in New Mexico in 2017 -- the first to be found in 97 years -- has revealed new details about its bizarre Elvis-style pompadour. Its analysis has allowed paleontologists to definitively identify how such a structure grew on this dinosaur.\n \"Imagine your nose growing up your face, three feet behind your head, then turning around to attach above your eyes. Parasaurolophus breathed through eight feet of pipe before oxygen ever reached its head,\" said Terry Gates, a paleontologist from North Carolina State University's department of biological sciences, in a news statement.\n The hollow tube on its head contained an internal network of airways and acted a bit like a trumpet.\n \"Over the past 100 years, ideas for the purpose of the exaggerated tube crest have ranged from snorkels to super sniffers,\" said David Evans, the Temerty chair in vertebrate palaeontology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada.\n \"But after decades of study, we now think these crests functioned primarily as sound resonators and visual displays used to communicate within their own species.\"\n The animal would have lived about 75 million years ago -- a time when North America was divided by a shallow sea and many duck-billed dinosaurs, horned dinosaurs and early tyrannosaurs would have roamed the land.\n \"The preservation of this new skull is spectacular, finally revealing in detail the bones that make up the crest of this amazing dinosaur known by nearly every dinosaur-obsessed kid,\" said Joe Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science and the leader of the team who discovered the specimen.\n The skull belonged to Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus, previously known from a single specimen collected in the same region of New Mexico in 1923 by legendary fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg. It has a shorter, more curved crest than other species of this dinosaur -- although this may be related to its age at death. There are three species of Parasaurolophus currently recognized, with fossils found in New Mexico and Alberta and dating between 77 million and 73.5 million years ago.\n \"It has answered long-standing questions about how the crest is constructed and about the validity of this particular species. For me, this fossil is very exciting,\" said Evans, who has also worked on unraveling the mysteries of this dinosaur for almost two decades.\n The research was published in the journal PeerJ on Monday.",

        "body_text": "Charcoal company Kingsford has created a new fellowship program to honor the contributions Black Americans have made to the legacy of American barbecue and ensure African Americans have a stake in the cuisine's future.\n The Clorox-owned (CLX) charcoal brand calls its new initiative \"Preserve the Pit.\" The program, which launched Monday, is giving aspiring Black barbeque professionals a chance to train and network with some of the top pitmasters in the nation throughout 2021 and receive an undisclosed capital investment to kick-start their business.\n Kingsford says candidates will be chosen based on their connection to the barbecue industry, their contributions to the legacy of Black barbecue and their commitments to its future, among other factors. The company is accepting applications for the program starting Monday and through March 1. The inaugural class will be announced in April.\n For the past several years, Kingsford says it has made efforts to support more diverse talent in the barbecue community, but last year it became clear the company needed to intensify its efforts.\n \"2020 made every company step back and take a deeper look at how they could do more to support the contributions of the Black community, which are so integral to the past, present and future of barbecue,\" Kingsford vice president of strategy and marketing Shaunte Mears-Watkins told CNN Business via email. \"We also wanted to be thoughtful about our approach to ensure that we found a credible role for our support.\"\n Barbecue historian Howard Conyers, chef Kevin Bludso, star of \"The American Barbecue Showdown\" on Netflix and FoodLab executive director Devita Davison will serve as mentors for the program, along with fellow pitmasters Bryan Furman, Rashad Jones and  Amy Mills.\n The 39-year-old Conyers has been in the barbeque business since the age of four, when his father, Harrison Conyers, who worked as a farmer and welder, taught him the traditional, whole-hog barbecuing technique. The elder Conyers had learned it from other Black farmers in their Manning, South Carolina, hometown.\n Howard Conyers is a rocket scientist who worked for NASA after earning his PhD in mechanical engineering from Duke University in 2009. He has spent the last seven years researching the history of Black barbecue, much of which he says has been lost or credited to the White men who owned the plantations, smaller farms and later the restaurants in which Black pitmasters often cooked the food and honed the craft.\n Thirty-six pitmasters have been inducted into the American Royal Association's Barbecue Hall of Fame since it opened in 2012. Only five of them -- Kansas City legend Henry Perry, Memphis restaurateur Desiree Robinson, John \"Big Daddy\" Bishop, C.B. Stubblefield and Chicago's James Lemons -- are Black, even though Conyers says the origins of American barbeque are rooted in American slavery.\n \"Barbecue was perfected at the hands of enslaved Africans for over 350 years in the American South,\" Conyers told CNN Business. \"These individuals weren't able to read and write to tell their own stories. We want to see this barbecue tradition uplifted, celebrated and become more of a central piece in the African-American community.\"",

Their livelihoods were thrown into limbo last year when Hollywood studios were forced to halt production due to the pandemic.\n \"As you know, these workers have been unable to return to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they stand ready to do their part when they are called upon,\"  IATSE President Matthew Loeb wrote in the letter, which the union shared on its Twitter account on Monday.\n IATSE entertainment workers have experience working behind-the-scenes in conference centers, arenas, theaters and other live events venues, he added.\n \"The skills required to convert these facilities are not much different than those required to load in rock and roll concerts and other live events,\" Loeb wrote.\n This is also not the first time the union is offering to lend a hand. In April, Loeb said workers also helped convert facilities into field hospitals to help fight the pandemic.\n \"Together, we have a unique opportunity not only to help beat this virus and save lives, but also to get these skilled union technicians back to work,\" Loeb wrote. \"Let's build back better, together.\"\n Biden said Monday that he expects that the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more vaccinations than its target of 1 million per day in his first 100 days in office\n The key factors in ramping up vaccinations are having enough vaccine, having enough syringes and other necessary equipment and having enough people administering them, Biden said.\n CNN's Anna-Maja Rappard, Maegan Vazquez and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

Investors have a lot on their minds: President Joe Biden's stimulus plan is facing criticism from lawmakers concerned about the deficit, a deluge of corporate earnings is on tap and drug maker Merck (MKGAF) pulled its Covid-19 vaccine plans.\n Meanwhile, various trading platforms appeared to struggle with outages: Vanguard and Charles Schwab (SCHW) acknowledged on Twitter (TWTR) that some users are experiencing problems, while Downdetector also flagged issues for users of Robinhood,  TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade (ETFC).\n And yet the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day at all-time highs, up 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.\n The Dow (INDU) was the odd one out, closing down 0.1%, or 37 points, after falling more than 430 points at its low point.\n \"This risk off [dynamic] isn't worrying me.

        "title": "AMC's CEO believes his movie theaters will survive through 2021",
        "body_text": "Adam Aron is in a surprisingly good mood for a CEO of a struggling theater chain that recently said it might not make it through the winter.\n But the AMC Theatres CEO was jovial because his fortunes recently changed. The world's largest movie theater company announced Monday it had raised $917 million of new equity and debt capital since mid-December. That number would be enough to \"make it through this dark coronavirus-impacted winter,\" the company said.\n Following the news, Aron told CNN Business he believes the new funding \u2014 and more vaccinations on the horizon \u2014 will help AMC (AMC) avoid financial catastrophe this winter and possibly for the rest of 2021 as well.\n \"This is a great day for AMC,\" Aron said.\n Aron spoke with CNN Business about the state of the theater industry and why he believes that moviegoing will make a comeback, even as streaming has become the dominant way people enjoy their entertainment.\n This interview has been edited and condensed.\n Everybody knows a lot of movie theaters in the world are closed. At those theaters that are open, visitation has been light \u2014 partially because of the pandemic and partially because major movie titles have been delayed. And AMC was losing a lot of money. As a result, we needed to raise the money that would give us liquidity to power through this dark coronavirus-impacted winter. And we just did that. We raised enough money that our financial runway has been lengthened deep into 2021.\n What that means is that AMC as a company remains viable, that our theaters will be open for our guests.\n When you look at forecasting our cash needs going forward, it depends on what the levels of the attendance actually are. It depends on how much additional money we raised because we're not done yet. The $917 million figure was as of this weekend, but we're not done yet in raising capital for AMC.\n My sense: We will have enough cash to make it all the way through all of 2021 based on a very detailed set of assumptions, which we've laid out in our various security filings with the SEC.\n That is my current view based on current assumptions and current thinking.\n We've already assumed that moviegoing would be quite light in the first half of 2021, but it's also our assumption that moviegoing will pick up in the second half of 2021. There are a lot of movies that are going to be released this summer, this fall and next winter.\n At the same time, as we all know, a major vaccination program is the underway in the United States and Europe, in the Middle East, where we have theaters. The combination of new movie titles and vaccination should be that the second half is a much stronger moviegoing environment than the first half.\n Well, it's almost impossible to conceive that 2021 could be worse than 2020. Our theaters were shut for most of the year. So, yes, I think 2021 is going to be a stronger year than 2020 and 2022 is going to be a stronger year than 2021.\n There's a critical difference. Vaccination is at hand. Thanks to the miracle of modern medicine, vaccines have been developed for this Coronavirus. There is a broad-based vaccination program underway. The Biden administration in the United States has committed to a hundred million injections in a hundred days. We talked with the most knowledgeable public health officials constantly and what they're telling us is that the world and this country will start to get this virus in better shape tomorrow than it's been yesterday, but that's very encouraging news and that will change the reality of what we can expect in the near future.\n So there was something developed about 70 years ago called television and people have TVs in their homes, and yet they've still been going to movie theaters in enormous numbers... People like going to the movies. People like going to theaters.\n Yes, streaming is around. Yes, some people will watch movies on streaming services instead, but we're very confident that the appeal of cinemas are great. People enjoy the communal experience of laughing together, crying together, howling hard together. And people have written off movie theaters since the creation of radio and then television and then VCRs and then streaming.\n AMC is a hundred years old this year. We believe our second century will be just as bright as our first.\n I know what I'd like to say on New Year's Day of 2022, and that is that we raised the money we needed to survive through the coronavirus pandemic and that moviegoing is back like normal.\n That possibility has certainly been made more likely by the $917 million that we just raised. That is made more likely by a vaccination program that has already started widely in the United States and across the world.\n But this pandemic has been one of uncharted waters and with incredible tosses and turns and no one knows for sure what will happen in 2021. We're all going to learn it together.",

        "body_text": "Tyrannosaurs were fearsome predators in the dinosaur kingdom, but new research shows their hatchlings were about as big as a medium-sized dog.\n Researchers studying the first-known fossils of tyrannosaur embryos suggest the dinosaurs were approximately three feet long when they hatched, according to a study from the University of Edinburgh, published Monday.\n A team of paleontologists studied the fossilized remains of a tyrannosaurus embryo, namely a jaw bone and claw that were found in Canada and the US, respectively.\n After producing 3D scans of the remains, researchers were able to predict that the dinosaurs would have hatched from eggs about 17 inches long.\n Remains of tyrannosaurus eggs have never been found, but this finding could help paleontologists spot them in the future.\n \"Dinosaur babies are very rare,\" lead study author Greg Funston, a paleontologist at the University Edinburgh, told CNN, explaining that larger specimens are better represented in the fossil record because their bones were more durable.\n \"Most dinosaurs didn't nest in an area where their eggs could be easily buried,\" Funston added, making the preservation of this kind of find even rarer. \"It's quite a big deal,\" he said.\n The claw is from an Albertosaurus and the jaw bone from a Daspletosaurus, both of which would have grown to around 35 feet in length.\n They were slightly smaller than their more famous cousin, Tyrannosaurus rex, which grew up to 40 feet in length, Funston said.\n Researchers found the jaw bone, which is just over an inch long, had features distinctive to the tyrannosaur group, including a pronounced chin.\n While tyrannosaurs are known to have undergone many changes over their lifetime, this shows the embryos already had certain physical traits before they hatched, Funston said.\n The discovery could help settle debates over whether other specimens in the fossil record come from new species or younger specimens of known species, he added.\n Tyrannosaurs lived more than 70 million years ago. Little is known about their early development as most specimens that have been studied are from older animals, Funston said, but researchers now know they were born with a full set of teeth and could hunt for themselves, albeit on smaller prey than adults.\n \"These were animals that were hatching and were probably fairly active relatively soon after they hatched,\" Funston said.\n The study was published in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences.\n Funston said he plans to try to produce scans of the remains at a higher resolution, to enable the study of tooth development, which could reveal how long the tyrannosaurs spent inside the eggs before hatching.",

It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.\n\"First look\" photos have long been a memorable moment for couples on their wedding day. The tradition allows the photographer to capture the look on the love birds' faces as they see each other all dressed up for the first time.\n For one Texas couple, this special moment reached a new level of memorability when comedian Dave Chappelle suddenly popped his head out of the doors of the neighboring restaurant.\n Matt and Eleanor McLaughlin were feeling nervous and excited for their socially distanced, intimate wedding at The Line Hotel in Austin earlier this month.\n When it came time for photos, the couple was strategically set in position by their photographer, Anna Szczekutowicz, and ready for the big 'first look' reveal.\n As soon as Matt turned around to see Eleanor, Szczekutowicz snapped her camera, capturing the exact moment Chappelle walked through the doors in a classic photo-bombing pose.\n Because they were on the outdoor patio of a restaurant, the couple was not surprised to hear cheering coming from the diners inside. They hugged and kissed and thought it was a sweet gesture from their audience inside.\n What they didn't realize was that the audience was cheering at the fact that Dave Chappelle had just photo-bombed their first look.\n \"I was just so emotional after finally seeing Matt for the first time on our wedding day,\" Eleanor told CNN. \"Then after I heard all the cheering, I turned and was like, 'Wait you're Dave Chappelle.' It was surreal.\"\n The happy couple thanked him for coming out to say hello and then asked for a real photo with.\n \"He was adamant about keeping a safe distance, so he stayed in the background for the staged photo and was just so cool about everything,\" Eleanor said. \"We took the photo and then he said, 'Best of luck, you guys look great take care!' and then went back inside.\"\n Chappelle revealed last week that he was asymptomatic after testing positive for Covid-19.\n Szczekutowicz said the surprise really helped lift the couple's spirits after downsizing their guests from 150 people to 12.\n \"I could tell they were pretty bummed because it wasn't the day they had long imagined,\" Szczekutowicz told CNN. \"The mood of the day was like, 'I wish we could have had our loved ones here,' so that moment just kind of changed the entire feeling of the day. It was really fun.\"\n This isn't the first time Chappelle has photo-bombed couples on their special day. The comedian surprised an Ohio couple in 2018 during their engagement photos -- and the photos are equally amazing.",

        "body_text": "Pharmaceutical company Merck announced Monday it is discontinuing development of its Covid-19 vaccine candidates after early studies showed immune responses were inferior to natural infection and other Covid-19 vaccines.\n Merck said its vaccine candidates appeared to be safe, but the company did not provide results from early trials. It said in a news release it plans to submit results from Phase 1 trials of its vaccine candidates, known as V590 and V591, for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\n In June, Merck announced it had acquired the company Themis to focus on a measles vector-based coronavirus vaccine candidate. Another candidate, developed with the nonprofit International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, was based on technology used for Merck's Ebola vaccine.\n Demand for Covid-19 vaccines is high, especially as the more contagious variants of the virus begin to spread in some places. There are 64 vaccine candidates in trials worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\n Two Covid-19 vaccines, from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, have already been authorized for emergency use in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration; both are about 95% effective after two doses.\n Johnson & Johnson has said results from large-scale trials of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the month. AstraZeneca's vaccine is already in use in some countries, and may be considered for authorization in the United States in the coming months. Novavax's vaccine is in Phase 3 trials and the company said results are expected as soon as early first quarter of this year.\n Merck said on Monday it is continuing to study and scale-up manufacturing for two potential coronavirus treatments, MK-7110, which may help control the inflammatory response to the virus, and molnupiravir, known as MK-4482, an oral antiviral developed with Ridgeback Bio.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nAs stocks hit record highs, Wall Street banks are getting more and more inquiries about whether the boom, which has some parallels to the dot-com era, will result in a similar bust.\n What's happening: \"We are receiving numerous questions [about] whether a bubble is potentially forming in financial markets,\" Mislav Matejka, JPMorgan's head of global and European equity strategy, said in a note to clients on Monday.\n But the research teams at big banks are hesitant to sound the alarm, pointing to historically low interest rates and the huge sums of cash still being printed by central banks.\n \"Taking into account the yield on Treasuries, corporate credit, or cash, the aggregate stock market index trades at below-average historical valuation,\" Goldman Sachs told clients late Friday.\n The investment bank referenced a column written at the end of November by economist Robert Shiller, who is an expert on bubbles and developed the most famous method for valuing stocks.\n \"With interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds,\" Shiller wrote.\n That doesn't mean there aren't reasons to be wary. Goldman noted that \"pockets of the market have recently appeared to demonstrate investor behavior consistent with bubble-like sentiment.\"\n \"This is not to say that the 'hot' areas of the financial universe might not get much more volatile, and be subject to bouts of profit taking, which could even spread to equities more broadly,\" Matejka wrote.\n Both Goldman and JPMorgan highlighted special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, as one potential problem area. In 2020, 229 US SPACs \u2014 or \"blank check\" funds that investors back while they look for takeover targets \u2014 raised $76 billion, six times more than in 2019, per Goldman. In the first three weeks of 2021, an additional 56 SPACs raised $16 billion.\n JPMorgan also observed that 2020 was the best year for IPOs since the dot-com boom, while those that have made their public market debuts \"have recorded unprecedented gains in a short span of time.\" Matejka called the moves \"startling.\"\n There's no sign that such enthusiasm is settling down. A short-form video app that competes with the Chinese version of TikTok is preparing for what's expected to be the world's largest initial public offering since the pandemic began, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.\n Kuaishou, a tech company based in Beijing, is seeking to raise as much as $6.2 billion in a stock market listing in Hong Kong, according to details of the planned IPO shared with CNN Business by a source familiar with the deal.\n Step back: Big-time investors like Carl Icahn and Jeremy Grantham have expressed anxiety about the state of affairs.\n \"The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble,\" Grantham wrote in a letter earlier this month. \"Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history.\"\n But banks \u2014 while outlining some areas of concern and weakness \u2014 aren't going so far, and think systemic risk remains limited.\n Foreign companies are turning their backs on the United States, taking advantage of China's booming economy and superior management of the Covid-19 pandemic, my CNN Business colleague David Goldman reports.\n The details: Direct investment in the United States by foreign companies plummeted 49% to $134 billion last year, according to a report released Sunday by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By contrast, foreign direct investment in China grew by 4% to $163 billion in 2020.\n 2020 marked the first year in history that foreign direct investment in China topped the United States, the UN said. China is now the world's largest recipient of foreign companies' investments.\n Remember: China's economy grew 2.3% last year while the rest of the world's major economies shrank. The country's ability to control the spread of the virus \"helped stabilize investment after the early lockdown,\" per the report.\n It's worth noting that the drop-off in foreign companies' American investments began well before the pandemic. After hitting a high of $440 billion in 2015, according to the US Commerce Department, foreign investment in the United States has been on a sharp downward slide.\n Former President Donald Trump's go-it-alone trade policies hurt foreign investment \u2014 particularly from China, which represented the sharpest drop in US investment over the past several years. Growing economic uncertainty around the globe has also been a contributing factor.\n An army of day traders coordinating on Reddit has powered shares of video game retailer GameStop (GME) to an all-time high.\n The latest: Stock in GameStop, a legacy company whose stores are often located in struggling malls, skyrocketed 51% on Friday to $65.01. They're up another 41% in premarket trading Monday as investors tout the stock on social media with growing zeal. The value of the stock has more than tripled in the past month.\n Hype around GameStop has jumped since the company added Chewy founder Ryan Cohen, who has been pushing a digital overhaul, to its board. Last week, investors on social media plugged GameStop with increased ferocity as short seller Citron Research outlined the reasons it believed shares would drop to $20.\n Citron said Friday that it will stop commenting on GameStop following the actions of \"an angry mob,\" per Bloomberg.\n \"We are investors who put safety and family first and when we believe this has been compromised, it is our duty to walk away from a stock,\" managing partner Andrew Left wrote in a letter, citing harassment and hacking attempts.\n My read: We've spent the past 10 months talking about how no-fee trading apps like Robinhood are affecting market dynamics \u2014 and this episode provides a clear example.\n It also speaks to what's happening in financial markets more broadly. Day traders, watching a meteoric stock boom despite the pandemic, are convinced that bets like GameStop can pay off. But such moves are, of course, incredibly risky \u2014 and Wall Street points to retail frenzy as an area of major concern when asking if stocks have gone too high, too fast.\n Kimberly-Clark (KMB) reports earnings before US markets open.\n Coming tomorrow: Results from 3M (MMM), American Express (AXP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Verizon (VZ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX).",

        "title": "A rural county in Washington state hasn't wasted a single Covid-19 vaccine dose. Here's its secret",
        "body_text": "A rural county in Washington state is lapping the field when it comes to distribution of the coronavirus vaccine.\n A big part of the reason Kittitas County says it is outpacing the vaccine rates in the state is that it's had a lot of practice in triaging and managing disasters, especially wildfires.\n \"We're a fairly rural county, and we get significant weather events, mostly wildfires,\" said Rich Elliott, the deputy fire chief of Kittitas Valley Fire and Rescue. \"Our county has a 25-year history of just sort of everybody -- the hospital, the school districts, law enforcement, fire agencies, federal state partners -- we just cooperate.\"\n When the coronavirus pandemic started and there was a need for personal protective equipment and testing, groups working with the emergency management center banded together to respond.\n Now the cross-functional team of essential workers and volunteers are working to distribute the vaccine and it's working, says Elliott, who is in charge of vaccine distribution for the county. In fact, he says a single dose hasn't been wasted.\n The story is different across the country. The United States is struggling to get the precious vaccine into arms, with supply issues, logistics challenges, long lines and crashed appointment sites. As of Friday, 16.2 million Americans, about 4.5% of the US population, had received their first dose and about 2.8 million people are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Washington state has distributed more than 335,000 vaccines, which is 48% of the delivered doses given, according to the state's Department of Health Covid-19 dashboard, as of January 18.\n While Kittitas County has given 53% of its current vaccines, the county has vaccine clinics running through this week to deliver a new batch of more than 2,000 vaccines, according to Kittitas Valley Healthcare. With all of the appointments taken, the county estimates having 97% of their doses administered by the end of this week.\n \"The infrastructure that we have with everybody communicating, everybody willing to be flexible and play whatever role's necessary and an understanding of (incident command system) and emergency operation centers gives us the framework to do it,\" Elliott told CNN.\n When you're fighting large fires, you have to act fast and resources can change in a flash, so learning to change plans and stay flexible is part of the job, Elliott said.\n \"In fires, we make do, and you build plans around what you have available, and what the priorities are,\" Elliott said. \"Those change almost daily at wildland fires because the risks change, the weather changes, all of those things are changing, and you get more resources, or you get resources taken away from you.\"\n Shifting resources and changing priorities are similar themes when it comes to fighting the pandemic.\n \"The same thing is true with this Covid,\" Elliott said. \"We need vaccine in people's arms, preferably as close to the priority order as we can get, but this is only going to go away with vaccination and people being respectful of the public health guidelines. And until we get there, the economy is going to be a wreck and people are going to die.\"\n In incident command, Elliott explained how he and others give enough guidance and flexibility for teams to make their own decisions. Give them guidelines and let them \"operate inside the fences,\" he said.\n \"We stress that repeatedly is you're not supposed to tell people how to do your job,\" Elliott said. \"You're supposed to tell them what the objectives are, give them the resources, give them the time frame, and then stay out of their business.\"\n In fighting fires and Covid-19, Elliott says it's important for local leaders to do what they believe is right for their community. If something doesn't pan out right, you have to be willing to accept the consequences, he said.\n \"Don't wait for it to be perfect,\" Elliott said. \"You're not going to get all your answers, you're not going to get every answer to every question. It's incumbent upon leadership at the local level to take reasonable risks.\"\n And when it's possible, make decisions on the local level, he said. Large jurisdictions are just a \"series of smaller units,\" like hospital districts within a large county, he said.\n \"I think we need to trust each other a little bit, give each other a little bit of grace and recognize we're all trying to work towards the same thing,\" Elliott said. \"The more local you can let the decisions be made in that distribution process, the more success you're going to have.\"\n While Elliott has had success in his county, he doesn't want people to think he's got all the answers.\n \"I don't want to sound like we have it all figured out because we don't,\" he said. \"There's nights I'm not sleeping really well.\"\n The county received more than 2,100 doses of the vaccine last week and it has already assigned a name of a person to each one of those valuable vials, Elliott said.\n That may not sound like a lot to someone in a big city, but it's a lot in this county. Located in central Washington, Kittitas County has 48,140 residents, according to the state's Office of Financial Management.\n \"We're over 95% distributed for the vaccine that we have received up until this week,\" Elliott said last week. \"Because we just got a huge shipment of the vaccine, after Friday of next week, we'll be back well over 95%. When I say 95%, the vaccine is either in people's arms or people have a hard date when their appointment is because you have to space the first and second doses out.\"\n Kasey Knutson, a spokeswoman for the Kittitas County Public Health Department, has been letting the public know when vaccine arrives, who is eligible based on the current vaccine phase and how to get appointments. She's also in charge of getting volunteers to help with distribution.\n During phase 1A of vaccine distribution, which included high-risk health care workers, high-risk first responders and residents and staff in nursing homes, the county had extra doses left over, she said.\n On short notice, the emergency management center lined up 102 teachers to come in and get vaccinated, Elliott said.\n The cross-functional team identified teachers, who are in vaccine phase 1B, as a group who would quickly be able to respond, Knutson said. The network for reaching teachers easily already existed through their school systems.\n Some teachers may have been vaccinated earlier than anticipated, but the overall goal was to make sure that some high-priority group got the vaccine, and it didn't go to waste.\n Elliott explained that sometimes there are extra doses with the Pfizer vaccine when it's mixed together, which local pharmacists are preparing in Kittitas County.\n \"You just don't know how many extra doses, so you have to have this flexible pool of people sort of waiting in the wings on 10 minutes notice to get the vaccine,\" Elliott said. \"We did it with teachers.\"\n Spacing out the vaccine doses is important for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which the county is using. The other part involves figuring out the logistics from traffic control and patient flow to paperwork and administering and monitoring vaccinated patients, Knutson said.\n \"We want to make sure that when we get people in for the first shot, that we already have a system in place, and we can guarantee that those folks are going to come back through for the second round,\" Knutson said.\n One of the biggest challenges the county and many around the country face is that people want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, Knutson said. But, vaccination will be a long process.\n She said she's been busy with vetting volunteers and making sure they do everything they can to avoid burning out the staff so the vaccinations can go on. This week, the goal is to distribute 215 vaccine doses a day at two clinics, she said.\n \"We are really aware of how eager people are to get their vaccinations and we want to just guarantee folks that we are effectively getting the vaccine out, that we're not stockpiling it and we're not going to waste the vaccine,\" she said.",

        "body_text": "Puerto Rico is declaring a state of emergency over gender-based violence, delivering on a demand made by activists in recent years after a wave of killings targeting women and transgender people.\n Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who was sworn in earlier this month, announced an executive order aimed at preventing and protecting against gender-based violence through a number of programs, according to a news release from the governor's office on Sunday.\n The state of emergency will be in effect until June 30, 2022, the news release said.\n \"Gender violence is a social evil, based on ignorance and attitudes that cannot have space or tolerance in the Puerto Rico that we aspire to,\" Pierluisi said in a statement. \"For too long vulnerable victims have suffered the consequences of systematic machismo, inequity, discrimination, lack of education, lack of guidance and above all lack of action.\"\n The order is the culmination of years of efforts by activists and advocacy organizations, who have long urged Puerto Rico's government to take action against gender-based violence -- which appears to have worsened after crises such as Hurricane Maria and the coronavirus pandemic.\n At least 60 direct and indirect femicides were reported in Puerto Rico in 2020, according to the local group Gender Equality Observatory. That includes six trans femicides and 26 cases still under investigation or lacking information, the organization said.\n Puerto Rico's police also reported that at least 5,517 women were victims of domestic violence last year.\n Among the initiatives laid out in Pierluisi's executive order is a committee tasked with providing education, support and rescue around gender violence.\n That committee will be comprised of 17 members, three of whom will be representatives from organizations that work on gender violence issues. Committee members will present an initial progress report 45 days after their first meeting and every 30 days after that until the order expires.\n The governor also ordered the development of a mobile app through which victims of gender violence can request emergency help without arousing suspicion from their aggressors.\n A compliance officer will also be appointed to oversee and ensure the order's implementation.\n \"In order to eradicate gender-based violence, we have to make concerted efforts between the state and society where in addition to an inclusive plan, an educational approach also exists to teach our boys and girls that every human being must be respected, as well as empowering our future generations so we can eradicate this evil,\" Pierluisi said.\n The governor's executive order comes just days after Angie Noemi Gonz\u00e1lez, a nurse and mother of three from the town of Barranquitas, was found dead in a ravine, the newspaper El Nuevo Herald reported. Police said that her longtime partner admitted to killing her, the newspaper El Nuevo D\u00eda reported.\n Puerto Rico has long been facing a crisis regarding violence against women.\n A 2012 report from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that Puerto Rico had the highest per capita rate in the world of women over 14 killed by their partners.\n In several cases, women had repeatedly gone to authorities for help and were turned away, the organization reported. Researchers also found that law enforcement agencies largely failed to adequately respond to, record or investigate crimes of rape and sexual assault. And just a fraction of reported cases resulted in conviction, the report stated.\n Pierluisi had promised during his campaign that he would take steps to address the problem.\n Activists and advocacy groups welcomed the governor's order as a step in the right direction, though they said they would be watching to see how it was carried out.\n \"Today our rage carries some hope,\" the organization Colectiva Feminista en Construcci\u00f3n, which has been one of the leading groups pressuring the government to declare a state of emergency, wrote on Facebook. \"Today, as always, our hope is radical. We will not take a step back.\"",

Leaders such as Austin are unique in the fact that he has continuously navigated racial barriers successfully.\"\n At least as meaningful as representation: the kind of action that betters people's lives in a more tangible manner.\n Enter Biden, with his repeal via executive order of the Trump-era ban on transgender people serving in the military.\n True to form, President Donald Trump had announced the ban in a series of tweets in July 2017, saying that transgender people would be prohibited from service \"in any capacity.\"\n The previous administration was known for scaling back hard-fought LGBTQ rights, as has been well documented.\n That Biden was widely expected to reverse the ban didn't diminish the moment's significance.\n \"This is reinstating a position that the previous commanders as well as the secretaries have supported,\" the President said on Monday, shortly before signing the executive order. \"And what I'm doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform.\"\n Biden's words echoed Austin's.\n \"I truly believe, senator, that as I said in my opening statement, if you're fit and you're qualified to serve and you can maintain the standards, you should be allowed to serve,\" Austin said in his confirmation hearing on Friday.\n In November, I argued that Biden's including transgender Americans in his victory address was momentous because the move brought with it the promise of LGBTQ equality under the new administration.\n Already, Biden has started to make good on that promise, offering representation, yes, but also much, much more.",

        "title": "Senate Republicans just took 2 big hits to their 2022 chances",
        "body_text": "Just days into their newfound status as the minority party, Senate Republicans suffered two body blows that could badly complicate their chances of retaking control in 2022.\n The first came Monday morning, with Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's announcement that he would retire in 2022 rather than seek a third term.\n \"This is a tough time to be in public service,\" Portman said in announcing his decision. \"For many of the issues I am most passionate about, I will continue to make a difference outside of the Senate, beyond 2022.\"\n The Portman news comes hard on the heels of a major Republican recruiting setback over the weekend, when Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey told The New York Times he will not challenge Sen. Mark Kelly (D) next November.\n \"I'm not running for the United States Senate,\" Ducey told the Times. \"It's a no. I'm 100 percent focused on being the governor of the state of Arizona. I've accepted the role as the chairman of the [Republican Governors Association]. So I've got a full-time job and then I've got a full-time job beyond that. And that's what my focus is.\"\n Combine the two announcements, and the GOP's quest to retake the majority they lost when Democrats swept both Georgia runoffs earlier this month is off to a decidedly rocky start.\n Let's take Portman first.\n His retirement decision came as an absolute shock to political Washington -- although maybe it shouldn't have given the current state of the Republican Party.\n Portman has been a stalwart member of the GOP establishment for decades. He served in the House from 1993 to 2005 and as the director of the Office of Management and Budget and US Trade Representative during George W. Bush's administration. He ran for Senate in 2010 and won handily; in 2016 he crushed former Gov. Ted Strickland by 19 points in what Democrats had hoped would be a serious race.\n But during the Trump years, Portman's brand of pragmatic conservatism had fallen very much out of favor. And the Ohio Republican's discontent about the state of political affairs is written everywhere in his retirement announcement.\n \"I don't think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,\" said Portman.\n His decision takes a seat that would have likely been of little concern for Republicans -- given Portman's demonstrated electoral successes and the state's clear GOP lean -- and puts it squarely in the potentially competitive category.\n All eyes -- especially those in Washington -- will immediately turn to Rep. Jim Jordan, perhaps the most prominent supporter of ex-President Donald Trump's in the House and someone who would likely have considerable appeal in a Republican primary in the state. There will be plenty of other names mentioned -- Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, to name two -- but much hinges on what Jordan decides.\n If Jordan runs and wins the nomination, the seat becomes more imperiled for Republicans. While Ohio is clearly no longer the swing state that it was in the early 2000s -- Trump beat Joe Biden by 8 points there in 2020 -- there is still a path to Democrats winning statewide, as Sen. Sherrod Brown has proven.\n And that path involves Republicans nominating a candidate that is too far to the ideological right -- allowing the Democratic nominee to co-opt the not-insignificant political center. Which, in theory, is exactly what might happen if Republicans nominate Jordan.\n While there is still lots (and lots) we don't know about how the Ohio seat will shake out, what we do know is that the seat is considerably more vulnerable today than it was yesterday.\n Now to Arizona.\n Kelly's decisive win over appointed Sen. Martha McSally was in a special election last November, meaning that he has to run again for a full six-year term in November 2022. Which is no easy task, especially when you consider how competitive the state is at the federal level. (Biden beat Trump by less than 11,000 votes of out of more than 3.2 million cast.)\n But Kelly is a formidable candidate -- particularly on the fundraising side, where he raked in more than $100 million in 2020. Beating him will be no easy task.\n Especially when you consider that:\n 1) The Republican bench in Arizona is surprisingly thin beyond Ducey.\n 2) The state GOP is at war with itself -- with Trump favorite Kelli Ward being reelected as chair of the state party over the weekend and approving censures of Ducey as well as Cindy McCain.\n The Republican nightmare scenario is if Ward becomes a candidate. Ward ran in a primary against Sen. John McCain in 2016 and challenged then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R) in 2018. (Flake eventually retired and Republicans chose McSally over Ward.)\n Ward, like Jordan in Ohio, would likely start out as the favorite in a Republican primary due to her hard-line support of Trump. \"The Arizona Legislature should DE-CERTIFY the false results of the 2020 election until at which time a full and thorough audit of the vote can be performed,\" the Arizona GOP's official Twitter account tweeted earlier  this month. \"Do it quick. Make Democrats lose their collective minds as they rage against transparency and integrity. Big win for AZ!\"\n But Ward as the Republican nominee against Kelly would be a massive problem for Republicans, likely costing them one of their few offensive opportunities on the 2022 map.\n Yes, it's early to talk about how voters will feel come November 2022. But make no mistake: Portman's retirement and Ducey's no-go decision are twin body blows for Republicans in the Senate already reeling from what happened in Georgia.",

Last year, the company announced plans to cut its portfolio in half and has discontinued brands like Tab and Odwalla to focus on its most powerful ones.\n Coca-Cola first announced the January launch of Coke with Coffee over the summer.

Since then, it has become available in over 30 markets throughout the world, including Australia, Italy and Vietnam.\n Now, it seems Americans are finally ready.\n The company spent about two years testing the latest product in the United States ahead of the launch, said Brandan Strickland, brand director of trademark at Coca-Cola in North America.\n Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Brandan Strickland's title. He is brand director of trademark at Coca-Cola in North America.",

        "title": "Biden avoids contentious issues in call with Mexico's president",
        "body_text": "When President Joe Biden spoke with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Friday, the most controversial issues complicating the relationship between the two countries were not on the agenda.\n It's a sign that Biden is looking to reset his relationship with the Mexican leader who had developed a close personal relationship with former President Donald Trump, sources briefed on the content of the call tell CNN.\n In the months following Biden's election victory, L\u00f3pez Obrador --- known in Mexico as AMLO -- has challenged his new counterpart by talking up the bond he developed with Trump and making controversial policy decisions related to security. It will take a tremendous personal commitment from both sides to get Biden- L\u00f3pez Obrador relationship on a positive footing, explain people closely tracking the relationship.\n \"I think the administration, and particularly President Biden, believe in letting bygones be bygones. He wants to build a constructive relationship going forward,\" said the former Mexican ambassador to the US Arturo Sarukhan, reflecting on the friendly initial phone call which avoided the most contentious issues. \"But as with most things in life, the saying goes you need two to tango, or two to salsa in this instance. And the question is if L\u00f3pez Obrador will want to work with his American counterpart.\"\n L\u00f3pez Obrador was one of the last world leaders to congratulate Biden on his victory, and when they finally spoke during the transition period, the Mexican president bluntly reiterated to Biden that he had developed a positive relationship with Trump, according to sources briefed on the call.\n By contrast, readouts from the phone call last week seemed mild and friendly. It was the second call Biden had with a world leader, following his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n The White House said the two leaders largely focused on migration -- agreeing to \"work closely\" to stem irregular immigration -- and on coordinating to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \"It is a signal that the relationship could start to move in the right relationship with that phone call. It is a vital relationship to both countries and it is important that the relationship stabilize,\" said Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico.\n But there is more than rhetoric to fix. Substance and style are also expected to be hurdles.\n L\u00f3pez Obrador took actions which put stress on the relationship with the US ahead of Biden assuming the presidency.\n In January, L\u00f3pez Obrador unexpectedly said his country planned to offer Julian Assange political asylum. He also welcomed a British court ruling rejecting a US request to extradite the WikiLeaks founder to the US, \"because he is a journalist and deserves a chance.\"\n In December, L\u00f3pez Obrador signed a security law placing restrictions on the presence of US drug agents in the country. It was clearly retaliation for the US arresting Mexico's former defense secretary, Salvador Cienfuegos, in Los Angeles in October and charging him with being tied to drug trafficking. After that arrest he was turned over to Mexican authorities and on his return to the country, the charges were dropped. It was also a decision that could impede the US-Mexico security relationship.\n \"It was a shot over the bow,\" said Sarukhan, adding that AMLO also recently has said he is considering taking action against the US for allegedly fabricating information in the Cienfuegos investigation. \"Now, are you trying to use that as a negotiation point with the incoming Biden administration, or is it that you just do not get how the relationship works? That is the question that I have not been able to answer. Like so many things in life it may be a combination of both.\"\n The security aspects of the relationship and the future of Trump's border wall did not come up in the initial conversation between the two, according to the readouts and sources familiar with the call who added it's unclear when the more difficult matters will be addressed. But they all agree that those issues cannot be avoided.\n \"The overarching concern is that the incredibly necessary and strategic intelligence, security and law enforcement relationship between both countries needs to be on sure footing,\" Sarukhan said. \"I think the administration needs to send that message clearly, that in the aftermath of 9/11 this is not just about drugs, it is about much more in terms of common security writ large.\"\n Immigration is an area where the two leaders are expected to work together. Due to the devastating toll that the coronavirus pandemic has taken on Latin America, thousands of immigrants are headed to the US border. L\u00f3pez Obrador said they are closely watching developments as a migrant caravan moves toward the US from Central America.\n But getting the two leaders synced up on issues across the board could be a challenge.\n Biden, who is known for being able to establish close personal relationships with world leaders, will be tasked with developing a personal bond with L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose leadership style does not mirror his.\n \"You build the relationship because it is so important. Biden is a very good personal politician, as is L\u00f3pez Obrador. They are good schmoozers,\" said Richardson, who also added \"there are going to be differences.\"\n The two leaders do not share the same bombastic and transactional governing style and L\u00f3pez Obrador is a populist who built a political brand on his own cult of personality, leading him to bond with Trump.\n Last fall, when he visited DC, L\u00f3pez Obrador praised Trump for his \"understanding and respect\" despite Trump's history of deriding Mexicans and attempting to use coercive measures including threatening tariffs and border closures against the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration.\n L\u00f3pez Obrador has more pressing problems though after announcing on Sunday that he had tested positive for Covid-19.\n And even the pandemic is an area where the two leaders will have challenge in seeing eye to eye. The two leaders have taken a contrasting approach to crisis which is devastating both nations. Biden has been very clear about the need to wear masks and maintain social distancing whereas L\u00f3pez Obrador has been dismissive of the virus and traveled throughout the country during the pandemic, often times without wearing a mask.",

        "title": "GOP Sen. Rob Portman won't run for reelection, saying it's difficult to 'break through the partisan gridlock'",
        "body_text": "Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio announced Monday that he will not run for reelection after his current term in office ends in 2022, saying in a statement that the entrenched partisan gridlock in Washington was a factor in his decision.\n The announcement will set off what could become a highly competitive race to fill the seat and will reshape the 2022 battlefield for control of the Senate. The news could also potentially pave the way for a crowded GOP primary field in a state won by former President Donald Trump in both the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections.\n There is already speculation that Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a close ally and vocal defender of Trump, could run. Other possible GOP candidates include: J.D. Vance, the author of Hillbilly \"Elegy,\" Josh Mandel, who dropped out of the 2018 GOP primary race to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Jon Husted, the state's lieutenant governor.\n A GOP source who has worked with the Portman team texted CNN: \"There are two scenarios for the seat now: 1.) Jordan Runs and Clears the Field; 2.) Everyone in the State Runs.\"\n Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also seriously eyeing a Senate bid, a former Ohio GOP official said.\n LaRose, who served as a Green Beret in Iraq as a member of the Special Forces, is a former Republican state senator. He largely financed his own bid as secretary of state, and his family is well established and funded, as he is the son of a beer distribution family company.\n At least three Ohio GOP representatives are also interested in running for Senate following Portman's announcement: Rep. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup and Mike Turner, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n On the Democratic side, one possible candidate could be Rep. Tim Ryan, who unsuccessfully ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primary. A top Democratic operative in the state told CNN they hope Ryan finally pulls the statewide trigger and runs. He had been thinking about governor, the source said, \"but Senate clearly fits him better.\"\n Ryan tweeted Monday afternoon that while he has not made a decision yet, he is seriously considering a bid.\n \"I'm overwhelmed by supporters who are reaching out to encourage me to run for Senate. I haven't made a decision yet but I'm looking seriously at it. Ohio deserves leaders who fight for working people,\" he said.\n In his statement, Portman said that partisan stalemate has grown worse and that played a role in his decision, saying, \"I don't think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision.\"\n \"We live in an increasingly polarized country where members of both parties are being pushed further to the right and further to the left, and that means too few people who are actively looking to find common ground. This is not a new phenomenon, of course, but a problem that has gotten worse over the past few decades,\" he said, adding, \"This is a tough time to be in public service.\"\n In announcing his decision, Portman also signaled he stands ready to work with the Biden administration as it attempts to win bipartisan support for the President's economic rescue package responding to the pandemic.\n \"For many of the issues I am most passionate about, I will continue to make a difference outside of the Senate, beyond 2022. In the meantime, I am hopeful that President Biden will follow through on his inaugural pledge to reach across the aisle, and I am prepared to work with him and his administration if he does,\" he said. \"I was on the bipartisan call yesterday on a new COVID-19 package. I hope the Administration will work with us on a more targeted approach that focuses on things like vaccine distribution, testing and getting kids back to school.\"\n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reacted to the news on Monday by saying in a statement that \"My friend Sen. Portman's announced retirement in two years will be a big loss for the entire Senate.\"\n \"Both the Republican conference and the institution as a whole will be worse off when Rob departs. Fortunately, in the meantime, we have two more years to continue drawing on his knowledge, his principles, and his dedication as we keep fighting for American families,\" McConnell said.\n GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina echoed that sentiment.\n \"Very, very sad to see that @senrobportman is not seeking reelection. Rob is one of the smartest, most sincere members of the Senate that I have ever known. This will be a major blow to the Senate as well as the Republican Party,\" Graham tweeted.\n This headline and story have been updated to include additional developments Monday.\n CNN's Annie Grayer, Sarah Westwood, Michael Warren and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Here's what could happen next with the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine",
        "body_text": "If all has gone well with its clinical trial, Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine will likely be the next one available in the United States.\n Last week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said that Johnson & Johnson is \"right around the corner\" from seeking emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine from the US Food and Drug Administration.\n The company said it's on track to have interim data from its clinical trial by the end of January. The company has a shareholder call on its fourth-quarter results Tuesday.\n Still, it can take weeks for the vaccine to make it through the US Food and Drug Administration's authorization process and it's not clear yet when any of those key steps will take place.\n The two vaccines already available in the United States are highly effective, but all eyes are on Johnson & Johnson's, which is only a single dose and would be much easier to administer.\n \"If this vaccine proves to be safe and effective, it could have major implications for the vaccine rollout because J&J has committed to producing and deploying at least a billion doses of vaccine during this calendar year, including at least 100 million doses for the U.S. population,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch of Harvard Medical School, who helped develop Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate.\n \"If it's a single-dose vaccine, then a billion vaccine doses would translate into a billion people vaccinated,\" Barouch  said Monday on CNN's Coronavirus Fact vs Fiction podcast.\n J&J Phase 3 trial involves 40,000 volunteers; the company cut the trial down from 60,000 because of the surge in Covid-19 cases around the country.\n Like with the other Covid-19 vaccine trials, the goal is to see how well the vaccine protects participants. The company recruits from different demographic groups and people with varying health statuses. Researchers give half the group the vaccine and half the group a placebo, which does nothing, and then monitors who gets sick and whether safety issues arise.\n \"A single dose would have big logistical implications,\" said Michael Haydock, the senior director at Informa Pharma Intelligence. \"In terms of the rollout it could really speed things up and simplify things quite considerably.\"\n \"Of course, the big question is, will it work?\" Haydock said.\n Once there's an answer to that question, the data will get a close look from the FDA and advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The process for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be the same as it was for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, according to Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n The change in leadership at the FDA and CDC should not make a difference in how long the process takes.\n \"I don't think it's going to change at all under the new administration,\" said Offit.\n If the data from the Phase 3 trial shows that J&J's Covid-19 vaccine works and is safe, the company will then request what's known as an emergency use authorization, or an EUA, from the FDA.\n Under an EUA, the FDA will allow the use of unapproved medical products to treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases when there is no adequate or approved alternative. The FDA's career scientists and physicians will do a comprehensive review of the data to determine if the results meet its criteria.\n While the FDA is reviewing the data, it schedules a public meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. The committee is made up of independent science and public health experts who will discuss the J&J data and make a recommendation to the agency.\n After the meeting, FDA staff members consider the committee input along with the agency's evaluation of the company's data and will make a decision about whether the vaccine should by authorized.\n With the Pfizer vaccine, it took a little over three weeks from the time the company submitted its data to an EUA. With the Moderna vaccine, it took a little more than two weeks.\n Shortly after an EUA, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also known as ACIP, goes through the data, too.\n ACIP is a group of medical and public health experts who make recommendations on how the vaccine should be used in the population. The committee's suggestions become the guidance used to determine which demographic groups should get the vaccine.\n Once the CDC committee has made a recommendation and it has been approved by the CDC director, vaccines can be shipped and can go into arms.\n CNN's Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Covid-19 relief faces time crunch with impeachment around the corner",
        "body_text": "Less than a week into his new administration, President Joe Biden's promise of restoring bipartisanship is going to face even more hurdles as Republicans are signaling they have little interest in taking up his first legislative priority: another massive Covid-19 relief bill.\n Meanwhile, the administration is just two weeks away from the beginning of an impeachment trial that will halt all other Senate business, creating even more incentive to act fast. How quickly Biden has to abandon his calls for unity in the name of getting something done amid a pandemic will set the tone for his relationship with Republicans on Capitol Hill and more broadly set the tone for his first 100 days as a President leading in a time of crisis.\n The article of impeachment will be delivered around 7 p.m. ET on Monday when House managers walk it over to the Senate chamber. Senators will be sworn in Tuesday and then there will be about a two-week break until the focus is back on impeachment. In the meantime, Democrats are going to be fighting to confirm as many of Biden's nominations as possible. They'll also have to decide soon about how to proceed with the organizing resolution that has been stalled for a week. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted that Democrats promise -- in writing -- they won't blow up the filibuster in the organizing resolution. Democrats don't want to give up their leverage on it even as they argue they have no immediate plans to get rid of the filibuster.\n It takes 60 votes to pass this organizing resolution. That means that McConnell is daring Democrats not to blow up the filibuster in a disagreement about whether they will promise not to blow up the filibuster. One more time: in order to pass this resolution without Republicans, Democrats would have to change the rules to allow it to pass by a simple 51-vote majority. That -- in essence-- would be eradicating the filibuster.\n Multiple aides CNN spoke with made it clear that Sunday's call between a group of bipartisan senators and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Jeff Zients and Louisa Terrell was a good first step, but there is still broad disagreement about the overall price tag of this stimulus package and what's actually needed.\n Everyone acknowledges more money for testing and vaccines is essential. But a $15 minimum wage? Billions in state and local funding? $1,400 stimulus checks? Multiple aides told CNN that senators on both sides argued they needed more data as to why nearly $2 trillion was the right choice. They just passed a more than $900 billion package a month ago. One Republican aide told CNN that it wasn't just Republicans balking at that number, but that some of the Democrats on the call were also \"cool\" on spending so much. Checks, they argued, needed to be more targeted. If a fight over a stimulus bill's price tag sounds familiar, it's because it is. The cost of last stimulus plan bedeviled Republicans and Democrats for six months the last time Congress attempted this.\n All you need to know: After the meeting, Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who is broadly viewed as one of the most \"gettable\" Republican senators are on this package released a statement to CNN saying \"It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope.\"\n In other words: if Biden and his team want this to be done quickly, they might have to pull the plug on their goal of getting 10 Republicans to sign on and move (AKA as soon as the next week or two) to the next step: a procedural budget maneuver that would only require 51 votes.\n This is a process that requires the House and Senate Budget committees to first pass a budget with specific instructions to House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees to write a Covid relief bill. The Senate would then have to pass that budget with 51 votes, but when they do that it will unlock a lengthy budget vote-a-rama in the Senate that will keep us up through the night as members offer hundreds of political amendments.\n Once the budget passes the House and Senate, each committee writes their Covid relief bill. And that bill will have to meet a very specific set of criteria that will be tested by the Senate parliamentarian in a process we affectionately refer to as a \"Byrd bath.\" It's named after former Sen. Robert Byrd, who established a set of rules reconciliation bills have to comply with in order to make sure the budget process wasn't taken advantage of by the majority party. There are a handful of rules.\n Supporters of the proposal have to prove that the bill in question either increases revenues or reduces spending.That those changes are not merely \"incidental.\"That all the changes are within the jurisdiction of the committees outlined in the reconciliation instructions.Senators for their proposal have to achieve at least the same amount of savings as the House bill did. And you have to hit the same targets in the one-year and five-year windows.The proposal cannot have any impact on Social Security.The provision must not increase spending or decrease revenues outside of the budget window if you want it to be permanent.\n There are already lengthy talks underway now in the House and Senate budget committees, Finance and Ways and Means about what provisions would be acceptable under those guidelines. There is a robust debate happening right now about whether or not some appropriations provisions would be acceptable (traditionally, appropriations haven't been handled using reconciliation). There are debates happening about whether the $15 minimum wage would meet the criteria. There are a lot of very smart people on the Republican and Democratic side who have been wrestling with these questions for weeks now. And, that's because there has always been an expectation that at some point, Democrats would have to pull the plug on bipartisan talks and do this without Republicans.\n Moving ahead with reconciliation would still require Democrats to be completely united. That means that it can't just be progressive members like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren leading this charge. Democrats need 100% unity. They need Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Montana Sen. Jon Tester and Maine Sen. Angus King, Arizona Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly. We don't yet how those members would vote if the reconciliation process began to occur in the next week or two. Would they argue that there hasn't been enough good faith negotiations with Republicans? We just don't know right now.",

        "title": "Biden is no longer afraid to spend big on economic relief. Here's what's changed since 2009",
        "body_text": "Even before he took office, President Joe Biden made clear he will not hesitate to spend big to fight the coronavirus pandemic and get the economy back on track.\n Biden can't afford to repeat the mistakes made 12 years ago, when he headed the recovery effort amid the financial crisis. The Obama administration checked its proposals to combat the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression only to face criticism that the response was too small, leading to a painfully slow recovery.\n The political and economic realities have changed a lot since 2009, which is allowing Biden to trade restraint for ambition.\n \"It's not just that smart fiscal investments, including deficit spending, are more urgent than ever,\" he said as he unveiled a $1.9 trillion relief package a week before his inauguration. \"It's that the return on these investments \u2014 in jobs, in racial equity \u2014 will prevent long-term economic damage and the benefits will far surpass the costs.\"\n The massive package is filled with immediate aid and longer-term Democratic promises. Much of it calls for boosting even further many of the provisions in the much-delayed $900 billion relief deal Congress passed last month, including larger stimulus checks and more unemployment, nutrition and housing assistance.\n And this is only the first step. The President intends to release a recovery plan at his joint address before Congress next month. The size remains to be seen, but Biden has said it will include \"historic investments\" in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy.\n Those proposals, however, need approval from Congress and will likely be scaled back as they work their way through the legislative process. Already, Republicans -- even moderate ones like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah -- have expressed doubts or opposition to passing another major relief bill on the heels of the $900 billion package.\n Democrats have an out -- a legislative process called reconciliation, which allows a bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority but limits what measures can be included.\n Biden is also using his executive authority to provide more assistance to Americans in need. On Friday, he signed an executive order directing the US Department of Agriculture to consider boosting food stamp benefits for certain low-income people and Pandemic-EBT payments to families whose children are missing free- and reduced-price meals because their schools are closed.\n The President can do this because it's a regulatory change for a mandatory appropriation, said Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council.\n Though some Republicans have already expressed concern about spending more federal funds, overall the political landscape has changed greatly, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right-leaning American Action Forum and chief economic policy adviser for late Republican Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.\n \"This is an environment where there is very little regard for the consequences of higher federal debt, if any, on both sides,\" Holtz-Eakin said. \"The parties have changed. You don't really have core constituency of fiscally conservative centrist Democrats or fiscally conservative Republicans.\"\n New members of Congress are not steeped in the importance of having things add up, so they don't push for legislation to do so, Holtz-Eakin said.\n The Tea Party, which battled former President Barack Obama over deficit spending, has essentially disappeared.\n Republican lawmakers were not particularly mindful of the deficit under former President Donald Trump. In their first year in control of Congress and the White House, GOP lawmakers passed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that added nearly $2 trillion to the deficit over a decade, mainly through tax cuts for high-income households and corporations, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center.\n Trump, who referred to himself as the King of Debt, saw the national debt soar by more than $7 trillion during his four years in office.\n In the most recent quarter, the federal budget deficit was $572 billion, up more than 60% from the same period a year earlier, largely because of federal pandemic relief programs.\n Meanwhile, progressive Democrats, who advocate for large government programs such as \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal, have pushed the party to the left.\n \"There's just a sense that they want to do bigger things,\" said Jason Furman, an economic policy professor at Harvard, of the progressives. Furman, who was a deputy director of the National Economic Council in the Obama administration, helped craft the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n Economists have also shifted their views on spending big during times of financial stress -- and the pandemic-fueled economic and employment collapse in the spring was unprecedented. Deficit spending is more acceptable now.\n \"There seems to be more openness to borrowing, especially during downturns,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for fiscal responsibility but believes that deficit spending is important during the pandemic to deal with the virus and stabilize the economy.\n Low interest rates make it more palatable to borrow. The rate on the 10-year Treasury bond is hovering around 1.1% versus 2.4% in January 2009.\n The nation's top policy makers have also given their blessing to continue to spend, saying the economy is still too shaky to pull back on assistance.\n Speaking to the National Association of Business Economists in October, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said now is not the time to prioritize the federal budget.\n \"Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,\" Powell said. \"By contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller. Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste.\"\n Janet Yellen, Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, also stressed the importance of providing more assistance at her Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.\n \"Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden,\" she said. \"But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big. In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time.\"",

        "title": "White House recommits to getting Harriet Tubman on $20 bill after Trump delay",
        "body_text": "The Biden administration says it is \"exploring ways to speed up\" release of $20 bills featuring abolitionist Harriet Tubman after the Trump administration delayed the move first initiated by President Barack Obama.\n \"It's important that our notes, our money -- if people don't know what a note is -- reflect the history and diversity of our country, and Harriet Tubman's image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday.\n A spokesperson for the Treasury Department confirmed to CNN that the agency is \"exploring ways to resume\" putting Tubman on the bill.\n There are production factors that will need to be considered in order for the bill to be released before 2028 -- when the Trump administration estimated the new note would be unveiled. For example, the Tubman bill will need to produced in a new, high-speed printing facility, which is currently scheduled to begin printing in 2025.\n Tubman, the once-enslaved African-American woman who guided dozens enslaved people to their freedom through the Underground Railroad in the 1800s, would replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.\n Tubman, born in Maryland, escaped the plantation where she was enslaved and went to Pennsylvania in 1849. Over the following decade, she made more than a dozen trips to Maryland to free enslaved persons, according to the National Parks Service.\n During the Civil War, Tubman served as a US Army spy, scout, nurse and cook. And in her later years, Tubman was involved in  the women's suffrage movement.\n While campaigning in 2016, President Donald Trump called the decision to redesign the $20 with Tubman's image front and center \"pure political correctness.\" He suggested at the time that Tubman be put on the $2 bill, which wasn't being printed at the time, instead.\n And throughout his presidency, Trump expressed appreciation for Jackson, visiting his grave, tweeting about Jackson, \"We honor your memory. We build on your legacy\" and displaying Jackson portraits in the Oval Office.\n Different groups have criticized the glorification of Jackson's legacy -- specifically for owning slaves, his record on racial issues and his decision to sign legislation that ultimately led to the deadly \"Trail of Tears.\" That legislation forced tens of thousands of Cherokees out of Georgia and moved to what's now Oklahoma.\n In a 2018 interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dodged when asked about progress with regard to the new bill, saying, \"We haven't made any decisions as to whether we'll change the bill, or won't change the bill.\"\n Mnuchin later said the bill wouldn't be unveiled until 2028 because of \"technical issues.\" But The New York Times reported in 2019 that in fact the \"basic design already on paper most likely could have satisfied the goal of unveiling\" the redesigned note by 2020. The paper said it obtained an image of the new note from a former department official, which \"depicts Tubman in a dark coat with a wide collar and a white scarf.\"\n According to the paper, the design \"was completed in late 2016.\"\n This story has been updated with additional reporting on Tubman and the Treasury Department's plans.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Lord Jonathan Marland is chairman of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council and served as the prime minister's trade envoy and minister for energy, climate change and business under David Cameron. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson should be congratulated for making Brexit happen. The landmark UK-EU trade deal worth \u00a3660 billion (US $893 billion), according to Johnson, just passed through UK Parliament and comes as welcome relief to economies on both sides of the channel. The deal will allow the UK to access EU consumers without tariffs and prevents a no-deal Brexit from taking place.\n But the country will now have to reset its position in the global trading landscape as its economy feels the pressure of rapidly increasing debt. Without the comfort of the EU market and an untested presence as a solo sovereign trading nation, the UK risks becoming financially isolated. The UK will need to focus on growing markets outside of the EU in order to compete with EU economies, such as France, within the next decade.\n While global leaders like the United States and China will still make for important and powerful trade partners, the UK must also take advantage of established market blocs where opportunities are emerging, like Nigeria, Ghana and Bangladesh.\n It's true that these countries have much smaller economies than the United States and China. But what these smaller economies currently lack in size they make up for in growth. Before Covid, Bangladesh was experiencing about 8% growth and a rising population of 163 million, while Ghana has been tracking around 6% growth. And India, a major Commonwealth economy, has grown at a steadily increasing rate, according to one economist's analysis, from between about 4.4% to about 7.1% since the 1970s, when the UK joined the EU. Compare that with the EU's larger economies, such as France, which has seen growth under 2% in recent years. It is the type of growth in these markets that is so appealing. And Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan have young, skilled workforces that are noted for their innovation.\n Nigeria's growing population \u2014 expected to be the third-most populated country by 2050 \u2014 creates a large and expanding market for the UK.\n Nigeria also supports a free trade approach and importantly, maintains a plural legal system that retains elements of British law and is therefore more familiar for trading partners. Growing economies, such as Bangladesh and Ghana, as former British colonies, also operate a legal system that is based on the British common law system, making it easier to transact business.\n Many will point to the United States as the UK's largest single trading partner, but these global economic growth trends mean it may no longer be prudent for the UK to put all of its eggs into the US basket.\n The powerful US Food and Drug Administration is a formidable negotiator and is often overprotective of businesses and trade. The UK could come out on the wrong side of negotiations following another exhaustive process, complicated by different legal systems. In my experience as a trade minister, it is likely the UK would find itself fighting over something totemic, such as scotch whisky, at the expense of other key industries like the automobile sector, which would bring in much greater revenue.\n This is not to say the UK shouldn't prioritize a services agreement with the United States, particularly as services were largely not included in the Brexit deal. The UK's economy is heavily reliant on the service sector, which leaves it with a degree of vulnerability.\n The UK will need to approach China with caution as well. The rules of engagement have changed with the shift in the global economic landscape, and the UK foreign secretary is questioning if China can be trusted to fulfill its international obligations. The UK may experience further friction with Beijing after banning Chinese company Huawei from providing the infrastructure to build up a 5G network.\n The UK economy can surpass its European rivals and be a bold player in the global market, but only with the courage to forge innovative relationships and seek opportunities in new, less familiar markets.\n How countries emerge from this period will define their next generation, and every lever should be used to tip the economic playing field.\n Instead of falling back on our traditional, safe markets, we need to embrace this change. Global Britain needs to become just that \u2014 truly global.",

        "body_text": "California health officials ended the state's regional stay-at-home order on Monday, saying the latest projections for intensive care unit capacity allowed the restrictions to be lifted.\n The order applied to the Southern California, San Joaquin Valley and Bay Area regions, which are home to more than 90% of the state's population of 39 million people. The four-week ICU projections for these areas show enough capacity to exit the order, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n All 58 counties now return to the state's tier-based system, which places each into one of four color-coded tiers indicating which activities and businesses are allowed based on local coronavirus case rates and test positivity. The tiers are reassessed every Tuesday.\n \"Today, we can lay claim to starting to see some real light at the end of the tunnel as it relates to case numbers,\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n The majority of counties are in the strictest, or purple, tier. Most indoor businesses remain closed but many can open outdoors with modifications, including restaurants, movie theaters, places of worship, and family entertainment such as mini golf. Modifications would include limited capacity and the use of masks.\n Personal care services, such as barbershops, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlors, and piercing shops, can open indoors with modifications. Retail businesses are limited to 25% capacity indoors.\n Under the regional stay-at-home order, personal care services and movie theaters were closed and restaurants were limited to takeout and delivery only.\n Schools in the purple tier must offer remote learning only -- but can reopen for in-person instruction after a county has been in the red tier for at least two weeks.\n Individual counties, however, have the authority to set their own restrictions and can choose to keep the tougher restrictions in place. California residents can check the status of businesses and activities in their county on the state's coronavirus website.\n San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a tweet that the city will be in the purple tier. \"We will be moving forward with some limited re-openings, including outdoor dining and personal services,\" she said.\n California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said the surge of cases after the December holidays did not overwhelm the health care system to the degree officials had feared.\n \"California is slowly starting to emerge from the most dangerous surge of this pandemic yet, which is the light at the end of the tunnel we've been hoping for,\" he said.\n The ICU capacity projections are based on four factors: current estimated regional ICU capacity available, a measure of current community transmission, current regional case rates and the proportion of ICU cases being admitted, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.\n The model the state uses to calculate its four-week projections has not been made public, a situation that has led to criticism. Ghaly said the state was making the model available on Monday on the health department's website.\n The Bay Area region is currently reporting 8.2% ICU capacity while the worst-hit regions of San Joaquin Valley and Southern California are reporting 0.0% ICU availability.\n Officials said that state projections show that in four weeks, ICU capacity in the Bay Area will be up to 25%, with the Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley regions rising to 33.3% and 22.3%, respectively.\n \"We're not out of the woods (but) we're seeing a flattening of the curve,\" he said during an online news briefing.\n He cited a number of statistics that are moving in a positive direction, including that hospitalizations are down 19.8% and Covid-19 ICU admissions are down 9.5% over the past 14 days. The 14-day average positivity rate also continues to decline, down more than 4% to 9.4% over the latest 14-day period.\n Newsom, a Democrat, is facing a movement to recall him in part because of the stay-at-home orders he imposed.\n California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson criticized the decision to lift the restrictions in a Twitter post, saying it was \"sad and pathetic.\"\n \"This Governor's decisions have never been based on science,\" she wrote. \"Him re-opening our state is not an attempt to help working Californians, but rather an attempt to counter the Recall Movement.\"\n Newsom said criticism that the decision to lift the stay-at-home order was due to the recall movement was \"utter nonsense.\"\n The regional stay-at-home orders were instituted in early December as Covid-19 cases surged. The order went into effect if ICU capacity dropped below 15% in one of five regions into which the state is divided: Northern California, Bay Area, Greater Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley and Southern California.\n The Southern California and San Joaquin Valley regions have been under the state order since December 6 and the Bay Area since December 17. The mandate, aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19, instructed residents to stay home as much as possible and not mix with other households. It closed hair salons, museums, movie theaters, and restricted restaurants to takeout or delivery service.\n The Greater Sacramento region exited the order on January 12 and the Northern California region never entered the order.\n On December 1, the state reported 9,365 patients hospitalized with Covid-19. By January 1, hospitalizations were past 21,000, peaking on January 6 with 22,853. Since then, hospitalizations have dropped with 18,347 reported on Sunday, below the 14-day average of 20,807. Correspondingly, the number of available intensive care unit beds had dropped from 1,810 on December 2 to 1,168 beds on Sunday.\n A letter from the California Restaurant Association to its members had indicated that the order would be lifted Monday. The association, which shared the letter with CNN, said it had been notified of the plan Sunday evening by the governor's office.\n New cases in the state are on the decline. The most recent data shows 27,007 new infections were reported Sunday but that is below the 14-day average of 30,382 and it marks the first full week of fewer than 30,000 cases each day since early December. On January 1, there were 53,341 cases reported and the 14-day average then was above 40,000.\n The stay-at-home orders placed restrictions on businesses, including a ban on outdoor dining. The restaurant industry has bitterly opposed the orders and has sued to stop them. A coalition of Bay Area wineries sued over the outdoor dining restrictions earlier this month and the restaurant association sued Los Angeles County in November over its outdoor dining restrictions.\n A spokesman for the restaurant association told CNN early Monday that it did not have any additional comment about the lifting of the stay-at-home orders.\n While new cases may be declining, the death toll in California remains high. The state reported its highest single day of deaths on Thursday with 764, above the 14-day rolling average of 499. Deaths on Sunday were 328, below the 14-day average of 504.\n The Los Angeles Times reported that it was unclear whether restrictions in Los Angeles County would be eased by the lifting of the order.\n Los Angeles County has been the epicenter of the virus' surge in the state. More than 6,800 people have died in the county since December 1 and more than 1 million of the state's 3 million cases are in the county.\n About 1 in 10 people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus in Los Angeles County but health officials speculate the actual number may be as high as 1 in 3.\n Across the US, Covid-19 infections kept soaring this weekend, as did the death toll. As of early Monday, more than 419,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n CNN's Sarah Moon and Douglas Wood contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Rand Paul's ridiculous answer on whether the election was 'stolen'",
        "body_text": "Even now -- after the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president, after the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, after the myriad lawsuit dismissals -- Rand Paul can't bring himself to say that the 2020 election was not, in fact, stolen.\n In an appearance on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday, the Kentucky Republican was asked just that question by George Stephanopoulos. And here's what he said:\n \"Well, what I would suggest is -- what I would suggest is that if we want greater confidence in our elections, and 75% of Republicans agree with me, is that we do need to look at election integrity and we need to see if we can restore confidence in the elections.\"\n Well, senator, no.\n Here's why: It is a FACT -- based on a total lack of objective evidence and the rejection of lawsuit after lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump and his legal team -- that there was no widespread election fraud in the 2020 race. (Which, by the way, makes it a lot like all the other presidential elections that experts have studied in search of fraud.)\n That FACT is not overridden by the opinion of Republican voters who say they don't have faith in the process. The reason they don't have faith in the process is that Trump -- as well as his enablers like Paul -- spent the last three months (and, really, the last four years) telling their supporters that the whole election system was rigged against them. So is it any wonder that so many Republicans -- contra objective evidence -- believe that the election wasn't entirely above board? Of course not!\n Paul didn't stop there, though. After Stephanopoulos said that President Joe Biden won a \"legitimate, fair election,\" the Kentucky senator interrupted to say this:\n \"I think where you make a mistake in -- hey, George. George. George, where you make a mistake is that people coming from the liberal side like you, you immediately say everything's a lie instead of saying there are two sides to everything.\n \"Historically what would happen is if said that I thought that there was fraud, you would interview someone else who said there wasn't. But now you insert yourself in the middle and say that the absolute fact is that everything that I'm saying is a lie.\"\n This is a classic appeal to both-sider-ism by Paul. His argument goes like this: I can say anything I want and it's not the job of the media to litigate whether it's true or not. Instead, there should be another guest on the show who says the opposite of what I am saying  -- and then the viewers can decide who is right and who is wrong.\n Paul is right that journalism, for far too long, worked like this. Person A said something that was wrong -- based on the facts. Person B disputed Person A's claim, pointing to established facts. The moderator said something like \"Well, a lot of heated views on this subject. Stay tuned,\" or something. And that was it.\n Which, candidly, did a disservice to viewers and readers. Because while there are absolutely issues -- immigration, abortion, education, health care -- where reasonable people disagree and can cite facts to back up their respective arguments, whether or not the 2020 election was stolen is not one of them. The FACTS make clear it was not stolen. And opinions that suggest otherwise are just that: Opinions. And facts \u2260 opinions.\n What Paul does in his responses to Stephanopoulos' questions then is to reveal the utter lack of seriousness in his arguments about the 2020 election.  A lot of Republicans think the election was stolen? No kidding! And Paul's false claims about the election should be treated the same as objective facts about the election? Really!\n The rottenness of Paul's argument -- and the clear bad faith that serves as its architecture -- should be evident to anyone who reads what he said. That it isn't -- and that Paul will just keep repeating it -- speaks to the challenges of our current political (and cultural) moment.",

Just find a method that works best for you.\n Whether it's with pen and paper or an Excel spreadsheet, tracking all your spending and incoming cash for at least a month provides a detailed log of your financial habits and makes you more aware of them.\n The key is to be honest and thorough with your tracking -- yes, that cup of coffee needs to be noted. As does that birthday card for your mom. At the end of the month, you will have a line-by-line accounting of your finances giving you a clear picture of how much you are spending and saving.\n To help categorize spending, Aliche places a \"B\" next to any bills that are fixed like rent or mortgage payments, and a \"UB\" for \"usage bills\" is placed on expenses that can fluctuate, like utility bills. She places a \"C\" next to expenditures that are a choice (and are the easiest to cut back on, like eating out or entertainment).\n If pen and paper aren't your thing, or you're just not diligent enough to keep up with all your purchases by hand, technology can help track and categorize your spending for you.\n Various apps and websites like Mint or PocketGuard will sync with your accounts to create spending reports. These tools work best if almost all of your spending is done through credit cards and electronic purchases.\n Some credit card providers also offer breakdowns of your spending to give you a sense of where your money is going, but they're usually limited to transactions you made with that account.\n Am I saving enough? Where can I cut back?\n Now that you know where you've been putting your money, maybe you need some help figuring out where it should be going.\n Online calculators, like this one from Mint, can help you break it all down and customize it.\n Once you've paid all your bills, spent on your wants and put cash toward savings, you might still have some left over. Money left floating around in your checking account without a designated purpose often ends up being spent on luxuries and impulse buys.\n That's not great.\n Having a visual reminder of where your money is going can help rein in overspending.\n Once the envelope is empty, no more spending in that category for the month.\n If you don't want to deal with physical envelopes full of cash, apps like Goodbudget and Mvelopes allow you to create virtual envelopes to help track spending.",

        "body_text": "It's 27 degrees where I live just north of New York City, but I'm taking a walk up a mountain with pop star Shawn Mendes in Griffith Park in Los Angeles. Unlike me, hands in pockets, mask giving me a little extra warmth, Mendes says hello to the people he walks by, in between reflections about his life in the spotlight.\n \"Especially over the last few weeks, I've been starting my day by going for a walk, clearing my mind and leaving my phone,\" he says. \"Sometimes I get a little woo woo and touch the plants.\"\n Mendes says walking about 25 minutes a day serves not only as a meditation practice but a way to \"let the noise fall out of my ears,\" so he's more present around the people he loves. When he recalls the pressures of being in the studio, a photo appears on my Apple Watch of Mendes holding a guitar.\n New episodes of Time to Walk, which launched on Monday, will appear in the Workout app each Monday through the end of April. (The timing for potential future episodes after \"this season\" have not been announced.) For Apple Watch users who use a wheelchair, Time to Walk becomes Time to Push, which tracks \"roll\" goals instead of steps.\n Last month, Apple launched Fitness+, a $9.99 monthly Apple Watch subscription pservice with workout videos, such as yoga, dance and strength training, that can be accessed from an iPad, iPhone or Apple TV. User data, including calories burned and heart rate, are displayed on screen in real time. For years, Apple has been working to turn its watch into a health and wellness hub, allowing users to monitor daily vitals, but also log data for studies related to diabetes, Parkinson's and dementia.\n For me, walking has always been my preferred way of moving: low-impact and free. Having some familiar voices walking at the same time feels like a personalized spin on a podcast (although Apple never uses the p-word). I can even hear Mendes taking deep breathes in just as I do.\n In Parton's sessions, I hear the background noise of birds as she talks about her Tennessee farm. \"During this time, Covid and all that, I know a lot of you can't get out and walk like you do normally, and I'm sure a lot of you feel confined,\" says Parton. \"But I know how important it is to be able to walk. So even though we can't get out and walk around all the places we'd like to this day and time. ... I can still take you down on a walk on memory lane. Hopefully with us walking together we'll feel a little more freedom.\"\n She tells me she does a lot of writing while walking and the backstory of her famous \"9 to 5\" song; I listen intently to her tapping her own acrylic fingernails so it sounds like a typewriter for rhythm in the background, something I didn't know until today.\n When NBA player Draymond Green recalls how the Golden State Warriors celebrated a championship win, it's \"Big Rings\" by Drake that takes him back to the locker room. It's one of three songs he intros and plays on his episode, which also includes a beautiful story about a walk he took after failing a class and getting into an argument with his mother. He talks about the sounds of the Malibu waves in the distance and the cars on the highway nearby.\n Although Time to Walk is no substitute for a stroll with a good friend, it's intimate storytelling is a welcomed change to walking alone.",

        "title": "Democratic congressman to introduce sweeping child abuse prevention bill Monday",
        "body_text": "Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia will introduce a child abuse prevention bill in the House on Monday, his office told CNN, setting up deliberations for a considerable child welfare investment as experts warn of an increasingly dire situation for at-risk kids.\n The Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act represents a legislative overhaul of the flagship bill addressing child welfare in the US. The new legislation would require the US Department of Health and Human Services to establish national standards for tracking and reporting child fatalities along with near-fatalities as a result of maltreatment.\n The bill would also set up an electronic infrastructure for states to share information from their respective child abuse and neglect registries. The proposed national tracking standards and information sharing infrastructure reflect the repeated calls of advocates to scale-up child welfare coordination among states to produce clearer national trends as it relates to abuse.\n \"One of the groups that identify child abuse more than any others are schoolteachers, and the fact that the students are not in school suggests that a lot of cases are not being identified,\" Scott told CNN in a phone interview last week. \"So we want to make sure that we have a strong bill in place so that as students come back to school, we'll be in a position where we can address all of the problems.\"\n Figures provided to CNN from states across the country in the early months of the outbreak showed significant drops in child abuse reports as social distancing measures kept kids out of school. While that would usually be welcome news, experts say the decline might really mean more cases are going unnoticed.\n In Massachusetts alone, reports of alleged child abuse dropped almost 55% from 2,124 in the first week of March to just 972 by the last full week in April, according to data provided by the state. And compared to 2019, Connecticut, California, Michigan, Kentucky, New Hampshire and Louisiana have all seen double-digit percentage drops as they've implemented their own stay-home orders.\n The Stronger CAPTA bill had died in the last Congress after failing to get a vote in the Senate. Republican Sen. John Cornyn had introduced his own child welfare bill in the chamber, the Jenna Quinn law, which was narrower than Scott's bill and based on what he called \"successful reforms passed in Texas.\" That law would authorize federal grants for increasing evidence-based training on abuse prevention and ensure recipients coordinate with local educational agencies.\n Scott -- who maintains that the Jenna Quinn Law doesn't provide for anything not already included in the Stronger CAPTA bill -- had offered to fold the language of Jenna Quinn Law into his bill in an effort to salvage negotiations.\n But now, with Democrats holding majorities in both chambers, Scott plans to move forward with the bill as is, and says he's confident it has a path to become law after it's assigned to the House Education and Labor Committee. A spokesperson for Cornyn told CNN the senator \"will do everything he can to pass\" the Jenna Quinn Law in the Senate again and maintained that Scott has been \"playing politics.\"\n Child Welfare organizations for months have felt the full weight of the pandemic, and further delay of a federal investment could have far-reaching consequences for their ability to reach at-risk children.\n \"If we do not develop a national plan to meet these children and families in their moment of crisis, we will be a country cruelly complicit in our apathy,\" Daphne Young, chief communications officer for Childhelp, recently told CNN.\n \"We are filled with hope when we see vaccines slowly trickling into our communities, but there is no vaccine for child abuse and what we can use from Congress is an economic shot-in-the-arm for children in need of help and healing.\"\n This story was updated with additional information Monday.",

        "title": "Biden replaces controversial White House physician",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden has replaced the controversial White House physician who offered misleading information about President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis last fall.\n A White House official said Biden had selected Dr. Kevin O'Connor to replace Dr. Sean Conley as his doctor. It's not uncommon for a president to name his own physician when taking office, though his two most recent predecessors each retained the incumbent doctor who had attended the men who served before them.\n Conley generated controversy in the fall when he admitted to offering rosy descriptions of Trump's condition because the White House wanted to project optimism. In reality, Trump suffered serious conditions like shortness of breath that required supplemental oxygen.\n Biden has a long history with O'Connor, who served as his physician while vice president. He is a retired US Army colonel who served in the 82nd Airborne Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army Special Operations Command.\n He administered Biden's physical in 2019 and prepared a report that deemed the then-candidate \"healthy\" and \"vigorous.\" At 78, Biden is the oldest newly inaugurated president in history.\n A White House physician is responsible for medical care of the President, the first family and White House staff. They oversee a team of doctors and nurses that comprise the White House Medical Unit, which is headquartered in the ground level of the White House.\n White House physicians travel wherever the President does, including on the Marine One helicopter and aboard Air Force One. They can frequently be seen walking a few paces behind the President, carrying a large medical bag. They also traditionally perform an annual physical and provide a summary for reporters.\n Both O'Connor and Conley hold degrees in osteopathic medicine, one of the two degrees in the United States with which physicians can practice medicine -- either as a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathic medicine. About a quarter of US medical students train at osteopathic medical schools, according to the American Medical Association. Historically, doctor of osteopathic medicine programs have touted their methods as \"more holistic.\"\n Conley drew scrutiny during Trump's bout with coronavirus in the fall. He supervised a team of specialists at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where Trump was treated.\n At first, he did not disclose the President had received supplemental oxygen, and defended the decision by saying he wanted to \"reflect the upbeat attitude of the team.\"\n \"I didn't want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction, and in doing so it came off that we were trying to hide something,\" Conley said.\n He\u00a0replaced Dr. Ronny Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who was nominated to be secretary of veterans affairs. Jackson later withdrew following a string of allegations that included he loosely handled prescription pain medications, was intoxicated during an overseas trip and created a toxic work environment. Jackson denied the allegations. He later ran for a Texas congressional seat as a Republican and won.\n On Wednesday, Conley was seen departing the White House alongside Trump, who was making a final trip to Florida before his term ended.\n This story has been updated with additional background information.\n CNN's Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "More than 5,000 National Guard troops will remain in Washington through mid-March to provide security amid concerns over potential unrest in the coming weeks, acting Secretary of the Army John Whitley said in a press briefing on Monday.\n There are currently 15,000 troops in the city with the numbers due to be reduced to 7,000 by the end of the week and 5,600 by mid-March, according to National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Daniel Hokanson.\n Five hundred members will support the US Park Police and 550 members will support the Metropolitan Police Department over the next two weeks. Another 5,000 will continue supporting Capitol Police and 600 will support the US Secret Service through mid-March, Whitley said.\n \"There are several upcoming events -- we don't know what they are -- over the next several weeks, and they're concerned that there could be situations where there are lawful protests, First Amendment-protected protests, that could either be used by malicious actors, or other problems that could emerge,\" Whitley said.\n As CNN previously reported, 25,000 National Guard troops were brought to Washington to help secure the city through President Joe Biden's inauguration following the deadly riot at the US Capitol earlier in the month. And discussions had been taking place to keep thousands of troops in the district until March because of concerns about potential unrest during the upcoming impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and around Biden's first joint address to Congress.\n The concerns stem from what defense officials say is ongoing chatter about demonstrations picked up by federal law enforcement. On Thursday, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser referenced \"intelligence from our federal partners that would suggest that we need more presence,\" but she did not elaborate.\n National Guard members remaining in Washington will provide the law enforcement agencies they are assisting with security, communication, medical evacuation, logistical and safety support, Whitley said.\n It was also confirmed Monday that there has been a coronavirus outbreak among the National Guard troops in the city.\n Two hundred National Guard troops have tested positive for Covid-19 while on duty in Washington, Major General William J. Walker, head of the DC National Guard, said. The 200 who have tested positive are being treated and quarantined, he added.\n \"Once we send a soldier or airman to a facility for a test, they come up positive, they are quarantined, and they remain here until they are cleared to go back to their state,\" Walker said.\n Hokanson said each guardsman who has tested positive for Covid-19 will quarantine for 14 days in order to make sure they are fully recovered before they return home.\n CNN's Michael Conte and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Pirates off Nigeria's coast kidnapped 15 sailors from a Turkish container ship on Saturday, in a brazen and violent attack that was farther from shore than usual.\n One sailor, an Azerbaijani citizen, was killed in the raid, while those kidnapped are from Turkey, according to the respective governments and a crew list seen by Reuters.\n Accounts from crew, family members and security sources described a sophisticated and well-orchestrated attack, in which armed pirates boarded the ship and breached its protective citadel, possibly with explosives.\n Three sailors remain on the Mozart ship, which by Sunday evening was receiving assistance in Gabonese waters off central Africa.\n \"The ship is in our waters and our sailors are assisting a few nautical miles from Port Gentil,\" said Gabon's presidency spokesman Jessye Ella Ekogha, without providing further detail.\n The Liberian-flagged vessel was headed to Cape Town from Lagos when it was attacked in the Gulf of Guinea, 160 kilometers (100 miles) off Sao Tome island on Saturday, maritime reports showed.\n The ship's fourth captain, Furkan Yaren, had been \"cruising blindly\" toward Gabon with damage to the ship's controls and only the radar working, according to state-run news agency Anadolu. The pirates beat crew members, and left him with an injured leg while another still aboard the ship had shrapnel wounds, Yaren said.\n Turkish media cited Istanbul-based ship owner Boden company as saying the owners and operators of the vessel were abducted at gunpoint. Boden was not immediately available.\n Ambrey, a security company, said four armed men boarded the Mozart and entered the citadel -- where crew are advised to hide in any attack -- from a deck atop the cabin.\n Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's office said on Sunday he was orchestrating officials in the \"rescue of kidnapped ship personnel.\" Erdogan spoke twice by phone with Yaren, who remained aboard after the attack, his office said.\n Edward Yeibo, a Nigerian Navy commander, said he was not aware of the attack and was seeking details. The Lagos naval command office and a spokesman for Nigeria's maritime regulator were not immediately available.\n Pirates in the Gulf, which borders more than a dozen countries, kidnapped 130 sailors in 22 incidents last year, accounting for all but five of those seized worldwide, according to an International Maritime Bureau report.\n The attack on the Mozart could raise international pressure on Nigeria to do more to protect shippers, which have called for tougher action in recent weeks, analysts said.\n \"The fact that someone died, the number of people taken and the apparent use of explosives to breach the ship's citadel means it is a potential game-changer,\" said David Johnson, CEO of the UK-based EOS Risk Group.\n \"It's clearly quite sophisticated and if pirates have decided to use munitions it's a big move,\" he said. There is \"no doubt\" those kidnapped will be taken back to Nigeria's Delta and Turkey will have little hope stopping it, he added.\n Turkey's foreign ministry said the pirates had not made any contact with Ankara.\n Seyit Kaya, brother of the ship's kidnapped 42-year-old captain Mustafa Kaya, a father of two, said in an interview he awaited details from the ship's owner on any possible ransom.\n \"Since that area is where many attacks take place, they take cautions against pirates,\" said Kaya, who is also a sailor.",

        "title": "5 planets found in unusual rhythmic dance around a star 200 light-years away",
        "body_text": "Astronomers have discovered a planetary system including six planets and it's not quite like anything they've seen before. The system could challenge the theories scientists have about how planets form and change over time.\n Our solar system is just one of many planetary systems, and so far, no two systems are alike. The systems vary in the number and type of planets they contain.\n About 200 light-years away from us is the star TOI-178, found in the Sculptor constellation. The research team initially thought there were only two stars orbiting the planet.\n A closer look revealed something else entirely.\n \"Through further observations we realized that there were not two planets orbiting the star at roughly the same distance from it, but rather multiple planets in a very special configuration,\" said lead study author Adrien Leleu, a CHEOPS fellow at the University of Bern, Switzerland, in a statement. (CHEOPS stands for the European Space Agency's CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite.)\n The study published Monday in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n This happens around Jupiter in our solar system as three of its moons, Io, Europa and Ganymede, orbit the gas giant. Io is the closest of the three moons. For every four orbits it completes around Jupiter, Europa completes two and Ganymede completes one. This creates a 4:2:1 pattern.\n The resonant orbits of the TOI-178 system are more complicated. It's one of the longest resonant chains found in a planetary system, the researchers said.\n The five outer planets of the system follow this pattern: 18:9:6:4:3.\n That means for every 18 orbits of the second closest planet to the star, the third planet completes 9.\n A chain of resonance can reveal information about how a planetary system forms and evolves and what it was like in the past.\n Planetary systems can be volatile places in their early days and disruptions caused by the gravitational influence of large planets can disrupt and kick out others. Other times, impacts between planets or other objects can disrupt systems.\n This system has been preserved, hence the resonant orbits. However, the densities of the planets are not well ordered, the researchers said.\n \"It appears there is a planet as dense as the Earth right next to a very fluffy planet with half the density of Neptune, followed by a planet with the density of Neptune. It is not what we are used to,\" said study coauthor Nathan Hara, a postdoctoral researcher and CHEOPS fellow at the Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, in a statement.\n The planets in our solar system are arranged with more dense, rocky planets closest to the sun, while the lower density gaseous planets are farther away.\n \"This contrast between the rhythmic harmony of the orbital motion and the disorderly densities certainly challenges our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems,\" Leleu said.\n Multiple telescopes were used to study the system, including the CHEOPS satellite and multiple ground-based telescopes at the European Southern Observatory in Chile.\n Exoplanets are difficult to observe directly, but the scientists used two methods to observe them. These methods include radial velocity, or observing starlight for telltale wobbles as planets move around a star in orbit, and transiting, or dips in starlight as planets pass in front of stars.\n Both techniques revealed that the planets are much closer and in quicker orbits around their star than Earth is to the sun. For example, the closest planet to the star completes a full orbit in a couple of Earth days; the farthest takes about 10 times that.\n The planets range in type, including rocky and larger than Earth, known as super-Earths, as well as gaseous planets smaller than those in our solar system, called mini-Neptunes.\n While the planets are between one to three times the size of Earth, their masses are 1.5 to 30 times that of Earth.\n None of the planets are considered to be in the habitable zone of the star, or the perfect distance from the host star where these planets could support liquid water, or life, on their surfaces.\n However, more observations of this system could reveal more planets orbiting the star that are in that zone. Future telescopes will be able to directly image some of these exoplanets and peer into their atmospheres, revealing more of the TOI-178 system's secrets.",

        "body_text": "When Congressman Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, announced that he would vote against the second impeachment of President Trump earlier this month, he hinted that he might regret it someday.\n McCaul said he wanted more time to review \"the facts and the evidence\" about the events leading up to the Capitol riot. He said he opposed impeachment \"at this time\" but he added, \"I truly fear there may be more facts that come to light in the future that will put me on the wrong side of this debate.\"\n That quote has been rattling around in my brain all weekend. The public is learning new facts about three different threads of the Trump presidency: Trump's last-ditch coup attempt; the insurrection that triggered impeachment; and his mishandling of the pandemic.\n \"It was even worse than we knew\" is the takeaway...\n Trump's Covid-19 task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx granted an in-depth interview with Margaret Brennan of CBS. Portions aired on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday morning, and the full 89-minute interview is now online in both video and text form. Among the many newsworthy bits: She says she almost never saw or spoke with Trump. She says he was getting a \"parallel set of data and graphics\" that she wasn't privy to. Brennan asked if it was \"disinformation\" but Birx didn't answer.\n Birx's belated confessions drew widespread scrutiny on Sunday. Dr. Seema Yasmin's reaction on Reliable: \"It feels like now she's on a national apology tour, but where was her skepticism... when she was in the administration and had the platform and the position, potentially at least, to be honest with the public?\" Maggie Haberman also offered her insight on Twitter: \"Lots of reporters tried to talk to Birx while she was there. She was not interested. And when she spoke publicly early on, she appeared in lockstep\" with Trump...\n I think we're going to keep learning more and more about how Trump's Covid denial hurt the country.\n Over the weekend The NYT's Donald G. McNeil Jr. went long with Dr. Anthony Fauci about life under Trump, and he said of Birx, \"it was much more of a painful situation for her,\" because she was much more closely tied to the WH. Fauci said Trump sometimes called him to \"express disappointment in me that I was not being more positive,\" and Trump surrounded himself \"with people saying things that didn't make any scientific sense,\" but he always felt it was better to stay at his post rather than resign. \"I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,\" Fauci said. \"Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing back on it, I felt was important.\" Read on...\n Thanks to the efforts of news outlets like the NYT, WSJ, and CNN, we keep finding out more about the last gasps of Trump's coup attempt.\n We're also hearing more and more about the assault on the Capitol. I was struck by this WaPo story the other day, titled \"Self-styled militia members planned on storming the U.S. Capitol days in advance of Jan. 6 attack, court documents say,\" because it quoted messages that one of the accused ring-leaders received during the riot. \"When he posted a one-word message, 'Inside,' he received exhortations and directions describing tunnels, doors and hallways, the FBI said.\" Directions from whom? How? There is so much we still don't know.\n Similarly, this NYT story described how a Capitol Police lieutenant scrambled to protect House lawmakers by piling tables and chairs into a makeshift barricade. \"He had 31 rounds for his service weapon, and he has told others that he feared he might need them all.\" I can't help but wonder: Is this new info sinking in? Or have most people made up their minds about 1/6?\n Maria, a regular \"Reliable Sources\" viewer, emailed me after Sunday's show to say this: \"In my Northwestern Pennsylvania Trump town, it is as if the insurrection did not happen, Trump won the election, Trump was the most successful POTUS ever, and Dems are going to take their freedoms away. Moreover, it was ANTIFA, not MAGA that caused the violence, the insurrection. THERE IS ZERO TALK OF THE INSURRECTION OR THE PANDEMIC and much praise for Trump.\" This is anecdotal, of course, but it's exactly what I see on right-wing radio and TV...\n The AP's Claire Galofaro and Juliet Linderman filed a story about \"bridging the political divide\" datelined Frederick, Maryland, right up Route 80 from where I grew up. The story was ridiculed due to this tweeted summary: \"She thinks the election was stolen from Donald Trump. He believes what dozens of courts and officials have found: that Joe Biden is the rightful winner. They're trying to find common ground but wonder whether they -- and the nation -- can do it.\"\n I get all the criticism -- namely, that she believes in fantasy and he believes in reality, and the story should simply say so. But I really wish people would click past the tweet and read about the subjects of the profile. The story might actually make you more hopeful about our collective future. Yes, the profile subjects \"don't agree on basic facts. They don't even share a vocabulary. They use the same words \u2014 truth, proof, patriotism \u2014 but they don't mean the same thing.\" That's all true. But they are still friends. And that still matters. Read on...\n The articles of impeachment will be walked from the House to the Senate on Monday evening. An impeachment trial is likely to consume the month of February. But \"what's clear,\" CNN's Manu Raju said Sunday, is that \"after comments from GOP senators over the past week, there's virtually no path to 17 votes to convict Trump - unless something changes in trial or the dynamics in the party change.\"\n >> \"Trump has started to believe there are fewer votes to convict than there would have been if the vote had been held almost immediately after Jan. 6,\" Haberman reported Sunday night, citing people familiar with his thinking...\n -- Margaret Hoover on CNN: \"Let's be clear, there's not been a better opportunity for the Republican party to divorce itself from the conspiracy theorists and the kooks than this impeachment trial coming forward.\" (Twitter)\n -- Speaking of conspiracy theorists, Maria Bartiromo will be hosting Fox's 7pm hour this week...\n -- David Folkenflik on Fox's strategy: \"What they're doing is trying to figure out what kind of public posture they can take to retain the greatest possible loyalty and audiences they can...\" (NPR)\n -- Glenn Kessler and co. on \"the final tally of Trump's presidency: 30,573 false or misleading claims \u2014 with nearly half coming in his final year...\" (WaPo)\n -- The \"lost cause\" of election fraud is alive and well on talk radio, including on Rudy Giuliani's WABC radio show in NYC, Azi Paybarah reports... (NYT)\n -- Yet another reminder that America is not really a 50/50 country: \"In his first week in the Oval Office, Pres. Biden yielded high approval ratings for his response to the coronavirus (69%) and confidence in his ability to unify the country (57%),\" per this new ABC/Ipsos poll... (ABC)\n But in many respects Trump WAS graded on a curve throughout his presidency. Every period without a hateful tweet was noted. Every sign of a \"new tone\" was lauded. The bar was set low, far too low, for Trump. Now the Biden team is willingly, gladly raising the bar back up. When WH chief of staff Ron Klain said on Twitter over the weekend that it was great to see Fauci on Rachel Maddow's show -- a place where Fauci was forbidden to go during Trump's time in office -- Klain said Fauci will now be seen \"anywhere else he wants to speak his mind.\" Maddow replied and thanked Klain and said \"I will hold you to it.\" That's the really important part -- the press now has to hold the Biden team to it...",

No cases have been identified in the US, but experts say it's likely there are cases and US surveillance, which has been widely criticized, has not yet found them.\n Moderna will test whether an additional booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine can help protect against emerging variants of the coronavirus, the company said Monday.\n The company said that while two doses of its vaccine are expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date, it expects another dose will be able to boost the vaccine's neutralizing ability.\n The company also said it is developing a new Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against a variant of the coronavirus first spotted in South Africa. The company plans to first test the vaccine in the lab and in a small, Phase 1 clinical trial in the US.\n \"Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa into the clinic to determine if it will be more effective to boost titers against this and potentially future variants,\" Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel said.",

Now, the state health department is advising everyone who attended to get tested for the virus.\n The Louisiana Classic Wrestling Tournament took place earlier this month at the Lamar Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales, a town about 60 miles west of New Orleans. Students, parents and school staff from across the state convened over two days to watch high school wrestling matches.\n \"Anyone who attended the tournament either day -- January 15 or January 16 -- should consider themselves exposed to COVID-19,\" the Louisiana Department of Health's statement said.\n Photos from the event published by the Acadiana Advocate show inconsistent mask use among those in attendance, many of whom were seated within close proximity of each other.\n In total, nearly 1,400 people attended the tournament, which was below the 25% threshold for venue occupancy, which follows the state's sporting event policy during the pandemic, Louisiana High School Athletic Association executive director Eddie Bonine told CNN in an email.\n Bonine said there are no plans to cancel future wrestling events, and the athletic association won't implement additional Covid-19 prevention efforts beyond the mask mandates, limited capacity and screening processes.\n \"The protocols, recommendations and guidelines this association has in place, if adhered to, will keep any and all participants and spectators safe,\" Bonine said. The director said he did not attend the tournament and could not speak to circumstances.\n Ascension Parish, where the wrestling tournament took place, is at \"highest risk\" of Covid-19, according to the state health department's coronavirus case tracker. The parish has seen nearly 10,000 Covid-19 cases among its 126,600-plus residents.\n CNN has reached out to the Lamar Dixon Expo Center for comment and is waiting to hear back.\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally advises against attending indoor events during the pandemic. In its guidelines for youth sports, the CDC specifically names wrestling as a sport that requires players to come within six feet of each other. For wrestling matches during the pandemic, the CDC advises modifying play to avoid competition altogether.\n If sporting events must be held indoors, the CDC says, they should take place only in well-ventilated buildings.

        "body_text": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book \"High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n This quiet is so startling -- like the moment when a siren is switched off -- that it almost seems unreal. Thanks to Twitter, Facebook, and votes cast by the American people, former President Donald Trump has been muted. However, this silence is not the same as absence. He remains, in fact, a threat to the political order, as the more rabid element of the Christian right would be poised to embrace him as a martyr. (Martyrdom has a significant place in the minds of many conservative Evangelicals.)\n The only president ever to be impeached twice, Trump will soon be tried in the Senate on the charge of \"inciting violence against the government of the United States.\" His incitements included months of false claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him and a call for his supporters to \"fight like hell,\" which they heeded by immediately launching a bloody and fatal mob attack on the US Capitol. If found guilty, Trump will almost certainly be punished, in a second vote the that requires merely a majority of Senators present, by a lifetime ban on his ever again holding federal office.\n No matter the outcome of the trial, Trump will still be regarded as a champion by a following that includes many who are familiar with the martyrs of their faith. Among the rioters who broke into the Capitol were many who prayed and others who carried religious symbols -- after they drove legislators from their chamber and occupied it. We should expect some of these supporters, not only to recommit to Trump, but also to visit retribution upon Republicans who fail to defend him in his upcoming trial.\n The danger of a martyred Trump was raised weeks ago by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio when he argued for Congress to let the defeated Trump fade away.  A second impeachment would be \"like pouring gasoline on fire,\" said Rubio after the mob ransacked his workplace. \"And, by the way, I think a lot of the people who are out there for the first time, after seeing what happened last week, sort of reckoning with the last four years, now all of a sudden they're circling the wagons and it threatens to make him a martyr.\"\n One of many Republican officials who openly blend conservative religion and politics, Rubio should know that the mix can be potent. However, failing to impeach and then convict Trump would constitute appeasement on a grand scale. This was what Rubio and other Senate Republicans did when they ignored the evidence and failed to remove Trump at the end of his first impeachment trial. The result was evident for all to see in the president's ferocious effort to overturn the election result and the televised assault on the Capitol.\n In light of everything that happened in the past year, surely Rubio sees how Trump responds when he escapes accountability. Failing to hold him accountable in this second trial would embolden him further and signal to future Trumps that there will be no penalty imposed even if they incite a violent insurrection.\n The members of Congress who voted for Trump's second impeachment, among them 10 Republicans, recognized their duty to the country's present circumstance and to its future.\n When Republican senators like Rubio raise the martyr argument to resist fulfilling their roles in the same way, they obscure the current state of affairs in two ways:\n First, having been impeached a second time, Trump is already a martyr in the eyes of the MAGA faithful.\n Second, as a martyr he poses an immediate threat, not to the nation, but to the Republican Party and those GOP senators who vote to convict him.\n Inside the GOP, the army that gathers behind the martyred Trump can wreak havoc by backing primary challenges against Republicans who fail to defend their leader. With a recent poll indicating that 73% of Republicans actually believe there was widespread voter fraud, their cause will appeal to millions who vote in party primaries.\n Trump himself is well aware of the power of the martyr dynamic. In 2015, he refused to support the idea that Barack Obama be impeached, which had been a fever dream of a number of Republicans. \"In a way you'll make him a martyr,\" warned Trump during a radio interview with the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n But the time for anyone to argue about whether acting to discipline Trump would make him a martyr has long passed. He already is one. Similarly, Republicans are well beyond the point where they should be worried about a schism on the political right. Trump and his followers are already talking about creating their own MAGA party should the GOP fail them.  This schism is happening and the Republican Party as they knew it is already lost.\n The only open question, as Republican senators prepare to try Trump, is whether they are at last willing to protect their country from him.",

Champ is enjoying his new dog bed by the fireplace, and Major loved running around on the South Lawn,\" First Lady Jill Biden's press secretary Michael LaRosa told CNN in a statement Monday.\n The Bidens' dogs moving in marks a return to a longstanding tradition of Presidents and their families bringing their pets with them to the White House. Former President Donald Trump and his family did not have any pets for the four years they lived in the White House.\n Champ has been with the Biden family for more than 10 years -- since December 2008, weeks after Biden became Barack Obama's vice president-elect. Major, a shelter dog, joined the Biden family more recently. He was adopted in November 2018, months before Biden announced he would run for president in the 2020 election cycle.\n Major is the first shelter dog to live in the White House. Earlier this month, the Delaware Humane Association, where he was adopted from, and Pumpkin Pet Insurance hosted a virtual celebration \u2014 an \"Indoguration Party\" \u2014 for Major.\n Though he is the first shelter dog at the White House, Major is not the first rescue. A shelter often receives government funding, whereas animal rescues are often completely run by volunteers.\n Former President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter, Luci, rescued a mixed-breed pup abandoned by his owner at a gas station in Texas named Yuki. Former President Bill Clinton's family cat, Socks, was also a rescue.\n Jill Biden has also said she would \"love to get a cat,\" telling Fox 5 in Washington, \"I love having animals around the house.\"\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday she did not have an update about the cat.\n \"I'm also wondering about the cat, because the cat is going to dominate the internet whenever the cat is announced and wherever that cat is found,\" Psaki said in a Sunday evening video answering questions posed on Twitter.\n The tradition of keeping pets in the White House dates back to Thomas Jefferson, who kept a mockingbird and a couple of bear cubs during his presidency. Throughout the years, presidential pets have become celebrities of sorts.\n This story has been updated with additional information.\n CNN's Kate Bennett contributed to this story.",

The increased activity was met with pandemic precautions, including mask wearing.\n On Sunday, the first dogs arrived from Delaware, where they had been waiting until things were unpacked and settled enough to allow a comfortable entry for the two German Shepherds at their new pad.\n \"Champ is enjoying his new dog bed by fireplace and Major loved running around the South Lawn,\" the White House said a press release early Monday morning. Champ lived at the vice president's residence during the Biden's time there, and Major was adopted by the family in 2018 from a Delaware pet rescue.\n Sunday saw a church-and-bagel run by the President, son Hunter and granddaughters Finnegan and Maisy. The narrow streets of Georgetown were clogged with motorcade vehicles while Hunter ran to grab bagels from Call Your Mother, a popular deli. (The choice of stop was tinged with a shmear of swamp: one of Call Your Mother's owners and investors is Jeff Zients, Biden's Covid \"czar.\" According to the Washingtonian, much of the recipe-testing for the deli's first location was done in Zients' kitchen.)\n Biden's visit to a DC dining establishment on Day 5 of his presidency already ties him with the number of local restaurants former President Donald Trump visited. In his four years in Washington, Trump seldom ate out and when he did, only did so at one place -- the steakhouse at the Trump hotel.\n Yet all of the new people in the White House residence meant more stringent Covid-19 precautions, a stark reminder of the pandemic amid a week of celebratory events.\n \"The family was good about it,\" said the White House source of adherence to mask-wearing and being socially distant from staffers.\n \"Every employee is masked especially when near the family,\" added a longtime residence staff member who said the Biden family does remove their masks once on the second floor of their private quarters. The staff member told CNN that the majority of the residence workers -- including ushers, butlers, housekeepers and cooks -- have had at least the first round of Covid-19 vaccination and several have received both shots.\n The White House did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the staff vaccinations.\n The residence staff is operating \"as usual,\" said the first White House source, noting the departure of chief usher and Trump hire, Timothy Harleth, which occurred on Inauguration Day. The move was initiated by a senior Biden administration official prior to the first family's arrival at the White House. White House residence staff typically stay on in their roles through different administrations, politically unaffiliated with presidents and first ladies. But Harleth was hired by Melania Trump in 2017 from Trump's Washington hotel, where he was a manager. In recent weeks, he had made a play to stay in the Biden White House, say several sources, to no avail.\n \"He was not particularly well-liked,\" said a former White House official of Harleth's reputation inside the White House, adding there was friction between Harleth and Trump's social secretary.\n The chief usher's office is currently being operated by Katie Hinson, who was deputy chief usher under Trump, until the first lady installs her choice to fill the role of chief.\n Kate Anderson Brower contributed to this report.",

Despite the trillions of dollars in relief packages worldwide, global recovery is rather shaky and the outlook remains uncertain,\" Xi said.\n The Chinese president called on governments \"to abandon ideological prejudice and jointly follow a path of peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.\"\n Xi continued his theme of inclusion throughout the address, adding: \"To build small circles or start a new Cold War ... will only push the world into division and even confrontation.\"\n The President said actors in the global community should not be \"beating each other like a wrestling area,\" and warned the world was at risk of falling \"back into the world of the jungle\" if multilateralism is abandoned.\n Xi also called for commitment from all countries to promote and maintain smooth supply chains, particularly during the pandemic, and said that vaccines should be considered public goods and be made affordable for all countries.\n \"It is especially important to scale up cooperation on the R&D [research and development], production and distribution of vaccines and make them public goods that are truly accessible and affordable to people in all countries,\" he said.\n The Chinese leader added that his nation had provided help to more than 150 countries and 13 international organizations, as well as sending 36 teams of medical experts to countries in need. He also stressed that China would \"continue to share its experience\" while working for greater accessibility of Covid-19 vaccines in developing countries.\n \"We hope these efforts will contribute to an early and complete victory over the coronavirus throughout the world,\" Xi said.\n A year has passed since the central Chinese city of Wuhan was placed under the world's first coronavirus lockdown on January 23. It has not reported a local infection in months. And while many countries have been forced to reintroduce stay-at-home measures, China has rescinded many of the regulations it put in place to tame the virus.\n Monday's speech was the second time Xi has addressed political and business leaders at the WEF event, which is normally held in Davos, Switzerland, but was postponed until the summer as a result of the ongoing pandemic. His previous address was in 2017, days before Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States.\n Biden is inheriting a tense, complicated relationship with China from his predecessor. The Trump administration spent the bulk of the last four years piling pressure on the United States' biggest economic rival. In recent weeks, things have only become more heated as Washington slapped additional restrictions on Chinese business and investment.\n At a regular press briefing after Xi's remarks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US would approach China with \"strategic patience\" but emphasized that the relationship was a \"serious competition.\"\n \"We're in a serious competition with China, strategic competition with China's defining feature of the 21st century. China's engaged in conduct that hurts American workers, blunts our technological edge and threatens our alliances and our influence in international organizations,\" Psaki said.\n \"What we've seen over the last few years is that China's growing more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad and Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity and values in significant ways that require a new US approach, and this is one of the reasons as we were talking about a little bit earlier, that we want to approach this with some strategic patience,\" she added.\n The Davos Agenda event continues throughout the week with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among the speakers.\n CNN's Jill Disis and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nOn the surface, Wuhan bustles like a city that has never known a paralyzing 76-day lockdown.\n At dawn, market vendors busily unload fresh fruits and vegetables. Office workers fill popular eateries during their lunch breaks. As dusk falls, elderly couples descend on the city's parks, practicing dance moves by the Yangtze River. Red lanterns have been erected around the city in anticipation of the Lunar New Year celebrations.\n A year has passed since the central Chinese city of 11 million people was placed under the world's first coronavirus lockdown on January 23. At least 3,869 Wuhan residents died from the virus, which has since claimed more than two million lives around the globe.\n The world was stunned when flights, trains and buses leaving Wuhan were canceled, highways were blocked and people were ordered to stay in their homes, relying on officials and volunteers for daily necessities. Initially, it was difficult for patients, families and even some healthcare workers to reach hospitals.\n But the Chinese government has since heralded those drastic steps as crucial to curbing the initial outbreak, and similar measures have now been enforced in countries around the world -- with some cities, and even whole countries, outside China undergoing multiple lockdowns.\n In that context, Wuhan can be seen as  a success story in taming the virus. It has not reported a local coronavirus infection for months. But the severe measures also came at a huge personal cost to residents, and despite the apparent return to normal life, deep emotional scars still haunt the city, David Culver and Nectar Gan write.\n Unlike fabric and surgical masks, which protect other people from larger respiratory droplets emitted when the wearer breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes -- in other words, outflowing air -- medical-grade masks (for example FFP1, FFP2, KN95, and N95 masks) protect the wearer by filtering both outflowing and inflowing air. They can also provide some level of protection against smaller droplets, or aerosols. When fitted correctly, FFP2 masks can filter at least 94% of particles, while N95 masks can filter at least 95% of particles.\n And while the tight weave of surgical masks offer a high level of outflowing protection -- which is why they're used by medical professionals around patients -- cloth masks are more hit or miss. Their efficacy depends on the number of layers of fabric and the type of fabric used -- most don't have any sort of safety rating.\n Send your questions here.

That's how long it took the world's top 1,000 billionaires to recoup their fortunes after the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n It could take the world's poorest  more than a decade to recover, according to Oxfam International's annual inequality report. The report, released on Sunday ahead of the World Economic Forum's virtual meeting of political and financial leaders, typically held in Davos, Switzerland, lays out the virus' disparate impact around the globe. The pandemic could increase economic inequality in almost every country at once, the first time this has happened, Oxfam found.\n \"We stand to witness the greatest rise in inequality since records began. The deep divide between the rich and poor is proving as deadly as the virus,\" said Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam's executive director. \"Rigged economies are funneling wealth to a rich elite who are riding out the pandemic in luxury, while those on the front line of the pandemic \u2014 shop assistants, health care workers, and market vendors \u2014 are struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table.\"\n Scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are speaking with British health officials to learn more about data that suggests a new coronavirus variant could be more deadly. A report released Friday states there is \"a realistic possibility\" that the Covid-19 variant first detected in the United Kingdom has a higher death rate than other variants. While the data is not conclusive, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said \"there is some evidence that the new variant ... may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\" Other strains have also been identified in South Africa and Brazil.\n CDC modeling shows this new strain could become the predominant variant in the United States by March. Only 195 cases of the new variant have been spotted in the US so far, according to the CDC, but public health officials believe many more cases are going undetected. Cases have been found in 22 states, the CDC says, with California and Florida detecting a particularly high number.\n Reacting to the new data in an interview with CBS on Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it should be assumed that the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK, B.1.1.7, does have the power to cause more damage, including deaths. But he also noted that both the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines \"seem to continue to be protective against the mutant strain. It is a very minor diminution, but the cushion that you have of efficacy is so large that it's not going to negatively impact.\"\n The words \"vaccine passport\" have a reassuring ring to them, perhaps conjuring up the image of a sleek, embossed document with watermarked pages and official stamps of approval. Flourished at border controls, such a passport could open travel doors that, for so many of us, have been closed by Covid-19.\n Some destinations -- including the Seychelles, Cyprus and Romania -- have already lifted quarantine requirements to visitors able to prove they're vaccinated. Others, such as Iceland and Hungary, have opened up to people who've recovered from Covid-19.\n This raises the prospect that proof of inoculation or immunity could be the golden ticket to rebooting travel and seems to be good news for people eager to book summer vacations after months of lockdown, particularly as vaccine rollouts gather pace.\n But the concept of immunity passports remains deeply contentious, and anyone banking on them for a 2021 summer vacation could be disappointed. While there's a strong argument that globally recognized inoculation documentation could help reconnect the planet, fears remain over what protection they actually afford, how they might be abused and what all of that means for those still awaiting jabs.\n The world is edging closer to a new grim milestone: 100 million cases. President Biden will formally reinstate Covid travel restrictions for non-US travelers from Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and much of Europe on Monday, a White House official confirmed to CNN.More than three dozen Capitol Police officers have tested positive for coronavirus since the Capitol riot on January 6, the union representing the Capitol Police told CNN Sunday. Residents of a city in northeast China have taken to social media to complain that a stringent coronavirus lockdown has left them short of food and medicine, triggering an online uproar and an apology from local officials.Israel will introduce a week-long ban on most incoming and outgoing flights from Monday night, in an attempt to slow the spread of new coronavirus variants. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has become the latest world leader to test positive for the coronavirus.Protests against a Covid curfew in the Netherlands descended into looting and clashes with police in cities across the country on Sunday.The travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand has been suspended for 72 hours after the South African variant of Covid-19 was detected in a woman who had quarantined for 14 days in New Zealand.\n As many people postpone necessary medical care due to the pandemic, medical professionals are worried that their patients will get sick or even die from other causes.\n Some 25% of Americans said that they or someone in their household had delayed medical care in the past month due to coronavirus, according to a December Kaiser Family Foundation study. An earlier report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 41% of Americans delayed medical care, including 12% who postponed urgent or emergency care.\n We talked to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, to get her advice on which appointments can be postponed and which cannot, and what precautions people should be taking when going to their doctor.

Sign up here.)\n The US has now recorded more than 25 million coronavirus cases, and experts say it's time to double down on safety measures and speed up vaccine administration to keep the already unfathomable numbers from spiraling further out of control. Still, healthy young Americans may not have access to a vaccine until mid- to late summer. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said a big problem is there's not enough information about how much vaccine is available. The CDC is also reviewing data that suggests the UK coronavirus variant could, in fact, be more deadly than the original strain. Meanwhile, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci are speaking out about their time working with the Trump administration on coronavirus efforts. Birx says former President Trump was presented with and used data about the virus that she had never seen. Fauci said Trump surrounded himself with people who said things that \"didn't make any scientific sense.\"\n President Biden is gearing up for a week of executive actions addressing commerce, climate concerns, health care, immigration and other top-line issues. Among them, Biden is expected to repeal Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military as early as today. Also today, he's due to reinstate Covid-19 travel restrictions on non-US citizens who have been in Brazil, Ireland, the UK and much of Europe. Transportation officials are already considering ways to enforce Biden's recent mask mandate for interstate travel. Elsewhere in the new administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is ordering a review of the Pentagon's sexual assault and harassment prevention programs. Biden's administration is also facing pressure to investigate more into the recent SolarWinds hack, allegedly perpetrated by Russian entities.\n The Justice Department has unveiled new criminal charges against alleged Capitol rioters, including a Federal Aviation Administration employee. Another rioter was charged with threatening to assassinate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that in the days leading up to the Capitol riot, Trump pushed the Justice Department to directly ask the Supreme Court to invalidate Biden's election win. The New Year's weekend effort reportedly failed after Trump's DOJ appointees refused to file the case. Trump's Senate impeachment trial will start the week of February 8, a move intended to give his legal team more time to prepare.\n The UK is adjusting to its new Brexit reality, and the fishing industry is being hit especially hard, with fresh catches reportedly being left to rot as exporters cannot get them to the European Union. Some logistics firms worry that importing and exporting may not even be viable for some businesses unless a different deal is struck with the EU. Shipping has become a problem, too, and businesses have reported piles of returned packages. The UK's economy has contracted in the first quarter, leading to real concerns about a double-dip recession amid ongoing pandemic challenges.\n Protesters gathered last night in Tacoma, Washington, one day after a Tacoma police officer drove into a crowd. The officer was among units responding Saturday to an incident involving about 100 people. The crowd reportedly surrounded his vehicle and hit it. A statement from Tacoma police said the officer feared for his life and tried to back up but could not. Graphic video of the incident shows the car approaching the crowd, backing up once it's surrounded, then accelerating. The back tires of the vehicle can be seen rolling over someone lying in the street. The incident comes as police departments across the country face scrutiny over how they use deadly force.\n This Super Bowl is going to be so ... red.\n The mission set the record for the most satellites on a rocket -- no open seats on that flight!\n He's embraced his new role as a cozy fashion inspiration.\n A truly bittersweet goodbye.\n Some husbands dream about accidentally showing up to work in their underwear, and others dream of $60 million premonitions.\n Tributes are still pouring in for Hank Aaron, baseball legend and Hall of Famer, who passed away Friday at the age of 86 ...\n ... and CNN icon and former TV host Larry King, who passed away Saturday at the age of 87.\n That's how many Capitol Police officers tested positive for Covid-19 following the Capitol riot. It's unclear how many of them were on duty during the attack. But health official warned that the crowds, largely unmasked, could have been a breeding ground for the virus.\n \"What happened this morning was not an act of simple gun violence. ...

        "body_text": "Anti-vaccine groups are exploiting the suffering and death of people who happen to fall ill after receiving a covid shot, threatening to undermine the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history.\n In some cases, anti-vaccine activists are fabricating stories of deaths that never occurred.\n \"This is exactly what anti-vaccine groups do,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious diseases specialist and author of \"Preventing the Next Pandemic: Vaccine Diplomacy in a Time of Anti-Science.\"\n Anti-vaccine groups have falsely claimed for decades that childhood vaccines cause autism, weaving fantastic conspiracy theories involving government, Big Business and the media.\n Now, the same groups are blaming patients' coincidental medical problems on covid shots, even when it's clear that age or underlying health conditions are to blame, Hotez said. \"They will sensationalize anything that happens after someone gets a vaccine and attribute it to the vaccine,\" Hotez said.\n As more seniors receive their first covid shots, many will inevitably suffer from unrelated heart attacks, strokes and other serious medical problems \u2014 not because of the vaccine but, rather, their age and declining health, said epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n For example, in a group of 10 million people, nearly 800 people ages 55 to 64 typically die of heart attacks or coronary disease in one week, Osterholm said. Public health officials \"are not ready\" for the onslaught of news and social media stories to come, he cautioned.\n \"The media will write a story that John Doe got his vaccine at 8 a.m. and at 4 p.m. he had a heart attack,\" Osterholm said on his weekly podcast. \"They will make assumptions that it's cause and effect.\"\n Public health officials need to do a better job communicating the risks \u2014 real and imagined \u2014 from vaccines, said Osterholm, who served on President Joe Biden's transition coronavirus advisory board.\n \"You get one chance to make a first impression,\" Osterholm said. \"Even if we come back later and say, \"No, [the deaths] had nothing to do with vaccination, it was coronary artery disease,' the damage has already been done.\"\n Anti-vaccine groups such as the National Vaccine Information Center and Children's Health Defense, founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are already inflaming fears about a handful of deaths \u2014 mostly in Europe \u2014 that have followed the worldwide rollout of immunizations.\n In a blog post, Kennedy scoffed at autopsy results that concluded a Portuguese woman's death was unrelated to a vaccine. He cast doubt on statements by medical authorities in Denmark who said the deaths of two people there after vaccination were due to old age and chronic lung disease. In an interview, Kennedy said the post-vaccination deaths of some very frail and terminally ill nursing home patients in Norway are a danger sign. Norwegian officials have said the elderly patients died of their underlying illnesses, not from the vaccine.\n \"Coincidence is turning out to be quite lethal to COVID vaccine recipients,\" Kennedy wrote. Kennedy described the deaths as suspicious, accusing medical officials of following an \"all-too-familiar vaccine propaganda playbook\" and \"strategic chicanery.\"\n Here in the U.S., vaccine opponents have pounced on the tragedy of Dr. Gregory Michael, a 56-year-old Florida obstetrician-gynecologist, to sow doubts about vaccine safety and government oversight. Michael died Jan. 5 after suffering a catastrophic drop in platelets \u2014 elements in the blood that control bleeding \u2014 suggesting he may have developed immune thrombocytopenia.\n According to a Facebook post by his wife, Heidi Neckelmann, doctors tried a variety of treatments to save her husband, but none worked.\n A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the agency is investigating Michael's death, as it does for all suspected vaccine-related health problems.\n California authorities had recommended pausing vaccinations with a particular batch of covid vaccines made by Moderna because of a high rate of allergic reactions. Following an investigation, vaccinations resumed a few days later.\n \"We're going to see these events happen, and we have to follow up on every one of these cases,\" Osterholm said. \"I don't want people to think that we're sweeping them under the rug.\"\n Many Americans were already nervous about covid vaccines, with 27% saying they \"probably or definitely\" would not get a shot, even if the shots were free and deemed safe by scientists, according to a December survey by KFF. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)\n These people may be particularly susceptible to vaccine misinformation, said Rory Smith, research manager at First Draft, a nonprofit that reports on misinformation online.\n Seven experts in blood disorders interviewed by KHN said there's not enough information available to blame Michael's decline on a vaccine and that the demonstrated benefits of covid vaccinations vastly outweigh any potential risk of bleeding. Even if investigators conclude that Michael's vaccine caused his death, it would still be an incredibly rare event, given that more than 20 million doses have been administered.\n \"It shouldn't give anyone pause about whether the vaccine is safe or not,\" said Dr. James Zehnder, a hematologist and director of clinical pathology at Stanford Medicine.\n Michael's bleeding disorder could have been developing silently for some time, said Dr. Adam Cuker, director of the Penn Blood Disorders Center at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. It could be a coincidence that Michael started showing symptoms shortly after vaccination, he said. About 30 Americans are diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia every day.\n The timing of Michael's illness suggests it had another cause, doctors said. According to his wife's Facebook post, his bleeding problems began three days after his first covid shot. It takes the body 10 to 14 days after vaccination to generate antibodies, which would be needed to cause immune thrombocytopenia, said Dr. Cindy Neunert, a pediatric hematologist at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.\n In most cases, the cause of thrombocytopenia is never known, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n Immune thrombocytopenia is linked, rarely, to certain vaccines, with about 26 cases for every 1 million doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.\n But it can also be caused by viruses themselves, including measles and the novel coronavirus, said Dr. Sven Olson, an assistant professor of hematology-medical oncology at Oregon Health & Science University's school of medicine.\n Many patients with immune thrombocytopenia are now wondering if they should be vaccinated against covid, Cuker said. Cuker said he urges nervous patients to be vaccinated, noting that any problems could be managed by closely monitoring their platelet levels and adjusting medication if needed.\n Even in patients with underlying bleeding conditions, \"it's still safer to get vaccinated than to get covid,\" Zehnder said.\n \"If you give a vaccine to a large enough number of people, there are going to be rare adverse events but there are also going to be coincidental events unrelated to the vaccine,\" Cuker said. \"If an anti-vaccine group uses a single case, where no link has been proven, to discourage people from vaccination, that's terrible.\"\n Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center, said her site provides balanced information from reputable news sources, including CNN, CBS and the Miami Herald, as well as Pfizer and the CDC.\n In an interview with KHN, Kennedy said he questions why government officials have been so quick to dismiss connections between vaccinations and deaths. \"How in the world do they know if it's a vaccine injury or not?\" he asked.\n \"We don't discourage anybody from getting vaccinated,\" Kennedy said. \"All we're doing is conveying the data, which is what the government should be doing. ... We print the truth, which is what the medical agencies ought to do.\"\n Opponents of vaccination have belittled concerns about the novel coronavirus for months, opposing masks and fighting stay-at-home orders and contact tracing, said Richard Carpiano, a professor of public policy and sociology at the University of California-Riverside.\n \"They have come out against every public health measure to control the pandemic,\" Carpiano said. \"They have said public health is public enemy No. 1.\"\n Recently, anti-vaccine activists have been so eager to discredit immunizations that they have blamed covid for the deaths of people who are very much alive.\n Social media users selectively edited a video of a Tennessee nurse, Tiffany Dover to make it appear as if she dropped dead after being vaccinated, when in fact she simply fainted, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the UC Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. Although Dover quickly recovered, social media users posted a fake death certificate and obituary. Anti-vaccine activists also harassed Dover and her family online, said Reiss, who chronicled Dover's ordeal in a blog post.\n Anti-vaccine activists are adept at manipulating video, Smith said.\n \"They are notorious for using videos and images purportedly showing the adverse effects of vaccines, such as autism in children and seizures in other vaccine recipients,\" Smith said. \"The more emotive and graphic the videos and images \u2014 irrespective of whether it's actually linked at all to vaccines or not \u2014 the better.\"\n In December, multiple Facebook posts falsely claimed that an Alabama nurse died after receiving one of the state's first covid vaccines. One Twitter user went so far as to identify the nurse as Jennifer McClung, who worked at Helen Keller Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama. In fact, McClung died of covid. Social media posts spread so widely that Alabama health department officials contacted every hospital in the state to confirm that no vaccinated staff member had died.\n Anti-vaccine groups often build fables around \"a tiny, tiny grain of truth,\" Smith said. \"This is why misinformation, specifically vaccine misinformation, can be so convincing. ... But this information is almost always taken completely out of context, creating claims that are either misleading or outright false.\"\n The Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity twisted a news story about the deaths of 24 people at an upstate New York nursing home, incorrectly blaming their deaths on covid vaccinations. The original article noted, however, that a covid outbreak at the nursing home began in late December, before residents received any vaccines. Covid vaccines, which require two doses for full protection, did not arrive in time to save the residents' lives.\n Kennedy repeated the misinformation \u2014 again incorrectly blaming the residents' deaths on vaccines \u2014 in his blog, although he linked to a local news station that reported the information correctly.\n Distorting facts to discourage vaccination, Cuker said, is \"very irresponsible and damaging to public health.\"\n KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
