Jacob Kohut spends his days fulfilling two duties: serving to protect the Capitol building and holding band class online as a commitment to his students' education.\n \"This is what a hero looks like,\" wrote Canterbury Woods Elementary School, a school where Kohut teaches in Fairfax County, Virginia, in a post to social media. \"A member of the DC National Guard, our band teacher Dr. Jake Kohut has been working around the clock since Wednesday to protect our nation's capital. And between shifts, he is dedicated to CWES students, teaching from DC.\"\n Up to 25,000 National Guard members have been authorized to help provide security for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, according to a National Guard Bureau news release Friday.\n The increase in service members comes as law enforcement in the nation's capital and around the country prepare for the possibility of more extremist violence after the deadly riots at the US Capitol on January 6.\n Kohut told CNN it was important to continue teaching his students while carrying out his Guard duties due to the challenges of the digital learning environment.\n \"It's difficult being virtual and doing music,\" said Kohut. \"If I can be there for the kids even though I'm down here, then it's kind of a no-brainer, that's what I'm going to do, even if I'm tired.\"\n Kohut said he starts his day early and teaches during breaks in his shifts. In one photo, he was captured holding a teaching class through video conference holding a flute while sitting in the back of a Humvee.\n Kohut says it is an honor to serve in both capacities when it's possible.\n \"I'm a soldier for the Constitution and a soldier for music education,\" said Kohut. \"I do both with a full heart.\"",

        "title": "China and WHO acted too slowly to contain Covid-19, says independent panel",
        "body_text": "China and the World Health Organization (WHO) could have acted quicker and more forcefully to contain the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, an independent review panel said on Monday.\n In its second interim report, the Switzerland-based Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response determined that Beijing could have been more vigorous in applying public health measures when cases were first detected in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province.\n \"What is clear to the panel is that public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January (2020),\" the report said.\n The first cases in Wuhan occurred between December 12 and December 29, 2019 according to city authorities. The cases weren't reported to WHO until December 31. By the time Wuhan went under lockdown on January 23, 2020 the virus had already spread to Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States.\n Several countries, most vocally the US and Australia, have accused Beijing of downplaying the outbreak's severity during its early stages, and preventing an effective response until it was too late.\n In response, China said it agrees there is always room for improvement but shut down the notion that it means the country is doing poorly regarding the pandemic.\n \"About this I want to say that we should certainly try to do better. I think any country, including China, the US, the UK, Japan, and any other country,  should try to do better, because I think there is always no best, only better, when it comes to public health issues,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.\n \"But I think there is another point that needs attention here,\" Hua said. She added that the idea that China should aim to work better is not the same as saying it is not doing well, adding that Western media has portrayed it that way.\n \"The former means that we need to constantly reform ourselves, improve ourselves, and constantly improve our ability to govern, aiming at the absolute perfection. I think this is precisely why China can continue to develop and make progress. The latter may be somewhat biased and carping,\" Hua said.\n The independent panel, co-chaired by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, also criticized WHO for its delays in sounding the alarm, and called for reforms to the UN agency.\n Despite being alerted to the cases by the end of December, 2019 WHO did not convene its emergency committee until January 22, 2020 -- and then waited until January 30 before declaring an international emergency.\n \"It is not clear why the committee did not meet until the third week of January, nor is it clear why it was unable to agree on the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern when it was first convened,\" the report said.\n The report also highlighted that WHO did not declare the outbreak a pandemic until March 11, 2020 after some health experts and media outlets had already begun adopting the term. By that time, there were already 118,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths worldwide.\n \"Although the term pandemic is neither used nor defined in the International Health Regulations (2005), its use does serve to focus attention on the gravity of a health event,\" the report said.\n It concluded that WHO \"has been underpowered to do the job expected of it.\" WHO has a \"gravely limited\" power to validate reports of disease outbreaks for pandemic potential, or to deploy support to local areas, it said.\n The international community needs to achieve a \"global reset\" on how it tackles pandemics, said the review panel, which is scheduled to present a final report at the World Health Assembly in May.",

        "title": "UPDATE: California pauses giving out shots from one lot of coronavirus vaccine",
        "body_text": "This story has been updated with a statement from Moderna saying the lot was shipped to 37 states.\nHealth officials in California are telling medical providers across the state not to administer doses from one lot of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine while they investigate possible severe allergic reactions last week in a number of people who got shots at a community vaccination clinic.\n Moderna said 37 different states got shipments from the lot, which included more than 1.2 million doses, and said most had likely been used.\n In California, more than 330,000 doses from the lot were distributed to 287 providers across the state from January 5-12. Tens of thousands of doses may have already been administered, but the number of unused doses is unknown, according to Darrel Ng, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health.\n CDPH said Sunday that fewer than 10 people at a clinic in San Diego who received Covid-19 shots from the lot  required medical attention over the span of 24 hours. The state said it was not aware of anyone at any of the other 286 sites who had similar allergic reactions after receiving vaccine from the lot.\n California's health department said it recommended pausing the entire lot, noting that there are not immediate replacement doses in addition to what had already been ordered.\n \"Out of an extreme abundance of caution and also recognizing the extremely limited supply of vaccine, we are recommending that providers use other available vaccine inventory,\" Dr. Erica Pan, California's state epidemiologist, said in the statement.\n Moderna issued a statement Wednesday saying the lot had gone to other states, also.\n \"Moderna confirmed that a total of 1,272,200 doses were produced in batch number 041L20A, with nearly a million doses (964,900) already distributed to approximately 1,700 vaccination sites in 37 states,\" the company said.\n It said about 307,00 doses were in storage and not yet distributed. \"While Moderna said it does not know how many doses may have ended up in arms of people, it did report that the lot was shipped between January 4th and January 8th, and thus it expects that a significant portion of the distributed doses have been already used,\" the company said.\n Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said historically there is no such thing as a bad vaccine lot.\n \"The (US Food and Drug Administration) is generally so good at making sure that there is no lot-to-lot variation that you don't have a problem with so-called hot lots,\" he said.\n State health officials didn't provide details on the symptoms associated with the allergic reactions but did provide a link to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website about anaphylaxis -- a severe allergic reaction -- which can occur after getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Symptoms of anaphylaxis can include shortness of breath, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, dizziness and fainting. The CDC considers an allergic reaction to a Covid-19 vaccine to be severe if the person needs to be treated with epinephrine or must go to the hospital.\n Offit, a top US vaccine expert who is a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, said California's decision to hold back doses of vaccine carries its own risks, especially since allergic reactions can be monitored and treated and, in this case, they occurred at only one location.\n \"There are going to be people who either aren't getting this vaccine or aren't getting their second doses of vaccine, which then puts them at risk in a situation where we have a virus which is rapidly spreading in the country,\" Offit said. \"There's going to be another probably roughly 100,000 people that die over the next couple of months, and among those people could be those who are not getting this vaccine because of quote-unquote 'an abundance of caution.'\"\n Thirty thousand doses from the lot were pulled from San Diego County's supply, according to the county. On Monday, Santa Clara County said in a statement that 21,800 doses from the lot had been allocated to the county, and that none of the doses had been administered.\n California officials acknowledged the risk of a serious adverse reaction to the vaccine is small, noting that while less data exists for Moderna's vaccine, only approximately 1 in 100,000 people experience anaphylaxis with the similar Pfizer vaccine.\n \"The thing about anaphylaxis is although it is frightening to watch, it's easily identified, it's quickly identified, and it's easily treated with epinephrine,\" Offit said. \"I don't see how taking this off the market is a conservative thing to do or exercising an abundance of caution. I think all it does is put people at risk unnecessarily.\" Vaccination sites are supposed to monitor people for side effects 15 minutes after they've been vaccinated. Sites are also required to have the means to treat a person for allergic reaction, if needed.\n \"None of the other places that used it had a problem. It was just one place. So do a careful examination of what was happening at that place,\" Offit added.\n Officials said an investigation by the CDC, the US Food and Drug Administration, Moderna and the state is ongoing.\n \"We're not saying throw them away. We're not saying don't ever give them,\" Ng told CNN Monday, noting the state hopes to have an update this week.",

        "title": "Melania Trump's disappointing break with tradition",
        "body_text": "Kate Andersen Brower is a CNN contributor and the author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies,\" \"Team Of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump,\" \"First in Line: Presidents, Vice Presidents and the Pursuit of Power,\" and \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\" Her most recent book is for children, \"Exploring the White House: Inside America's Most Famous Home.\" The opinions expressed here are hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nUnderstandably lost in the morass of the horrifying things that have happened leading up to Joe Biden's inauguration is something that did not happen. Melania Trump will become the first modern first lady not to invite the woman who will replace her to the White House for a walk-through of the private living quarters on the second and third floors.\n From Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower's meeting, to the visit Laura Bush hosted where Jenna and Barbara Bush showed Sasha and Malia Obama how to slide down the banister in the Residence, to the visit where Michelle Obama invited Melania Trump even after Donald Trump had questioned her husband's citizenship, this tradition has long been one of the first lady's many unwritten obligations. And Melania Trump has discarded it.\n It's perhaps unsurprising that Melania Trump has flouted a social norm of her position. Every one-term president -- and his wife -- have felt the sting of defeat, but unlike her husband, none of them have refused to accept the election results. Betty Ford was furious when her husband lost his 1976 race to Jimmy Carter. \"No matter who follows you, you know they didn't deserve to be there,\" she once said. Scathing, yes, but brutally honest. Ford canceled the tour she was to give to Rosalynn Carter twice, and when it finally did take place, Carter said she received a \"brief, but cordial\" walk-through. The important thing, though, is that it happened.\n Ceremony matters. Traditions matter. Our expectations about what's normal and civil behavior in our society matters. The usually peaceful transfer of power happens once or twice a decade. Lady Bird Johnson called Inauguration Day \"the great quadrennial American pageant,\" and I agree. It's a rare event when we're reminded that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, and while a meeting over tea served on silver platters in the Residence between two powerful women married to presidents might seem quaint, that tradition is meaningful. It grounds us, knowing that two people who may have very little in common are acknowledging that something as momentous as the transfer of presidential power also touches the lives of real families not so unlike ours.\n Another difficult transition came in 1980, after Carter lost to Ronald Reagan, and Rosalynn Carter had to give Nancy Reagan the tour. Still, she dutifully walked Reagan through the second and third floors, describing her efforts to showcase American paintings. But the outgoing first lady abruptly cut things short without showing Reagan the presidential bedroom and study. The mood was reinforced by the temperature: Jimmy Carter, because of the ongoing energy crisis, insisted on keeping the living quarters a cool 65 degrees during the day and 55 at night.\n \"The chill in her manner,\" Nancy later wrote, \"matched the chill in the room.\"\n These meetings aren't always filled with tension; they sometimes set the stage for long-lasting relationships. Michelle Obama and Laura Bush were able to work together later in part because of those first interactions.\n The transition from the Bushes to the Obamas is considered one of the smoothest in modern history, though Laura had to put aside some ill will during that visit. As she wrote in her memoir, \"It is easy to criticize a sitting president when you are not the one in the Oval Office, when you are not responsible for the decisions that must be made...I thought of that when I heard the daily rants from the campaign trail. It got so that even the weather seemed to be George's fault.\"\n Barack Obama, she felt, was more consumed with attacking her husband than he was with going after his rival for the presidency, John McCain.\n But Laura Bush invited Michelle Obama to the White House twice, once alone and once with her daughters. She showed her the dressing room window, which has a view through the Rose Garden to the West Wing, where first ladies can occasionally catch a glimpse of their husbands at work It's a standard stop on the tour. But the first stop on Laura Bush's tour was special: The bedrooms she thought Sasha and Malia, then ages 7 and 10, would like best.\n These visits make the presidency -- and all the family roles that go with it -- more connected to the humanity of the people who hold them. In their meeting as mothers with young daughters were perhaps the seeds of the moment in 2014 when Obama, then first lady, and Bush hosted a meeting (coinciding with President Obama's US - Africa Leaders Summit) with the spouses of African leaders that focused on the role they could play to improve education and health care in their countries.\n At a 2016 event at the George W. Bush Presidential Center, Michelle Obama praised her predecessor. \"As you all know, I deeply admire and respect Laura. And I think that it's important to collaborate with people you admire and respect, regardless of party. That's what makes a democracy work, truly.\" Last April, the two former first ladies participated in a joint event to raise money for Covid- 19 response. A collaboration like this is hard to imagine between Melania Trump and any other first lady.\n Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama will attend Joe Biden's inauguration and after they will join Biden at Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton will also be there. This display of unity will bring Melania Trump's decision to do away with tradition into stark relief.\n When Hillary Clinton gave Laura Bush her tour, she led her to that window in the first lady's dressing room and said, \"Your mother-in-law stood right here and told me that from this window you can see straight down into the Rose Garden and also over to the Oval Office.\" I wish Melania Trump had done the right thing and shown Jill Biden that same spot, whether she felt like doing it or not.",

        "title": "Pentagon chief says 'no intelligence indicating an insider threat' to inauguration as FBI vets National Guard",
        "body_text": "Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller said Monday that there is \"no intelligence indicating an insider threat\" to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, though National Guard members arriving in Washington are being vetted by law enforcement.\n Miller's statement comes hours after the head of the DC National Guard said that the FBI is vetting troops involved in securing the US Capitol  to prevent any insider threats.\n \"As is normal for military support to large security events, the Department will vet National Guardsmen who are in Washington, D.C. While we have no intelligence indicating an insider threat, we are leaving no stone unturned in securing the capital,\" Miller wrote. \"This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events.  However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique.\"\n Miller also thanked the FBI for its assistance in vetting members of the National Guard.\n The enhanced screening measures come as thousands of National Guard members are patrolling the streets of the nation's capital ahead of Inauguration Day.\n \"What happens is they're screened before they leave their state and what it is is a credentialing process so they're screened and they're repeatedly screened until they are actually put on the street,\" Major General William Walker told ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n Walker did not say that the screening included specific questions about the members' beliefs surrounding the legitimacy of the election, but they are carrying out enhanced background screening.\n \"No, it's all about the background. So, a regular background check is enhanced with more screening, more details and it's layered so the FBI is part of it, the Secret Service is part of it and once they are certain that there's no insider threat then that soldier, guardsman or airman is given a credential,\" he said.\n Walker stressed that members of National Guard are screened upon their entry to the service and this is another layer.\n CNN has previously reported that the US Army is working with the Secret Service to determine if there are soldiers who will be part of the National Guard contingent providing security at the inauguration who require additional background screening.\n The DC National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in the nation's capital that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command,\" an Army spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN last week.\n \"There is no place for extremism in the military and we will investigate each report individually and take appropriate action,\" the statement said.\n \"The Army is committed to working closely with the FBI as they identify people who participated in the violent attack on the Capitol to determine if the individuals have any connection to the Army,\" the statement said while adding that any type of activity that \"involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace,\" may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state and federal law.\n Current Defense Department policy requires all service members be trained annually under a program that requires department personnel to report \"any information regarding known or suspected extremist behavior that could be a threat to the department or the United States,\" the statement said.\n The vetting comes as new details have emerged linking a rioter involved in the January 6 US Capitol insurrection to the US military.\n Among those charged in connection with the riot so far is an Army reservist who federal investigators say has security-level security clearance and a long record of posting his extremist views online.\n Federal investigators said the Army reservist \u2014 Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, of Colts Neck, New Jersey \u2014 was described by an informant as \"an avowed White supremacist and Nazi sympathizer,\" according to court documents.\n The court documents also say, in a phone call with the informant on Thursday that was recorded by law enforcement, Hale-Cusanelli can be heard saying that he encouraged members of the mob to \"advance\" through the Capitol and gave directions \"via both voice and hand signals.\" It's not clear if he's been arrested.\n Efforts to find and eliminate extremism within the military's ranks, particularly among those who espouse White supremacist beliefs, began long before this month's riot at the Capitol but have taken on increased urgency in the days since.\n Extremist groups, including White supremacists, place a premium on recruiting current and former members of the military, a senior defense official said last week, while also trying to get their group's extremist members into the armed forces. The groups want the experience and expertise of the military.\n \"We know that some groups attempt to actively recruit our personnel into their cause, or actually encourage their members to join the military for purposes of acquiring skills and experience,\" the senior defense official said. \"We recognize those skills are prized by some of these groups not only for the capability it offers them, but it also brings legitimacy to them in their mind for their cause.\"\n CNN's Barbara Starr and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Democratic lawmaker accuses Boebert of giving tours prior to insurrection",
        "body_text": "Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee said that he and a fellow lawmaker personally saw Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado guiding a group of people through the Cannon House Office Building tunnel in the days leading up the Capitol insurrection on January 6.\n Cohen's accusation is significant because it is the first time a member of Congress has specifically accused another member of giving a tour of the Capitol complex prior to the riot. It comes after several Democratic members have suggested that their Republican colleagues may have been providing the tours as an opportunity for the would-be rioters to get the lay of the land ahead of a planned insurrection.\n \"Only thing that I've seen, Congressman Yarmuth refreshed my recollection yesterday. We saw (Rep.) Boebert taking a group of people for a tour sometime after the 3rd and before the 6th. I don't remember the day we were walking in a tunnel and we saw her and commented who she was and she had a large group with her. Now whether these people were people that were involved in the insurrection or not, I do not know,\" Cohen told CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"CNN Newsroom.\"\n Cohen continued, \"She was a freshman, she might have had a large number of people coming to be with her on this historic occasion and just wanting to give them the opportunity to have a tour. But it is pretty clear that her team is the team -- she's not on the home team. She was with the visitors.\"\n Boebert sent a letter to Cohen responding to the allegations he made on CNN, disputing the congressman's characterization and saying his comments \"repeat irresponsible lies in order to elevate his own political relevance and to further fuel the division of our country.\"\n \"Let me be clear\u2014all of your claims and implications are categorically false,\" Boebert wrote. \"I have never given a tour of the U.S. Capitol to any outside group. As I previously stated, I brought my family to the Capitol on January 2nd for a tour and on the 3rd for pictures to commemorate the day I was sworn in as a Member of the U.S. Congress. Again, the only people I have ever had in the Capitol with me during the 117th Congress are my young children, husband, mom, aunt and uncle.\"\n Cohen has not reported his observation to the FBI or Capitol Police, a spokesperson for the congressman told CNN.\n \"He was only reminded of it when he talked to Mr. Yarmuth yesterday,\" the spokesperson added.\n A spokesperson for Yarmuth confirmed that the congressman recalled seeing a group of people with Boebert earlier this month but would not comment on who those people were.\n \"On either January 3 or 4, Congressman Yarmuth was in the Cannon Tunnel going back to his office and saw Congresswoman Boebert walking in the direction of the Capitol,\" Yarmuth spokesman Christopher Schuler said in a statement. \"While Congressman Yarmuth remembers there was a group of people around Congresswoman Boebert, he has no knowledge of who they were or if they were with her.\"\n While Cohen is the first to specifically name Boebert as someone who may have given the tours, the rumors surrounding her role in the days leading up to January 6 were so heated that the congresswoman preemptively denied any wrongdoing. Boebert sent Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York a letter denying that she gave tours to insurrectionists after an interview on MSNBC in which Maloney accused Republican members of doing so. Maloney never mentioned Boebert by name.\n \"The only people I have ever had in the Capitol with me are my young children, husband, mom, aunt and uncle,\" Boebert wrote in the letter to Maloney. \"My mother was the only one of those family members in Washington D.C. on the 6th. During the riots, my mother was locked in a secure location, not in the U.S. Capitol, with my staff and never left their sight.\"\n Prior to the pandemic, the public had wide-ranging access to the Capitol complex, including the tunnels connecting the member office buildings to the Capitol itself. The Sergeant at Arms banned all tours of the Capitol Grounds at the start of the pandemic, but members of Congress were able to ignore the guidance. Lawmakers or staff led tours have never had to register visitors with Capitol Police, a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of overall protocols told CNN.\n Capitol Police and the FBI would not say on the record if they are investigating any members of Congress for their role in the planning leading up to the insurrection. USCP has not responded to CNN's request for comment about whether a tour led by Boebert is something they are looking into.\n Still the activity of GOP members during that week, was enough for Democratic members to raise concerns to Capitol Police and the Sergeant at Arms. Their concerns were loud enough that the Capitol Police sent out a memo on January 4 reiterating the Capitol Hill policy that banned tours from the spring and completely shut down the Capitol Building on January 6 to only members and those who had offices there.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Monday including a new statement from Boebert's office.\n CNN's Dana Bash and Sarah Westwood contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "As the US approaches 400,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, new cases have been trending down but multiple states are reporting cases of new variants of the virus.\n The US recorded 1.5 million new Covid-19 cases in the past seven days, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University, an 11% drop from the previous week. Cases declined in 35 states week-over-week, and 18 states saw a drop in the number of deaths.\n But with a longer range view, last week's apparent improvement falls much closer to average. Over the past month, the number of new Covid-19 cases recorded each day has ranged from nearly 101,000 to more than 302,000; over the past seven days, new cases averaged about 218,000 daily.\n \"The virus has established itself in the human population and it's not going anywhere,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert with Johns Hopkins University, told CNN. \"We're going to see a lot of transmission until we cross the threshold for herd immunity.\"\n At least 398,879 people have died in the U.S. from Covid-19 in the United States, and the country passed the 24 million mark in total cases on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than half -- 60% -- of all Covid-19 cases in the United states have been reported since Election Day, according to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University data.\n California, the current epicenter of the pandemic in the US, became the first state on Monday to record more than 3 million Covid-19 cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins and the Covid Tracking Project. The number of Covid-19 cases in California has tripled in just the past two months.\n The country's total Covid-19 death toll is more than the number of Americans who died in World War I, the Vietnam War and the Korean War combined and nearly as many Americans who died in World War II.\n And it's far higher than any other country's Covid-19 death toll.\n Multiple US states have now reported cases of a new Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK. And a new Covid-19 variant is now \"increasingly being found in multiple counties throughout California,\" state health officials announced Sunday in a news release.\n The variant, known as 452R, is different from the B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the United Kingdom, health officials say. As testing for variants has ramped up in California, the 452R version has been identified more frequently since November and has been identified in large outbreaks in Santa Clara County.\n At least 122 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant have been identified in 20 US states, according to data posted Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n This includes at least 46 cases in Florida, 40 in California, six in Colorado, five in Minnesota, four in Indiana, four in New York, two in Connecticut, two in Maryland, two in Texas, and one case each in Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n Meanwhile, more than 12.2 million Americans have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and more than 31 million doses have been distributed across the country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n That's as the country is just days away from President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n Biden has outlined a plan for vaccinations that includes opening up eligibility to more people, creating more vaccination sites and taking measures to increase vaccine supply and distribution.\n Washington state is now allowing anyone age 65 and older to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, part of a major change in plans to distribute shots. The announcement from Gov. Jay Inslee makes nearly 400,000 more people eligible to be vaccinated.\n The governor also announced a goal of increasing the number of people vaccinated every day to 45,000, which is greater than the current amount of vaccine they have available.\n Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday called for the federal government to release more doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, saying that his state currently had \"a very limited supply.\"\n \"The federal government has been giving mixed messages on vaccine availability and guidance, and we need them to step up and get more vaccine to the state,\" Walz said\n Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said Monday he believes the incoming Biden administration will come through.\n \"I believe the Biden administration understands the importance of this,\" Evers said while speaking at a vaccination clinic in Green Bay. \"We will get the vaccine that we need.\"\n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Monday demanding an explanation for what Cuomo said was a false claim that vaccine doses held in reserve would be shipped to states. \"The federal government is in control of the supply, they must increase the supply,\" Cuomo said.\n Cuomo said he also sent a letter to the president of Pfizer asking if New York can buy vaccine doses directly from the drug company, which Cuomo believes would be a first.\n In a statement provided to CNN, Pfizer responded to Cuomo's comments, saying, the company is open to collaborating with HHS to increase access to the vaccine.\n \"However, before we can sell directly to State governments, HHS would need to approve that proposal based on the EUA granted to Pfizer by the FDA,\" the statement said.\n In Florida, more than 40,000 people who received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose are overdue for their second dose, according to the state's health department. Those people overdue for their second shot account for about 5% of the nearly 916,000 who have received their first Covid-19 vaccine shot.\n In Los Angeles, county officials are struggling to keep up with vaccination demand. While people 65 and older are eligible for the vaccine, the county is still inoculating health care workers. Dodger Stadium has opened as a mass-vaccination site and the county is scheduled to open similar sites at other locations this week.\n Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest public school district, has requested authorization from state and local officials to administer the Covid-19 vaccine, Superintendent Austin Beutner said Monday morning.\n Beutner said the district, which has 1,413 schools spread over 710 square miles, has 12 health clinics in high-needs areas already licensed to provide vaccinations and can pivot to vaccination sites.\n \"In a typical community we serve, there are about three drugstores, 2 fire stations, and 25 schools,\" he said. \"No organization has the infrastructure to provide easier access to vaccinations than schools.\"\n More than 123,000 Americans are currently hospitalized with the virus nationwide, according to the Covid Tracking Project. To put that into perspective, that's more than double the country's Covid-19 hospitalization peak in spring, according to data from the project.\n In their latest briefing, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projected hospitals in many states \"will be under severe stress in the next four weeks.\"\n That's already been the case in different parts across the country.\n Los Angeles County -- the epicenter of California's Covid-19 crisis -- has battled a brutal surge of infections, hospitalizations and deaths for weeks now. County health officials reported Monday more than 7,328 people remained hospitalized with the virus -- 23% of whom were in intensive care units.\n According to the state, the Southern California region continues to have 0% available ICU capacity.\n In another sign of the spread of the virus in Los Angeles County, an air pollution control agency says it has temporarily suspended limits on cremations to assist crematoriums in the county with a \"backlog\" caused by the pandemic.\n Permits for crematoriums usually contain limits on the number of human remains that can be cremated each month based on the potential impact they will have on air quality, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.\n But after requests from both the county coroner and health department, the agency issued an emergency order Sunday suspending permit conditions that limit the number of cremations.\n Pennsylvania officials said late last week there were more than 4,900 people hospitalized with Covid-19 -- nearly double spring's peak.\n In Georgia, one hospital told CNN affiliate WSB they were so full they had to treat patients in hallways and ambulances.\n \"We truly are in the darkest days,\" Dr. Deepak Aggarwal, with Northeast Georgia Medical Center, told the news station.\n CNN's Jacqueline Howard, Virginia Langmaid, Lauren Mascarenhas, Deidre McPhillips, Michael Nedelman and Andy Rose contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The President might want Trump World, but he needs a real library",
        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nFor anyone at all disturbed by the alternate universe President Donald Trump has pushed as reality over the past four years, a nagging aggravation may be that one day this man will have a presidential library, just like the 13 most recent presidents to come before him.\n The ultimate honor for a former leader is a temple to his leadership, all the better if it is ultimately subsidized by taxpayers. It's a complete certainty that any library that could possibly meet Trump's standards of bombastic self-aggrandizement would trample over anything an objective observer could certify as verifiable fact.\n Consider: Would Trump mention the pandemic? His first impeachment? His second impeachment? Would the insurrection he inspired at the US Capitol be portrayed as revolution?\n We don't know the answers to those questions yet. But one thing we know is that presidential libraries are not, under law, taxpayer-funded parting gifts for presidential egos, but rather repositories for their records, which must be conceived and built with private funds. Another is that Trump is heading to Florida to begin his post-presidential life, hoping to raise $2 billion, according to The Washington Post, while the country comes to terms with how to remember and learn from his divisive presidency.\n \"A former president can open a shrine if they wish,\" said Timothy Naftali, the former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California.\n That's essentially what Nixon and his supporters did when they raised money in the years after his resignation to build the Nixon center, he added.\n \"Donald Trump certainly has the right to build a Trump World if they want,\" Naftali said. \"The question is whether it becomes a federal archival facility and has the stamp of professionalism from the National Archives and Records administration? That's the issue.\"\n Naftali was the first director of the Nixon library after it was taken over by the National Archives, and his first order of business was to put in an objective look at Watergate -- which when the library was run by Nixon supporters had been treated not as the scandal that ended his presidency but as a sort of Democratic conspiracy.\n He thinks Congress should consider passing a law, as it did with Nixon, to segregate artifacts and papers from Trump's administration, which under federal law belong to the country, and treat them differently than they have for other presidents.\n \"What I'm worried about is that they would go to a facility that will have as its mission the continuation of the disinformation campaign that characterized much of the Trump years,\" Naftali said. \"I think it would be harmful to the country for a National Archives-administered library to be seen even tacitly as participating in the divisive, and as we saw on January 6th, deadly,  misinformation of the Trump world.\"\n Not exactly, although every president since Herbert Hoover has a library in his name that is run by the National Archives and Records Administration. But it is not a guaranteed thing.\n The legislation that allows for libraries has been changed over the years since it first passed into law in 1955 after Franklin D. Roosevelt established the first presidential library, using private funds, and then gave it to the National Archives. The legislation was amended in 1986 to cut down on costs, according to the National Archives.\n The legislation requires private funds to set up a presidential library, which can then ultimately be run by the Archives, through the Office of Presidential Libraries.\n But the concept and execution of the library must come from private sources before it is taken over by the government.\n Some recent presidents have worked alongside the National Archives as they were using private funds to build their libraries, so that their operation could be taken over relatively quickly after they were completed, according to Anthony Clark, a former congressional staffer who wrote a book critical of the need for presidential libraries called \"The Last Campaign: How Presidents Rewrite History, Run for Posterity & Enshrine Their Legacies.\"\n He pointed out that Congress can technically object to the National Archives taking a role in a presidential library, but since the 1950s it has not had to take an affirmative vote to approve one.\n \"Right now, under the law, there's nothing technically prohibiting the National Archives from starting to plan with whatever organization the Trump family creates, like a Trump Foundation, towards the eventual opening of that building.\" He added: \"There's nothing in the law that says there's anything needs to be balanced, that any kind of historical analysis has to be done.\"\n There are also examples of honest and powerful exhibits at presidential libraries, according to Clark, who has written approvingly about the way former President Gerald Ford wanted the end of the Vietnam War is portrayed at his library.\n These libraries, while they have museum-like exhibits, also usually house the records from a president's administration. Think of the volume of paperwork a presidential administration generates. They're troves for researchers and historians. Read here about the value of presidential papers to presidents.\n They've gotten more and more ornate. Ronald Reagan's library, for instance, features an Air Force One plane resting on pylons. It's become a popular destination site for presidential debates during Republican primaries.\n President Barack Obama, for instance, has ceded any control of his records to the National Archives, which has created an online-only Obama presidential library.\n Instead, the Obama Foundation is building, with private money, a massive Obama Center in Chicago. That's a private venture, although he got a sweetheart deal on the South Side space from the city and it will include a new branch of the Chicago Public Library. It may borrow artifacts from the National Archives, but that site will not be an official presidential library.\n It's been a difficult process for the former president to find a space and get started on the museum, something twice-impeached Trump might find even more difficult. Four years after Obama left office, no ground has been broken. But the spec pics look really nice.\n Obama's foundation has raised many millions of dollars and lists some of the larger givers on its website. Corporations like CNN's owner, AT&T, Microsoft and Boeing, billionaires like Marc Benioff, charitable foundations and more have all given more than a million dollars.\n Fundraising could be a huge issue for Trump, who has been ostracized by corporate America. The Washington Post reported Monday that he hopes to raise $2 billion from small-dollar donors to build a library, but that is a LOT of small-dollar donations.\n CNN's White House team has reported that before Trump's speech inspired rioters to storm Capitol Hill there \"had been talk of securing property in Florida and having Dan Scavino, his longtime aide, run it. But now there are questions about who would donate to Trump's library in the current climate.\"\n On the other hand, this is a man who has built or rebranded numerous buildings and golf courses in his image during a long career in real estate. The question is not whether he will find a way to commemorate his time in office. It's whether the US government will play a part.\n Hoover, FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, LBJ, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. And, starting Wednesday, Biden.\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated how the Air Force One at the Reagan Library is secured. It rests on pylons.",

        "title": "Rand Paul's dire prediction for the GOP",
        "body_text": "Sometime shortly after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday, the Senate will likely begin the impeachment trial of soon-to-be-former President Donald Trump.\n A number of Republican senators -- including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- have signaled they have yet to decide whether Trump deserves to be convicted of incitement regarding the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.\n But McConnell's home-state colleague thinks that is a very bad idea -- and could lead to the collapse of the Republican Party.\n \"I didn't agree with the fight that happened last week, and I voted against overturning the election,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said in an interview on Fox News Friday night. \"But at the same time, the impeachment is a wrongheaded, partisan notion. But if Republicans go along with it, it will destroy the party. A third of the Republicans will leave the party.\"\n Which is a pretty big claim! And if Paul is right, massively raises the stakes for the coming Senate trial and eventual vote to acquit or convict Trump.\n Here's what we know: In order for Trump to be convicted, 67 senators -- a supermajority -- would have to vote that way. Which means that 17 GOP senators in the new Congress -- where Democrats and Republicans each control 50 seats -- would have to vote to convict.\n At the moment, that looks unlikely, given that no Republican senator has announced that he or she will vote to convict.\n But there's no question that McConnell is the linchpin here. If he votes to convict, he gives broad cover for lots of other wavering Republican senators to do so. And there's also no question that the Kentucky senator is at least considering the possibility of voting to convict Trump.\n \"I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,\" McConnell said in a decidedly leave-the-door-open statement issued shortly after the House impeached Trump last week.\n McConnell is faced with a stark political choice. He is clearly fed up with Trump and believes the outgoing President represents a clear and present danger to the future of the GOP. Casting a vote to convict Trump -- or being part of a Republican rebellion that led to the President's conviction -- would allow McConnell a very clean break with the 45th president.\n On the other hand, Paul isn't wrong about the impact such a vote might have within the GOP.\u00a0 It would almost certainly further splinter the Republican Party between the so-called \"establishment\" and the Trump wing.\n And that sort of fracture would make it very difficult for Republicans to win national elections or take back the House and Senate majorities.",

        "title": "Scottish fishermen say 'Brexit carnage' threatens to kill their business",
        "body_text": "Scottish fishermen parked their trucks near UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office at 10 Downing Street on Monday to protest post-Brexit red tape they say has made it almost impossible to sell British seafood to the European Union.\n Many of them drove several hours from Scotland, where the fishing industry is in crisis because paperwork issues and administrative errors related to new border checks and customs rules are delaying shipments to Europe. Trucks carried slogans such as \"Brexit carnage\" and \"Incompetent government destroying shellfish industry!\"\n Scotland Food and Drink, a trade body, estimates that seafood merchants are losing \u00a31 million ($1.4 million) a day, placing some businesses days away from collapse. Donna Fordyce, the CEO of Seafood Scotland, said that the price of several species of seafood destined for EU markets has fallen by between 40% and 50% because processors are struggling to get products into Europe.\n \"Losses for the sector are mounting and the situation is urgent,\" she said in a statement last week.\n One company, which normally ships \u00a31 million ($1.4 million) of seafood to the European Union every week, managed to get just \u00a312,000 ($16,300) of product into the bloc the week before last and has told its 27 suppliers to stop fishing.\n \"Getting anything out of the UK into the EU is being achieved by luck rather than design,\" Fordyce said. \"This was inevitable, given such a complicated process was put together at the last minute.\"\n Following months of fraught negotiations, the United Kingdom and European Union reached a post-Brexit trade agreement on December 24, leaving almost no time for businesses and customs officials to familiarize themselves with new rules that kicked in on January 1.\n \"What they want us to do now is just impossible to work with live shellfish. Timings, costs involved, paperwork, it's crazy,\" Allan Miller, the owner of Aberdeen-based AM Shellfish, told CNN Business outside Downing Street on Monday.\n \"If they don't change [the process] a lot of these companies are going to go out of business,\" he said. \"A lot of these fishing communities have been fishing for generations. What are they going to do?\"\n Speaking in Oxford on Monday, Johnson said that UK exporters would be compensated for losses caused by bureaucratic delays. He described current issues as \"teething problems\" and said the government has set up a \u00a3100 million ($136 million) fund to help Britain's fishing industry take advantage of \"great opportunities.\"\n The prime minister also blamed the closure of restaurants in Europe for a drop in demand for UK fish.\n DR Collin & Sons, a seafood business based south of Edinburgh, ordinarily sends one to two trucks a day to France that are each loaded with \u00a3150,000 ($204,000) of live lobsters, crabs and langoustines. The company, which employs 200 people, has lost more than 90% of its revenue since January 1, according to head of transport David Rosie.\n \"We are one of the bigger companies, but it's certainly not looking good going forward. For the smaller companies, they've got weeks, maybe days,\" he told CNN Business.\n Having furloughed truck drivers and factory workers, the 70-year old firm has been shipping more lobster to Asia by air freight than it's been selling to neighbors in Europe. \"We're selling more to China and the Far East than to the EU, that's unheard of in the industry,\" he added.\n Rosie said the company has been unable to obtain the correct paperwork from Britain's revenue and customs authority to move its products through France. It has had to return catches to the sea because it can't get the produce to customers quickly enough.\n Some fishermen are making a 72-hour round trip across the North Sea to Denmark to expedite entry into Europe so that their catch will \"actually find its way to market while still fresh enough to meet customer demands,\" according to the Scottish Fishermen's Federation.\n \"Many in our industry now fear for their future,\" Elspeth Macdonald, the CEO of the federation, said in a letter to Johnson on Friday. The deal covering fisheries is \"desperately poor\" and not what the UK government promised the industry, she added.\n \"We've been made a fool of by the Westminster government. It's an absolute disgrace what we've had to go through,\" Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Seafarms and Loch Fyne Langoustines said in a video posted to Twitter (TWTR) last week.\n McMillan threatened to dump rotten shellfish outside UK parliament buildings if he and other Scottish exporters are unable to get their product to market.\n \u2014 Will Godley and Sarah Dean contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Biden administration braces for new wave of migrants as it rolls out new immigration plans",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden plans to immediately begin the rollout of his immigration agenda upon taking office Wednesday, but the new administration will also have to contend with migrants already on the US-Mexico border, as well as those on their way.\n Among the first actions Biden plans to take is proposing legislation that would offer a pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrations currently in the United States. The legislation, which has already been drafted, includes an immediate path to citizenship for participants of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and Temporary Protected Status program, among others, border technology, and aid to Central America, according to people briefed on the plan.\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has said the proposal also includes cutting down the amount of time it takes to get citizenship to eight years.\n Biden will also sign dozens of executive orders, according to a memo from incoming chief of staff Ron Klain, including rescinding the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries.\n But while Biden has pledged to take a more humane approach to those arriving at the US southern border, incoming officials have been publicly warning migrants that restrictive policies put in place under President Donald Trump will take time to roll back -- a point Biden has recognized.\n But behind the scenes, plans have been set in motion to prepare for new arrivals, which have been gradually ticking up since last year and present an immediate challenge to the incoming administration as it sets up its own immigration policies.\n The Department of Homeland Security has been putting contingency plans in place, in anticipation of an increase in migrants at the southern border as a result of deteriorating conditions in Latin America and a perceived relaxation of enforcement, and relaying those plans to transition officials, according to a senior DHS official. Plans include, for example, the use of soft-sided facilities that take into account Covid-19 precautions.\n Non-governmental organizations and the Biden transition have been engaged in regular planning conversations that have primarily focused on them connecting with direct service providers at ports entry to start to get to a more nuanced perspective on processing and regional differences, according to two sources familiar with discussions.\n The long-term plan is to set in motion a regional strategy that addresses root causes and expands pathways for migration.\n According to Guatemala's official immigration agency, an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 US-bound migrants have crossed into Guatemala from Honduras since Friday.\n The coronavirus pandemic has taken a dramatic toll on Latin America, where Covid-19 cases and deaths have soared and economies projected to grow have been decimated. The region was also hit with two devastating hurricanes. The decline in economic growth in 2020, according to the Congressional Research Service, is expected to worsen income inequality and poverty in the region.\n Caravans, as they've largely become known, are intended in part to provide safety in numbers as migrants embark on the dangerous journey north. The Trump administration seized on caravans to back up controversial and restrictive policies that largely sealed off the US, but they're only one means of migration.\n \"It gets outsized attention because it's a lot of people. They do it for safety, they do it for community. ... It doesn't necessarily mean they have a better chance of getting in,\" said Theresa Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n \"We knew for awhile there was pent up demand to come to the United States,\" Brown added, citing conditions in Latin America.\n Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday the country is closely watching developments of a migrants' caravan moving towards the US from Central America, adding that he's talking with Central American and US government officials, including the incoming Biden administration. Lopez Obrador said his team is \"in communication with the government of the United States, the current officials and those who are coming through in the new government\" around the caravans' issue.\n The Trump administration took an aggressive posture on the US-Mexico border that resulted in thousands of migrants waiting along on the southern border for their US immigration court date and, during the coronavirus pandemic, the swift removal of migrants, including children.\n The incoming administration has pledged to undo policies that, immigrant advocates argued, put migrants in harm's way. Klain underscored Biden's commitment to restoring \"dignity to our immigration system and our border policies, and start the difficult but critical work of reuniting families separated at the border,\" out of the gate in a memo to staff over the weekend.\n As that happens, the administration will also have to address ongoing migration. \"That's going to be the challenge with this administration. They're going to have to deal with this as they plan for what they want it to look like,\" Brown said.\n CNN's Stefano Pozzebon in Bogota and Florencia Trucco in Atlanta contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump moves to lift some Covid-19-related travel restrictions, but Biden plans to block the order",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump on Monday lifted coronavirus-related travel restrictions for much of Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Brazil, effective on January 26 -- a move that President-elect Joe Biden's administration has promised to block.\n In an executive order issued Monday evening, Trump said he had been advised to lift restrictions on incoming travelers to the United States from the 26 European countries in the Schengen Zone, the UK, Ireland and Brazil but leave in place restrictions on travel from Iran and China.\n \"I agree with the Secretary that this action is the best way to continue protecting Americans from COVID-19 while enabling travel to resume safely,\" Trump wrote in the order, referring to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.\n Biden is set to take over the presidency on Wednesday and his incoming press secretary, Jen Psaki, said that his administration would not lift the restrictions.\n \"With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,\" Psaki said on Twitter. \"On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\"\n Reuters was first to report the order.\n The expected easing of travel restrictions comes after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week it will require a negative Covid-19 test from all air passengers entering the United States -- a move it says may help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Air passengers will be required to get a test within three days before their flight to the United States departs, and to provide written documentation of their lab results, or documentation of having recovered from Covid-19, the agency said in a statement to CNN.\n CNN has reached out to the White House Coronavirus Task Force as to whether the panel approved the anticipated move.\n The combination of the testing program announced last week and lifting travel restrictions aligns with the interests of several airlines that have been in negotiations with the CDC and the White House. Earlier this month, a group of major airlines asked the Trump administration to broadly expand a program to test US-bound passengers and simultaneously lift travel restrictions.\n Airlines for America -- with members including American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines -- wrote to Vice President Mike Pence asking the administration to implement \"a global program to require testing for travelers to the United States.\" Such a program would allow authorities to release restrictions on entering the US from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Brazil, the group wrote.\n Last month, the CDC announced that passengers arriving in the United States from the United Kingdom must test negative for Covid-19 before departure in response to a new coronavirus variant that is said to have originated in the UK and is potentially more transmissible. At least 72 cases of a variant first identified in the UK have been found in 10 US states, according to data posted last week by the CDC.\n Many of the countries impacted by Trump's order have their own recent requirements for American travelers looking to enter their borders. US travelers must have a negative Covid-19 test from within the prior 72 hours to travel into the United Kingdom or Ireland, and in conjunction with proof of a completed Declaration of Traveler's Health to enter Brazil. American travelers cannot enter countries in the Schengen Zone including Spain (barring special permission or requirements), Germany, France, Italy and Sweden.\n The potential travel restriction reversal would come as the Trump administration shifts on another element of the coronavirus response in the President's final days in office.\n The Department of Health and Human Services was expected to announce sweeping changes last week in vaccine rollout guidelines in an effort to boost the lagging number of vaccinations in the first month -- effectively adopting the approach proposed by Biden's incoming administration.\n Since then, hopes of a surge in Covid-19 vaccine shipments under a new policy to release second doses held in reserve appear to be evaporating -- with the revelation that those doses have already been distributed, contrary to recent indications by the Trump administration.\n A senior administration official told CNN that when the administration announced that it would be releasing reserved doses last Friday, many of those reserves had already been released into the system starting last year as production was ramping up.\n This story has been updated with further developments.\n CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Jessica Firger, Eric Levenson, Kristen Holmes and Sara Murray contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said Monday that the National Guard and law enforcement response to the deadly US Capitol riot was hampered by an archaic system and criticized the current method of defending the nation's capital in a crisis as \"overly bureaucratic.\"\n In an interview with CNN, McCarthy called for overhauling the bureaucracy, including the process of ordering in the National Guard, which has happened twice in seven months. He called for the process to call in federal authorities to protect Washington, DC, to be simplified and said the current system is \"almost arcane and overly bureaucratic.\"\n \"There's too many people that are involved with the decision, and ultimately no one, one single person responsible,\" McCarthy told CNN, adding, \"It makes it very difficult and slow in the response.\"\n CNN previously reported that efforts to mobilize the National Guard during the unprecedented crisis were hamstrung by bureaucracy and confusion between Pentagon, DC government and Capitol police officials.\n But questions as to why the National guard was not fully activated until hours after the violent mob descended on the Capitol have continued to emerge in the days since.\n Four federal agencies announced Friday they are opening investigations into their own roles on January 6. The Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the Interior Department will all examine their preparations for the events in Washington that day that may have played a part in allowing rioters to breach the Capitol.\n \"You saw a lot of people run into friction in support of the Capitol Hill police. It came far too close. Something like this should never happen. This country has the talent and the resources to do anything. But the pre-planning and coordination and the intelligence were not really managed well, and we were not in a position to be successful that day as a country,\" McCarthy said.\n On Monday, McCarthy described a situation of \"tremendous confusion.\"\n \"No one really understood the situation. No specifics or clarity what the size of the crowd, where they were, did they actually breach the building,\" said McCarthy in an interview at the Pentagon.\n McCarthy said he \"ran down the hall to get authority to launch\" the National Guard even as he \"didn't have great understanding\" of what was happening after a phone call with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and DC Police Chief Robert Contee.\n \"A lot of confusion because we weren't asked for help\" in the leadup to the event, McCarthy said.\n An official familiar with conversations in the DC government previously told CNN that the Pentagon was too hesitant to deploy troops ahead of the protest and once the situation deteriorated rapidly they said defense officials took too long to approve the deployment of additional troops.\n But McCarthy has repeatedly said the Pentagon worked as fast as it could to understand the situation on the ground and get the guard to Capitol Hill.\n Facing increased scrutiny about the timeline, the Pentagon has pushed back, outright rejecting accusations that defense officials denied any requests for help. When the first calls for aid came shortly before 2 p.m., \"the request was amorphous,\" a senior defense official said, adding it was a nonspecific \"We need help\" request.\n Efforts to find and eliminate extremism within the military's ranks, particularly among those who espouse White supremacist beliefs, began long before this month's riot at the Capitol but have taken on increased urgency in the days since.\n Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller said Monday that there is \"no intelligence indicating an insider threat\" to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, though National Guard members arriving in Washington are being vetted by law enforcement.\n The enhanced screening measures come as thousands of National Guard members are patrolling the streets of the nation's capital ahead of Inauguration Day.\n CNN has previously reported that the US Army is working with the Secret Service to determine if there are soldiers who will be part of the National Guard contingent providing security at the inauguration who require additional background screening.\n \"We don't know the size and scale of the problem,\" McCarthy told CNN. \"We are working with federal law enforcement to vet our people, obviously ones in particular supporting this operation. But you would do that in most cases.\"\n \"We're taking the extremist threats very seriously. And we're vetting all of our soldiers. We're going to continue to look at the entire army as a whole and how we can ensure that these threats are not in our formation. And if they are, we'll find them and we'll get rid of them,\" he added.",

        "title": "Trump administration issues racist school curriculum report on MLK day",
        "body_text": "A commission stood up by President Donald Trump as a rebuttal to schools applying a more accurate history curriculum around slavery in the US issued its inflammatory report on Monday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n Trump announced that he was establishing the commission last fall, following a slew of Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the country. He blamed the school curriculum for violence that resulted from some of the protests, saying that \"the left-wing rioting and mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools.\"\n The commission is an apparent counter to The New York Times' 1619 Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning project aimed at teaching American students about slavery. Trump, speaking last fall, called the project \"toxic propaganda.\"\n A sitting US president typically has the power to dissolve existing presidential commissions and advisory councils, which sometimes provide reports and recommendations to the White House.\n It's not clear what action President-elect Joe Biden will take with the commission once he's in office.\n Trump's presidency has been marked by his racist statements and actions, including his incitement of a mob, which included White supremacists, to storm the US Capitol on January 6 in protest of Biden's victory.\n A White House statement calls the report \"a dispositive rebuttal of reckless 're-education' attempts that seek to reframe American history around the idea that the United States is not an exceptional country but an evil one.\"\n The report, released less than two weeks after supporters of the President stormed the US Capitol building, calls today's ideological divisions akin to those experienced during the Civil War.\n \"Americans are deeply divided about the meaning of their country, its history, and how it should be governed. This division is severe enough to call to mind the disagreements between the colonists and King George, and those between Confederate and Union forces during the Civil War,\" the report states.\n The report's authors also argue that \"the Civil Rights Movement was almost immediately turned to programs that ran counter to the lofty ideals of the founders,\" specifically criticizing affirmative action policies.\n \"Today, far from a regime of equal natural rights for equal citizens, enforced by the equal application of law, we have moved toward a system of explicit group privilege that, in the name of 'social justice,' demands equal results and explicitly sorts citizens into 'protected classes' based on race and other demographic categories,\" the report states. \"Eventually this regime of formal inequality would come to be known as 'identity politics.' \"\n The commission is chaired by Larry Arnn, the president of Hillsdale College. He drew criticism for his comments in 2013 when he said state officials visited the college to see whether enough \"dark ones\" were enrolled The commission's vice chair, Carol Swain, once wrote that Islam \"poses an absolute danger to us and our children.\"\n The report argues that identity politics are \"the opposite of King's hope that his children would 'live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'\"\n Commission members also took aim at feminists and the wide use of ethnic and racial identities in American life, arguing that they were constructed by \"activists.\"\n \"A radical women's liberation movement reimagined America as a patriarchal system, asserting that every woman is a victim of oppression by men. The Black Power and black nationalist movements reimagined America as a white supremacist regime. Meanwhile, other activists constructed artificial groupings to further divide Americans by race, creating new categories like 'Asian American' and 'Hispanic' to teach Americans to think of themselves in terms of group identities and to rouse various groups into politically cohesive bodies,\" the report states.\n \"While not as barbaric or dehumanizing,\" the report states, identity politics \"creates new hierarchies as unjust as the old hierarchies of the antebellum South, making a mockery of equality with an ever-changing scale of special privileges on the basis of racial and sexual identities.\"\n American universities, the report's authors say, are \"hotbeds of anti-Americanism, libel, and censorship that combine to generate in students and in the broader culture at the very least disdain and at worst outright hatred for this country.\" And in a section about to school curriculum, the authors suggest \"states and school districts should reject any curriculum that promotes one-sided partisan opinions, activist propaganda, or factional ideologies that demean America's heritage, dishonor our heroes, or deny our principles.\"\n They also declare that \"educators must convey a sense of enlightened patriotism that equips each generation with a knowledge of America's founding principles, a deep reverence for their liberties, and a profound love of their country.\"\n The commission does not have authority to enforce the recommendations it has made for educators.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's DJ Judd contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "On Wednesday, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the President of a nation at a pivotal moment, and the world will be watching because all democracies are in this moment together\n The view from Biden's podium at the United States Capitol, looking down over Washington DC's National Mall, will not be pretty.\n Instead of people standing shoulder to shoulder sharing in democracy's highest ritual -- the peaceful passing of power from one leader to the next -- there will be an abundance of armed troops, higher than normal fences, and mostly empty fields.\n It is ironic that these hallowed acres, now unreachable by the masses, were the birthplace of President Donald Trump's first big on-the-job lie, when he falsely boasted four years ago that his inauguration crowd was bigger than the one that turned up for his predecessor.\n After that, the blizzard of lies came so thick and fast that it was difficult to unpick and fully challenge each falsehood, much less see the extent of the cumulative damage done by them.\n Four years later, it is now clear that Trump's relentless distractions shrouded an unpleasant truth -- that the United States is at a turning point and so too is the democratic future of many of its allies.\n World leaders were quick to denounce him the day after the insurrection on Capitol Hill. \"I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol,\" said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Trump ally.\n Johnson, who has a reputation for tardiness, was quick to put Trump down, because like many of America's allies, the Capitol siege was the moment their own nations risked damage by association.\n Hollywood's idea of the end of an epic battle often depicts drifting gun smoke, toppled cannons, churned sods, busted picket fences, bloodied and broken men, and generally a victor -- in this case Joe Biden, heading ruefully and more wisely off towards happier days.\n But the attempted coup on January 6 was no movie, and this inauguration is no happy ending.\n The troops and fences surrounding the Mall are not the problem, they are a symptom of it, painfully visible now thousands of miles away in the capitals of allies from Europe to Asia.\n Trump's most fervent political allies -- like Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, Congressman Jim Jordan and others -- have made clear they'll continue his fiction of a stolen election and in so doing not only risk America's democracy but her allies too.\n At a yet-to-be scheduled global summit for democracies, Biden will soon be calling on allies to trust him and hold on to their faith in America. It is a very big ask for a very big need -- containing China, America's biggest overseas threat.\n Concern was already being felt in Europe before Cruz and the others joined Trump's election lie. America's friends saw Trump's turnout as an indication that his style of deceit-driven politics is not dead.\n A Pew Research Center survey conducted in Germany, France and the UK before the January 6 insurrection revealed that 73% of Germans, 64% of French and 62% of British people said they were concerned about US democracy.\n Many Europeans believe Trump's presidency has managed to not only damage democracy in the United States but unleash a trickledown effect in Europe, enabling populists like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n Separately to Trump the UK experienced its own unsettling strains on democracy when Johnson challenged centuries of British democracy in 2019, when his suspension or proroguing of Parliament was ruled unlawful by England's Supreme Court.\n Writing in the New York Times, Timothy Snyder, the author and professor of law at Yale University, presciently explained why Trump's big election lie is so dangerous.\n \"Like historical fascist leaders, Trump has presented himself as the single source of truth. His use of the term 'fake news' echoed the Nazi smear L\u00fcgenpresse ('lying press'); like the Nazis, he referred to reporters as 'enemies of the people,'\" Snyder writes.\n Snyder's warning that \"America will not survive the big lie just because a liar is separated from power\" will be heard and understood outside the US too.\n Fascism's legacy is still an ugly scar on the European continent and cannot easily be ignored, meaning any sustained hint that that is where the US is headed could weaken transatlantic support.\n Johnson himself has been pilloried for being Trump-lite, populist and nationalist in leaning, but if he or many of his peers were perceived as condoning fascism in a US leader it could be political death sentence.\n Trump's impact on the politics of Europe over the past four years is already a chilly warning of the insidious effect of undemocratic tendencies in the White House.\n So while Biden tries to build back trust and confidence of America's allies, they will be watching American politics more intently than before.\n Biden's newly announced executive orders, including rolling back Trump's \"Muslim ban\" and reversing his withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, will help restore some of America's legitimacy, but the moves won't mask the incoming President's international pressures for long.\n He needs help de-escalating tensions with President Xi Jinping and has said he'll do this by working with allies. But time is not on his side, and some of the global dynamics have changed; Europe, for one, has just signed a new investment agreement with China.\n Japan and South Korea's diplomatic, intelligence and military support are also vital to Biden. Both nations were hurt by Trump's demands they pay more to have US troops based on their land, even though it is in America's national security interests to have them there.\n Biden's experience and hitherto truth-telling style will be welcomed by allies, but as long as he is fighting off Trump's lies -- still pedaled by leading Republicans -- America's standing in the world will be shakier, and democracy the world over in danger.",

        "title": "Norway reviewing deaths of frail and elderly patients vaccinated against Covid-19",
        "body_text": "Doctors in Norway are investigating the deaths of 23 elderly patients who had received the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, looking into the possibility that adverse reactions to the shot \"may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients.\"\n The vaccine's side-effects are rare and usually mild. But they could include fever and nausea, which could be dangerous in very ill and frail patients.\n Following the deaths, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health updated its Covid-19 vaccination guide with more detailed advice on inoculating elderly people who are frail or terminally ill.\n The new guidance says doctors should evaluate each individual patient to determine whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of any potential side effects.\n As of last Thursday, 42,000 people in Norway had received their first dose of the vaccine. As is the case in many other countries, the elderly and those in nursing homes with underlying health conditions are first in line to be vaccinated, because they face much higher risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid-19.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that the deaths have to be put into context of the population that they occurred in -- a nursing home with extremely frail individuals.\n Speaking at the Choose Healthy Lives Black Clergy Conclave, Fauci said that his understanding was that the deaths followed the booster dose of the vaccine when there are more non-specific symptoms, such as aches, fever and malaise.\n \"It is conceivable that when you have a very frail individual, such as many who are in nursing homes, that even that amount of stress to them could put them over the top,\" Fauci added.\n Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that so far there was \"no evidence that any link between vaccination and death in these vulnerable patients is a causal one.\"\n Evans told the UK's Science Media Centre that when people who are at high risk of death get vaccinated, \"there will be a certain number of coincidental deaths that occur shortly after vaccination.\"\n Regulatory bodies across the world are closely monitoring these fatalities, Evans said, and are able to calculate the \"expected number\" of deaths within various time periods.\n \"We do not yet know, but it would seem that the observed numbers of deaths is not notably above the numbers expected,\" he said, adding that there was \"no need for anxiety, but complacency is equally mistaken.\"\n Fauci agreed with that assessment, saying that the first question is what was the rate of death in the nursing homes in the individuals who never received the vaccine. \"Once you get that, you'll get the true denominator,\" he said.\n Of the 23 deaths, 13 have so far been assessed by the Norwegian Medicines Agency and the National Institute of Public Health, the Institute said in a statement on Friday.\n Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, said the assessments suggest that common adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients.\n \"We cannot rule out that adverse reactions to the vaccine occurring within the first days following vaccination (such as fever and nausea) may contribute to more serious course and fatal outcome in patients with severe underlying disease,\" the statement added.\n Pfizer said in a statement sent to CNN on Saturday that it was aware of the reported deaths and \"our immediate thoughts are with the bereaved families.\"\n Pfizer added it is working with NOMA to gather all the relevant information.\n \"Norwegian Authorities have prioritized the immunization of residents in nursing homes, most of whom are very elderly with underlying medical conditions and some which are terminally ill,\" Pfizer said in a statement, adding that NOMA has said \"the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations.\"",

        "title": "Biden crafts inaugural address to unify a country in crisis",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden has spoken volumes inside the US Capitol over more than four decades, but the weight of those words does not approach the magnitude of the message he will deliver on its steps during his inaugural address Wednesday.\n Biden has been steadily crafting the speech -- adding a thought here, inserting a line there -- since the day after he delivered a victory address in Wilmington, Delaware, aides say. But in those passing 72 days, Biden's burden has grown even heavier, with President Donald Trump's relentless falsehoods complicating the already-challenging task of unifying a divided nation.\n Mike Donilon, a longtime adviser to Biden who will join him in the West Wing, is overseeing the speechwriting process along with Vinay Reddy, Biden's chief speechwriter. Jon Meacham, the historian and presidential biographer, is also helping shape the inaugural address, which will be delivered as the opening mark of perhaps the most challenging presidency since Franklin Roosevelt.\n It is expected to be about 20 minutes in length, aides said, which follows a pattern of inaugural addresses from recent presidents. Four years ago, Trump spoke for 15 minutes, while Barack Obama's speech in 2009 was about 18 minutes.\n For the first time in modern history, the new president's successor will not be sitting within arm's reach on the west front of the Capitol. By the time Biden takes his oath of office, Trump is scheduled to have arrived at his home in Florida. Aides say Biden is unlikely to mention -- or certainly not dwell on -- Trump, but could give an appreciative nod at Vice President Mike Pence, who plans to attend.\n The exact text is a closely guarded secret, advisers tell CNN. Not only because he wants the message to be fresh, but also because the speech has changed multiple times -- out of necessity, given the horrific siege of the Capitol on January 6, and also because of Biden's penchant for rewriting speeches until the very last minute.\n But several people close to Biden say clues to his address can be found in themes from his speech on November 7, 2020, when he implored Americans: \"Let's give each other a chance.\"\n \"It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again. Listen to each other again,\" Biden said on that crisp night. \"And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They're Americans.\"\n Those words now strike almost an ominous tone, with their mission even more difficult after a pro-Trump mob attempting to stop Congress from accepting the electoral votes overtook the Capitol steps where Biden will deliver his first message to the nation as president. The events of the past two weeks underscore the reality that the 78-year-old Biden -- who will on Wednesday stand on the steps of a building in which he has spoken countless words during a 36-year-run as a loquacious senator and eight more as vice president -- is delivering remarks that will carry more weight than a lifetime's worth of his speeches.\n \"Despite all that's happened, despite all that the country has endured, his message never strayed from restoring the soul of the nation,\" a top Biden adviser told CNN. \"That is his mission statement as much as ever.\"\n Jon Favreau, the former chief speechwriter for President Barack Obama, said Biden's task with his speech \"will be easier because of who he is and who he's following.\"\n \"We're in the midst of a national trauma that's tested our faith in everything good we've ever believed about this country, and the guy who was supposed to be helping us through it made the crisis infinitely worse,\" Favreau told CNN. \"No inaugural address, however well-written or delivered, can heal that collective wound. But Joe Biden is someone who's held on to his faith and optimism despite enduring more tragedy than most, which makes him uniquely positioned to ask the country to do the same.\"\n Favreau, who worked with Obama to craft both inaugural addresses, said Biden's speech was not the place to offer a detailed policy agenda. That message, he said, will come during Biden's first address to a joint session of Congress in February.\n \"I'd use the inaugural to lift people's spirits,\" Favreau said, \"and remind them why the American experiment is worth saving.\"\n Biden aides have been reluctant to preview specifics of Biden's inaugural address. Ron Klain, his incoming chief of staff, told The Washington Post in a video interview last week that Biden \"takes time every few days to sit down and think about it and write some thoughts and rewrite some thoughts.\"\n During a fundraiser Friday evening, Biden said he is heading into what \"may be the most unusual inaugural in American history.\"\n \"Maybe not the most consequential, but the most unusual,\" he said.\n Biden told supporters that while his inauguration, due to the coronavirus pandemic, would not look like previous inaugurations, it would be \"an event that the American people will be proud of.\"\n When Biden looks into the cameras shortly after noon on Wednesday, he will be addressing a country in the throes of multiple overlapping crises. Nearly 4,000 Americans are dying every day from the coronavirus and many more are out of work, hungry and at risk of losing their homes.\n The closest parallel to the situation Biden is inheriting came in 1933, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office during the Great Depression and a rising tide of global authoritarianism. But even then, Roosevelt had some advantages that Biden will not enjoy, historians say.\n \"The idea of giving a speech that unifies the country, or giving a speech that everyone hears the same way, even if they don't agree with what he's saying, that's just not our world anymore,\" said historian Julian Zelizer, a professor at Princeton University and CNN contributor. \"It's one thing to call for unity and inspire people to come together when there's a common frame through which everyone is listening to you, but if it's all divided, fragmented, polarized, it's very hard to convey any kind of message like that.\"\n Roosevelt in his first inaugural delivered one of his most famous lines, telling Americans that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" But the speech was also deeply political. Roosevelt called on the Congress to grant him \"broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.\"\n Biden has been cautious in his talk about executive authority, but in his remarks last week outlining the Covid-19 relief package that will be his first legislative effort to stem the ongoing disaster, he too called on partisans to set aside their sharpest tools and unite in the face of existential threats.\n His challenge on Wednesday, Zelizer said, was not in convincing legislators or whipping votes, but in restoring Americans' confidence that he and the government he will lead understands their suffering.\n \"I don't think he'll necessarily inspire through kind of the high rhetoric that FDR was able to achieve, or even some other presidents like Reagan or Lyndon Johnson or Kennedy,\" Zelizer said. \"He'll inspire by just giving people a sense that the adult is finally in the room, and an adult who cares about what we're all going through as a country. He can deliver that, but it's going to be tough.\"\n This story has been updated with additional reporting on Biden's speech.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free,\u00a0here.\n In today's business news: There's a new top cop on Wall Street, the rise of the fake commute and Parler makes a reappearance.\n Joe Biden just announced a new top cop for Wall Street \u2014 someone Elizabeth Warren loves and bankers... well, he wouldn't be their top choice.\n Biden is tapping Gary Gensler to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n Gensler's nomination sends a clear message that the Biden administration will be much tougher on Wall Street than Trump was. My colleague Matt Egan has more.\n Pop quiz: name the largest beverage maker\u00a0in the world\u00a0by market capitalization?\n Hint: It's not Coca-Cola, though that company held the title for years. It's not Diageo or AB InBev, either.\n The crown has been taken by a luxury spirits maker whose sales come almost entirely within China, writes my colleague Michelle Toh.\u00a0Its product is a fermented sorghum-rice liquor called\u00a0baiju\u00a0that's 53% alcohol and has been compared to drinking liquid razor blades.\n The company is Kweichow Moutai, and it's valued at about $421 billion.\n The story of how Moutai baiju became China's national spirit is a fascinating one.\u00a0Mao Zedong was known to enjoy a tipple. When President Nixon made his historic 1972 trip to China, he was welcomed with baiju, which became known as the \"drink of diplomacy.\"\u00a0Once, at\u00a0a state dinner in 1974, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Deng Xiaoping: \"I think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.\"\n Even during a pandemic, Kweichow Moutai's stock surged around 70% in 2020. Outside of technology, the company is China's most valuable firm \u2014 worth more than the country's four biggest banks. It's also worth more than Toyota, Nike and Disney.\n Moutai is still largely unknown internationally, and that'll have to change if the company wants to stay on top. Like Mexican tequila, Russian vodka and American bourbon, baiju ultimately needs to go global to survive, industry analysts say. And baiju is a decidedly acquired taste. As I recently told a colleague: baiju tastes like jet fuel, but after a couple of shots you forget a lot of things \u2014 the taste, where you live, your own name \u2014 so maybe that's why it keeps flying off the shelves.\n President-elect\u00a0Joe Biden last week proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, part of\u00a0an\u00a0ambitious plan to combat an economic crisis.\n But, as my colleague Chris Isidore writes, many economists and business leaders say no amount of stimulus can fix the economy until we fix the underlying cause of the problems \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0And unfortunately, the message from public health experts is clear: The pandemic is going to get worse before it gets better.\n Ah, commuting. I can almost recall the last time I rushed out of my apartment with a gym bag, purse, and a giant tumbler of coffee, speed-walking without a mask on my face to the subway, where I'd squeeze onto a packed car with hundreds of other unmasked faces \u2014 how cavalier we were with personal space then! \u2014 and stare at my phone while praying the Q doesn't stall over the Manhattan Bridge (lol it always stalled).\n While it wasn't exactly a relaxing ritual, it was\u00a0something. It sucked, really, but I miss it.\n That's why a lot people are embracing the Fake Commute.\n Rather than rolling out of bed and heading straight for the laptop, many in the work-from-home set are finding ways to carve out time that was once spent on going to the office to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 besides stare at a screen, CNN's Kristen Rogers writes.\u00a0Read on for tips on how to create your own Fake Commute.\n Samsung vice chairman\u00a0Lee Jae-yong\u00a0was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison after the Seoul High Court found him guilty of embezzlement and bribery.\n Ford ordered a month-long production halt at one of its plants in Germany, the latest sign that a\u00a0global shortage of computer chips\u00a0is putting carmakers under pressure and threatening their recovery from the pandemic.\n Facebook posts promoting violence during inauguration week have circulated on the platform over the past week despite a crackdown by the social media giant since the January 6 insurrection, a tech watchdog group found.\n Parler suddenly reappeared Sunday with a message from its CEO, suggesting the social network has found a new online hosting platform after it was booted from Amazon Web Services.",

        "title": "With Trump's exit, the Fox News presidency will come to an end",
        "body_text": "Four years ago, Fox News headed into the Trump presidency with an unprecedented opportunity. It was not only the primary source of news for the Republican Party, but also the primary source for President Trump himself. The network could have used the opportunity to act responsibly. It could have leveraged its contacts within Trump's inner circle and the GOP to double down on reporting and break some real news. It could have \u2014 at the very least \u2014 delivered the cold hard truth to the millions who relied on it for accurate, reliable information.\n But it did none of those things. Instead, Fox chose to run in the opposite direction. The propagandists on the network were empowered like never before while the so-called \"straight news\" hours became Trumpier and Trumpier. Its hosts scored dozens of Trump interviews, but, in most cases, instead of pressing him with tough questions, they egged on his worst tendencies. Even when not talking directly with him, the hosts were speaking directly to him. And they egged on those poor tendencies by feeding him a steady diet of hyper-partisan stories and outright disinformation. While it is officially called the \"Trump presidency,\" there is a good case to be made that it should be referred to as the \"Fox News presidency.\"\n Now, that is all coming to an end. But it is important to realize that none of that had to happen. Rupert Murdoch, who has already earned more money than he can possibly know what to do with, could have put an end to it with a snap of a finger. He could have done this when his hosts lied about the Russia investigation and pushed \"deep-state\" nonsense. He could have done it when his hosts misled the American public about the coronavirus. He could have done it when the network's top personalities entertained wild conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. He did not.\n Instead, Murdoch tweaked the network in another way. As Stelter reported earlier this month, Murdoch was personally involved in shaking up Fox's daytime lineup. That new lineup premiered on Monday. The biggest change? Replacing Martha MacCallum's newscast \u2014 which was already overtly conservative \u2014 with another right-wing talk show. More opinion, less news.\n While MacCallum lost her 7pm time slot, she is now hosting at 3pm. The promos said she would bring her \"unmatched perspective\" to the daytime hour. If Monday's show was any indication, that \"unmatched perspective\" translates to a right-wing POV. For her debut at 3pm, MacCallum's guest list consisted of Sara Carter, Charlie Kirk, Alex Berenson, Geraldo Rivera, Rep. Nancy Mace, K.T. McFarland, Heather Higgins, and Stephanie Cutter. Which is to say her hour was ripe with pro-Trump pundits. And while Cutter was on her show, MacCallum's posture was adversarial, of course.\n Brian Kilmeade on Monday became the first person to try out for host of \"Fox News Primetime\" \u2014 which, I feel obligated to note, is not actually in primetime given that primetime doesn't start until 8pm. Kilmeade played all the hits for the Fox audience. He led his show talking about censorship, moved on to fear-mongering about a migrant caravan heading toward the US border, and finished off a segment featuring Barstool's Dave Portnoy. It felt like Kilmeade's chief aim was to hit directly back at Newsmax's Greg Kelly, which has chipped away some of Fox's audience at 7pm, and earn some of that audience back...\n Fox is used to obnoxiously boasting that it dominates its competitors in the ratings. But right now, as Stelter wrote Friday, the channel is stuck in third place. The changes that were implemented Monday should be viewed through that frame. Will the shakeup bring Fox fans home? Also: More big changes are coming soon. Which hours will be shaken up next?",

        "title": "If Kim Jong Un destroyed North Korea's economy to keep Covid-19 out, will sanctions stop him from pursuing nuclear weapons?",
        "body_text": "After arguably the most challenging year of his near-decade rule of North Korea, Kim Jong Un is sticking to his guns.\n Kim announced last week at the Eighth Workers' Party Congress -- a meeting for North Korea's governing elite -- that his country plans to beef up Pyongyang's already dangerous nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs with new, sophisticated armaments, such as tactical nuclear weapons designed for use on the battlefield and warheads designed to evade American-made missile defense systems.\n And at a parade marking the conclusion of the Congress, Kim's military showed off a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).\n Kim's message was crystal clear: Right now, North Korea needs its nuclear weapons to deter the United States \"no matter who is in power,\" he said -- and no matter the cost.\n The young leader's ambitious plans for modernizing his nuclear arsenal will prove expensive, at a time when money is already tight. North Korea voluntarily severed the last of its scant ties with the outside world in 2020 to prevent an influx of Covid-19. That included cutting off almost all trade with Beijing, an economic lifeline the impoverished country needs to keep its people from going hungry.\n North Korea's economy is now in the gutter, and its food supply is reportedly in peril.\n To ward off the pandemic, Kim effectively did to his country what many in Washington hoped economic sanctions would do: bring the North Korean economy close to the brink of collapse. That he did it on his own volition has led many to question if sanctions ever be strong enough to change Kim's thinking.\n Some analysts disagree with that line of thinking. They see opportunity.\n With North Korea's economy already on the ropes, they believe now is the time to deliver the knockout punch -- a blow of crippling coercive measures that, once and for all, convinces Kim that his continued pursuit of nuclear weapons does not guarantee his regime's safety, it threatens it.\n Either way, Kim's plans will prove to be a major challenge for President-elect Joe Biden.\n Trump, like Obama and President George W. Bush, will leave his successor a more-dangerous and better-armed adversary than the one he inherited.\n Before Trump agreed to sit face-to-face with Kim in 2018, his administration put in place an aptly named strategy called \"maximum pressure.\"\n The goal was to use sanctions, diplomacy and other coercive measures, short of armed conflict, to convince Kim to agree to the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\n As North Korea tested missiles and nuclear bombs at an unprecedented clip in 2017, the Trump administration turned up the heat. The US mission to the United Nations successfully lobbied the UN Security Council to put in place resolutions that went after North Korea's ability to make money by selling regular goods, such as coal and seafood. The Treasury Department used its tremendous power and influence over the global financial system to enact their own, unilateral sanctions. And diplomats successfully lobbied US partners to close Pyongyang's embassies overseas, which the regime has been accused of using as fronts for money-making opportunities.\n By the end of 2017, North Korea was barred from almost all international trade. Even long-time  North Korean ally China agreed to sign on to incredibly punitive UN sanctions that year, and Beijing appeared to be enforcing them at first.\n That momentum didn't last. As Trump pivoted to diplomacy with Pyongyang in 2018, the United States took its foot off the gas on the pressure campaign. Hundreds of new sanctions that were ready to go were put on hold ahead of Trump's first summit with Kim in Singapore, the President said. Sanctions have been issued at a much slower clip since.\n As the threat subsided and its relationship with the United States crumbled, China began loosening its enforcement of restrictions, Washington alleged, though Beijing repeatedly denies any claims that it does not fully enforce UN sanctions.\n Many experts believe Washington gave up on maximum pressure too soon.\n Some, including former US acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific Evans Revere, argue Biden's team should seriously consider a new maximum pressure model, ramping up sanctions \"in ways that would impose even more pain and isolation on North Korea.\"\n \"Intensification of sanctions, plus other diplomatic, economic and banking and military pressures that you could apply on North Korea could certainly shake the regimes foundations, particularly now that we see that the regime is suffering a severe economic crisis the likes of which we haven't seen in a while,\" Revere said.\n Revere and other proponents of sanctions argue there are still tools left in the US arsenal to pressure North Korea, and they should be pursued. The Biden administration could, for example, try harder to close North Korean trading companies in conjunction with US allies and target Chinese banks that help North Korea access foreign currency.\n \"There is much, much more to be done that could squeeze, isolate and undermine North Korea in ways that would shake their confidence in their long-standing assumption that nuclear weapons are their salvation and would also drive the point home that not only are nuclear weapons not your salvation, they are the thing that has the potential to undermine the stability of your regime,\" Revere said.\n Revere said he recognizes that such an approach is risky.\n It could force North Koreans to choose between feeding its people and funding its nuclear weapons, and history shows Kim would likely choose the latter.\n Kim Jong Il, the current leader's father and predecessor, let millions die of starvation during a famine in the 1990s rather than reform, accept aid or or do anything that might have threatened his iron grip on leadership.\n Things aren't that bad in North Korea right now, but analysts believe the economic situation is more dire than it has been since the famine. Devastating storms, the punishing sanctions and the pandemic pummeled North Korea's economy in 2020. There appears to be enough food to go around, but the supply is under more strain than any time since the famine, according to Chad O'Carroll, the CEO of Korea Risk Group, which produces North Korea publications NK Pro and NK News.\n \"We can safely say there are nationwide shortages of several key food types, food items,\" he said.\n A large number of cases would likely overwhelm North Korea's dilapidated healthcare infrastructure, so Kim is unlikely to lift border restrictions until the pandemic subsides. That means Pyongyang will, in order to achieve its objectives, continue to inflict a level of economic pain upon itself.\n John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Relations, said that should be \"a sobering reminder to the Biden administration that (economic) pressure does not work on North Korea.\"\n \"North Korea subjected itself to an even more extreme form of economic pain (than sanctions) to keep away Covid. And yet, they're not budging on the nuclear thing,\" Delury said.\n Biden now faces the same foreign policy issue that has plagued his previous five predecessors: How to get North Korea to give up its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n He may be forced to do so sooner than he'd like. Though the new weapons Kim mentioned are at various stages of development, most would need to be test-fired to be considered operational. If North Korea were to conduct such a test, it would likely set the stage for a diplomatic confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang in the first days of Biden's presidency.\n Whatever path Biden chooses, major roadblocks remain.\n If, like his predecessor, Biden responded with sanctions and pressure, it might preclude the type of back-channel diplomacy used to set up the Iran deal. Pyongyang views sanctions as \"hostile\" acts and could in turn shut the door to talks with its typical bombastic language. North Korea referred to the last round of UN sanctions on it in 2017 as \"an act of war,\" and called the idea that it would give up its nuclear weapons a US \"pipe dream.\"\n The strategy would also require buy-in from three uneasy players: China, Russia and South Korea.\n \"China and Russia will not fully enforce even existing sanctions,\" said Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \"Geopolitically it would be difficult to designate new sanctions without a very convincing rationale for Beijing, Moscow and even South Korea's Moon government.\"\n China and Russia appear content with the status quo. South Korean President Moon Jae-in may not be on board with a pressure strategy because he favors engagement and economic cooperation as means of lowering the temperature. Moon said that dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation are key to the Korean peace process in a speech earlier this month.\n If dialogue is the path chosen, the Biden administration must recognize its limits, said Delury.\n \"We should moderate our expectations of what engagement can do,\" he said. \"We've seen what three summits can do, and it leaves a lot to be desired.\"\n But the biggest issue might simply be bandwidth. Biden comes into office facing incredibly daunting challenges at home. He must stop the Covid-19 pandemic raging within the United States' own borders, heal a wounded nation still recovering after a Trump-incited mob of insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol, and get his Cabinet approved by the Senate which must try Trump after his impeachment on charges of insurrection.\n \"How do you deal with this North Korea challenge ... and deal with all these other things at the same time?\" Revere said. \"This is hard, but these are extremely capable people.\"\n CNN's Kylie Atwood and Jake Kwon contributed reporting",

        "body_text": "New Covid-19 cases in the United States have been trending down since hitting a peak last week, but experts say it's too soon to be overly optimistic.\n The US recorded 1.5 million new Covid-19 cases in the past seven days, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University -- an 11% drop from the previous week. Cases declined in 35 states week-over-week, and 18 states saw a drop in the number of deaths.\n \"These kinds of fluctuations, on a statistical basis, aren't sustainable,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert with Johns Hopkins University, told CNN.\n \"The virus has established itself in the human population and it's not going anywhere,\" Adalja said. \"We're going to see a lot of transmission until we cross the threshold for herd immunity.\"\n With a longer range view, last week's apparent improvement falls much closer to average. Over the past month, the number of new Covid-19 cases recorded each day has ranged from nearly 101,000 to more than 302,000; over the past seven days, new cases averaged about 218,000 daily.\n These broader trends could indicate that the US is beginning to flatten the curve, said Dr. Edison Liu of The Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institution.\n Flattening the curve is not the endpoint, but it is a positive step in the right direction, Liu told CNN.\n \"Flattening the curve means we've stopped the exponential rise of infection; that whatever intervention we have worked,\" he said. \"But that's only the first step. What we're really looking for is a consistent downward trend.\"\n It's still too early in the vaccine rollout to consider the vaccines a factor contributing to the decline in cases. \"There has not been enough vaccination to see a full effect nationally,\" Adalja told CNN.\n And new, potentially more contagious strains of the virus pose an added threat, experts say.\n \"It's a race against time to reimpose protective behaviors and equip ourselves against the spread of virus,\" Liu said. \"If we allow it to spread, you will see an increase, definitely, in the number of cases.\"\n Despite what the data may be say, experts agree that continued vigilance is key.\n \"I wouldn't let our guard down,\" Adalja said. \"Biologically speaking, nothing is changing.\"",

Bush initially became president in 2001. Final details are still being sorted out between the two leaders, sources said, and the two are expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss these issues.\n Similar to those rules, set in January 2001, Schumer and McConnell aides are discussing allowing bills and nominations to advance to the Senate floor even if they are tied during committee votes, something that could become common given that each party is expected to have the same number of seats on committees.\n Democrats will hold the chairmanships of the committees, giving them power to set the agenda, and Schumer will be granted the title of majority leader since Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will cast tiebreaking votes on the floor.\n The full chamber still has to ratify these procedures, but that is expected to occur once Schumer and McConnell have finalized their agreement.\n Democrats are still waiting for the seating of the two new Georgia Democrats -- Sens.-elect Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff -- who won their runoff races this month. Georgia election officials had expected the certification process to be completed by Tuesday, and if it is, it's possible the two senators could take their oaths and be sworn in that day, according to Democratic sources.\n Harris resigned her Senate seat on Monday, and will soon be replaced by Democrat Alex Padilla. It's still uncertain when Padilla will be sworn into office.\n Once Harris gets sworn in as vice president and the final three Democrats take their Senate seats, their caucus will be in charge of a 50-50 Senate with Harris breaking ties.",

        "body_text": "Colombia's best-known drug trafficker, Pablo Escobar, may have been killed in 1993 but his influence continues to be felt in the country, sometimes in unexpected ways.\n Hippopotamuses brought to Colombia as part of Escobar's private zoo at his ranch, Hacienda Napoles, have bred so successfully that there is serious concern over their environmental impact and human safety, according to a new study by researchers at Mexican and Colombian universities.\n The hippos have spread out from their original home, some 100 miles east of the city of Medellin, in the Antioquia department, dispersing around the Magdalena river basin as their population continues to grow steadily.\n The authors of the study, published in the January edition of the journal Biological Conservation, recommend that the hippos be culled to prevent long-term negative effects, but other scientists are calling for a castration program to control the hippo population, citing concerns over animal welfare and the attachment of some locals to their new neighbors.\n Back in the 1980s, Escobar imported one male and three female hippos to join his menagerie. Upon his death, other species of exotic animals were relocated, but the hippos were left because they were difficult to capture and transport, according to the study.\n The hippos soon began to spread in the surrounding area, but government efforts to cull them were halted after a public outcry.\n A sterilization campaign was begun instead, but it has done little to slow the hippos' progress.\n From 2011 to 2019 four males were castrated and two females were sterilized, but this \"does not seem to have an important impact on reproduction,\" according to the study.\n Researchers say there are probably more than 80 hippos in the area today, up from 35 in 2012, and they worry that the hippos will continue to spread throughout Colombia if no action is taken.\n The study also cites research showing the negative effects of hippo waste on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can affect fish and ultimately humans, and raises concerns about the possible transmission of diseases from hippos to humans.\n Hippos also pose a threat to the livelihoods and security of people in affected areas, the study said, eating or damaging crops and engaging in aggressive interactions with humans.\n The researchers cite incidences of hippos chasing people, as well as a hippo attack in May 2020 in which a 45-year-old man was seriously injured.\n But while the study's authors recommend a cull, Enrique Zerda Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a biologist at Colombia's National University, believes castration programs are the way forward.\n Culling the hippos would be an \"easy option,\" said Zerda, but it could affect the survival of a species that is under threat in Africa.\n Though sterilizing hippos is no easy task, he said, he believes it is both possible and necessary to do so now, before their numbers rise further, according to a press release from the university.\n \"Right now, the authorities don't consider the species to be a problem,\" Zerda said, \"but in the future, when there are 400-500 hippos, it could represent a threat to the survival of other species that feed in the same areas.\"\n David Echeverri Lopez, head of forests and biodiversity at the CORNARE regional environmental agency, told CNN that the situation is delicate.\n \"The option of killing them has always been on the table,\" he said. \"However it's very difficult to imagine this could happen at the moment.\"\n While the hippos are an invasive species capable of completely changing local ecosystems, people in the area have gotten used to them, Echeverri said. They've become a tourist attraction that people feel some affection toward, he added.\n Some of the hippos will have to be killed, because it's \"practically impossible\" to find and relocate or sterilize them.\n \"But there are some other animals that are located in certain areas, in lakes and places that allow for a birth control plan to be put in place, assuming that adequate resources are available,\" said Echeverri, who is working with the NGO Animal Balance to try to find alternative solutions.",

Yes, really.\n Just Scream!, a hotline created by elementary school teacher Chris Gollmar, aims to reduce tension for those needing an outlet. All you have to do is call the hotline and scream for as loud as you want, and for as long as you want -- and then hang up.\n \"I wanted to find a prompt that people would respond to and screaming seemed to be a good fit!\" Gollmar told CNN of his creative project, which he came up with in September 2020 and launched just before Election Day in November.\n Gollmar, who said he's been an artist and coder since he was a kid, spends his free time working on participatory art projects that invite people to call a phone number and leave a voicemail for others to hear.\n This time, he said he \"thought it would be funny and unique to create a phone line just for screaming.\"\n After people dial in, their calls are recorded and put on the website Gollmar created.\n \"Why should I call you?\" the website asks.\"To scream! You might be unhappy, terrified, frustrated, or elated. All of these are perfectly good reasons to call and record yourself screaming.\"\n Personal phone numbers are not stored, and all calls go to an answering machine -- so interacting with a real person isn't required.\n According to the website, there is currently a backlog of over 40,000 screams waiting to upload.\n \"Wow! That's a lot of screaming!\" the website states, noting if people can't hear their own scream that it may still be processing.\n Gollmar said he's gotten 70,000 recordings since launching the hotline.\n \"Never in my life would I have expected so many people to actually pick up the phone, dial a number and record themselves for the world to hear,\" he said. \"But we're all screaming on the inside right now, so I guess I should have figured.\"\n The hotline will stop accepting calls on January 21. After that, Gollmar said he will pick a new project to work on.\n \"I've always intended it (the hotline) to be a limited-term project -- a reflection of this point in time when, in addition to all the stress of the pandemic, we're also experiencing political turmoil in the United States,\" he said. \"I've started thinking about it like a time capsule, in a way.\"\n Don't worry, though: The screams will remain on the project's website.

        "body_text": "Between March and November last year, even as the coronavirus upended lives and devastated economies around the world, India's richest man was handed more than $27 billion to make a bet on the future of the internet.\n More than half that eye-popping amount came from Silicon Valley. It started with $5.7 billion from Facebook in March, one of the biggest investments in the American company's history. Silver Lake Partners, the private equity firm based eight miles from Facebook's (FB) Menlo Park headquarters, followed with its own investment just weeks later, as did Palo Alto's General Atlantic and San Francisco-headquartered TPG Capital.\n Smaller investments from Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC) came next, before Google (GOOGL) swooped in with $4.5 billion to swell the impressive war chest.\n The recipient of all those billions is Jio Platforms, part of Ambani's sprawling conglomerate Reliance Industries. Jio started as a mobile network in 2016. Since then it has amassed around 400 million users and launched a streaming service, a video conferencing app, a fiber broadband network and digital payments.\n Its super-cheap data has helped bring hundreds of millions of Indians online for the first time. When Ambani launched Jio, India had fewer than 350 million internet users. Now, it has 750 million.\n Jio has become the gateway to India's internet, and Ambani holds the keys.\n \"A lot of this change, especially in terms of bringing people online, has happened on the back of the positive disruption that Jio triggered,\" Ajit Mohan, Facebook's vice president and managing director in India, told CNN Business. \"Jio has been the hero in that story in terms of providing that access, and I think that sets the context for our investment and Jio and our partnership, because... we saw alignment of the vision.\"\n Ambani's vision keeps getting bigger.\n After raising more than $20 billion for Jio Platforms, Reliance went courting investors for its retail business. Between late September and early November, Reliance Retail raised around $6.4 billion, much of it coming from Jio investors including Silver Lake, General Atlantic, TPG as well as the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia.\n Ambani's retail chain is the biggest in India, with more than 12,000 stores. And he has made no secret of his ambitions to combine his retail and tech empires to take on two big US players. Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart's (WMT) Flipkart dominate online shopping in India, controlling more than 60% of the market between them. Ambani is making an aggressive play for a slice.\n He's doing that with JioMart, an initiative announced in 2019 to bring online thousands of India's mom-and-pop stores known as \"kiranas.\" And Reliance Retail recently acquired one of its biggest Indian rivals, Future Retail, for $3.3 billion \u2014 a deal that has kicked off a protracted and complex legal battle with Amazon.\n Even as he digests all of that, India's richest man is already looking to the next big thing \u2014 bringing 5G to India in the second half of 2021.\n \"It will be powered by an indigenous developed network, hardware, and technology components,\" Ambani told a virtual audience at the India Mobile Congress in November, in a possible nod to calls for China's Huawei to be excluded from building the country's 5G network.\n Any one of those plans on its own would be a big undertaking and executing them all together is a huge ask even for one of the world's top billionaires. His ambition is to fundamentally transform the way more than a billion people communicate, do business and make purchases.\n And the ultimate goal is to reach billions more.\n \"We are creating compelling homegrown solutions in education, health care, agriculture, infrastructure, financial services and new commerce,\" Ambani said in his speech. \"Each of these solutions, once proven in India, will be offered to the rest of the world to address global challenges.\"\n But the billionaire, who is reportedly looking to take Jio public in the United States, may find it challenging to parlay the company's meteoric rise in India into success on the global stage.\n \"Reliance does not have any one area where it has a technological edge and superiority like say Google's search, Facebook's portfolio of social networks, Amazon's e-commerce engine, Alibaba's combination of strengths in e-commerce and payments or Tencent's super app,\" said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at the Institute for Business in the Global Context at Tufts University's Fletcher School.\n Rather, Jio's dominance has been largely geographical, helped by a regulatory regime that supports homegrown players.\n \"One would be hard pressed to come up with a meaningful list of technological innovations and IP that Jio created that could be the basis for its expansion abroad,\" Chaturvedi added.\n India is, of course, a massive prize in itself that Jio has largely already captured.\n The country's online population of 750 million \u2014 second only to China, which has shut out US companies for decades \u2014 is the biggest draw for global tech. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Uber (UBER), to name a few, have already spent several years and billions of dollars to crack open the market.\n \"For Silicon Valley, the Indian market alone is bigger than the five next biggest consumer markets \u2014 by population \u2014 in the world combined,\" said Chaturvedi.\n Where China has its \"Great Firewall\" of online censorship that keeps out US tech companies en masse, Ambani has succeeded in creating a \"Great Indian Paywall\" that runs through Jio, Chaturvedi argues.\n Global tech firms have been forced to navigate a series of regulatory hurdles from an Indian government that has shown a greater willingness to clamp down on foreign players \u2014 whether blocking Facebook's efforts to provide free internet, changing how companies can store and collect data or, more recently, shutting out Chinese tech companies over a border dispute.\n Ambani has been the biggest beneficiary of many of those regulations, and the billionaire has been a vocal champion of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his campaign for a \"self-reliant\" India.\n A few cracks \u2014 albeit small ones \u2014 have started to appear in Ambani's dominance. Barely a day into 2021, the Securities and Exchange Board of India ordered Reliance Industries and Ambani to pay a $5.5 million fine over what the regulator described as a \"fraudulent and manipulative trading scheme\" over a former subsidiary in 2007.\n But that's unlikely to dent his tech ambitions. Ambani, who declined multiple requests to be interviewed for this article, is used to making audacious bets and having them pay off \u2014 usually with enormous resources at his disposal and a fair political wind at his back.\n \"After all he's India's richest man, he has therefore the deepest pockets in this country,\" said Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, journalist and co-author of Gas Wars: Crony Capitalism and the Ambanis. \"I can say without any risk of contradiction that he has been supported by a favorable political dispensation and a regulatory regime,\" he added.\n The corporate empire that Ambani presides over today looks rather different to the one he inherited.\n His father, Dhirubhai, started a small yarn trading firm in Mumbai in 1957 that he subsequently spun into a thriving textile business. Over decades, it grew into the sprawling conglomerate Reliance Industries spanning energy, petrochemicals and telecommunications. Dhirubhai's death in 2002 kicked off an acrimonious succession battle that split the business in two.\n Mukesh Ambani ultimately took over the company's main oil and petrochemicals assets, while his younger brother Anil assumed control of the newer ventures, including telecom and digital businesses.\n \"You lure your users by giving something free, and once they've got hooked onto it, you gradually start increasing the prices,\" Thakurta said. \"It's the classic way all kinds of monopolies work across the globe.\"\n One of the major casualties of the price war was Anil Ambani. His Reliance Communications company announced in late 2017 that it would sell most of its assets and exit the mobile business. Two days later, Jio acquired Reliance Communications. And two years later, the elder Ambani underscored the divergence in the brothers' fortunes by helping pay off an $80 million debt to Ericsson (ERIC), keeping Anil out of jail.\n Jio's meteoric rise has helped offset some of the volatility in oil that cost Ambani billions last year and set up Reliance for a future that's further removed from its core business. In fact, a company spokesperson previously told CNN Business that the name Jio \u2014 which means \"to live\" in Hindi \u2014 was chosen in part because it's a mirror image of the world \"oiL.\"\n Ambani charted his course years ago.\n \"Data is the new oil,\" he said in 2017, just six months into his campaign to disrupt India's tech landscape.\n For American tech giants, having a big homegrown player in your corner often makes life easier in a foreign country, and Jio is by far the biggest in India.\n \"Why did Facebook, why did Google...put in their money in Jio at a time when the world economy is in a mess, the Indian economy is in recession, why would they do it? Obviously because there is more than an economic angle,\" said Thakurta. \"It's also I believe, indirectly... a political insurance of sorts.\"\n Mohan, Facebook's India head, denied that government regulation was part of the conversation.\n \"That didn't have anything to do with our investment in Jio or the partnership,\" he said. \"It really did come from recognizing that this was a special company that had done pretty amazing work in transforming the digital infrastructure of India in a short period of time.\"\n From Ambani's perspective, a wide-ranging coalition of some of the biggest names in tech is just a way to further Jio's command over all aspects of India's internet.\n \"As digitization of the Indian economy and Indian society picks up speed, the demand for digital hardware will grow enormously. We cannot rely on large-scale imports,\" Ambani said last month. \"I clearly foresee India becoming a major hub for a state-of-the-art semiconductor industry.\"\n Qualcomm, a longtime Jio partner, joined the investment bandwagon by spending around $97 million in July for a 0.15% stake. Jio's commitment to building out its own network while also developing a smartphone presented the chipmaker with a unique opportunity to get involved on both sides of Ambani's internet access plan, according to Quinn Li, senior vice president and global head of the company's investment arm Qualcomm Ventures.\n \"If you look at operators across the world, not many are that vertically integrated,\" he told CNN Business. \"Given we're the technology supplier to the industry, we're I think best equipped to work with Jio both on the device front as well as infrastructure.\"\n Ambani appears ready to leverage the global backing for Jio and Reliance Retail into IPOs, saying in June that he would \"move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years.\" An IPO for Jio Platforms on Nasdaq could come as soon as 2021, according to several media reports and industry analysts. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment on its IPO plans.\n \"I wouldn't be surprised in the least,\" said Thakurta. \"Once you're on Nasdaq, you give all these investors a good exit route.\"\n Ambani seems confident he can get the world to buy into India's moment, anchored in his company. And given his track record so far, he has no reason not to be.\n \"Friends, we are about to step into a glorious decade of the India story,\" he declared. \"Nothing can stop India's rise, not even Covid-19. This is our chance to create history.\"",

        "title": "How Trump allies stoked the flames ahead of Capitol riot ",
        "body_text": "Steve Bannon evoked the beaches of Normandy. Michael Flynn drew comparisons to Civil War battlefields and spoke of Americans who died for their country. Roger Stone called it a struggle \"between the godly and the godless, between good and evil.\" Rudy Giuliani called for \"trial by combat.\" Ali Alexander said it would be a \"knife fight.\"\n As 2020 faded into 2021, some of President Donald Trump's most influential supporters -- among them members of his inner circle who were in direct contact with the President -- spoke in ominous and violent terms about what was coming on January 6.\n Even as anxious eyes turn toward the Inauguration Day on January 20, the words of these firebrands in the leadup to the riots at the Capitol raise crucial questions about the relationship between the rhetoric of far-right figureheads and the violence that unfolded on January 6.\n \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\" Bannon, Trump's former top White House adviser, promised listeners of his podcast -- called \"War Room\" -- on January 5.\n The next day, Trump himself gave a rambling speech near the White House where he claimed the election \"was stolen from you, from me and from the country,\" and called on supporters to \"walk down to the Capitol.\"\n \"We are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\" he added, \"and we are probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you will never take back our country with weakness.\"\n Soon after, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, killing a police officer and assaulting others before charging inside -- some carrying weapons and zip-tie handcuffs.\n \"What we have is influential, powerful people influencing the President and pushing out messages that are radicalizing large chunks of the population,\" said Heidi Beirich, chief strategy officer for the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit organization that monitors extremism around the world. \"It's very dangerous.\"\n To be sure, as a rule most speech that doesn't convey a direct threat or incite \"imminent lawless action\" is protected under the First Amendment.\n But experts told CNN they believe Trump and his most visible allies bear a great deal of responsibility for stoking the flames that led to the January 6 uprising.\n \"When you are an adviser to a President, formal or informal, you need to think about the impact of anti-democratic rhetoric,\" said John Hudak, an expert on governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \"And the President himself, and a lot of the President's supporters and certainly his children, seem to believe that it is responsible for a President and his advisers and family to be anti-democratic. That's a real problem. And we haven't really experienced that in our history.\"\n Trump has already paid a historic price for his words, with the US House on Wednesday voting to make him the only American president to have been impeached twice -- this time for \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n But while much attention has been paid to Trump's words in the run up to the breach of the US Capitol, less talked about is the fiery rhetoric of his most high-profile champions.\n Bannon and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment. Stone rejected CNN's questions as \"defamatory attempts to say that my belief in God and my view of the last election in apocalyptic terms is somehow inciting violence.\" Alexander argued he had \"no involvement in the breach of the US Capitol.\"\n Flynn attorney Sidney Powell, who herself is facing a defamation lawsuit over her claims about the election (she's denied the allegations), insisted that Flynn \"encourages patriotism and lawful political action,\" and to suggest otherwise is \"absolutely ludicrous.\"\n In the weeks between the election and that day, Bannon and his guests and co-hosts on his \"War Room\" podcast relentlessly promoted conspiracy theories of election fraud and cast the fight to overturn the election results in war-like and often apocalyptic terms.\n Bannon's menacing metaphors first landed him in hot water a few days after on Election Day, when he suggested in a video that posted to several of his social media accounts that, if he were in charge, he wouldn't merely fire FBI Director Christopher Wray and Anthony Fauci -- the US government's top infectious disease expert -- but would put their heads on pikes \"as a warning to federal bureaucrats.\" Twitter permanently suspended his account.\n In December, Bannon's co-host tweeted a video of Bannon speaking on \"War Room\" overlaid with cinematic music and dramatic images from the famous D-Day battle scene of \"Saving Private Ryan.\" In it, he spoke of the \"moral obligation\" Trump supporters have to \"the kids that died at Normandy.\" He added that if they allow Biden -- \"that feckless old man\" -- to win, \"I want you to explain that to the 20-year-old kid in the first wave on D-Day.\"\n On December 28, Bannon insisted that patriotic Trump supporters had to be ready to fight in the spirit of George Washington's soldiers during the American Revolution and American soldiers on D-Day in World War II. \"That's our DNA, that's where we come from,\" Bannon said.\n Bannon began promoting the upcoming DC protests of January 6.\n \"l'll tell you this,\" Bannon said the day before the riot.  \"It's not going to happen like you think it's going to happen. OK, it's going to be quite extraordinarily different. And all I can say is, strap in ... You have made this happen and tomorrow it's game day. So strap in. Let's get ready.\"\n The podcasts also pointed to close coordination with Trump's team. \"You and me were talking almost every day, many times, you know, 10 times a day,\" Trump campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn said to Bannon on December 28.\n Meanwhile, a senior Trump adviser confirmed that the President and Bannon have been in communication in recent weeks, discussing Trump's conspiracy theories about the election.\n Just before Christmas, Alexander -- a political activist who has organized pro-Trump rallies, including one of the demonstrations that converged on the Capitol lawn on January 6 -- used violent metaphors to hint at what was to come in January when speaking to followers of his livestream channel on the social media platform Periscope. In his freewheeling monologue, Alexander credited Roger Stone, a veteran Republican operative and self-described \"dirty trickster\" whose 40-month prison sentence for seven felonies was cut short by Trump's commutation in July. (He was given a full pardon in December).\n \"This is something Roger and I have been planning for a long time,\" Alexander said. \"And finally, he's off the leash. So, you know, it's a knife fight and your two knife fighters are Ali Alexander and Roger Stone, and you either fight with us or you get slashed. So I'll let you guys know more about what that means as we evolve.\"\n Alexander has helped turn the \"Stop the Steal\" slogan that Stone launched on Trump's behalf during the 2016 primaries into a rallying cry for conservatives around the country.\n At a DC rally on the night of January 5, Stone took the stage clad in one of his trademark pinstripe suits as a dance track titled \"Roger Stone did nothing wrong\" blared from the speakers.\n After repeating the falsehood that the election was stolen from Trump, Stone, 68, rallied the faithful with an us-versus-them battle cry.\n \"This is nothing less than an epic struggle for the future of this country between dark and light, between the godly and the godless, between good and evil,\" he said. \"And we will win this fight or America will step off into a thousand years of darkness. We dare not fail. I will be with you tomorrow shoulder to shoulder.\"\n Stone also has bumped elbows with extremist groups, most notably the Proud Boys. In September he endorsed the congressional candidacy of Nick Ochs, who founded the Hawaii chapter of the far-right organization. Ochs, whose bid for the US House came up short, was arrested for his role in the Capitol siege. Law enforcement was alerted to it by the photo Ochs posted on Twitter of himself enjoying a cigarette in the building, and by the comments he made to a CNN reporter.\n Long a dispenser of supercharged rhetoric, Stone was not muted by his recent run-in with the law, and was talking about election fraud even before November.\n In September, he went on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' show, InfoWars, and the two mused discursively about \"fake ballots,\" Big Tech and the Clintons.\n \"If someone will study the president's authority in the Insurrection Act in his ability to impose, impose martial law,\" Stone said, \"if there is widespread cheating, he will have the authority to arrest (Mark) Zuckerberg, to arrest Tim Cook, to arrest the Clintons, to arrest anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal activity.\"\n For his part, Jones has joined \"Stop the Steal\" efforts since the November election and used inflammatory, dark rhetoric to bolster the movement's false claims.\n Two days after election day, Jones said, \"We are in the attempted overthrow of our country.\" When a guest on the show mentioned people showing up in person to protest the counting of votes, Jones drew a comparison to World War II.\n \"It's like when Hitler was bombing London, most Brits were against a war because they had World War I. But once Hitler bombed them, over 95% said let's go to war,\" he said. \"This is a war. This is not regular times.\"\n Jones did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n Also employing war analogies is another beneficiary of Trump's pardon powers -- Michael T. Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\n Speaking to a fired-up crowd at the DC rally on January 5, Flynn -- who was pardoned by Trump in November after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat -- managed to pack election-fraud conspiracy theories, violent innuendo and a call to action into a couple of sentences.\n \"In some of these states, we have more dead voters than are buried on the battlefields of Gettysburg, or the battlefields of Vicksburg, or the battlefields of Normandy,\" he said. \"Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don't have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here, and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie.\"\n Much of the rhetoric leading up to the riot has been draped in the language of existential threat.\n Speaking at a January 6 rally just before the siege, Rudy Giuliani -- Trump's personal attorney -- spoke in grandiose terms about the stakes at hand.\n \"This is bigger than Donald Trump,\" he said. \"It's bigger than you and me. It's about these monuments and what they stand for. This has been a year in which they have invaded our freedom of speech, our freedom of religion, our freedom to move, our freedom to live. I'll be darned if they're going to take away our free and fair vote. And we're going to fight to the very end to make sure that doesn't happen.\"\n His mention of \"trial by combat\" was cited by the New York State Bar Association, which has launched an inquiry into Giuliani to determine whether he should be expelled from the group.\n \"Mr. Giuliani's words quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election's outcome to take matters into their own hands,\" the group said in a statement. \"Their subsequent attack on the Capitol was nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power.\"\n John Scott-Railton, a researcher at University of Toronto's Citizen Lab who now works with others to identify extremist groups who were part of the Capitol mob, said the rhetoric plays into the fantasies of armed protesters who have been gunning for a civil war.\n \"They're ready -- it's what they've been prancing around in the woods, playing dress up, preparing for,\" he said. \"I'm just terribly worried that they weren't satisfied with what happened on the sixth, and they're going to come back for more.\"\n As for Bannon, the tenor of his podcast took a turn once the violence started unfolding.\n On the morning of January 6, before the rally and march on the Capitol, Bannon echoed Stone's words by saying the day would be a battle between \"the children of light and the forces of darkness.\"\n But the podcast's tone shifted sharply as footage of the violence at the Capitol was broadcast nationwide. Even as Bannon and his co-podcasters continued to describe Vice President Mike Pence as a traitor, they absolved Trump and themselves from any responsibility for fomenting violence.\n \"What's going on right now was choices made by individuals who are fed up with what they've seen happen,\" said right-wing activist Ben Bergquam on a War Room episode later that same day. \"When I'm talking to people on the ground, that is what I'm hearing over and over and over again, it has nothing to do with President Trump's words.\"\n Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, said anyone paying attention knew the events on January 6 would be a magnet for angry people. The violence of extremists, he added, has historically been sparked by a fear that something is being taken away -- be it a White majority, guns or a way of life.\n \"Whether it's illegal or not, people have gotta know better,\" he said. \"You don't have to be a genius to know how people are incited by words.\"\n CNN's Nelli Black, Scott Bronstein, Bob Ortega, Benjamin Naughton and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Amazon Prime show 'Tandav' faces calls for a ban in India",
        "body_text": "Authorities are looking into claims that Amazon's new Prime Video series \"Tandav\" includes religiously insensitive content. Several Indian politicians say they have complained to the police or regulators about the company and the show's creators.\n The title is a political drama that has been likened to the hit Netflix (NFLX) series \"House of Cards.\" It was released last Friday on Amazon's streaming service and boasts some of Bollywood's biggest names, including celebrity director Ali Abbas Zafar and actor Saif Ali Khan.\n The show follows a power-hungry politician who is willing to do anything to become the country's prime minister. It appears to be loosely based on real political controversies that have erupted across the country as Hindu nationalism has grown. (The cast and crew said Monday in a statement that the show is a \"work of fiction and any resemblance to acts and persons and events is purely coincidental.\")\n The show's depiction of some Hindu deities, though, has drawn ire from local lawmakers. Manoj Kotak, a member of parliament from Mumbai, said Sunday on Twitter that he has written to the country's Minister of Information and Broadcasting urging him to \"ban [the] controversial web series.\"\n Kotak, who is a member of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said that the show's creators appeared to be \"deliberately mocking Hindu Gods.\"\n Amazon declined to comment on Monday.\n Zafar, the director of the series, expressed \"sincere apologies\" on Twitter, posting a statement from Tandav's cast and crew.\n \"The cast and crew of 'Tandav' take cognizance of the concerns expressed by the people and unconditionally apologize if it has unintentionally hurt anybody's sentiments,\" the statement read.\n The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, which has announced an intention to start regulating streaming services, said Monday that it had reached out to executives at Amazon about the show.\n \"A discussion will happen on this,\" a spokesperson told CNN Business.\n The series has prompted other lawmakers to go to the police. Ram Kadam, another BJP leader and local legislator in the state of Maharashtra, said he filed a police complaint in Mumbai over the weekend, accusing Amazon of intending to \"outrage religious sentiments\" and publish \"material which can cause harm.\"\n Local police confirmed that they had received Kadam's complaint, but had not yet started an investigation.\n Police initiated a separate investigation on Sunday in the state of Uttar Pradesh against Zafar, as well as Aparna Purohit, Amazon's chief of Indian original Prime Video content, according to a media adviser for the state's chief minister.\n The series has also been hit by negative reviews on Amazon, which claim that the show promotes a \"Hindu-phobic agenda\" or comes across as \"anti-Hindu.\"\n India is a crucial market for Amazon. This month, a company executive called the country \"one of the most exciting streaming markets in the world right now.\"\n During the pandemic, the firm \"doubled down our investment on films in this period,\" Gaurav Gandhi, director and general manager of Amazon Prime Video in India, told Deadline in a recent interview.\n Original content is key to that strategy, with more than 80 titles in production or development, Purohit told the outlet.\n This isn't the first time Amazon has run into hot water in India.\n The \"Tandav\" incident is also reminiscent of a recent encounter with Netflix (NFLX) in India. Last year, the streaming giant faced boycott calls in the country over a now-infamous kissing scene in one of its shows.\n The exchange, which takes place in the series, \"A Suitable Boy,\" depicts a young Hindu woman being kissed by a Muslim man at a Hindu temple. The show angered some viewers in India, prompting a police complaint against Netflix executives.\n Netflix declined to comment Monday about the current status of that complaint. A police official told CNN Business the investigation was ongoing.\n The news comes at a sensitive time for streaming services in the country. Last fall, the Indian government announced new rules for digital media, saying that online streaming platforms would be regulated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.\n That could force companies like Amazon and Netflix to follow the same restrictions as traditional media, such as rules about showing violence or nudity.\n \u2014 CNN's Vedika Sud contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Armed demonstrators gather at Virginia state Capitol as states stay tight on security ahead of inauguration",
        "body_text": "Dozens of armed demonstrators gathered at the state Capitol in Richmond, Virginia, on Monday as authorities remained on alert at capitols across the United States two days ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n Several demonstrators in Richmond identified themselves as members of the Proud Boys and Boogaloo groups as well as the Black Panthers. The demonstrations were part of the state's annual \"Lobby Day,\" an event held in support of Second Amendment rights and hosted by the Virginia Citizens Defense League.\n Car caravans originating from across the state of Virginia also converged on downtown Richmond. The Citizens Defense League, unable to obtain a permit to hold their yearly rally downtown, held the caravan instead.\n The Richmond Police Department reminded demonstrators in a tweet Monday that the city has banned firearms at permitted events, which are events of 11 or more people that obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.\n The demonstrations came after a state of emergency was declared in Richmond ahead of anticipated protests at the state Capitol and Gov. Ralph Northam activated the National Guard in the wake of the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol.\n Officials braced for potential unrest this weekend after an internal FBI bulletin warned that such demonstrations were being planned at all 50 state capitols through at least Wednesday.\n But protests were largely small, with demonstrators -- some of whom were armed -- vastly outnumbered by police.\n A light snow fell Sunday morning in Lansing, Michigan, but an estimated 75 demonstrators and 40 counterprotesters showed up at the Statehouse. Some carried firearms and wore body armor, but protests remained peaceful, officials said.\n \"We wanted to make sure what happened in Washington did not happen here in Michigan,\" Lt. Michael Shaw of Michigan State Police told CNN, \"so we put a lot more security outside, a lot more visible security than normally would be there.\"\n In Texas, about two dozen armed demonstrators gathered near the state Capitol in Austin, but they rallied in support of Second Amendment rights, the organizer said -- not in protest of the results of the presidential election.\n In Denver, demonstrator Larry Woodall said he was disappointed by the low turnout of Sunday's protest. While he accepted that Biden will be inaugurated, Woodall said he wanted to show his support for Trump, suggesting he would vote for Trump in 2024 if he ran for president again.\n \"Donald Trump ain't a bad guy. He really isn't,\" Woodall told CNN, adding he was opposed to the violence seen this month at the US Capitol.\n About a dozen people -- including some who held anti-Trump signs -- were at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, which was surrounded by tall, heavy fencing. There were five armed people dressed in camouflage and carrying flags at the Oregon state Capitol in Salem who said they were anti-government libertarians who supported neither Trump nor Biden.\n At Ohio's Statehouse in Columbus, a small group of protesters gathered next to a statue of President William McKinley amid a large police presence and metal barriers, CNN affiliate WSYX reported.\n About 40 protesters gathered at the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, for a rally over free speech after social media companies banned Trump, according to CNN affiliate WIS. The organizer of the event, Shawn Laurie, told WIS he didn't condone the riot at the US Capitol but felt he was being restricted on social media, hampering others from understanding who he really is.\n \"I'm a patriot, I'm a veteran, I'm not a racist, I'm not hateful, I'm not violent,\" he told the station. \"I'm an American and that's it.\"\n Whatever crowds were present were just a fraction of the pro-Trump crowds that converged on Washington, DC, earlier this month, an incident that eventually swelled into a full-on riot and left five dead.\n Many of Sunday's demonstrations were dwarfed by the ranks of police who stood guard to prevent a repeat of the Capitol riot.\n Meanwhile, the Pentagon has authorized up to 25,000 National Guard troops for Inauguration Day -- an unusually large number, according to retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a CNN military analyst.\n \"The National Guard -- or the forefathers of the National Guard, the early days of the militia -- have been a part of every inauguration since George Washington,\" he said, \"but certainly not at this level and certainly not with this kind of background noise going on.\"\n The deployment of 25,000 troops is about twice the number of National Guard members normally involved in the inauguration, Hertling said.\n \"It certainly is somewhat like a combat zone,\" he said.\n The rehearsal for the inauguration ceremony was delayed until Monday amid heightened security concerns, acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said, citing \"online chatter\" about the previously scheduled rehearsal day of Sunday. But he said there are \"no specific credible threats.\"\n Guests of members of Congress will not be required to undergo security background checks this year, multiple sources told CNN on Monday. Guests ordinarily do not have background checks for events such as the inauguration because those guests tend to be spouses of members and other security measures are in place.\n Member guests will be required to take a Covid-19 tests. Both members of Congress and their guests will be required to pass through security in order to enter the event.\n \"In order to maintain critical operational security surrounding the 59th Presidential Inauguration, the U.S. Secret Service and our law enforcement partners will not be commenting on the means and methods used to conduct the agency mission, inclusive of protective intelligence matters,\" US Secret Service spokesperson Justine Whelan told CNN in a statement.\n The Federal Aviation Administration expanded restrictions on DC's airspace, posting a notice to pilots restricting noncommercial and nonmilitary flights to Dulles International Airport, Baltimore Washington International Airport and Manassas Regional Airport between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Inauguration Day.\n The bulletin warned that the government \"may use deadly force\" against any aircraft that's determined to pose an \"imminent security threat.\"\n Many of the capital's monuments and buildings are inaccessible, including the National Mall, which will be closed through at least Thursday. The iconic lawn stretching from the Capitol to the White House, typically a viewing area for presidential inaugurations, was deserted Sunday -- something National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst told CNN was \"unprecedented, almost surreal.\"\n \"But it is being done,\" he said, \"to guarantee that the constitutional mandate of a peaceful transfer of power on January 20 takes place.\"\n State leaders ramped up security around their capitol grounds in recent days -- pulling in National Guard members for help, erecting barriers, boarding up windows, asking residents to avoid the areas and some even closing down capitol grounds altogether.\n \"It's pretty clear that the (US) Capitol itself is locked down about as tight as humanly possible,\" former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said Sunday, adding it was hard to imagine a reprise of the Capitol riots taking place there in the next several days, given the security measures in place.\n \"But,\" he added, \"we have 50 state capitols around the country that are not nearly as protected as our national Capitol, and those are the places that I fear smaller pockets of this sort of violence could really flare up.\"\n Minnesota officials told CNN they would \"continue to assess potential threats\" to their state Capitol, though Bruce Gordon, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said there were no current credible threats.\n Protests there were quiet Sunday, but Gordon said officials would \"enhance\" their response and \"change tactics as needed\" in the coming days.\n Texas will keep its state Capitol and its grounds closed through Wednesday, officials said, adding they were aware of \"violent extremists who may seek to exploit constitutionally protected events to conduct criminal acts.\"\n Columbia, South Carolina, officials have similarly advised residents to stay home and stay away from the city center.\n \"Unless there's a need, this weekend and certainly on Inauguration Day, to be downtown,\" Mayor Stephen Benjamin said, \"I encourage you to stay home.\"\n Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Friday declared a state of emergency in connection with Biden's inauguration, allowing state officials to efficiently coordinate resources to help local jurisdictions and nearby states.\n \"The State of Maryland will continue to do everything we possibly can to secure our nation's capital,\" Hogan said, \"and to ensure the peaceful transition of power.\"\n CNN's Richa Naik, Samantha Guff, Priscilla Alvarez, Jamie Crawford, Lauren Fox, Omar Jimenez, Lucy Kafanov, Bill Kirkos, Jason Kravarik, Eric Levenson, Ross Levitt, Christina Maxouris, Artemis Moshtaghian, Jon Passantino, Conor Powell, Manu Raju, Raja Razek, Rebekah Riess, Hollie Silverman, Dan Simon, Greg Wallace and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Wall Street has a new top cop. And Elizabeth Warren is a big fan of him",
        "body_text": "A new sheriff is coming to Wall Street -- and, for a change, he's not a friendly face.\n In a win for Elizabeth Warren and progressives, President-elect Joe Biden announced Monday he is tapping Gary Gensler to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n Gensler made few friends, and plenty of enemies, during his time as an Obama regulator. As chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gensler helped craft the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that the industry loudly opposed. Gensler then moved to swiftly implement Dodd-Frank much faster than other regulators.\n Even though Gensler is a former Goldman Sachs banker, his nomination sends a clear signal that Biden plans to take a tougher stance on Wall Street than not only President Trump but perhaps Obama, too.\n \"Gensler was the toughest regulator under Obama. That will now be the norm in the Biden administration,\" former Democratic Congressman Barney Frank told CNN Business.\n Frank, who co-authored the 2010 financial reform law, called Gensler's nomination a \"very good sign.\"\n \"That will relax people who might have been worried that enforcement of our bill wouldn't be strong enough,\" said Frank, who is now a director at Signature Bank.\n Warren, a fierce critic of big banks, also sounds very pleased with the Gensler pick.\n \"He is a tenacious regulator who stood up to the industry titans to rein in their risky behavior,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said in a tweet Monday. \"He will be an excellent SEC Chair during this economic crisis.\"\n Not only did Biden tap Gensler to lead the SEC, he also announced Monday the nomination of Warren ally Rohit Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n Biden fired an early warning at Wall Street in November when he tapped Gensler to lead an agency review team working to shape the Federal Reserve, SEC and FDIC.\n Dennis Kelleher, a vocal advocate for Wall Street reform who also worked on the Biden agency review team, praised the Gensler pick.\n \"Gary is a deeply experienced expert in securities markets,\" Kelleher, the CEO of Better Markets, said in an interview. \"He will be a smart, strategic and bold leader who will return the SEC to the gold standard of investor protection.\"\n Before joining the government, Gensler worked for nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs (GS), where he was an M&A partner, led the bank's media group and co-headed its finance team.\n \"He is the unique exception to the rule of former Wall Streeters who deliver for Wall Street, not Main Street,\" Kelleher said.\n Frank, the former Congressman, said that is no coincidence.\n \"Gary Gensler was effective in part because he knew the business so well from his time at Goldman,\" Frank said. \"This should be a rebuttal to friends on the left who think you shouldn't have anyone who worked in industry.\"\n Neither the American Bankers Association nor the Bank Policy Institute responded to requests for comment on Gensler's nomination.\n Stephen Cohen, a white-collar defense attorney at Sidley Austin, said Wall Street is bracing for much tougher enforcement ahead.\n \"The industry recognizes his reputation. He will want to demonstrate that the SEC is tough on Wall Street -- not just a market regulator, but a market cop,\" he said.\n Cohen, a former SEC official who worked with Gensler during the Obama administration, called Gensler \"extremely smart and confident,\" but warned he may face legal obstacles ahead.\n \"The courts are far more conservative than they were four years ago,\" said Cohen, alluding to Trump's appointment of many pro-business judges. \"There will be more successful challenges to aggressive enforcement and rulemaking.\"\n Gensler was also known as a demanding boss -- so demanding that the staff eventually formed a union.\n When he took over the CFTC, there were calls to merge the agency with the SEC. Not only did Gensler fight off those efforts, he successfully pushed to expand the agency's jurisdiction.\n If confirmed, Gensler is expected to bring a strong focus on investor protection. But he will also be asked to address the rise of cryptocurrency and the worsening climate crisis.\n Climate activists want Gensler to establish mandatory, industry-wide rules on climate change disclosure. That is a step that would likely be opposed by parts of corporate America, especially the fossil fuels industry.\n \"Mr. Gensler will enter his new position with a clear mandate, and clear expectation, to act on the climate crisis,\" Mindy Lubber, CEO of sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said in a statement.\n Clearly, Gensler represents a sharp shift from the Trump era.\n In 2017, Trump tapped Jay Clayton, an elite lawyer with a long history of defending big banks, to lead the SEC. Under Clayton, who stepped down last month, the SEC obtained orders for more than $14 billion in fines and returned a record $3.5 billion to harmed investors, according to the agency.\n However, Clayton also presided over a \"modernization\" effort that critics say often tilted against investor protection.\n For instance, the Clayton-led SEC enacted rules that made it harder for shareholders to submit proposals at annual meetings and to get independent advice from proxy advisers.\n Last month, the SEC's own Investor Advocate criticized the \"troubling recent actions\" of the commission and called the agency out for \"selectively abandoning its deregulatory posture by erecting higher barriers for shareholders' exercise of independent oversight over the management of public companies.\"\n \"While these typically were characterized as efforts to 'modernize' or 'streamline' regulations, they often had the effect of diminishing investor protections,\" Rick Fleming, the SEC Investor Advocate, wrote in a report.\n Under Obama, the SEC was criticized for not being tough enough after the 2008 financial crisis.\n \"The record of the SEC was pretty disappointing,\" said Kelleher, the Better Markets CEO.\n Mary Schapiro, Obama's first SEC chair, picked Robert Khuzami, a former federal prosecutor who later became Deutsche Bank's general counsel for the Americas, to lead the agency's enforcement division. Obama's second SEC chair was Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who later became a Wall Street defense lawyer.\n Kelleher expressed hope that Gensler won't repeat the \"fatal flaws\" of the Obama-era SEC by hiring Wall Street's lawyers for key agency posts.\n \"That's going to be the big tell,\" he said.",

        "body_text": "In a new criminal court case against a woman alleged to have entered the US Capitol on January 6, the FBI noted that a tipster raised the possibility of a laptop being stolen from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office to potentially sell to Russia.\n There's no indication in the court record that a laptop was actually taken from Pelosi's office, though Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, tweeted two days after the attack that there was a laptop stolen that was used for presentations and that was in a conference room. The FBI says in the court record the \"matter remains under investigation.\" It's not known if the two incidents are connected at all, or even if the tipster's information about a stolen laptop is accurate.\n It's one of the more bizarre details to emerge in the avalanche of court filings against people accused of storming the Capitol.\n In this case, a person who said they are the former romantic partner of Riley June Williams of Pennsylvania identified Williams to the FBI in video inside the Capitol building and directing people \"upstairs\" to Pelosi's office, according to an affidavit filed Sunday supporting Williams' arrest.\n The tipster \"also claimed to have spoken to friends of Williams, who showed (the tipster) a video of Williams taking a laptop computer or hard drive from Speaker Pelosi's office,\" the affidavit says. The tipster \"stated that Williams intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service.\"\n The person told the FBI the \"transfer of the computer device to Russia fell through for unknown reasons and Williams still has the computer device or destroyed it,\" the affidavit says.\n A Justice Department spokeswoman told CNN on Monday that Williams had surrendered to authorities.\n Williams is not accused of theft. She is only charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct, and entering the restricted space of the Capitol, the same charges faced by many who took part in the siege that day.\n The FBI also noted it appeared that Williams had fled and deleted her social media accounts.\n This story has been updated with Williams' arrest.\n CNN's David Shortell and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Analysis: What does Biden's diverse Cabinet mean for a divided country",
        "body_text": "When President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20, he will inherit a nation that is divided.\n Americans are demanding leaders atone for the forces of White supremacy that motivated a mob to storm the US Capitol on January 6 in its refusal to accept President Donald Trump's loss. And people of color, despite their rising political power, have been among the communities hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and other disparities.\n Biden has achieved a historic feat that observers hope will help begin the process of repairing a broken country. The President-elect has the most racially diverse presidential Cabinet in the history of the US.  A CNN analysis found that 50% of nominees for Cabinet positions and Cabinet-level positions are people of color. That figure includes Vice President-elect Kamala Harris who will be the first Black and South Asian person and first woman to hold the position. Former President Barack Obama set the previous record for diversity with a Cabinet that was 42% people of color.\n Civil rights leaders have praised Biden for keeping his promise of creating a Cabinet that better reflects the country's changing demographics. However, this is only the first step and they are cautiously optimistic.\n Biden's administration will be expected to enact policies that lead to substantive change for communities of color. The Cabinet will be judged on whether it can end the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure vaccine access to underserved communities, support voting rights legislation, revive the economy, push police reform that addresses the fact that Black people are killed by police at higher rates, and reverse Trump's anti-immigration policies. Civil rights activists will also be looking for Biden to consider people of color for deputy roles in the Cabinet as well as judges and US attorneys.\n Interactive: Biden vowed his Cabinet would look like the country. So does it?\n \"We believe that Biden's Cabinet appointments are just the starting point for a slate of demands that Black people and other people of color have,\" said Arisha Hatch, vice president of Color of Change. \"For us, diversity is just table stakes. It's like the baseline thing that needs to happen.\"\n Biden will be turning the tide of a majority White and male Trump administration that was only 16% people of color.\n Trump garnered criticism for the lack of diversity in his Cabinet and his failure to address issues of concern to communities of color.\n Throughout Trump's presidency, he used offensive rhetoric to target Muslims, Mexicans, Syrian refugees, Africans, congresswomen of color, and Black athletes protesting racial inequality.\n During an impeachment hearing for Trump on Wednesday, Rep. Cori Bush, a freshman Democrat from Missouri, called Trump a White supremacist.\n \"If we fail to remove a White supremacist President who incited a White supremacist insurrection, it's communities like Missouri's first district that suffer the most,\" Bush said during her speech. \"The 117th Congress must understand that we have a mandate to legislate in defense of Black lives. The first step in that process is to root out White supremacy starting with impeaching the White supremacist in chief.\"\n A 2019 study by the Pew Research Center found that 56% of Americans believed that Trump made race relations worse in the US.\n The country experienced a reckoning on racism last summer when mass protests erupted after the controversial police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans. Covid-19 exacerbated already existing health disparities as people of color have died from the virus at higher rates than White people.\n Inequality has now become a central focus for this country and many social justice advocates are looking for Biden to right the wrongs of the Trump administration.\n In December, lawmakers and civil rights groups pressured Biden to appoint Black, Latino and Asian nominees to his Cabinet, citing the nation's heightened alert on race and justice.\n Douglas Brinkley, a CNN presidential historian, said Biden's diverse Cabinet is taking the White House to a \"new level\" that past presidents haven't been able to accomplish.\n Former President Bill Clinton, Brinkley said, attempted to create a diverse Cabinet when he chose four Black and two Hispanic department heads.\n Still, Clinton came under fire for passing the 1994 Crime Bill, which strengthened law enforcement across the country, provided federal money for new cops and prisons, and ordered mandatory life sentences for repeat offenders. Critics say the bill led to mass incarceration of Black people. Biden, who authored the bill, has defended aspects of it while also calling it a \"mistake\" and blaming its negative impacts on state governments.\n Brinkley said Biden and his Cabinet have an opportunity to disprove critics who say Democrats rely on voters of color but don't meet their expectations.\n \"This is coming at a time when the Republican party seems to be doubling down on being the party of White Americans only,\" Brinkley said. \"There's a feeling here of a last gasp of particularly White male privilege going on here and Biden is trying to shatter that impression of America by making sure his Cabinet is very diverse and that should be applauded.\"\n While Black and Latino leaders say they are pleased with the Cabinet picks, Biden did not meet the expectations of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus that asked for top-tier representation in the Cabinet.\n Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the nation and make up 6% of the US population.\n Biden nominated two Asian people to Cabinet level positions. Neera Tanden will be the Office of Management and Budget Director and Katherine Tai was named US Trade Representative. Both will be the first Asian American women in their roles.\n Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair and California Rep. Judy Chu called it \"incredibly disheartening\" that an Asian American Pacific Islander was not selected for a Cabinet secretary job for the first time since 2000.\n \"Despite the diversity amongst these Cabinets selections, we are deeply disappointed by the decision to exclude AAPIs from the 15 Cabinet Secretary positions who oversee executive departments in our government,\" Chu said. \"The glaring omission of an AAPI Cabinet Secretary in the self-declared 'most diverse Cabinet in history' is not lost on us and sends a demoralizing message to our nation's fastest growing racial group and voting bloc that AAPIs do not need to be counted the same way as other key constituency groups.\"\n According to CNN exit polls, Asian Americans backed Biden at 61%.\n Biden has promised to meet the concerns of AAPI's including appointing them as judges and federal officials, protecting the Affordable Care Act to mitigate their barriers to healthcare access, fighting the rise in hate crimes against their community, and rescinding Trump's Muslim ban.\n In December, Biden met with several Black civil rights leaders who pushed Biden to tap Black people for high level Cabinet roles and not just second-tier positions.\n Many wanted Biden to pick a Black attorney general who would crack down on police violence in the Black community and voting rights. Biden ultimately selected Merrick Garland for the role.\n Black Americans make up 12% of the US population and have faced oppression dating back to slavery and the Jim Crow era. Black people are also three times more likely than White people to be killed by police, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n Biden ultimately picked five Black people for his Cabinet including incoming Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will be the first Black person to lead the Pentagon, and Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, who was named HUD secretary. Other Black nominees include incoming EPA Administrator Michael Regan, who will be the first Black man to head the department; Cecilia Rouse, incoming chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and the first Black person to hold the post; and Linda Thomas-Greenfield will be U.N. Ambassador.\n Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, was among the civil rights leaders who met with Biden and said the President-elect has achieved a \"milestone\" with this diverse Cabinet.\n Morial said he believes their push for diversity was crucial to ensure Biden kept his word.\n Now Biden will be charged with prioritizing equitable Covid-19 vaccine access, economic equality and increased funding for Black-owned businesses, voting rights and other issues affecting the Black community, Morial said.\n \"He has successfully gotten to first base,\" Morial said. \"I think for people who are fair minded and open minded, the truth is that the way people feel will very much be predicated on how they (Biden's Cabinet) perform.\"\n Latino leaders have also praised Biden for his Cabinet picks. Latinos hold the largest minority population in the country at 18%.\n Biden selected four Latino people for his Cabinet and three are Cabinet secretaries. The nominees include Xavier Becerra, for Secretary of Health and Human Services; Miguel Cardona for Secretary of Education, Alejandro Mayorkas for Secretary of Homeland Security; and Isabel Guzman who will be the Small Business Administrator. Becerra and Mayorkas will be the first Latinos to lead their departments.\n Last week, the heads of UnidosUs, Hispanic Federation and other national groups met with Biden, Harris and their Hispanic Cabinet nominees to discuss the challenges facing the Latino community. Among the issues discussed were the devastating toll Covid-19 has had on Latino Americans, health care access, immigration, and jobs, the leaders said in a statement.\n \"The President-elect knows our people are hurting,\" said Janet Murgu\u00eda, UnidosUS President and CEO. \"He wants to address the health and economic impact on the Latino community and understands the need to address systemic inequality by putting equity at the center of his economic and health care response. This feels like a new day, a huge change.\"\n Eric Rodriguez, senior vice president of UnidosUS, said he expects Biden to undo the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies that he called \"cruel and heartless and gutless.\"\n Rodriguez said having a diverse Cabinet will help Biden gain the trust of people of color.\n \"Having that cultural experience and background is just so important to being able to communicate and get information from those communities,\" Rodriguez said.\n Biden was also lauded by Native Americans when he nominated Deb Haaland for secretary of the Interior, which will make her the first Native American to lead a Cabinet agency.\n Crystal Echo Hawk, executive director of IllumiNative, said she now wants to see Biden's Cabinet boost funding for Covid-19 relief in Native American communities and ensure vaccine access. Echo Hawk said Native Americans have been sickened or dying from Covid-19 at high rates because of the \"deliberate and long-term under-funding\" of their health care systems.\n Native Americans are also asking Biden to undo the repeated attempts by the Trump administration to undermine tribal sovereignty over their lands and sacred sites, suspend Trump's decision to lease drilling rights on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and rebuild the relationship between tribal leaders and the federal government, Echo Hawk said.\n \"We are encouraged to see these strides toward political representation that looks like the United States and the constituents the Cabinet serves,\" Echo Hawk said. \"However, this must be accompanied by policies that transform the systems of power that have shutout Native, Black, Latinx, and other communities of color for generations.\"",

He was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital and was later pronounced dead.\n Officials did not provide any more detail around the circumstances of his death.\n Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott mourned the loss, saying Barksdale's work \"saved lives.\"\n \"My heart is broken with the loss of my friend Dante Barksdale, a beloved leader in our community who committed his life to saving lives in Baltimore,\" he said in a news release. \"His death is a major loss to Safe Streets, the communities they serve, and the entire City of Baltimore.\"\n Shantay Jackson, director of the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, called Barksdale \"not only a respected Safe Streets team member, but a beloved friend to so many in Baltimore.\"\n \"He turned his life around and worked tirelessly for nearly a decade to prevent gun violence in our communities by working with those who were at the highest risk of being a shooter or the victim of shooting,\" she said.\n Since 2008, Barksdale -- known to people locally as \"Tater\" -- had worked with Baltimore's Safe Streets, where he most recently served as the program's outreach coordinator.\n At the core of Safe Streets is the idea that communities are best equipped to police their own neighborhoods. Staffed by people who know and understand the street culture that often perpetuates violence, the program works to build relationships with young people in at-risk communities and help them mediate conflicts.\n Barksdale's work there was informed by his own experiences of growing up in a housing project in East Baltimore, which he chronicled in a 2019 memoir titled \"Growing Up Barksdale: A True Baltimore Story.\"\n \"I was tired of getting locked up, of getting robbed by police, of having to keep an eye out at all times,\" he wrote in the book. \"I wanted a regular job. And it seemed the universe had one in mind for me.\"\n Barksdale was also the nephew of Nathan Barksdale, a Baltimore drug dealer who was purportedly one of the inspirations behind the character Avon Barksdale in HBO's \"The Wire.\"\n \"... My reputation as a hustler would help the Safe Streets mission, more than any amount of training ever could,\" he wrote in another book passage. \"No one would suspect alliance with BPD. Nobody could accuse me of not understanding.\"\n Barksdale's death shook community leaders and city officials, who spoke about the impact he had on Baltimore's neighborhoods as well as their personal lives.\n Erricka Bridgeford, another anti-violence activist in Baltimore, wrote on Twitter that \"my level of shock & pain at his murder make my knees buckle.\"\n \"Dante Tater Barksdale is a beautiful friend, the best hugger, a warrior when I need one, a confidant when I can't tell everybody everything, and our smiles and laughs were contagious to each other,\" she wrote in another tweet.\n Nick J. Mosby, the president of the Baltimore City Council, also lamented Barksdale's death.\n \"Dante Barksdale used his life to save others by preventing gun violence on our streets,\" Mosby tweeted. \"He beat a myriad of odds to do it. Dante was my friend, and I grieve with countless others at the murder of this exceptional man.\"",

Josh Hawley's forthcoming book will now be published by conservative publishing house Regnery Publishing after it was dropped by Simon & Schuster earlier this month following the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol building.\n Regnery will publish Hawley's book, titled \"The Tyranny of Big Tech,\" in the spring, according to a news release from the publisher.\n The Missouri senator has fielded a wave of backlash in the days since January 6, when he and other Republicans in Congress raised objections to the counting of some Electoral College votes for Joe Biden, pushing false claims of voter fraud that were echoed by members of the mob incited by President Donald Trump.\n Just one day after the riot took place, Simon & Schuster announced that it would no longer publish Hawley's book. \"After witnessing the disturbing, deadly insurrection that took place on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., Simon & Schuster has decided to cancel publication of Senator Josh Hawley's forthcoming book,\" the company said in a statement.\n \"We did not come to this decision lightly,\" the publisher added. \"As a publisher it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voices and viewpoints: at the same time we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom.\"\n Hawley responded at the time by calling the move \"Orwellian,\" and claiming it was a \"direct assault on the First Amendment\" even though the First Amendment pertains to government restrictions on free speech and not the decisions of private companies.\n That message was echoed by Regnery's president and publisher, Thomas Spence, who wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed: \"Readiness to silence someone because of who he is or whom he associates with is often called the 'cancel culture,' but I prefer an older term -- blacklisting -- whose historical associations expose the ugliness of what is going on.\"\n \"Not so long ago, publishing professionals would have been horrified to be accused of it. Today they compete to see who can proclaim his blacklist with the fiercest invective,\" he said.\n Several major companies also announced they were halting donations to Hawley and other Republicans who objected to the Electoral College votes, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Citigroup. And luxury hotel chain Loews Hotel Group has since canceled an upcoming fundraiser for Hawley, saying it's opposed to \"all who supported and incited\" the deadly riot at the Capitol.\n In the forthcoming book, Hawley is set to argue major tech companies \"represent the gravest threat to American liberty since the monopolies of the Gilded Age,\" according to an archived description posted on Simon & Schuster's website.\n CNN's Oliver Darcy, Donald Judd and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A so-called Covid-19 \"superspreader\" who traveled around northeastern China has been linked to 102 confirmed infections, according to Chinese officials.\n The individual, who worked as a salesman promoting health products to the elderly, had traveled from his home province of Heilongjiang to neighboring Jilin province, bringing the virus with him.\n Authorities claim he unknowingly spread the virus among elderly residents for several days before he was tracked down by health officials as a close contact of a confirmed case.\n \"The superspreading phenomenon occurred in our province mainly because when the superspreader was discovered, he was still in the early phase of his infection and had relatively strong ability to shed the virus,\" Zhao Qinglong, an official with the Jilin provincial disease control and prevention center, told state-run news agency Xinhua.\n A superspreading event occurs when an individual infects a large number of people, because of a higher viral load in their droplets, or other factors such as behaviors and timing.\n The apparent superspreading event in Jilin occurred as China is battling its worst coronavirus outbreak in months, which has seen hundreds of cases reported and tens of millions of people placed under lockdown in its northern provinces.\n It also demonstrated the extent and speed of contact tracing and screening by Chinese health authorities, which have played a crucial role in taming local outbreaks.\n The salesman was diagnosed as a confirmed case of Covid-19 Sunday, after being initially identified as an asymptomatic carrier last Tuesday, according to the Jilin provincial health commission. China records asymptomatic infections separately from its official case count.\n The commission published a detailed itinerary of the salesman's travels in the week before he tested positive for the virus, including four train rides (with his seat numbers listed), three bus rides and a metro ride, going back and forth between Heilongjiang and Jilin.\n Over four days, the man held four \"health seminars,\" or marketing sessions, in community health clubs targeting elderly residents in the cities of Gongzhuling and Tonghua in Jilin.\n In total, the individual infected 79 people who attended the seminars, who then went on to infect 23 of their close contacts, Zhang Yan, deputy director of the commission, said at a news conference Sunday. The average age of those infected is 63, with the oldest being 87, Zhang said.\n All the infected people had been tracked down as close contacts of the man and placed under quarantine, before testing positive during medical observation, Zhang said.\n Although an effective tool for contact tracing, publicizing detailed travel history of coronavirus patients has also led to concerns around privacy in China.\n Last month, a young woman in the southwestern city of Chengdu was publicly shamed on social media for her \"decadent\" lifestyle, as users attacked her for going to a bar and several night clubs in the two weeks before testing positive for the virus.\n Jilin's apparent superspreading event has brought community health clubs under greater scrutiny from health experts and authorities.\n One of the health clubs, in Tonghua city, is located in a room on the ground floor of an old residential building, where 30 to 40 people attended the man's seminar, with few wearing masks, Xinhua reported.\n \"The infected people were gathered in an enclosed space for a long time,\" Zhao, the Jilin health official, told Xinhua. \"Most of them are middle-aged and elderly people with underlying health conditions and weak immunity, and therefore extremely susceptible to infection.\"\n So-called \"health clubs\" catering to the elderly are becoming increasingly common among residential communities in China, where marketing sessions, often branded as \"health lectures,\" are regularly held to promote health products such as supplements and physical therapy equipment.\n Unlike cinemas, restaurants, karaoke parlors and other commercial venues, these clubs are often hidden in residential buildings and difficult for authorities to regulate, according to Xinhua.\n Jilin authorities are investigating whether the two health clubs where the man held promotions had violated any regulations, a provincial market supervision official said at the news conference.",

        "title": "The secret to a great inaugural address",
        "body_text": "John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN.\nIn a political world defined by escalating confrontation, a presidential inaugural is one of the few times we slow down and listen together as fellow citizens.\n These are the words that begin to define a presidency -- reminding us that, at its best, politics is history in the present tense.\n Not all inaugural addresses are created equal -- many are too long and consequently forgettable. Others make the mistake of laying out a specific policy agenda, rather than setting a broad direction toward a new horizon.\n But an inaugural is preeminently a speech about the new president's values -- about how he sees the world and America's role in it.  At best it offers a unifying vision and the promise of new beginnings.\n Most are remembered -- if at all -- for a single phrase that becomes shorthand for the entire speech. And if you listen closely, these lines often share a similar structure. This is the one of the secrets to what makes a great inaugural address.\n Thomas Jefferson called for an end to partisan rancor after the brutal 1800 campaign, declaring: \"Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.\"\n Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural was just 701 words long, but it contained this crystalizing phrase as a guide toward reconciliation at the end of Civil War: \"with malice toward none, with charity for all.\"\n In the depths of the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed: \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\"\n As the greatest generation took the helm during the Cold War, John F. Kennedy declared, \"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\"\n These are American catechism, lines that are repeated across generations, giving us a common language for our civic religion.\n And there's a pattern at work: it's repetition of a phrase with a twist, which makes them instantly memorable. In some specific structures, it's what's called antimetabole, an ancient Greek word that means \"turning about.\"\n Armed with that knowledge, listen to the most famous line from Ronald Reagan's first inaugural: \"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\"\n Or Bill Clinton's: \"There's nothing wrong with America that can't be cured by what's right with America.\"\n So, it turns out there's something like a science behind the art of great speeches.\n But, of course, inaugural addresses are more than a succession of slogans.\n They update the American story, connecting the past with the present and the future. The best contain a sweep of history -- a clear-eyed sense of reverence for the American experiment.\n And while the assembled crowds and people watching at home are celebrating the inauguration of one person to be the next president, it's not actually about that individual leader.\n He (or someday she) is simply a symbol for a new era, and his personal story -- while a necessary ingredient -- provides a point of contact with the American story. Still, great speeches tend to take the risk of intimacy. There needs to be a personal reveal to communicate to the heart as well as the head, and then to take that goodwill and project it forward into the future on behalf of everyone else.\n Now Joe Biden's day has finally arrived -- nearly 50 years after he first arrived in Washington, DC, as one of the youngest senators and more than 30 after he first ran for president.\n But Biden's rise to the presidency was rooted in the authenticity of his own story -- the middle-class kid from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who struggled through adversity and almost unimaginable loss of a wife, daughter and son. His moral authority comes not from the lifelong politician's loquacious charm, but from his enduring heart.\n While Biden is not known to be a great orator (unlike his former boss), he raised his reputation as a fighter for the middle class from the baby boom generation. His 1988 campaign speeches recalled the death of the Kennedy brothers with a determination to rekindle their idealism while railing against the outsourcing that was even then squeezing American workers. He rebounded from political stumbles over intervening decades because of a reputation for personal decency and empathy that was recognized by his colleagues across partisan lines.\n Throughout the course of the 2020 campaign, he promised to \"restore the soul of America\" and to make government work again by governing without partisan prejudice. His best speeches -- at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and Warm Springs, Georgia, -- consciously drew on American history to summon our strength to rise above these challenging times and rediscover the better angels of our nature.\n These speeches were too deep-seated in Biden's soul to be put aside for something entirely fresh for Inauguration Day. He is not one for reinvention, and this is not a time for more reality television.\n Few presidents have entered the Oval Office facing more stark challenges, from a nation violently divided along partisan lines to a pandemic still raging at its deadliest levels. Biden has not promised these problems will be solved in his first 100 days; instead he's honestly warned that our most difficult days might still be ahead.\n But it's the endurance of hope that animates and which may inspire his inaugural address. To quote from one of his favorite poets, Seamus Heaney: \"History says don't hope on this side of the grave / But then, once in a lifetime / The longed-for tidal wave / Of justice can rise up / And hope and history rhyme.\"\n The rhyming of hope and history are what great inaugural addresses deliver. And rarely in our country's history have we been more in need for such rebirth and redemption.",

        "title": "Stimulus is nice. But here's what Biden really needs to fix the economy",
        "body_text": "Joe Biden last week proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, part of a historically ambitious plan to combat an economic crisis.\n But many economists and business leaders agree that no amount of government assistance to individuals and small businesses can fix the economy until the underlying cause of the problems \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 has been defeated. At best, the combination of the $900 billion plan passed in December, and this plan from the president-elect, can only help the economy to continue to tread water until the pandemic is under control.\n \"This is a very large package, but it's about helping the economy hang together as well as it can hang together until the end of the pandemic,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n Zandi and other economists believe that the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economic activity, could soar if Biden gets his full package soon after taking office. But job growth will be far more muted.\n The US economy lost 22 million jobs in March and April and ended the year with another 140,000 net jobs decline. Even with the 12.5 million jobs recovered in between, that left the headcount at US employers down nearly 10 million during the pandemic. Moody's forecast that those jobs won't be fully recovered until 2022, even if Biden gets his full package.\n \"We get a lot growth in GDP up front, but it'll take 18-24 months to get all those jobs back,\" said Zandi. \"A lot of people just can't go back to work until the pandemic is in the rearview mirror.\"\n And unfortunately, the message from public health experts is clear: The pandemic is going to get worse before it gets better.\n New cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States are at or near record highs. That could lead to renewed lockdown orders and business closings in many parts of the country, as have been imposed in other nations, especially with a new, more transmittable version of the virus. The vaccine now being rolled out isn't expected to reach enough of the population to allow the majority of Americans to return to normal life until the summer, at the earliest.\n That could mean a slower-than-hoped-for return to economic activity, such as eating at restaurants and travel. The economy lost jobs in December for the first time since April because of massive unemployment in leisure and hospitality businesses, as well as restaurants and bars. The stimulus might help many businesses and individuals weather the storm, but it won't save all of them from going out of business, according to experts.\n \"There's not really much you can do from an economic policy perspective when the pandemic is continuing to rage,\" said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist for Capital Economics. \"Things are looking good for some time later this year, but it depends first of all on getting vaccines rolled out so things can return to normal.\"\n Biden has promised to step up vaccination efforts that he said have been \"a dismal failure thus far.\" But it's not clear how successful those efforts will be, and how much they could be slowed by resistance by many members of the public to get vaccinated.\n \"We're having a slower than expected vaccine rollout, and that is really weighing on the expectations about when we'll return to pre-pandemic life,\" said Ed Moya senior market analyst for Onada.\n And that uncertainty is causing problems for businesses, from retailers to airlines to banks, as they try to make plans, even businesses that have so far done well.\n \"The rules of the game keep changing. For a business person, that is overwhelming,\" said Zandi. \"They're not going to feel like the coast is clear. That uncertainty will depress ability to go out and expand and grow. They're not going to go out and hire more people because they're not sure what lays ahead in the future. This is going to be a process. I don't think it's like a light switch going on.\"\n Also preventing the economy from getting a quick boost from the proposed stimulus package is the fact that many businesses have already closed permanently because of the crisis, and thus permanent job losses are rising. The money Biden is proposing in direct aid to most US households and expanded and extended unemployment benefits will help many families weather the crisis, but it won't repair all the damage done to the economy during the crisis.\n \"It takes a lot less time to destroy the jobs than it does for the economy to create new jobs,\" said Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, \"I've seen estimates that a third of jobs lost will never come back in their previous form.\"\n The money Biden proposed is only slightly less than what was passed under the CARES Act in March, but Biden made clear last week that this is only the first step of what he'll be asking Congress to spend. This first package is more than twice as much as the $787 billion stimulus package passed soon after Barack Obama and Biden took office in 2009, in the depths of the Great Recession.\n The money in the CARES Act, passed at a time that more 22 million Americans were losing their jobs, did have notable impact on the economy and households' ability to weather the economic crisis. Despite the economic upheaval, the number of individual bankruptcy filings fell 31% in 2020, to the lowest level since 1987, according to analysis by the Equip for the American Bankruptcy Institute.\n \"Continued government relief programs, moratoriums and lender deferments have helped families and businesses weather the economic challenges over the past year resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic,\" said ABI Executive Director Amy Quackenboss.\n But that support, as important as it was, didn't end the economic crisis. Even with millions of those on temporary layoffs being called back to work, there remain 10.7 million people looking for jobs who can't find them, 2.2 million more who want jobs but have stopped looking and 6.2 million who are working only part-time even though they want a full-time job. Getting them back to work will take time, even with the stimulus, according to experts.\n And much of that help has run out, or will run out soon. It's not clear how much of the $1.9 trillion that Biden is asking for will be approved by a divided Congress. IHS Markit's Prakken thinks the final amount is likely to be closer to $1 trillion. Moody's is estimating it might be closer to $750 billion.\n But the key for when the economy is recovered probably depends less on the stimulus than on the state of the pandemic and when life returns to something that feels more normal, for businesses and their customers.\n \"Deaths are likely to peak probably sometime late winter/early spring,\" said Prakken. \"It'll probably be sometime in second half of the year that people will be more comfortable going out.\"",

        "body_text": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has formally submitted a letter of resignation for her US Senate seat to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, ending her four-year career in the chamber.\n As Harris says goodbye to her seat, she assured Americans in an op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle that her work is not done since she will preside over the chamber once she is sworn as the first female, first Black and first South Asian woman vice president of the United States on Wednesday.\n \"And this is not goodbye. As I resign from the Senate, I am preparing to take an oath that would have me preside over it,\" Harris wrote. \"As senator-turned-Vice-President Walter Mondale once pointed out, the vice presidency is the only office in our government that 'belongs to both the executive branch and the legislative branch.' A responsibility made greater with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.\"\n Harris continued that while she will use her power as tie breaker in the Senate, she hopes she does not have to.\n \"Since our nation's founding, only 268 tie-breaking votes have been cast by a Vice President. I intend to work tirelessly as your Vice President, including, if necessary, fulfilling this Constitutional duty,\" she wrote.\n \"At the same time, it is my hope that rather than come to the point of a tie, the Senate will instead find common ground and do the work of the American people.\"\n Harris, who was also the first Black woman to serve as a senator for the Golden State, won her seat in November 2016 and was sworn in January 2017. At the time, Harris was California's attorney general.\n Newsom has named Alex Padilla, California's secretary of state, to fill Harris' seat. The incoming vice president has spoken to Padilla before he is sworn into the Senate, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.\n She also addressed the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, saying that America has \"two systems of justice -- one that failed to restrain the rioters on January 6 and another that released tear gas on non-violent demonstrators last summer.\"\n Noting the elections of Senators-elect Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Democrats from Georgia to the Senate, Harris wrote \"Change is possible. For that, I am grateful and ready to get to work.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "body_text": "Samsung vice chairman Lee Jae-yong is going back to prison, casting the future of leadership at the massive tech company in doubt.\n The Seoul High Court in South Korea sentenced Lee to 2 1/2 years behind bars on Monday after finding him guilty of embezzlement and bribery. He was taken into custody following the verdict.\n It's the latest twist in a controversy that has followed Samsung for years. Lee, also known as Jay Y. Lee, was caught up in a massive influence-peddling scandal that brought down the government of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Park herself is spending some two decades in prison in connection with the case.\n Lee, meanwhile, was found guilty of bribery and other corruption charges in 2017, and sentenced to five years in prison at the time. But he walked free after less than a year when an appeals court threw out some of the charges and suspended his sentence.\n This latest sentence is the result of a retrial ordered by the country's Supreme Court.\n Lee's return to prison comes at a critical time for Samsung. His father Lee Kun-hee, the company's chairman, died last year. The elder Lee had been comatose since suffering a heart attack in 2014 but remained titular chairman of the company. His son had been operating as Samsung's de facto leader.\n Samsung declined to comment about the sentencing, instead referring to a statement from Lee's attorneys.\n \"This case is, in essence, a violation of corporation's rights to freedom and property by the former president abusing her power,\" said Injae Lee, the lawyer leading the vice chairman's defense team. \"I find the court's decision regrettable.\"\n The company's shares dove in Seoul following the announcement, though. Samsung (SSNLF) stock fell nearly 3.8%.\n Lee can appeal if he so chooses, though it was not immediately clear whether he intends to do so.\n Lee's legal troubles also aren't over yet. He faces a separate trial over a controversial 2015 merger that helped him tighten control over the company. Eleven executives from Samsung, including Lee, were indicted last year on charges including illegal transactions, stock manipulation, and perjury.\n That case is still pending.",

        "body_text": "At the end of December, Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Kimbriell Kelly was looking at getting Moleskine notebooks as gifts for her staff. A couple weeks later, she was procuring goods of a decidedly different kind: gas masks, helmets and body armor for LA Times staff members who will be attending Wednesday's inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.\n Newsrooms like the LA Times have distributed protective equipment and held safety trainings to prepare reporters for Inauguration Day. Protests and demonstrations around the ceremony in Washington, DC are typical, but after the riots on January 6, journalists are preparing for another violent outbreak.\n \"I quickly saw my role as a person who had to adapt,\" Kelly told CNN Business. \"My goal is to protect my staff, protect my reporters and make sure that everybody is taken care of.\"\n According to a bulletin obtained last week by CNN, the FBI has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington in the days leading up to Biden's inauguration. The Pentagon has authorized up 25,000 National Guard members for Inauguration Day.\n In the days since the storming of the Capitol, authorities and the media have unearthed details and images that paint a picture of an attack that appears even more chilling and violent than what viewers saw on live TV that day. Among the images that have surfaced in the ensuing days includes some that show the mob attacking journalists who were there.\n At least nine journalists were physically assaulted, at least five journalists were arrested and at least four had equipment damaged while covering the insurrection, US Press Freedom Tracker managing editor Kirstin McCudden told Poynter.\n While reporting inside the Capitol on January 6, LA Times Congressional reporter Sarah Wire was handed an evacuation hood and received instructions from Rep. Ruben Gallego on how to use it. Wire will be much more prepared for violence at Wednesday's inauguration: The LA Times sent her a bulletproof vest, helmet, goggles and a gas mask \u2014 all of which she's never worn on the field before.\n Covering the inauguration is typically \"very predictable,\" said Tracy Grant, a 27-year veteran of The Washington Post, where she serves as a managing editor. As defined by the US Constitution, the transition happens at noon on January 20. But other details around the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been uncertain.\n \"All of the things that are very normed and ceremonial have been up in the air,\" Grant said. \"Nothing about this has been predictable, and so we are prepared for things to change right up until the last moment.\"\n The pandemic had already created hurdles to reporting \u2014 and reporters, producers and camera operators on the ground will continue to face those challenges and anxieties on Inauguration Day.\n BuzzFeed News politics reporter Paul McLeod told CNN Business last week that he was feeling \"a bit relieved\" ahead of the inauguration. That's because the Covid-19 test he took after covering the events of January 6 \u2014 where many rioters were maskless \u2014 came back negative.\n \"I don't know if I'm a target as a Black photojournalist, Black journalist period during this time,\" Henderson said. \"It's very exhausting. There's some threats that are being made. I cannot unsee 'Murder the Media' that was etched into the side of the Capitol doors last week.\"\n Media organizations have recently sent out tips and guidance for journalists in the field. The Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) launched a journalist training and resource center last week about reporting \"ethically and safely\" during civil unrest.\n \"This is the most perilous time for journalists in the field in the modern history of the United States,\" RTDNA Executive Director Dan Shelley told CNN's Brian Stelter on \"Reliable Sources\" Sunday. \"This is really pervasive, and it's not just the US Capitol. It's not just state capitals. It's in communities large and small, in all 50 states.\"\n Grant said that all reporters covering Inauguration Day for the Post will get a refresher on a training program that teaches them how to make decisions in contentious situations. Post journalists also have received protective gear.\n Gannett (GCI), the largest US newspaper conglomerate which publishes USA Today, The Detroit Free Press, The Arizona Republic and hundreds of other local papers, has hosted several trainings and panels during the past week. More than 3,000 Gannett journalists listened to a panel last Wednesday where Henderson and others who were at the Capitol and had covered other protests shared their expertise.\n Amalie Nash, senior vice president of local news at USA Today Network, recalled staff members asking, \"If I have long hair, should I think about putting it up because it could make me a target and I could be dragged by my hair?\"; \"What's the best way to file if my phone has gone down?\"; \"What is the best way to get out of a situation if it turns volatile?\"\n McLeod of BuzzFeed News said he will be wearing running shoes on Inauguration Day along a bulletproof vest and a backpack storing a helmet, a respirator mask and goggles. He had worn some of these items on January 6.\n For Inauguration Day, McLeod said he plans to not wear anything that could identify him as a member of the press. One striking difference he noticed between Trump rallies and the insurrection was the aggression from the crowd.\n \"For all of the pageantry and theater of booing the media, when you go up to talk to people afterward, in my experience, they'd actually been pretty polite,\" McLeod said about covering Trump rallies. \"I identified myself as a reporter to one person [on the 6th] who started screaming at me and trying to scream at other people around that I was a reporter and calling all kinds of attention to me. I got out of there, and obviously, stopped identifying myself as a reporter to anyone.\"\n Newsrooms are having journalists work in teams so that no one is out on the field alone. Some are hiring security, too. Peter Gorenstein, chief content officer at Cheddar, told Digiday his two reporters on the ground that day will have a security guard.\n \"This is risky to go out, but it's more risky to not go out. It's more risky to let misinformation spread,\" Nicole Carroll, editor in chief of USA Today, told Stelter on \"Reliable Sources\" Sunday. \"So we're prepared and we're careful and we're going to do our jobs.\"\n Henderson, the USA Today producer, echoed Carroll's sentiment on the role and responsibility of media to document history.\n \"I just applaud everybody who's going out, who's prepared, who's already gone through this, who, despite their own personal and professional trauma, are still going out to document this history,\" Henderson said.",

        "body_text": "Ann M. Ravel is the Digital Deception Project director at MapLight and previously served as chair of the Federal Election Commission. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is rightfully being criticized for claiming that the US Capitol riots were \"largely organized\" on other social media platforms \"that don't have our abilities to stop hate and don't have our standards and don't have our transparency.\" Despite her attempts to deflect blame, Facebook as well as other social media companies played a crucial role in fueling the mob that stormed the Capitol building.\n The compartmentalization of users in echo chambers where only extreme \u2014 and often false \u2014 viewpoints can travel is probably the single-most important driver of political polarization. Absent a social media landscape that incites outrage and division, the Capitol riots likely never would've happened.\n With so much damage already done and just a handful of days left in the Trump presidency, social media and technology companies finally banned Trump and the apps some white supremacist followers used to incite violence. But these decisions were made too late and now risk emboldening conspiracy theorists who still believe the election was stolen. They also raise legitimate questions as to why we let profit-driven companies set the rules of democratic engagement online in the first place.\n It is troublesome that we've turned over the rules of online deception, harassment and incitement to violence to powerful tech CEOs who are not accountable to the public. Our democratic institutions must take back control and introduce regulations that address incendiary online propaganda.\n Here's how Congress and the Biden-Harris administration should approach social media regulation in the months ahead:\n For the Biden-Harris administration to begin to address the problem, it should treat the spread of disinformation as a fundamental threat to achieving progress in all facets of policy, as a large coalition that I'm part of urged last month.\n The spread of online disinformation is not only a threat to our democratic institutions; it also undermines important efforts to respond to the pandemic or combat climate change. The incoming administration should establish a task force to study the harms of disinformation on social media; launch a website to combat viral disinformation; and appoint an expert on disinformation to the Covid-19 task force \u2014 this person would be in charge of coordinating a national response.\n By prioritizing the fight against disinformation, the next administration can help restore common ground between existing factions, lay the foundation for Congress to reverse the decay of our democratic institutions and fix our broken information ecosystem.\n For far too long, the First Amendment's specter has been used by actors that benefit from an unregulated internet to prevent any legislation from increasing online transparency, especially when it comes to political speech.\n Six years ago, as vice chair of the Federal Election Commission, I called on the commission to discuss online political messaging, which was and still is largely exempt from federal campaign finance disclosure laws. These gaps allow malicious actors \u2014 both domestic and foreign \u2014 to anonymously target voters with inflammatory propaganda, and to leverage influencers, troll farms and fake accounts to amplify their messages, all outside of the public eye.\n As online political disinformation morphs into physical violence, it's past time for comprehensive reforms such as H.R.1, which was recently reintroduced in the House. H.R.1 introduces clear disclosure and disclaimer requirements for political ads online, mandates organizations to reveal their top donors and requires tech companies to maintain a public database of online political ads shown to their users, including who the ads targeted, the buyer and the rates charged.\n Congress should also pass legislation requiring social media and technology companies to enhance the transparency of their content moderation processes, conduct periodic risk assessments that look at how their rules and recommendations may help spread deceptive propaganda and other harmful content and explore suitable mitigation strategies in cooperation with government agencies, experts, consumer associations and civil society groups.\n In their role as gatekeepers of the public discourse, social media companies should also be required to develop a crisis protocol that could be activated to contain the spread of harmful activities that pose an imminent threat to public security or public health. Other jurisdictions, such as the EU, are currently considering options like these, and US lawmakers should also have a thoughtful debate on how to keep platforms accountable without stifling free speech.\n The violent outburst of anger that disrupted a key step in the peaceful transfer of power and resulted in the death of five people was not only the outcome of white supremacy and viral conspiracy theorists enabled by unregulated digital platforms \u2014 it was also preventable. We are staring into the abyss, but the erosion of our democracy is not an inevitable fate.",

        "title": "Here are the Martin Luther King Jr. words that inspire today's social justice leaders  ",
        "body_text": "More than a half a century has passed since Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial calling for freedom and equality -- and the fight for social justice appears to be far from over.\n CNN asked activists and athletes fighting for equality in the Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American and Muslim American communities to reflect on King's words and his legacy at a time when America is deeply divided after last year's racial reckoning and the insurrection at the US Capitol earlier this month.\n Each of them selected a quote from the civil rights movement leader and shared why it resonates with them. Here are their responses, some of which have been edited for clarity:\n Huerta, a Mexican American civil rights icon, formed a farmworkers union with Cesar Chavez and is president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation. She chose a quote from a Dr. King's speech titled \"The Three Evils of Society.\"\n \"Racism is a sickness. Many Americans with that sickness stormed the nation's Capitol recently as racism feeds fascism. Racism stems from ignorance and creates, hate, fear violence and destruction,\" Huerta said.\n \"Dr. Martin Luther King warned us that racism threatened the very foundation of our democracy. Racism began with slavery, the oppression of workers, the subjugation of women and children.\"\n Huerta said that a national effort is needed to save the United States' democracy from fascism and to end the racism which \"is so ingrained in our body politic.\"\n \"We have no choice but to heal.\"\n Cullors is an artist, political strategist and co-founder and executive director of Black Lives Matter. She chose a quote from Dr. King's \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\"\n \"On January 6, the world witnessed a failed attempted coup by White supremacists extremists. These are the same people who have taunted, humiliated and threatened Black Lives Matter members and our leadership. And while these White supremacists are scary and dangerous, our movement has historically seen the White liberal as a barrier to the freedom of Black people,\" Cullors said.\n \"To keep it plain. We need White folks to show up. Showing up in more ways than just saying 'Black Lives Matter' or putting 'Black Lives Matter' on their social media,\" Cullors added.\n \"We need white folks to show up by following the leadership of Black folks, the very same Black folks who have transformed this country over and over again. On this MLK day let's remind ourselves that Black people deserve dignity, care and power.\"\n Ogwumike is a WNBA player and president of the Women's National Basketball Players Association. She chose the following quote:\n \"It is not enough for good people to know they are good for goodness to take place,\" she said. \"We must hold ourselves to actionable accountability that plants the seeds for sustainable change; allowing both its roots and branches to grow over time, naturally and intentionally.\"\n Awad is the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He chose a quote from Dr. King's book \"A Gift of Love: Sermons from Strength to Love and Other Preachings.\"\n He said the quote speaks to the \"five years of indoctrination and lies by (President) Donald Trump and his enablers created a poisonous environment in which millions of Americans believe in falsehoods and conspiracy theories that make our society and the world less stable and less peaceful.\"\n Suryanarayanan is a spokesperson for the advocacy group South Asian Americans Leading Together. She chose a few sentences from Dr. King's 1967 book \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\"\n \"Building a just world starts with the abolition of White supremacy, in all its forms -- structural, institutional, and personal,\" Suryanarayanan said. \"But as non-Black people of color, we must also unpack and combat our own complicity in White supremacy and American imperialism. Without the deconstruction of anti-Black racism, no liberation is possible.\"\n Crenshaw is the co-founder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum. She chose a quote from Dr. King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n \"Martin Luther King Jr.'s framing of the failures and promises of America makes clear how the nation's unaddressed deficits become the justification for even greater disenfranchisement and expropriation. The right-wing attacks on his dream and the physical embodiment of the ideological assault on multicultural democracy that we witnessed last week are a repudiation of the very idea that there exists a 'promissory note',\" Crenshaw said.\n \"King was often critical -- most famously in his 'Letter from a Birmingham Jail' -- of those moderates who chronically advocated for a 'more convenient season' to pursue racial justice. On this Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, we should acknowledge -- in the face of so much tragedy and depravity -- that we are never going to be in a stable position when it comes to injustice. And it is from the illusion of stability that the further deterioration of Black people's material status occurs. The fight for justice must continue -- always.\"\n Echo Hawk is the founder and executive director of IllumiNative, a national Native-led non-profit group. She chose an excerpt from Dr. King's book \"Why We Can't Wait.\"\n \"Dr. King taught us that racial injustice in the United States started with the arrival of colonizers on Native land. The violence these settlers used first against Indigenous peoples, then against Black slaves, was predicated on White supremacist beliefs. White supremacy is upheld by false origin myths about the United States, ignored by whitewashing brutal anti-Native and anti-Black policies, and sustained by stereotyped, inaccurate portrayals of Native people and people of color in popular culture,\" Echo Hawk said.\n \"To create a just world, all people of every race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender expression, and age, must stand together and tell truthful stories about our past and hopeful stories about our future.\"\n Wilson, who plays for the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces, is a member of the league's Social Justice Council. She is also the founder of A'ja Wilson Foundation, which supports children who struggle with dyslexia. She chose a Dr. King quote that gives her hope.\n \"There is so much going on in the world right now. So many disappointing, tragic and gut-wrenching moments,\" Wilson said. \"We all have to keep our foot on the gas but historically, we have always come together as a people to celebrate the wins, big or small, and that's one of the greatest things about our culture. We can never give up.\"\n Jackson Jr. plays for the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. He chose a Dr. King quote that he said \"resonated\" with him the most.\n \"This quote resonated with me the most given our current climate because we have become so polarized. We no longer sit down and have conversations about our differences and as Dr. King said it is purely out of fear of what we don't know about each other,\" Jackson Jr. said.\n \"I believe in order for us to move past the horrible events of the past few months as well as the past several decades, we need to have open and honest dialogue. (We need) a conversation where no matter your race, religion, sexual orientation or any other difference, we listen with compassion and find a common ground. If the pandemic taught us nothing else, we must value time and we must talk to each other. We can't let fear dictate who we are. We gotta be better than that. It's time to achieve Dr. King's dream.\"",

Certainly, he would be greatly disappointed in how we have chosen to conduct ourselves at this particular moment, but most particularly probably disappointed in the commander in chief, because the commander in chief is supposed to bring people together and not to bring people together to actually intercept your government,\" Martin Luther King III told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Monday, referring to President Donald Trump.\n \"He understood we are a United States of America, not a divided state of America, and he would be telling us we must turn to each other, not turn on each other,\" said King, who spoke to CNN on the federal holiday honoring his father.\n King is a global human rights leader and chairman of the board for the Drum Major Institute, a non-profit organization originally founded by King Jr. to drive social progress.\n The son of the civil rights movement leader said he believes President-elect Joe Biden and his administration should lead the country in bringing people together and addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, police brutality and misconduct as well as climate change.\n \"We're going to see a new air brought in,\" he said.\n But King noted it will take time for the country to move past what he called a \"very difficult moment.\"\n \"We will do better. We are much better than the behavior that we've seen exhibited over the last few days,\" he said.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nMass public vaccination programs are underway across the globe. In the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC that President-elect Joe Biden's goal to distribute 100 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine in his first 100 days of office was \"quite feasible.\"\n India, which trails only the US in total cases, began an ambitious nationwide vaccination drive this weekend after regulators approved the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot and a locally produced vaccine. In Turkey and Indonesia, tens of millions of people are poised to receive doses of the CoronaVac shot made by Beijing-based company Sinovac, Helen Regan reports.\n England has just expanded its vaccine program to people aged 70 and older, while South Korea's president says he believes the country will have complete Covid-19 \"herd immunity\" by November.\n There's an urgency to these rollouts. The world hit 2 million coronavirus deaths last week, and policy makers are scrambling to stem the human and economic toll wrought by the pandemic. The Chinese and Indian vaccines are regarded as potentially affordable and easily distributed shots, and unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, they do not require expensive cold storage.\n But there have been queries over the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine, which was revealed to have an efficacy rate of just 50.38% in late-stage trials in Brazil -- significantly lower than earlier results showed. The makers of India's homegrown vaccine, Covaxin, have also faced criticism from experts for not revealing the vaccine's efficacy results or any other data from its clinical trials.\n Amid the questions, countries are re-examining their rollout plans. Singapore's Health Minister said officials would review Sinovac's vaccine before any rollout to its citizens. Concern is growing in Australia -- which has secured 54 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot -- that relying on a single vaccine with a lower efficacy rate may not necessarily build up the required herd immunity in its 26-million-strong population. Some scientists are calling for a delay to mass inoculations.\n New Zealand, hailed as a global model for how it handled the outbreak, has yet to approve a vaccine, though it has struck deals with several vaccine developers for access to their candidates once local regulators give the green light. Experts say its wait-and-see approach will mean the population will be able to have greater confidence in the vaccines. But it could be a risky bet -- particularly given new, potentially more transmissible variants, could risk further outbreaks.\n Send your questions here.

Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415.\n At least 4.5 million Palestinians living on the West Bank and in Gaza are being left behind by Israel's world-leading vaccine rollout, Sam Kiley reports. So far none has had the injections, and most are unlikely to get them any time soon -- because there is no Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the Palestinian territories.\n A UN expert report says that Israel is the occupying power in and over Gaza and the West Bank, and has been since 1967, and is thereby ultimately responsible for the health care of those living under occupation. But as Israel's vaccination campaign climbs past 20% of its population (including east Jerusalem residents), Israel's government has pointed to the Oslo accords, signed in the mid-1990s with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Included in the first of those agreements is a clause that hands responsibility to the PA for the health of all Palestinians under its civil administration.\n Experts admit it is not a straightforward task trying to navigate between the responsibilities assigned by Oslo, which was not a final status agreement, and the duties laid out under the Geneva Conventions.\n England is expanding into the next phase of its vaccination campaign, offering doses to people aged 70 and over and those considered vulnerable to the virus, the government announced Sunday. So far, more than 3.5 million people received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the UK, surpassing the number who have tested positive for the virus, according to government data.\n While the UK was the first in the world to start a mass vaccination rollout, and has vaccinated more people than some of the European Union's biggest nations, the country has suffered the highest Covid-19 death toll in western Europe, of more than 89,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Fears over new Covid-19 variants have also led it to close all travel corridors today, meaning all travelers coming into the UK must have a negative Covid-19 test and will have to quarantine for 10 days on arrival.\n Norway is looking into the death of 23 patients who had received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Thirteen of the deaths have so far been assessed by Norwegian authorities and the assessments suggest that common adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients, said Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician at the Norwegian Medicines Agency.\n As the country is vaccinating the elderly and people in nursing homes with serious underlying diseases it should be \"expected that deaths close to the time [of the] vaccination may occur. In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities,\" the country's Institute of Public Health said in a statement. Pfizer said in a statement to CNN that it is working with Norwegian authorities to gather all the relevant information, adding that the \"the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations. All reported deaths will be thoroughly evaluated [by the Norwegian Medicines Agency] to determine if these incidents are related to the vaccine.\"\n Preparations for the Australian Open hit a major stumbling block when 47 tennis players were told they couldn't train after some passengers on charter planes arriving in Melbourne returned positive Covid-19 test results. Thousands of New Delhi's teachers are being sent to the Covid frontlines. They are expected to juggle their usual responsibilities with new roles, and some are complaining about no training, PPE or even pay.China's economy grew more than expected last year even as the world was upended by the pandemic.Brazil, which has the world's third-highest Covid case count, finally authorized two vaccines. Minutes later, Monica Calazans, a Black nurse from S\u00e3o Paulo, became the first Brazilian to be vaccinated.\n If the blur between work and home is still a struggle, mimicking your pre-pandemic routine may be the solution you need.\n Enter the rise of the \"fake commute,\" wherein people replace that daily transition with walks, runs, bike rides and more. Here's some tips on how to start your own journey.\n \"I'm angry because I know we can do better.\".. -- CNN Correspondent Sara Sidner",

        "title": "Even a small portion of fried foods can increase risk of heart disease, study says",
        "body_text": "Eating fried foods may increase your risk for major heart disease and stroke, according to a new analysis of existing research.\n Compared to those who ate the least, people who ate the most fried food per week had a 28% higher risk of major cardiovascular events, a 22% greater risk of coronary heart disease and a 37% heightened risk of heart failure, according to the study published Monday in the journal Heart.\n Each additional weekly serving of 114 grams or 4 ounces (\u00bd cup) of fried foods increased the risk for heart attack and stroke by 3%, heart disease by 2% and heart failure by 12%, the study found. A medium McDonald's french fry serving, for example, is 117 grams.\n No associations were found for deaths from cardiovascular disease or from any cause, but the researchers said this might be because of the relatively small numbers involved in some of the studies.\n When food is fried, it absorbs some of the fat from the oil, potentially increasing calories. In addition, commercially fried and processed foods can often contain trans fats, created by an industrialized process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid (think of semisoft margarine and shortening).\n The food industry loves trans fats because they are cheap to produce, last a long time and give foods a great taste and texture.\n Besides fried foods, you'll find trans fats in coffee creamer, cakes, pie crusts, frozen pizza, cookies, crackers, biscuits and dozens of other processed foods.\n The US Food and Drug Association banned trans fats in 2015, but has extended time frames for the industry -- the latest gave companies until June 18, 2019, to stop manufacturing foods and until January 1, 2021, for these products to work their way through the marketplace.\n There is still a loophole, however. The FDA allows companies to label a food as \"0 grams\" of trans fats if one serving of the food contains less than 0.5 grams.\n If people eat multiple servings of such foods, the small doses can quickly add up, experts say, contributing to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other conditions, such as dementia.\n According to the American Heart Association, trans fats raise your bad cholesterol levels and lower your good cholesterol levels. The AHA recommends replacing trans fats from fried and processed foods with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats, such as olive and canola oil.\n The \"findings of this study are consistent with current guidance to limit intake of fried foods but cannot be considered as providing definitive evidence on the role of fried food consumption in cardiovascular health,\" said Alun Hughes, professor of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology at University College London, in a statement. Hughes was not involved in the study.\n That's because most studies of this kind reply on study participants' recall of the amount and type of fried foods eaten, which is subject to error. In addition, high consumption of fried foods is likely to be associated with overeating and obesity, lack of exercise and other unhealthy behaviors that can contribute to heart disease, experts said.\n \"If the relationship is causal, we can't assume that this association is definitely down to the fat content of the foods, as many of these foods are highly processed and often contain both fat and carbohydrate together,\" said registered dietitian Duane Mellor, a senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\n \"So, when considering this type of study, it is important to consider that although reducing fat intake is a logical part of a healthy diet, it is also important to look at what foods are eaten in its place,\" said Mellor, who was not involved in the study.",

        "title": "A nurse for 50 years refused to retire when the pandemic began. She later died from Covid-19",
        "body_text": "After more than 50 years as an emergency room nurse, Betty Grier Gallagher had more than earned the right to retire. But according to those who knew and loved her, she just couldn't. She cared that much.\n Gallaher worked the night shift at Alabama's Coosa Valley Medical Center -- her preference, her son said, so she could mentor younger nurses. Known around the hospital as \"Miss Betty,\"she loved to be their sounding board, personal therapist and \"work mom.\"\n She'd make sure everyone she worked with was fed every night. She cared for her patients the same way she cared for her family and her coworkers, who became family themselves. She was, according to her loved ones, everyone's favorite nurse.\n So when the Covid-19 pandemic began in March, Gallaher's concerned coworkers asked her, for her safety, to stay home.\n But sitting back wasn't like her. She knew her colleagues and community needed her, so she continued to work until Covid-19 sidelined her in December.\n Gallaher died from Covid-19 on January 10, one day before her 79th birthday, in the same hospital where she worked for much of her career.\n \"She didn't do it to stand out,\" said her son Carson Grier Jr. \"She did it because this is who she was -- this is her calling.\"\n Gallaher was a nurse for most of her life. She believed it was her lifelong duty to care for her patients and mentor her younger colleagues, said Grier, a high school basketball coach and elementary school physical education instructor.\n \"This was her purpose and plan for her life,\" Grier told CNN. \"And she lived it daily.\"\n She spent 43 years at Coosa Valley Medical Center in Sylacauga, about an hour southeast of Birmingham. It's where she met Chuck Terrell, then a radiology technician. The two were best friends for more than 30 years, and Gallaher even trained two of his sons as nurses at Coosa Valley.\n \"We've all worked with Betty now,\" Terrell said. \"I never could make her understand how much everybody loved her.\"\n One of the parts of the job she loved best was working with young nurses who were sometimes 50 years her junior, such as Coosa Valley ER nurse and supervisor Nikki Jo Hatten.\n \"Betty's the type that worries about you as a nurse just as much as she worries about a patient,\" Hatten told CNN. \"She's gonna stop you while you're busy, just to make sure you're OK.\"\n Gallaher knew everyone's name in the ER, plus the names of their partners, children and pets, Hatten said. She'd show up with a bag of burgers to feed anyone who forgot to bring a meal for their 12-hour shift. She'd hold your hand and wrap you in a warm blanket if you needed it. She showed the same love to her colleagues as she did to her family and children.\n \"She was the cure for an anxiety attack,\" Hatten said.\n Miss Betty didn't fear working on the front lines of a disaster. She worked as a supervisor at a hospital in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina knocked out power and stranded many of her coworkers.\n A few years after the 2005 hurricane, she told her son she was retiring. When he asked her what she'd do next, she said she'd go back to Coosa Valley, where Terrell had worked his way up to director of the emergency department, and return as an ER nurse.\n \"She wanted to get back to the everyday grind of the emergency room,\" Grier said. \"She did it 'til it was her last days.\"\n In March, her coworkers tried to persuade her to sit the pandemic out. Hatten said after a day or two of staying home, the 78-year-old arrived back at work to resume her night shift.\n \"She couldn't stand it,\" Hatten said. \"She missed coming to work. It's what she lived for.\"\n On December 19, Hatten noticed the typically indefatigable Miss Betty was short of breath during her rounds. Hatten suggested Gallaher get checked out after her shift ended, but Gallaher shrugged her symptoms off as exhaustion.\n The next day, emergency responders brought Gallaher into the hospital, though she hadn't called them, Hatten said -- they'd checked on her out of worry. She tested positive for Covid-19, and she would stay at Coosa Valley until she died.\n Even when she was confined to her hospital bed, Gallaher's primary concern was her colleagues' well-being. On New Year's Eve, she called Terrell and requested that he buy pizza for the ER staff with her debit card as a thank-you. She refused a transfer to a Birmingham hospital suggested by her carers -- Hatten said she joked that she wouldn't have anyone to style her hair.\n Hatten, Terrell and their coworkers tried to keep Gallaher comfortable and occupied. After she made her rounds throughout the hospital, Hatten would stop by Gallaher's room in the intensive care unit and draw on her door in dry erase marker or don PPE to show Gallaher photos of her dog.\n Miss Betty feared dying alone in the ICU, Hatten said. At the end of her life, her work family made sure she was surrounded by people who loved her.\n \"The day she did pass away, just about all our ER staff went and filled that room up,\" Hatten said. \"It was not the way we wanted to see her go, but I'm glad we got to be there.\"\n Hatten's shift is quieter than usual without Miss Betty there. When the silence becomes too sad, Hatten and her coworkers will swap \"Betty stories\" or repeat the funny quips she'd make. It's therapeutic, she said.\n \"She was the glue of our ER, or the ER matriarch,\" she said. \"It feels like we lost our mom.\"\n Gallaher's legacy was well known in Sylacauga, but Hatten wanted to share Miss Betty with the world. So she made a TikTok dedicated to Gallaher, a compilation of short clips of the 78-year-old nurse palling around with her colleagues, beaming.\n Her first TikTok about Miss Betty, posted less than one week ago, has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\n \"We didn't want her to be forgotten,\" Hatten said. \"Everybody deserves a Betty in their hospital, and we wanted to share ours.\"\n Grier likes to remember his mother the way she appears in Hatten's TikTok -- smiling, playful, always a bag of food in hand. He believes if his mother had the chance to do her life over again, knowing how it would end, she'd do it the exact same way.\n \"There was only one way she knew how to live, and that was to help others,\" he said. \"I hope that I get to say that I lived my life the way I wanted to live it, like she did.\"\n Terrell was set to preach at Gallaher's funeral before it was postponed; Grier tested positive for Covid-19 a few days before the service, though he's now recovering. Giving the eulogy would've been both easy and impossible, Terrell said -- easy because Gallaher secured her own legacy in the care she showed others, and impossible because he loved her so much and missed her terribly.\n Before she died, Gallaher texted Terrell that she'd finally retire when she recovered from her illness. The pair liked to relax by painting acrylic figurines -- cows were her favorite to paint.\n Gallaher never got to retire, and Terrell never got to paint with her one last time. He knew she'd never slow down in life, so he likes to imagine her now, in bliss, painting cows while the people she's touched carry on her legacy of kindness.",

One person suffered a non-life threatening injury, city authorities said, but the US Secret Service said there was \"no threat to the public.\"\n As the fire was checked out, US Capitol Police, citing an \"external security threat,\" advised lawmakers and staff to shelter in place. Capitol Police instructed the complex to \"return to normal operations\" shortly after 11:30 a.m.\n The response underlines the immense sense of alert in Washington, DC, this week. It comes less than two weeks after the deadly siege at the Capitol left five dead and two days ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, which has turned the city's downtown into an armed police zone.\n There are currently hundreds of National Guard troops on the east front of the Capitol. Another alert at one point urged people to stay inside, to not leave and to stay away from windows and doors.\n Capitol authorities evacuated the west front of the building as well as the first-floor crypt.\n \"I just tried to leave (the Longworth House Office Building) after getting my Covid test, only to be told that the building is now on lockdown. Apparently some external threat. Propane tanks under some bridge. Stuck in my office,\" a Democratic congressman told CNN shortly after the incident was reported.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Ted Barrett, Abby Phillip, Ali Main and Clare Foran contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Ford closes German plant for 1 month as global chip crisis worsens",
        "body_text": "Ford has ordered a month-long production halt at one of its plants in Germany, the latest sign that a global shortage of computer chips is putting carmakers under increasing pressure and threatening their recovery from the pandemic.\n The US automaker said it would idle its factory in Saarlouis, Germany, from Monday until February 19 because of the chip shortage and weak demand. The plant makes Ford's most popular car in Europe, the Focus, and employs around 5,000 workers.\n \"We are closely monitoring the situation and adjusting production schedules to minimize the effect on our employees, suppliers, customers and dealers across Europe,\" said a Ford spokesman. \"At this time, we do not anticipate any similar actions at our other European facilities.\"\n Ford (F) was forced to close a SUV plant in Louisville, Kentucky, last week because of the shortage of semiconductors. But the shutdown in Germany suggests the problem, which is affecting carmakers around the world, could get worse before it gets better.\n Leading semiconductor manufacturers reassigned capacity from automakers last year after the pandemic slashed car sales, instead shipping chips to companies that produce smartphones, gaming systems and other tech gadgets that remained in high demand. Supplies are still tight, and carmakers are struggling to secure the chips they need.\n Volkswagen (VLKAF), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota (TM), Nissan (NSANF) and Honda (HMC) are among the other automakers suffering from the shortage of chips, which are used in a growing number of applications including driver assistance systems and navigation control. The average car has between 50 to 150 chips.\n \"Light vehicle manufacturers are finding increased disruption to the supply of systems using semiconductors in the first quarter,\" Mark Fulthorpe, executive director for the automotive team at IHS Markit, said recently in a research note. \"The situation is highly fluid.\"\n The disruption comes at a crucial time for carmakers, which suffered a collapse in sales in the early months of the pandemic, yet remain under intense pressure from global regulators to invest heavily in electric cars. Research firm Bernstein estimates global vehicle sales will grow 9% in 2021, following an expected 15% decline last year \u2014 but the chip shortage is putting the recovery at risk.\n Volkswagen (VLKAF) said in a statement last month that it will need to adjust production at plants in China, North America and Europe this quarter. The changes will affect production of the bestselling VW Golf, as well as models from its Audi, Skoda and Seat brands.\n According to UBS analysts, the world's largest carmaker could lose out on production of 100,000 units in the first three months of the year, or roughly 4% of global quarterly output, as a result of the components shortages.\n \"We are doing everything in our power to minimize lost production and to ensure that normal deliveries to customers can be resumed as rapidly as possible,\" Volkswagen Group purchasing manager Murat Aksel said in a statement last month.\n Audi said Monday that it has furloughed 10,000 workers because of the chip shortage, with production and shift patterns affected at plants in Germany and Mexico. Production of the luxury brand's A4 sedan and A5 cabriolet has been provisionally halted in Neckarsulm, Germany, through January 29.\n \"We are currently looking at a range of countermeasures and alternatives designed to mitigate the impact of the supply bottleneck and, in turn, minimize the number of vehicles affected,\" a spokesperson said. \"Any improvement largely depends on the semiconductor industry.\"\n In an interview published on Sunday by the Financial Times, CEO Markus Duesmann said Audi would try to limit production losses to 10,000 cars during the first quarter.\n Fiat Chrysler said last week that it would delay the restart of production following a scheduled break at its Toluca, Mexico, plant, which builds the Jeep Compass. It has also scheduled downtime at its Canadian plant in Ontario, which produces the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger.\n Japanese carmakers are also hurting. Toyota said it was forced to temporarily halt production at a plant in Guangzhou, China, on January 12, and it's cutting production at a Texas factory that makes Tundra pickup trucks. Nissan and Honda have both said they're \"adjusting\" production in response to the shortage.\n South Korea's Hyundai said in a statement on Monday that it's \"making effort to optimize supply of parts to ensure stable production at each production hub.\"\n German luxury brand BMW (BMWYY) said last week that it has not yet had to contend with interruptions to production but is in \"constant contact\" with its suppliers. General Motors (GM) and France's Renault (RNLSY) have said they are working with suppliers to mitigate the impact on production, while Daimler (DDAIF)-owned Mercedes-Benz said it is \"monitoring the situation.\"\n Production levels in Europe, North America, Japan and India are expected to be hit this quarter, according to IHS. But the biggest problem could be in China.\n \"At this stage, with varying levels of visibility across the supply chain, the biggest volume disruption is noted in mainland China where, based on available information, the risk could be 250,000 units in the first quarter,\" said Fulthorpe.\n Chinese carmakers Brilliance Auto Group, SAIC Motor and Geely (GELYF), which owns Volvo, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major supplier of chips, said last week that easing the shortage is its \"top priority.\" \"We are working closely with our automotive customers to resolve the capacity support issues,\" CEO C. C. Wei said at an investor conference on Thursday.\n \u2014 Jake Kwon, Junko Ogura, Jill Disis and CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this article.",

        "body_text": "As Los Angeles County battles against the unrelenting coronavirus, an air pollution control agency says it has temporarily suspended limits on cremations in order to assist crematoriums in the county with a \"backlog\" caused by the pandemic.\n The South Coast Air Quality Management District said in a news release Sunday that permits for crematoriums usually contain limits on the number of human remains that can be cremated each month, based on the potential impact they will have on air quality.\n But after requests from both the county coroner and health department, the agency issued an emergency order suspending permit conditions that limit the number of cremations, as long as crematoriums submit an email notice and meet certain requirements.\n The news is part of a devastating series of headlines in recent days reflecting the gravity of the crisis in Los Angeles County: It just surpassed a million total reported infections. Hospitals declared internal disasters. And officials began adding more capacity to store bodies of Covid-19 victims.\n Earlier this month, the county said a person was dying of the virus every eight minutes.\n \"The current rate of death is more than double that of pre-pandemic years, leading to hospitals, funeral homes, and crematoriums exceeding capacity without the ability to process the backlog of cases,\" South Coast AQMD said in a statement.\n And its order says there's another surge of deaths that's approaching, fueled by the gatherings that took place over the New Year's holiday.\n The emergency order will be in effect for 10 days and can be extended, the agency said.\n Los Angeles County health officials reported Sunday more than 13,800 people have died of Covid-19 since the pandemic's start and more than 7,400 remain hospitalized with the virus -- 23% of whom are in the ICU.\n Late last week, county health officials said in a news release that both healthcare workers and ICU capacity remain \"strained.\"\n \"The most important action for everyone to take to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives is to stay home and not mingle with others not in your household,\" the release said.",

        "title": "David Axelrod: The scary call I got the night before Barack Obama's inauguration",
        "body_text": "David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of \"The Axe Files,\" was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN.\nThe night before former President Barack Obama's first inauguration, I got an urgent call from Rahm Emanuel, his incoming chief of staff: \"Can you call me back right away from a hard line?\"\n Rahm sounded a bit agitated, which wasn't entirely unusual. But the fact that he was asking me to call from a land line rather than my cell phone was a tipoff that something was amiss.\n I was visiting friends in Washington, DC, when Rahm's jarring call came and borrowed a corded phone in a bedroom to resume our conversation.\n \"I'm going to tell you something you can't share with anyone -- not even Susan,\" he said, referring to my wife. \"We've been talking to (Michael) Chertoff all day, and there is a serious threat on the inauguration.\"\n Chertoff was the outgoing homeland security secretary for President George W. Bush. He shared intelligence that four young men who had been radicalized and gone overseas to train with Al Shabaab, an Al Qaeda affiliate in East Africa, may have slipped back into the US to target the inaugural ceremonies.\n The threat was considered serious enough that contingency plans had been drawn to quickly disperse the inaugural crowd. If that became necessary, Rahm said, the Secret Service would alert Obama, who would instruct the crowd to follow directions and leave in an orderly fashion.\n \"I can't read the speechwriters into this, so I want you to write a brief statement for the President-elect,\" Rahm told me. \"Meet him right before the ceremony in the Speaker's office and give it to him. He'll put it in his pocket in case it's needed.\"\n Out for an evening of celebration before I began my work as senior adviser to the President of the United States, this news brought instant sobriety. I could not sleep, haunted by police sirens that pierced the night and the specter of a looming catastrophe.\n The following morning, I was committed to do television interviews while Susan and my son Ethan were invited to attend the traditional pre-inaugural service at the historic St. John's Episcopal Church with the Obamas and Bushes.\n Fearful that the attack could take place there, I was desperate to tell my wife and son not to go, but I would have had to share what I knew, and I was sworn to secrecy. I could only hope it was a decision I would not regret for the rest of my life.\n I delivered the remarks to the President-elect, as planned. He slipped them into his coat pocket without reading them, and we exchanged a few words about the journey on which we were embarking.\n A few minutes later, Susan and I sat on the reviewing stand behind the rostrum from which Obama would take the oath of office, looking out at a sea of humanity that extended from the Capitol all the way to the Washington monument.\n It was a wonderful, inspiring scene, yet I couldn't shed the ominous knowledge that potential terrorists might be lurking in that vast crowd.\n Thankfully, they were not. But those harrowing 24 hours were a bracing introduction to the grave threats and profound responsibilities we were about to assume.\n On Wednesday, Joe Biden will take the oath of office from those same Capitol steps, but it will be a starkly different scene. Even before the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, attendance at the inauguration was going to be limited to dignitaries and a relative small number of invited guests because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now Biden will have to offer our battered nation words of hope and unity from within a fortified green zone, constructed to protect him and the incoming national leadership from homegrown terrorists.\n The man who did so much to radicalize these Americans will be en route to Florida by then, breaking yet one more norm by skipping the swearing-in of his successor. But he made the right decision. It would have been profane to see him sitting on the same steps the mob he incited had stormed just two weeks earlier.\n As he wings away to his own uncertain future, Donald Trump will leave for his successor myriad crises and threats that eclipse even what Obama faced when he assumed office amid war and recession in 2009.\n I'm thinking about our new President and his team as they prepare to take on these extraordinary burdens. Every American should be grateful for their willingness to help lead us out of this awful mess. And though there are clearly some in this bitterly divided nation who would vehemently disagree, we all have a stake in their success.",

        "body_text": "David A. Andelman, a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award, and executive director of The Red Lines Project, is the author of \"A Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen\" and host of its Evergreen podcast. He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\nThe whole world is watching.\n From Day One, President-elect Joe Biden has a tall order -- to rebuild around the world the shattered image of America that Donald Trump had cultivated from his first day, four long years ago. At its core, this involves a restoration of the most critical underpinnings of America's national security and the world's well-being that Trump and his minions sought to dismantle, with increasing intensity through the final days and hours of his presidency.\n And this process can, and indeed must, begin the very moment Biden takes his hand off the Bible after swearing to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n Some of these first day priorities he will be in a position to accomplish through a series of executive orders, drafted and teed up on his desk for his first hours.\n But his most difficult task will be to convince the growing band of skeptics around the world -- most of whom want so desperately to embrace an America that may be long gone -- that the Biden years are not simply a golden interregnum as America takes a respite before again plunging ever more deeply into a toxic maelstrom of conservatism, isolationism and self-interest. \"Day One, if I win, I'm going to be on the phone with our NATO allies saying, 'We're back,' \" he told KPNX in Phoenix last summer. \"We're back, and you can count on us again.\"\n So what else should be on Biden's Day One priorities list?\n To begin, there's reversing a series of Trump withdrawals: return to the Paris Climate Accords; return to the World Health Organization and restore the $90 million in funding the US owes. Both of these are unquestionably flawed, but they can be better reformed from within than without.\n Equally, the United States needs to either find its way back into or find some way of restoring several treaties Trump bolted out of with little real understanding of the consequences. The Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty were both victims of Trump's ill-considered ire. Just last week, Russia joined the US in withdrawing from the Open Skies accord, which allows unfettered overflights of military sites by observation aircraft. About the only major East-West arms treaty still left is the New START agreement, set to expire next month and which needs desperately to be re-upped to prevent a new, unchecked nuclear arms race.\n Then there's a succession of ongoing flashpoints or endemic crises that Biden, his Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan will need urgently to confront, but with a host of immediate obstacles that outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has hardly hesitated to strew in their path.\n Iran has already been doing its best to wait out the new administration in Washington and see what new directions it might be prepared to take. The ayatollahs seem to have shown some restraint in allowing the first anniversary of the assassination of their military hero Gen. Qasem Soleimani on January 3, 2020, -- ordered by Trump -- to go largely unmarked. But a day after the anniversary, Iran did announce with some fanfare it would begin enriching uranium to 20% concentration -- a clear breach of the nuclear treaty known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action from which Trump withdrew and Biden has pledged to revive and re-enter. (After the killing of Soleimani, Iran announced that it wouldn't restrict itself to the plan.) Waiting in the wings is an expansion of Iran's ballistic missile program, which Jake Sullivan told CNN's Fareed Zakaria must be on the table to deal with early-on. Already, Iran has threatened to expel international nuclear inspectors if sanctions aren't lifted by February 21.\n Pompeo has further not improved the atmosphere awaiting the Biden team, announcing a host of sanctions against Iran's military-industrial complex last week, against its shipping industry and against institutions controlled by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah AIi Khamenei and his associates, who Pompeo described as \"Iran's corrupt leaders.\"  And he announced with little evidence that Iran had allowed al-Qaeda to set up its headquarters in Tehran, then slapped on more sanctions.\n All these moves are obstacles to building the kind of trust that Biden and his team must assemble if they are going to be able to return to the JCPOA agreement designed to restrain Iran's dash toward a nuclear weapon.\n Meanwhile, Trump's interim Defense Secretary Chris Miller announced -- with apparent pride -- that the Pentagon has completed the reduction to 2,500 of American troop levels from Afghanistan and Iraq each, to the lowest levels in two decades. Whether this might embolden the Taliban or Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq remains to be seen.\n Then there  are China and Russia. Both are at once immediately pressing -- and long-term problems. The Biden team will need to develop a long-term strategy in dealing with China. To do so, they will need to understand and accept China's principal need -- recognition that it is a dominant world power in virtually every respect. No doubt this means the United States cannot hope to compete  and emerge victorious on its own.\n \"Trying to compete one-on-one with China is a much more difficult prospect than trying to build partnerships with allies and like-minded states around the world to compete against them together,\" Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, a foreign policy and defense veteran of the Obama presidency, told me in a recent interview.  In a host of areas, from technology to Indo-Pacific security, to economics and trade, China will continue to grow and pose an ever-increasing threat at every turn.  \"What we want to try to do is figure out early in the game is how do we compete successfully with China in those areas without ending up in a war between two nuclear powers,\" Flournoy said. And then, six days before the inauguration, along came Pompeo with new visa restriction and sanctions against Chinese communist party members and corporations designed only to inflame relations.\n The big question over sanctions also hovers over America's dealings with Russia, and especially Vladimir Putin. It took more than a month for Putin to recognize Biden's victory. But Biden does not seem to have much appetite for the \"reset\" in relations with Russia that marked the early days of the Obama presidency.  Which is not to say that eventually business might not be done. For the moment, however, it may best to monitor Putin's response. Will Russia continue buzzing US ships in international waters, infiltrating troops and materiel into eastern Ukraine, assassinating political opponents at home and abroad?  As Ambassador Kurt Volker, deeply involved for years in east-west issues, told me in an interview last week, Biden needs to tell Putin early on that, \"If you persist in this we will keep up the counter pressure on you, but you need to signal that you're willing to actually come to the table with us. For once, it's not on the US or the West to reset our policies. It's time for Russia to rethink its policies.\"\n Seizing Putin-opponent Alexei Navalny at the Moscow airport Sunday on his return from Germany did not seem to be any move in that direction.\n And lastly, there is North Korea. Already, dictator Kim Jong Un has thrown down the gauntlet. Last week, he gave a surprise preview of a massive pipeline of advanced new weaponry -- military drones, a nuclear-powered submarine, smaller and lighter missiles with greater range and multiple warheads. Without neighboring China and Russia on board, not to mention a Europe that is more immediately focused on Iran, there are few possible restraints on Kim's actions. After all, he's already wrung the principal benefit of global recognition as an \"equal\" of an American president out of his ill-conceived summits with Trump.\n Inherent in so many of these challenges is the restoration of alliances and partnerships with many of America's natural friends and allies, particularly in Europe. Which brings us full-circle to Biden's overwhelming need to re-establish a global or at least Western order led by a newly rational and globalist America.\n Gone must be \"America First.\" Welcome, \"America One Among Many\" -- erasing as quickly as possible a host of toxic red lines that were the hallmark of the Trump years.",

        "body_text": "But is it?\n The formula was meant to analyze when people booked holidays, assuming that people were most likely to buy a ticket to paradise when they were feeling down. Arnall was asked to come up with the best day to book a holiday trip, so he thought of reasons why people might want to take a holiday \u2014 and thus, the gloomiest day of the year was born.\n \"There is generally more sadness in the winter time and January is not uncommon at all for overall more sadness among folks,\" said Dr. Ravi Shah, a psychiatrist at Columbia University's Irving Medical Center in New York City. \"So rather than dial in to one specific day, I think the more interesting question is what it is about the winter that affects our mood.\"\n Some fuel stoking the Blue Monday fire could also be the phenomenon that's based on research from Japan. In 2009, the suicide ratio for Mondays for Japanese men was significantly higher than on other days of the week, especially for those in the \"productive age\" category \u2014 suggesting that the structure of the work week and economic struggles were to blame.\n Arnall's formula looks the part: [W+(D-d)]xTQ/MxNA. Upon closer inspection, however, the variables involved are subjective and plainly unscientific. W, for instance, stands for weather. D is debt and d is monthly salary, while T means time since Christmas and Q is the time since you gave up on your New Year's resolution.\n \"I had no idea it would gain the popularity that it has,\" Arnall told CNN. \"I guess a lot of people recognize it in themselves.\"\n Arnall has also claimed to campaign against his own idea of Blue Monday as part of the \"activist group\" Stop Blue Monday. But that group, as it turned out, was also a marketing campaign \u2014 this time for winter tourism to the Canary Islands.\n Now, he told CNN, he'd do it again.\n \"I don't regret it at all,\" he said, adding he has \"used the media\" on several occasions with the intention of starting conversations about psychology.\n \"My problem with academic psychology and peer reviewed publications ... they don't really make that much difference to regular people,\" added Arnall, who was paid \u00a31,200 to come up with Blue Monday.\n That's not a popular view in the profession, however.\n \"Mental health is the biggest health challenge of our generation,\" he added. \"Trivialising it is completely unacceptable.\"\n \"Depression is not a single day phenomenon,\" Shah said. \"Depression is a clinical syndrome that has to be at least two weeks, most of the day, most days over time.\"\n The condition has been linked to a biochemical imbalance in the brain prompted by shorter daylight hours and less sunlight in winter. As seasons change, people experience a shift in their biological internal clock, or circadian rhythm, that can cause them to be out of sync with their regular schedule.\n Common symptoms of SAD include fatigue despite how much a person sleeps, and weight gain associated with overeating and carbohydrate cravings, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\n Other signs include feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, trouble concentrating or making decisions, thoughts of death or suicide, and even suicide attempts.\n The onset of SAD can occur at any age, but typically starts between the ages of 18 and 30 and is more common in women than in men.\n The easiest way to start taking action against SAD is to focus on light exposure, Shah said. \"If you can't get natural sunlight, buy a light box,\" he said.\n Light therapy involves sitting in front of a light therapy box that emits very bright light for a minimum of 20 minutes per day. Most people see improvements from this method within one or two weeks of beginning treatment.\n In anticipation of the return of symptoms in late fall, some people begin light therapy in early fall to prevent them.\n Increased exposure to sunlight can help improve symptoms as well. Those prone to symptoms may want to spend more time outside or arrange a sitting area in your house that is exposed to a window during the day. Antidepressants and talk therapy are effective in treating SAD as well.\n Taking holistic care of your health can also help: exercising regularly, eating well, sleeping enough when you can and staying connected with family and friends. Talk to your doctor, too, as SAD can be a manageable condition with the right diagnosis and treatment.\n \"If you keep yourself active physically, mentally and socially and use a light box, that's going to go a long way,\" Shah said.\n Smart light bulbs, which can be activated by a Google Home or Amazon Echo device, can help you gently fall asleep or wake up by slowly brightening or dimming. Weighted blankets have been beneficial for people who struggle with insomnia and anxiety.\n So, if you're feeling OK today on Blue Monday, don't anticipate that the day will hold impending doom. If you're struggling with SAD, know that help is available for you.\n CNN's Allen Kim contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "James Griffiths is a Senior Producer for CNN International and author of \"The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet.\"\nSpeaking to reporters after casting her ballot in the Ugandan capital Kampala last week, one local resident was overjoyed to have voted for opposition leader Bobi Wine.\n \"The only sad thing ... is that we are missing the communication because some lines have been cut off. We don't have internet so we are lacking communication,\" she said. \"Outside Kampala, we don't know what is going on.\"\n What was going on, according to Wine and other opposition figures, was the election being stolen.\n Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni claimed Saturday that he had been re-elected for a sixth term, despite widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. In power since 1986, Museveni has defied repeated attempts to remove him over the years, cracking down on protests and jailing potential rivals.\n In recent elections, a key tactic in curtailing opposition has been to control Ugandans' access to the internet, blocking social media and messaging software like WhatsApp, and even instituting countrywide internet blackouts, cutting the population off from information at the most vital time.\n This year was no different. As Ugandans prepared to go to the polls last week, more and more of the internet gradually slipped out of reach, starting with Facebook and other social platforms, before finally the entire country was disconnected.\n The effects of such a shutdown go beyond online expression. According to Netblocks, an internet freedom monitor, such a blackout could have already cost the Ugandan economy around $9 million, while Cipesa, an African internet NGO, reported that both biometric voting systems and mobile money -- which many Ugandans rely on for payments -- were both disrupted by the shutdown.\n In a speech last week, Museveni accused Facebook of \"arrogance\" after it closed several accounts linked to the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) for alleged efforts to manipulate the election, saying a subsequent block of the platform, along with several other websites, was \"unfortunate but unavoidable.\"\n \"That social channel you are talking about, if it is going to operate in Uganda, it should be used equitably by everybody who has to use it,\" he said. \"If you want to take sides against the NRM, then (you) cannot operate in Uganda ... We cannot tolerate this arrogance of anybody coming to decide for us who is good and who is bad.\"\n Thanks to Museveni's control over traditional media in the country, Wine has relied on online platforms to get his message out, so the ban on Facebook and Twitter affected him far more than the President or NRM candidates.\n In the past, Ugandans have been able to get around limited blocks using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) -- software that encrypts internet use -- and other censorship circumvention tools, enabling them to bypass the restrictions by tunneling their traffic through servers in another country. There were signs this year that the censors are catching up, however, with many VPN servers being blocked, and finally a full shutdown ordered, cutting off all traffic.\n \"After a brutal, months-long crackdown on the media, Uganda's internet disruption is the latest attempt to keep the country's citizens in the dark ... and to prevent journalists from reporting on events surrounding the vote,\" Muthoki Mumo, a regional representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. \"Ugandan authorities should reverse course and take steps to ensure unrestricted internet access and guarantee that the public is adequately informed during the post-election period.\"\n Such a move seems unlikely. As of Monday, Uganda remains largely cut off from the global internet, according to monitor Netblocks, even as Wine and other opposition leaders attempt to contest Museveni's declaration of victory.\n Wine himself has been under house arrest for several days. In a message on Facebook -- visible to the rest of the world but not his fellow citizens -- the former reggae star wrote that \"everyone including media and my party officials are restricted from accessing me.\"\n Museveni, 76, has outlasted many other onetime African revolutionary leaders, showing an ability to stay in power that exceeds even former stalwarts like Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe.\n For decades, this was relatively simple, thanks to the well-funded Ugandan military and alliances with the United States and other major world powers. But as the country has developed, becoming one of sub-Saharan Africa's strongest economies, the government's ability to respond to demands from a growing and increasingly well educated, connected population, has waned.\n According to the IMF, Uganda has one of the fastest growing populations in Africa, and needs to create more than 600,000 jobs a year to cater for its expanding labor force, a task that has been made all the more difficult by the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic contraction.\n Museveni has sometimes appeared less than sympathetic to his citizens, saying in 2017 -- following another hotly-contested election during which internet restrictions were rife -- \"I hear some people are saying I am their servant, I am not a servant of anybody.\"\n In his speeches, he often harkens back to his history as a revolutionary, but Museveni's real talent has been for adapting to modern methods of control, not least online censorship and surveillance.\n Such tactics have spread across the continent in recent years, used in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Sudan, and further afield in Kashmir, Bangladesh, Belarus and Myanmar. There were more than 200 internet shutdowns in 2019, according to the Keep It On coalition, a trend that continued throughout 2020, with some governments using the pandemic as an excuse to introduce new online controls.\n Uganda has been a leader in this regard, thanks in part, critics allege, to the assistance of China, which has invested heavily in the country, increasing its influence over the formerly stalwart US ally. Chinese firms, both state-backed and nominally private, have also established a major presence in Uganda, reportedly supplying core internet technology and network monitoring equipment.\n During a visit to Beijing in 2017, government minister Evelyn Anite spoke admirably of China's model of internet control, saying she had asked for help to \"fight back\" against those in Uganda who were \"using social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to commit crimes with impunity.\"\n Museveni's growing grip over the internet, both technological and through new laws against \"cyber harassment\" or \"offensive communication,\" has enabled his government to limit the effect of the internet as a platform for organizing against him.\n As the former revolutionary begins his sixth term in office, other wannabe authoritarian leaders, facing their own online dissenters, will be taking note.",

        "title": "Fired Florida data scientist Rebekah Jones turns herself in to jail and tests positive for Covid-19",
        "body_text": "The former Florida data analyst who has accused state officials of covering up the extent of the pandemic has turned herself in, days after a warrant was issued for her arrest, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) said.\n Rebekah Jones has been charged with one count of offenses against users of computers, computer systems, computer networks and electronic devices, the FDLE said. She surrendered Sunday to the Leon County Detention Facility.\n Jones walked out of the jail Monday afternoon after posting bail. Wearing a mask, she told reporters outside the jail she had just tested positive for Covid-19.\n Jones didn't make any other comments as she walked alongside her attorney to a vehicle.\n In a series of tweets Saturday, Jones announced her intention to turn herself in to authorities.\n \"To protect my family from continued police violence, and to show that I'm ready to fight whatever they throw at me, I'm turning myself into police in Florida Sunday night,\" Jones tweeted.\n \"The Governor will not win his war on science and free speech. He will not silence those who speak out.\"\n Jones was fired from the Florida Department of Health in May and has repeatedly criticized Gov. Ron DeSantis' handling of the Covid-19 crisis.\n The FDLE has said it is investigating whether Jones accessed a state messaging system without authorization to call for state officials to speak out about Covid-19 deaths.\n \"It's time to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead,\" said a message sent on November 10, according to the affidavit. \"You know this is wrong. You don't have to be part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it's too late.\"\n Officials traced that message to an IP address linked to Jones' house, according to a search-warrant affidavit.\n On December 7, Jones' home was raided. Jones has filed a lawsuit, alleging FDLE officials violated her First Amendment rights, deprived her of due process and unlawfully seized her computers, cell phone and storage media during a search of her home.\n The suit states that IP addresses are commonly \"spoofed\" and references news articles that found that the username and password for the system of the message that triggered the investigation were publicly available on the health department's website.\n The investigation of Jones comes as DeSantis faces increasing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic.\n In April, the governor falsely claimed Covid-19 hadn't killed anyone under age 25.\n And last spring, the Florida Department of Health asked the Florida Medical Examiners Commission not to release the commission's comprehensive list of Covid-19 deaths, the commission's chairman told CNN.\n Despite multiple surges of Covid-19 in the state, DeSantis has refused to allow municipalities enforce their own mask mandates or stricter social distancing laws. That limitation of local control has been criticized by mayors from both parties.\n An investigation by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel found that DeSantis' administration worked to minimize bad news about the pandemic and spread misinformation.\n Some health department spokespeople were told in September not to issue statements until after the November election, and officials withheld crucial data about the spread of the virus, the newspaper reported.\n Jones, who helped build the state's coronavirus dashboard, has become one of the governor's harshest critics, publicly alleging that DeSantis was to blame for the mounting death toll.\n In May, state officials said Jones was terminated because she \"exhibited a repeated course of insubordination\" and modified a state data portal without input or approval from epidemiologists or her supervisors.\n But Jones said she was fired after she refused to falsify state Covid-19 data.\n Jones filed a whistleblower complaint in July with the Florida Commission on Human Relations.\n After her firing, Jones published her own dashboard of Covid-19 stats. She said she received internal records from people who worked for the state, including what she said was proof that state officials \"were lying in January (2020) about things like internal reports and notices from the CDC.\"\n That evidence was on \"a bunch of flash drives\" that officers took when they raided her house, Jones said. She said she also had documents that were legally accessed from when she was a state employee.\n Legal experts said the material could theoretically be used to target Jones' sources if they violated rules about sharing internal information.\n The search warrant allowed officers to recover \"any and all computer equipment\" that stores or transmits data, including hard drives, devices, software, and correspondence \"pertaining to the possession, receipt, origin or distribution of data involving the facilitation of computer crimes offenses.\"\n Employment attorneys in Florida said that state workers who leaked internal records to Jones could face disciplinary action or possibly legal trouble -- although they might be able to seek protection under state whistleblower laws.\n CNN's Curt Devine, Kay Jones and Casey Tolan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The rise of the fake commute, and why it's good for your mental health ",
        "body_text": "For many people, commuting to work can be the worst part of their day: There is the chance of sitting in standstill traffic. Or, railway problems might leave you disembarking and on an unexpected journey.\n For others, however, commuting may have been a ritual that was critical for their mental health and work-life balance. Enter the rise of the \"fake commute,\" wherein people replace that daily transition with walks, runs, bike rides and more.\n Not long into the pandemic, Kanter felt the stress and knew that to maintain resilience, she had to establish boundaries and routines by doing a fake commute in the morning.\n \"I realized that a lot of the time on airplanes was reflection time and thinking time,\" said Kanter, who has been doing an hour-long morning walk. She has learned neighborhood routes and looked for succulents and photographed them \u2014 birthing an \"obsession\" that led to her own succulent garden.\n \"Routines and rituals are very beneficial to us, because they're things that we understand and know what to expect from them,\" said Lynn Bufka, the senior director of practice transformation and quality at the American Psychological Association.\n \"The routine sets up for us, without having to think about what we're going to do next, 'Here is how my day is going to flow,'\" she said. \"It helps us ease from point A to point B.\"\n Commutes are forced pauses that signal the time to transition from one's work identity to another identity, such as parent, spouse or friend, said Ravi S. Gajendran, an associate professor at Florida International University's College of Business. \"Working full time from home during the pandemic makes it difficult to transition between work and home roles,\" he said via email.\n \"Many individuals are shifting between being a parent/spouse and an employee multiple times during a day,\" Gajendran added.\n \"It's hard to smoothly hop on to a work-related Zoom call right after dealing with a demanding situation with kids at home. Likewise, it's hard to leave behind the stresses and mental worries of work-related Zoom call and instantly switch to being a loving and caring partner or spouse.\"\n Ilona Alcock, another faithful fake commuter, and her husband shifted from train rides and walks to enjoying strolls to \"create a split between home and work.\"\n \"The fake commutes were an absolute lifeline for myself and my husband,\" added Alcock, cofounder of business development consultancy Elevate Greater Manchester in England. \"They gave me a reason to get out of bed at the same time each morning and set me up for a more productive, active day. Walking outside has a massive positive impact on my mental health.\"\n For several months now, the practice has been a way for Alcock to start her day with fresh air, green spaces and time to learn. \"It has a positive impact on my whole day and I often have my best ideas during these walks,\" she said.\n Kanter's fake commutes have been a meditational respite as well. She has found a way to \"be in the moment and observe, which I know is another technique for getting through trauma,\" Kanter said. \"It brought down the stress levels and the fear and the negative thinking, and improved (my) concentration.\"\n Nick Shepherd, a business development executive in Stockport, England, has been waking up earlier to \"go for a wander and see the world wake up\" since October. \"I think people (think) that it's nice to just wake up straight from your bed and go straight to your desk to work for the day,\" he added, \"but it makes such a difference having that time before work to yourself.\"\n Joseph Neville, an accountant and county councilor in Kildare, Ireland, also missed that distinction \u2014 so instead of spending up to 40 minutes in a car or train, a 40-minute walk helps him improve clarity of thought.\n No commute meant that Louise Sharp was increasingly logging in to her laptop earlier and finishing later. An 8-kilometer (nearly 5-mile) walk helped her process her responsibilities, improve her mood and become motivated and more aware.\n \"Spending too much time in front of a screen and with no likely return to the office, I knew I had to do something,\" said Sharp, a whole family practitioner in Warrington, Cheshire, England.\n Starting your own fake commute can be as simple as walking, running or biking for around the same time or mileage that your former trip took. Some people drive to their office building, stay in the car, then return home in time to start work. \"People who segment do have better work-life balances,\" said Kristen Shockley, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Georgia.\n Whichever substitute you choose, a key is to \"make it a habit and prepare the night ahead,\" Alcock said. Adding a social aspect could make the habit more enjoyable and sustainable. Kanter recruited her husband and declared their commute a \"no-COVID discussion zone,\" she said via email. Alcock has found that the morning chats with her husband help keep their \"relationship strong throughout the pandemic.\"\n Since some people's homes are masquerading as offices, just having your laptop in sight can be stressful. Separate yourself from work by also shifting your area, Bufka said, perhaps by putting away your laptop and shelving notebooks.\n \"Depending on what people really appreciate about the notion of transition and figuring out what kind of time they might need,\" Bufka added, \"plan on that.\" That transition could be spending time alone or simply changing clothes.\n In addition to the benefits for mental health and work-life balance, fake commutes could improve your physical health. Before the pandemic, Kanter learned that her cholesterol was high \u2014 but when she had a follow-up appointment with her doctor months later, her cholesterol had normalized.\n Walking and other forms of exercise can help to reduce problems with stress, mental health and sleep, research has shown. Physical activity can also boost your immunity and respiratory health, which are critical factors in how a person fares if infected with coronavirus.\n \"There's some opportunities here to build some new habits or new structures into our day-to-day lives that will serve us well,\" Bufka said, \"whether there's a pandemic or not.\"",

        "body_text": "Facebook posts promoting violence during inauguration week have circulated on the platform over the past week despite a crackdown by the social media giant since the January 6 insurrection, a tech watchdog group found.\n \"Patriots January 20, 2021 is your Tiananmen Square moment!!!\" one post in a private pro-Trump Facebook group read.\n \"We need to organize our militia... Wars are won with guns.. and when they silence your commander in chief you are in a war,\" read another posted on January 9 to a public \"Patriot Party\" group with over 12 thousand members.\n Other posts include people openly asking for details about joining a militia.\n The posts were identified by the Tech Transparency Project (TPP), a nonprofit watchdog group.\n Facebook removed the post referencing Tiananmen Square after being contacted by CNN.\n \"This post violated our Coordinating Harm policy and has been removed but important to note that it violated one of our policies that require more context and can't always be applied at scale. These policies often require specialized teams to gather more information on a given issue in order to make decisions,\" a Facebook spokesperson said.\n The spokesperson added, \"once you shared the post, our teams started to review, they brought in specialists from our Content Policy team and ultimately determined that in the context it was shared, it violated a section of our Coordinating Harm policy that requires additional teams/context to determine, and was removed.\"\n Facebook said on Sunday that the \"Patriot Party\" group where the post referencing organizing a militia appeared had been \"proactively detected by our teams\" and was being removed. Facebook said on Monday that it had removed the group.\n The posts highlight the challenge the tech giant faces in cracking down on domestic calls for violence.\n \"Facebook is proving it is not willing or capable of effectively moderating its platform and has become a danger to the public and to democracy,\" Katie Paul, director of TTP, told CNN Sunday night.\n TPP told CNN it found the posts by using a Facebook account to join far-right groups.\n TPP last week said it found evidence that Facebook was allowing ads for weapon accessories, body armor, and other military gear to be run on its platform targeted at users who have shown interest in far-right and militia groups.\n Facebook announced Saturday it would stop accepting US ads for weapon accessories and protective equipment through at least Jan. 22.\n A Facebook spokesperson told CNN last week that the company removed pages and groups representing militarized social movements and is continuing to take those pages down.\n Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg last week appeared to downplay the role her company had in the insurrection saying most of the organizing had occurred on other platforms.\n \"Our enforcement is never perfect, so I'm sure there were still things on Facebook,\" Sandberg told Reuters in an interview. Then she added: \"I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don't have our abilities to stop hate and don't have our standards and don't have our transparency.\"\n A \"Stop The Steal\" Facebook group promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was rigged gained hundreds of thousands of members during election week before Facebook shut it down.\n The company only entirely banned content containing the phrase \"stop the steal\" after the insurrection.\n But some of the groups and individuals spreading the conspiracy theory have sought to evade Facebook's content moderation systems, either by changing their group names to avoid triggering suspicion or by using other app functions to hide in plain sight, according to watchdog group Avaaz.\n As recently as last week, Avaaz highlighted 90 public and private groups on Facebook dedicated to spreading false election fraud claims, and a half-dozen that had tried to circumvent Facebook's crackdown on \"stop the steal\" content. Since the groups were brought to its attention, Facebook has removed nine, Avaaz told CNN this week.\n \"We work with experts in global terrorism and cyber intelligence to identify calls for violence and remove harmful content that could lead to further violence,\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone told CNN. \"We are continuing all of these efforts and working with law enforcement to prevent direct threats to public safety.\"\n Conspiracy theorists have also used Facebook product Instagram Stories to share debunked claims, Avaaz said. Instagram Stories are programmed to disappear after 24 hours, allowing misinformation peddlers to spread their messages to thousands before their content can be identified and caught.",

        "body_text": "As Indonesia continues to count the number of dead from last week's earthquake on Sulawesi island, search and rescue teams are being stretched to breaking point, as they grapple with a series of disasters unfolding across the country.\n Flooding in South Kalimantan has killed more than a dozen people and displaced tens of thousands. Rescue workers are still looking for several missing and feared buried under the mud 10 days after landslides tore through a village in West Java. And divers continue to search for victims and crucial data in the wreckage of Sriwijaya Air flight 182, which crashed in the Java Sea on January 9, with 62 people on board.\n Meanwhile, two volcanoes on the most populous island, Java, are spewing ash into the air, with hundreds of people evacuated from the slopes of Mount Merapi in recent weeks.\n The string of grim events comes just a few weeks into 2021 and at a time when Indonesia is reporting record daily increases of Covid-19 cases while it embarks on a mass vaccination program.\n On Sunday, the death toll from a 6.2-magnitude earthquake on Indonesia's Sulawesi island rose to 84, as rescue workers continued the search for survivors trapped in rubble while aftershocks rattled the island.\n Seventy-three people died in Friday's quake in the city of Mamuju, to the north of the epicenter, while another 11 were killed in Majene, a city about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mamuju. Thousands of residents fled their homes to seek safety, but many are still trapped under collapsed buildings, according to local search and rescue teams.\n At least 253 people were seriously hurt and another 679 suffered minor injuries, said Raditya Jati, from Indonesia's National Board for Disaster Management. The quake also triggered a power outage and caused three landslides along the main road connecting Majene and Mamuju.\n The quake has created an additional headache for a nation already battling a serious coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia has reported at least 907,929 Covid-19 cases and nearly 26,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n The head of Indonesia's disaster management agency, Doni Monardo, said Sunday that rapid antigen test kits were being provided to evacuation centers to check and trace for potential Covid-19 transmission among the 19,435 people displaced by the earthquake.\n \"Later there will be an antigen swab process, to ensure that refugees are not exposed to Covid-19,\" Doni said. He added that displacement centers have been asked to separate vulnerable groups from young people to prevent the virus spreading.\n Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency cautioned that aftershocks could still occur and urged those living in hilly areas to be aware of landslides. People living near the coast were also warned to stay away from the beach in case of tsunamis.\n Meanwhile, rescue teams were continuing to free people trapped under collapsed buildings in multiple locations across Mamuju -- including two hotels and a hospital. \"People are reporting that their family members are trapped under collapsed houses and asking for our help,\" Ariyanto Ardi, section head of the local disaster management department, told CNN on Saturday.\n \"We still have no details how many people are buried under those flattened buildings,\" he added.\n Straddling the so-called Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" Indonesia -- a nation of high tectonic activity -- is regularly hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2018, a 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands of people.\n Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano, began erupting again on January 4. Since then, 500 people living on or close to its fertile slopes have been evacuated, according to the local Disaster Management of Magelang District.\n On Monday, Merapi continued to spew lava as hot clouds and ash rose 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) into the air, according to the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation. The agency said six lava flows could be seen, descending 600 meters down its southwestern slope.\n Also on Java Island, Indonesia's highest volcano Mount Semeru began spewing lava, ash and smoke on Saturday.\n Floods brought on by heavy rain in South Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo this week have killed at least 15 people and displaced more than 100,000.\n Waters as high as 1.5 meters (5 feet) inundated more than 20,000 homes across 10 districts in the province, according to Raditya from the disaster management agency.\n Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the flood-hit areas on Monday as rescue teams distributed aid including food, tarpaulins and blankets, to those in need.\n Separately, at least six people were killed in flooding and landslides in Manado City, in North Sulawesi on Saturday.\n The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency warned that more rain could follow, saying the region was in the middle of the rainy season, which will last until February.\n Meanwhile, rescue workers continue to search through mud and debris for victims 10 days after a landslide, brought on by heavy rains and unstable soil conditions, tore through Cihanjuang village in West Java province. On Monday, four bodies were pulled from the mud, raising the death toll to 33. Rescue workers are searching for four people still missing, according to the West Java Search and Rescue Agency.\n Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands, often suffers floods and landslides, particularly during the rainy season from November to March. In December 2019 and January 2020, severe flooding in Jakarta triggered by the worst rainfall on record, left swaths of the capital underwater and affected more than 400,000 people.\n Experts have voiced concern that such extreme weather could become a new norm due to the climate crisis.\n In another disaster that rocked the Southeast Asian nation, divers continue their search of the wreckage of Sriwijaya Air flight 182 while authorities push on in their investigation into the cause of the crash.\n On Friday, search teams located the plane's cockpit voice recorder but the memory unit was not with the case, Soerjanto Tjahjono, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee, told CNN.\n Despite the missing crash memory unit, Soerjanto said they believed they would still be able to retrieve data.\n Also on Friday, the committee successfully downloaded information contained in the recovered flight data recorder, which was found by divers and a remotely operated underwater vehicle last week.\n \"There are 330 parameters and all are in good condition. We are currently studying it,\" Soerjanto said.\n The findings from the flight data recorder data have so far confirmed earlier reports that the two engines were still operating when the plane hit the water.\n Efforts to find and identify those who perished on board also continue. On Sunday, divers retrieved 10 bags of human remains as well as pieces and debris from the plane itself.\n Masrur Jamaluddin reported from Jakarta, Helen Regan wrote from Hong Kong.

        "body_text": "Mars is about to be a very busy place when three separate missions arrive at the red planet in February.\n One of those missions includes NASA's Perseverance rover. When it lands, we'll be able to hear the sounds of Mars for the first time, thanks to microphones riding on the rover.\n A new interactive experience shared by the agency will prepare our ears for a key difference in the sounds of Mars: the atmosphere. The thin Martian atmosphere has only 1% of the density that we experience of Earth's atmosphere at the surface. It also has a different atmospheric composition. Mars is also much colder than Earth. All of these factors will affect sound on Mars, even though the differences may be subtle.\n The NASA interactive compares sounds as we hear them on Earth versus how they may sound on Mars, like birds chirping or music. If you were speaking on Mars, your voice would sound more muffled and it would take longer for others to hear you.\n So what will we be able to hear on Mars? The microphones are expected to pick up the sounds of the rover landing and working on Mars, as well as ambient noises like wind. One of the microphones is located on top of the rover's mast, so it can pick up natural sounds and even activity by the rover -- like when the rover's laser zaps rock samples and turns them into plasma to learn more about their composition.\n \"It is stunning all the science we can get with an instrument as simple as a microphone on Mars,\" said Baptiste Chide, a postdoctoral researcher in planetary science at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a contributor to the SuperCam microphone, in a statement.\n The other microphone will listen for the sound of pyrotechnic devices that deploy the parachutes during landing and the rover's wheels moving over the Martian surface.\n \"Recording audible sounds on Mars is a unique experience,\" Chide said. \"With the microphones onboard Perseverance, we will add a fifth sense to Mars exploration. It will open a new area of science investigation for both the atmosphere and the surface.\"\n The Perseverance rover, tasked with the mission of hunting for signs of ancient life, and the Ingenuity helicopter, which will be the first to fly on another planet, are due to land on Mars on February 18.\n That doesn't mean the planet hasn't been buzzing with activity from the robotic explorers NASA has sent to Mars in recent years.\n The Curiosity rover is still going strong and has been investigating Mars since it landed in 2012 -- and it has been 3,000 Martian days since Curiosity touched down on the red planet.\n Curiosity has gradually climbed Mount Sharp, a mountain that stretches 3 miles up in the center of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater.\n To celebrate 3,000 days on Mars, Curiosity took one of its famed panoramas. Geologists on the mission team were excited to see rocks that look like benches as Curiosity continues its ascent.\n The panorama includes 122 individual images that were captured on November 18.\n The center of the panorama shows the floor of Gale Crater, and its northern rim is on the horizon. The upper layer of Mount Sharp can be seen to the right.\n These benchlike stones form as softer rock layers erode on slopes, leaving behind harder clifflike layers of rock.\n \"Our science team is excited to figure out how they formed and what they mean for the ancient environment within Gale,\" said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist, in a statement.\n The InSight mission, which landed on Mars in 2018, has been extended for another two years and is expected to operate through December 2022, according to a NASA announcement.\n Since InSight began investigating Mars, the mission team members have learned more about the planet's crust and mantle. They have identified a number of Marsquakes and established that Mars is seismically active.\n The scientists have also learned more about the Martian atmosphere, magnetic field and the interior structure of the planet.\n During the extended mission, InSight will track seismic activity on Mars and study Martian weather.\n One thing that won't be moving on, however, is the seemingly doomed \"mole,\" or InSight's heat probe. The probe was intended to bury itself beneath the Martian surface and take the internal temperature of Mars to better understand the heating behind the evolution of the planet.\n Martian soil has a tendency to clump, which has proven to be an obstacle to the mole as it has tried to bury itself since February 2019. Simply put, there isn't enough friction for the mole to hammer itself further down than the 3 centimeters it has reached. Even tapping it with a scoop, located on InSight's robotic arm, didn't help.\n \"We've given it everything we've got, but Mars and our heroic mole remain incompatible,\" said Tilman Spohn, principal investigator of the instrument, in a statement. \"Fortunately, we've learned a lot that will benefit future missions that attempt to dig into the subsurface.\"\n This is the first time a mission attempted burrowing beneath the soil on Mars. However, the knowledge gained from this attempt will inform future designs -- especially for astronauts that may have to one day dig through Martian soil or instruments that search for subsurface life.\n \"We are so proud of our team who worked hard to get InSight's mole deeper into the planet. It was amazing to see them troubleshoot from millions of miles away,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. \"This is why we take risks at NASA -- we have to push the limits of technology to learn what works and what doesn't.\"",

And there's still more to be cleaned; the team is planning another event in April and aims to collect 100,000 pounds of trash from the river by the end of the year.\n The Tennessee River, a 652-mile tributary of the Ohio River, is notoriously polluted. In 2019, researchers said the river was more like a river of plastic, according to CNN affiliate WVLT, possibly with more broken down bits of plastic than any other river in the world.\n \"In terms of the other types of pollution, pharmaceuticals, heavy metal, the Tennessee River really isn't so bad,\" Michelle Campanis, University of Tennessee Arboretum education coordinator, told WVLT. \"The microplastics are astronomically higher than any other river they've studied.\"",

        "title": "HBCU graduates continue to write the story of America",
        "body_text": "Bakari Sellers is a former Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and a CNN commentator. He is the author of the book \"My Vanishing Country\" and an attorney at Strom Law. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nAmerica is struggling with a complicated set of challenges, raised up and laid bare during the Trump years. Tackling them requires a new generation of leadership that is morally grounded and invested in the plight of the communities that are incessantly ignored. Fortunately, an incoming cadre of leaders, educated and shaped by historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), are positioned as the change agents our nation needs.\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is a Howard University alumna. US Sen.-elect Rev. Ralph Warnock (D-GA) is a Morehouse man. Stacey Abrams, the woman who helped make Warnock's victory possible, is a Spelman woman. Incoming Congressional Black Caucus Chair Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH) graduated from Central State University. And the formidable Rep.-elect Cori Bush (D-MO) attended Harris-Stowe State University.\n HBCUs, which produce nearly 20% of the nation's Black college graduates, have mastered the art of transforming young people into servant leaders for their race and the world. Now they are transforming Washington, DC -- and our nation is better for it.\n From the moment I stepped foot on the campus of Morehouse College, I knew I was someplace special. There was history everywhere you looked -- from the ageless dorms and classrooms to the majestic statues of Black men situated across the campus. The fact that a school founded in 1867 to teach the children of former enslaved people to read and write would emerge as one of the most prestigious, private, all-male educational institutions in the nation is nothing short of a miracle.\n HBCUs like Morehouse have a legacy of producing men and women who excel in every field of human endeavor imaginable. These graduates are prepared to enter the workforce with the knowledge necessary to change the world: a heightened value for education, belief in human dignity and desire to combat racial inequality. This noble mission continues to ring true today.\n As a 16-year-old country boy entering college, I quickly realized that Downtown Atlanta was a stark contrast from my hometown of Denmark, South Carolina. But Morehouse offered a nurturing environment where faculty and staff looked like me and were inimitably invested in my development as a Black man.\n While society might write me off for the color of my skin, my HBCU embraced me for who I was. When I doubted myself, they placed a crown above my head and challenged me to grow tall enough to wear it. My HBCU saw the best in me and others like me, producing generations of leaders who continue to see the best in others and our democracy.\n Though HBCUs are under-resourced, 25% of the nation's Black college graduates in the crucial STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics have been educated in these institutions.\n HBCUs also have made a profound impact on helping countless first-generation students avoid the peril of generational poverty. Statistically, 70% of HBCU students who are federal Pell Grant-eligible go on to surpass that $50,000 family income threshold just six years after graduation. This achievement is mostly possible because HBCUs believe that every student has potential and is worth fighting for.\n It will take time for our nation to process the violent images of White supremacists storming the US Capitol and National Guard troops mount in congressional hallways in preparation for another racially fueled attack. Our nation stands at yet another crossroads, however, we stand at this pivotal juncture on the broad shoulders of HBCU graduates and civil rights leaders like Medgar Evers (Alcorn State), Rosa Parks (Alabama State), Stokely Carmichael (Howard), Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Morehouse), and countless others who helped write the story of America through their dedication to the civil rights movement.\n Indeed, we must pick up where the brave men and women before us left off. And there is no better way to move forward than with HBCU grad Yogananda Pittman (Morgan State), recently named as the acting US Capitol police chief, and a host of HBCU alumni proudly serving in the Congressional Black Caucus.\n Today, the American story continues to be composed by HBCU graduates and the values of service and community that are taught and exemplified in those schools. And after January 20, this transcription will take place in the White House and halls of Congress.\n Every American citizen should be thankful.",

Police are still searching for the thief, according to Henderson.\n The suspect is described as a White male with long, dark brown braided hair. He wore a multi-colored face mask.\n Anyone with information on the car theft can contact Beaverton police at 503-629-0111.\n \"This is a good learning lesson for all of us who have children,\" Henderson said. \"Be extra careful with your kids, take the extra step to make sure they're safe.\"",

The witness initially deleted the photo but was able to recover it, according to the complaint.\n The complaint also describes a video Fee allegedly sent to a witness that shows numerous people inside the Capitol rotunda \"who do not appear to have authorization to be present,\" yelling the words \"tyranny\" and \"Pelosi.\"\n Fee allegedly texted the witness that he was \"at the tip of the spear,\" after sending the video, according to the complaint.\n Fee has not yet been arrested, according to federal prosecutors in New York. CNN has reached out to Fee for comment.\n The charge adds to a growing list of charges brought against participants in the riot earlier this month, which left five people dead and set off a firestorm in the nation's capital. Prosecutors in Washington, DC, have already charged about 100 people related to the riot, and there are more than 275 open investigations into potential criminal activity on that day, acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said on Friday.\n Dwyer said in a statement to CNN that the FDNY has been cooperating with law enforcement investigations into allegations of possible active or retired members' involvement with the riot.\n \"The Department received anonymous allegations that active or retired members were present at the events at the United States Capitol on January 6 and, as required, has provided that information to the FBI,\" Dwyer said in the statement.\n FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a separate statement last week that while his department \"respects the right of all members to take and personally support social and political positions,\" that members \"must act with the utmost discretion and respect for others,\" and ensure that they are in compliance with laws.\n \"Department members, whether active or retired, must not engage in conduct that tends to bring the Department into disrepute, or is disruptive to the discipline and good order of the Department,\" the statement read.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Marvel, like 'WandaVision,' looks to the future while holding on to the past",
        "body_text": "With its opening episodes, Marvel's \"WandaVision\" has turned out to be a pretty good symbol of the crossroads at which Disney's pop-culture titan finds itself: Trying to move forward without letting go of the past.\n Perhaps that's why the Marvel rumor mill has been spinning faster than usual of late. A Deadline story about Chris Evans possibly reprising the role of Captain America here, speculation about Michael B. Jordan returning to the \"Black Panther\" sequel there.\n Death isn't always the impediment for comic-book characters that it represents for ordinary mortals, and the concept of alternate timelines surely helps. \"WandaVision\" distills that into a show that's all about being somehow imprisoned in the past, as the title characters reside in the black-and-white glow of old sitcoms.\n The fact that familiar names keep being floated for additional appearances that will require serious explanation offers further evidence that Marvel faces some tough choices as it forges ahead after the operatic high of \"Avengers: Endgame.\"\n Marvel was supposed to begin turning the page from \"Avengers\" to the next phase of its grand plans in 2020. There was the \"Black Widow\" prequel, and another one of those bold new offshoots with \"The Eternals,\" a lesser-known title that the company hoped would become an unlikely hit a la \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\"\n The timetable for those carefully charted releases has been complicated by the fallout from a pandemic that has closed and hobbled theaters, delaying movies that were going to begin Marvel's merry march into the future. The theatrical setback has also focused attention on the studio's efforts for Disney+, with \"WandaVision\" launching a parade of series for the streaming service.\n Having established one of the industry's most powerful brands, Marvel appeared ready to tackle the challenge of losing Iron Man and Captain America, as played by Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans, respectively, two of the heroes upon which its cinematic universe was meticulously built.\n Marvel was also dealt a terrible and unexpected blow with the tragic death of Chadwick Boseman. The \"Black Panther\" sequel will go forward but without its star, after Marvel chief Kevin Feige announced that the studio wouldn't recast the role.\n Streaming TV represents a top priority for Disney and Marvel, which didn't enjoy the same level of success in their previous TV ventures that they did with their almost unparalleled track record in movies.\n The savvy solution to that was to shift from projects like \"Marvel's Agents of SHIELD\" and the gritty Netflix dramas that began with \"Daredevil\" to Disney+ titles that draw directly upon familiar faces from the Marvel films, including the upcoming \"Loki\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.\"\n From a broader perspective, though, you don't necessarily move on from signature heroes and hugely popular actors easily. That might explain the temptation to try sustaining key franchises in some fashion, even if it means retreating from what seemed to be the end of certain storylines and characters.\n The rumors hinting at those kind of moves, it's worth noting, are good for business. If nothing else, they keep fans engaged and talking about the Marvel universe, as they wait for something like \"Black Widow\" to see the light of day.\n Marvel still possesses an enviable tool chest, and its \"universe\" is bigger than any single hero; still, in an entertainment business that's all about replicating success, nobody relishes retiring proven hits.\n As the buzz surrounding \"WandaVision\" suggests, Marvel commands inordinate loyalty, and the studio's future -- both streaming and theatrically -- looks plenty bright. But like the show's protagonist, getting there might require, at least for a while, clinging a little tighter to the good old days.",

Employees told the inspector general they were \"under significant pressure to produce this technical report\" and that they were \"concerned that incomplete data could be misinterpreted, misused, or otherwise tarnish the Bureau's reputation.\"\n After the effort was publicly revealed, Dillingham told the inspector general he would reverse course.\n But the incident prompted a federal judge hearing a lawsuit over the apportionment issue to order the Trump administration not finalize the count in its remaining days in office.\n The Democratic chairwoman of the House Oversight committee, which has been probing the Trump administration's handling of the decennial population count, on Friday called on Dillingham to resign.\n Dillingham wrote that he \"received requests to continue serving during and after the transition, including from a President-Elect Biden transition official,\" although he did not specify whether that official who apparently made that request knew of the last-minute non-citizen directive.",

        "body_text": "Two young men work side-by-side in a butcher's shop. They live in the same teeming and densely packed town. One is fortunate -- he's eligible to get an Israeli Covid-19 vaccination. The other isn't.\n Both are Palestinian residents of Kafr 'Aqab, a finger of territory that under Israeli law is part of greater Jerusalem, but under international law is considered illegally annexed territory, following its capture from Jordan in 1967.\n It's also walled off from Jerusalem by Israel's gigantic concrete security wall. Jewish Israelis rarely come here, except in uniform to conduct military raids.\n Mahmoud Oudeh, like thousands of other residents of the town, has a Palestinian identity document. His friend Anan abu Aishe has an Israeli ID, which defines him as a permanent resident of east Jerusalem. This entitles him to join Israel's world-leading vaccination campaign, which is on course to meet the government's target of inoculating the entire country by the end of March.\n But at least 4.5 million Palestinians living on the West Bank and in Gaza are being left behind. So far none have had the injections, and most are unlikely to get them any time soon -- because there is no Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the Palestinian territories.\n So, if Anan gets the vaccine and continues alongside his friend, slicing and selling meat from the goat and cow carcasses swinging from hooks in the shop, he says he'd feel guilty.\n \"Half of the people here cannot take it so I'm also not going to take it, why would I take it when they cannot? I won't,\" he told CNN.\n \"It's racist,\" Mahmoud added.\n According to United Nations experts, a policy of immunization that differentiates between those with Israeli IDs, and those without, is \"unacceptable.\"\n The UN expert report says that Israel is the occupying power in and over Gaza and the West Bank, and has been since 1967, and is thereby ultimately responsible for the healthcare of those living under occupation.\n According to the experts' report, published by the UN's Office High Commissioner for Human Rights, Israel should extend its vaccination campaign to all Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\n \"The experts said that as the occupying power, Israel is required under the Fourth Geneva Convention, 'to the fullest extent of the means available to it', to maintain health services in the occupied territory. Article 56 requires Israel to adopt and apply 'the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics' in cooperation with national and local authorities,\" the human rights body said in a statement.\n The experts also said: \"4.5 million Palestinians will remain unprotected and exposed to Covid-19, while Israeli citizens living near and among them -- including the Israeli settler population -- will be vaccinated. Morally and legally, this differential access to necessary health care in the midst of the worst global health crisis in a century is unacceptable.\"\n But as Israel's vaccination campaign climbs past 20% of the Israeli population (including east Jerusalem residents), this is not a characterization that Israeli health minister Yuli Edelstein accepts.\n \"Our calculation was based on Israeli citizens. If we'll get to the situation where everyone in the country who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated, we will be more than ready to share the vaccines with our neighbors,\" Edelstein told CNN.\n \"At this stage we are talking about Israeli citizens ... I haven't heard of any obligation of Israel to pay for the vaccines for someone else.\"\n Israel's government points to the Oslo accords, signed in the mid-1990s with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Included in the first of those agreements is a clause that hands responsibility to the PA for the health of all Palestinians under its civil administration.\n Experts admit it is not a straightforward task trying to navigate between the responsibilities assigned by Oslo, which was not a final status agreement, and the duties laid out under the Geneva Conventions.\n In his interview with CNN, Edelstein couched the decision in terms of interests rather than obligations.\n \"At this stage we are not supplying vaccines, but we do understand that it is in Israel's interest to make sure we don't get into a situation where we are vaccinated and then out of this trouble, and on the Palestinian side there is another surge in numbers,\" added Edelstein.\n The rate at which people with confirmed Covid-19 in the Palestinian territories and east Jerusalem are dying (1.1%) is higher than Israel (0.7%), but substantially lower than the rates in the United States (1.7%) and the United Kingdom (2.6%), according to the World Health Organization.\n The PA Health Minister, Dr. Mai Al-Kaileh, says they expect to get hold of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of March, but that there is no specific date set yet for their arrival. The Ministry says it has contracted with four companies producing the vaccine. These vaccines will cover 70% of the Palestinian population and the World Health Organization will provide the Ministry with 20%,\" the PA said in a January 9 statement.\n In Ramallah's Public Central Hospital, medics work around the clock treating coronavirus patients in a Covid-only intensive care unit. Just as in many other hospitals around the world, non-specialist staff have been drafted in to help cope with the pandemic. But after a prolonged lockdown, admissions are falling and on the day CNN visits, the ICU unit isn't full.\n Dr. Wafa Shihadeh, a resident general surgeon, has been working on the Covid-19 wards for months. He says he's seen many of his colleagues succumb to infection and spread it to their families.\n \"We are starting to feel depressed because we're not getting the vaccines here in the Palestinian territories,\" he said. \"And on the other side of the border, Israel ... I think as of three days ago about 1,600,000 people had been vaccinated, and here in Palestine the number of vaccinated people is zero.\"\n Abeer Salman contributed to this report.",

Whether you've been trying to adapt to working remotely, struggling to balance your kids' online schooling with your daily workload, or just having a harder time focusing with everything else that's going on in the world, it's more critical than ever to have some idea of expectations and priorities.\n \"It's pretty important to know what your boss is thinking when working remotely and under different circumstances,\" McIntyre said.\n So even if your manager isn't keen on doing a review, she recommended still asking for a meeting to look back at the year and set goals for 2021.\n Here's how to navigate your performance review in the middle of a pandemic.\n A performance review should be a two-way conversation, so come prepared with a list of your top accomplishments, new goals and any pain points or requests you would like to discuss.\n There can be a recency effect when it comes to achievements, so take the time to review the entire year, including pre-pandemic work that might have been overlooked.\n \"The onus is on an employee to articulate results, not your manager,\" said Jane Scudder, a leadership and executive coach. \"Even the very best managers can't stay plugged in to everyone's results.\"\n Have three success stories at the ready to talk about, recommended career coach Hallie Crawford. \"Have the story of why it was successful and what you did to contribute to it, and three areas that you want to improve or get back on track with, along with goals you want to achieve in the coming year.\"\n Negative feedback is hard to hear. But try not to get defensive and keep an open mind.\n The key is focusing on the future when discussing negative feedback.\n For instance, if your boss brings up a project that was three weeks late, McIntyre suggested saying that you understand why that is a concern and what you could do differently in the future. Or have a plan on how you will avoid missing a deadline again.\n Working remotely brings a unique set of challenges. And sometimes, the problem is your boss. Maybe you don't have a clear sense of priorities and communication is lacking.\n For instance, if the problem is you need more communication with your boss, Crawford suggests saying something like: \"If we could have a few more meetings, that would help me be more effective.\"\n Many employees are working under less-than-ideal situations when working remotely these days, which could affect their work or require flexibility when it comes to scheduling.\n But just how candid can you be with your boss?\n \"You don't want to raise concerns about your ability to do the job,\" said McIntyre. \"What you do want to do is let them know of any unusual or difficult circumstances.\"\n When approaching the subject, focus on the positive. For instance, starting later in the day once the kids are set with distanced learning and working later into the evening will make you a more effective employee.\n \"In my book, it is better to overcommunicate those needs...\" said Crawford. But she advised not to start the conversation off with any pain points.\n \"I wouldn't say them at the beginning, [do so] closer to the middle or end of conversation,\" she said.",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 18 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\nIrony is dead at Trump's State Department.\n In a statement on Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's spokeswoman praised Ugandans for braving \"an environment of intimidation and fear\" to cast votes in national elections. \"We are gravely concerned by harassment of and continued threats to civil society,\" Morgan Ortagus added, bemoaning reports of election irregularities and violence. \"We urge all parties to reject violence and to use constitutional and legal means to address complaints.\"\n For most of the last 80 years, this would be a pretty standard statement consistent with America's self-appointed role as a guardian of global democratic norms. But it's awfully bold after the US President himself tried to steal an election he clearly lost and then incited a mob's attack on Congress. US moral authority has been gutted -- but credibility doesn't seem to be a priority for the Pompeo team boasting about renewed American \"swagger.\"\n President-elect Joe Biden's team is well aware of America's shredded reputation overseas and plans to convince the world that \"America is back\" as soon as he's sworn in on Wednesday. (Notably it was incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan who reacted first to the detention of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, tweeting Sunday that \"the Kremlin's attacks on Mr. Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard.\" Pompeo chimed in on Twitter about four hours later.)\n But restoring American clout is not like flipping a switch: Many US partners aren't sure Trumpism is gone for good. Shortly after winning the leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party this weekend, Armin Laschet, warned, \"Trust is what keeps us going and what has been broken in America. By polarizing, sowing discord and distrust, and systematically lying, a president has destroyed stability and trust.\"\n In nations historically indebted to the US for the preservation or restoration of their own freedoms, leaders used to cite Washington as a guiding light. Now the US is a case study in how democracy can die.\n The Trump White House is packing up to leave, and staff are taking their mementos with them. Above, Trade advisor Peter Navarro -- an extreme China hawk who invented a fictional economics expert to bolster his arguments -- was spotted exiting the West Wing last week with a framed photograph of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the 2018 G20.\n For someone who has long since given up caring about his job, Trump sure put up a pitched fight to keep it.\n Of course, losing Air Force One will suck. No Marine band plays when an ex-POTUS walks into a room, even in gilded Florida exile. And the former reality show host has always been desperate not to seem like a loser. But he didn't try to destroy democracy this year just out of personal pique -- post-presidential life is likely to be especially uncomfortable for Trump because his company is a massive branding exercise. And when the name on the front of the building represents an international pariah, that's a problem.\n That's what led the PGA of America to pull its 2022 major championship away from a Trump golf course in New Jersey. In another incalculable personal and financial blow to Trump, the PGA's global counterpart the R&A won't send its Open Championship to his Turnberry resort in Scotland. The President's hospitality properties  \u2014 often financed by massive lending \u2014 were already struggling amid the pandemic. Now, banks, financiers and management firms are cutting him loose. Plus, the President has a $300 million loan payment looming in a couple of years. And while he has millions of followers, most Americans can't afford the luxuries offered by Trump hotels, exclusive clubs and condos.\n The Trump Organization does have some valuable assets. And the President wriggled out of financial disasters before, with the aggressive use of the bankruptcy laws and the courts. But Trump has more to worry about than money. He's facing multiple legal challenges relating to his own personal conduct and the way he ran his businesses. There's possible legal exposure from his inciting of the insurrection on the Capitol and attempt to steal the election in Georgia, not to mention his coming impeachment trial.\n Trump may be about to lose the two privileges of office that were perhaps most valuable to him \u2014 using the presidency to pitch resorts and hotels, and a Justice Department policy that considers sitting Presidents immune from indictment.",

        "title": "'The lost years': Climate damage that occurred on Trump's watch will endure long after he is gone",
        "body_text": "For four years, President Donald Trump has careened from one crisis to the next, many of his own making.\n Still, through the Mueller investigation, two impeachments, the deadliest pandemic in a century, and even a failed and dangerous attempt to overturn his own election defeat, Trump and his administration remained steadfast in at least one quest: to weaken many of the country's bedrock climate and environmental guardrails.\n Considered in the course of humanity -- or the 4.5-billion-year history of this planet -- a single presidential term is barely a blink of an eye.\n But in just four years, Trump has cemented a legacy -- particularly on climate change -- that will be felt by generations to come.\n \"It's pretty much been an unequivocal disaster,\" said Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who was EPA administrator under President George W. Bush. \"To just roll back [regulations] whole cloth because they came from a previous administration has made no sense, and really what's happening is that they're putting the health of Americans and the health of our environment in jeopardy.\n \"The mission [of the EPA] is to protect human health and the environment \u2014 pretty simple and pretty straightforward,\" Todd Whitman added. \"It seems to me they've totally ignored the mission.\"\n Much of the environmental protections that Trump dismantled can be rebuilt by the incoming Biden administration, experts say.\n However, doing so will take time. And in the case of global warming, the hour has grown late to stop the worst effects.\n The most lasting part of Trump's climate legacy -- and one that cannot be undone -- may be the time the administration wasted in the face of a worsening climate crisis, some scientists and experts say.\n \"I'm kind of hopeful that many of the worst and most damaging climate policies are capable of being reversed,\" said Kim Cobb, a professor and climate scientist at Georgia Tech's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \"But the lost years in terms of progress on emissions reductions we can't ever take back, and that is something that will have a finite impact on coming climate change impacts.\"\n Trump's deregulatory crusade began with his first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who had sued the agency a dozen times over environmental protections before being tabbed to lead it.\n After he resigned in the face of multiple ethics scandals, Trump picked a former coal lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, to take his place.\n Pruitt and Wheeler -- in parallel with the Interior Department and the Department of Energy -- have worked to complete dozens of industry rollbacks, gutting regulations on everything from greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to showerhead water efficiency.\n Along the way, fossil fuel interests have applauded Trump's moves, even if he didn't revive America's coal industry as he had promised.\n \"They took industry's wish lists and translated them into agency orders or regulations,\" said Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. \"They were only partially successful because they were so sloppy in following the necessary procedures that they were often slapped down by the courts.\"\n In an interview this week with the Washington Post, Wheeler defended his legacy, saying that on his watch the EPA has \"proven that you can reduce pollution and have cost-effective regulations.\"\n But critics see a willful and costly ignorance of science, one that has colored the administration's response to the world's biggest crises, from the Covid-19 pandemic to climate change.\n \"I think their [policies] are dangerous. That's the bottom line,\" Cobb said. \"I think it's even worse than anti-science.\"\n The Trump administration's pullbacks on climate regulations came at a time when the science has never been clearer on the urgent need for the planet's biggest polluters to make big cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions.\n Preliminary estimates by the private data analytics firm the Rhodium Group show US emissions did plummet by 10% last year, the largest drop since World War II. But experts attribute most of the reduction to the pandemic, which kept many Americans out of their cars and off planes, and expect emissions to rebound as the effects of Covid-19 wane.\n Before the pandemic, US emissions rose in 2018 and then fell by a slim 2.1% in 2019.\n In 2019, the UN warned that to hold global warming below the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, global emissions would need to fall by 7.6% each year from 2020 to 2030.\n Trump's moves also coincided with a seemingly unending rash of extreme weather events, which brought the destruction fueled by global warming to the doorsteps of millions of Americans.\n In Trump's first year in office in 2017, he announced that he planned to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate. That same year, Hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma left behind a wake of death and destruction from Puerto Rico to Texas, a year that saw all disasters in the US cause a record $321 billion in damages.\n In 2020, a record-breaking 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters -- including unprecedented wildfires in the American West -- caused a total of $95 billion in damages across the country.\n Many of those disasters bore the fingerprints of climate change.\n During Trump's presidency, global average temperatures have also continued to climb. The last six years have been the hottest six years ever recorded, with 2020 tying 2016 as the hottest year.\n Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations also climbed to a new high in 2020, reaching levels unseen in millions of years.\n And because of how long greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere, the Trump presidency could influence global warming for years to come.\n When humans burn fossil fuels, it sends heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air, where it accumulates in the atmosphere like a blanket, and can stay to heat the Earth for hundreds of years.\n Some studies have tried to quantify how much of a contribution Trump's regulatory rollbacks will make over time to accelerating global warming.\n One estimate published last year by the Rhodium Group found that the administration's moves to weaken greenhouse gas regulations could add the equivalent of 1.8 gigatons of CO2 to the atmosphere by 2035, equaling nearly one-third of all US emissions in 2019.\n However, there was a bit of good news hidden in the massive Covid-19 relief package that passed last December and which Trump signed.\n Buried in the $900 billion stimulus package were some significant climate legislation which calls for phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons -- a class of super heat-trapping gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners -- and an extension of a carbon capture technology tax credit for industry.\n Over time, analysts say those line items could go a long way toward negating the emissions impact of Trump's rollbacks.\n \"We estimate that this is one of the single biggest climate actions the U.S. has taken in at least in a decade,\" said Kate Larsen, the director of the Rhodium Group's international energy and climate research team. \"When you look at the remaining policy rollbacks that Trump implemented and that will remain standing, these are largely equivalent to making up the damage that the Trump administration has done in terms of regulatory rollbacks.\"\n Still, the long-term impact of Trump's other major climate moves is harder to quantify.\n Chief among those is the US' exit from the Paris Agreement on climate, which was completed last November.\n Leaving Paris marked the second time the US has bailed on an international climate agreement after it led the negotiations. The first exit was from the Kyoto Protocol, a previous climate pact which the US signed during the Clinton administration, only to drop out during George W. Bush's presidency.\n President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris Agreement on Day One of his presidency, but experts say repairing the damage to the country's international standing that was done by Trump abandoning the accord will not be easy.\n \"In one sense, it's easy for President Biden to announce on the first day he's in office that the US will rejoin,\" said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor who served as counselor for energy and climate change in the White House under President Barack Obama. \"The hard part is to put together an ambitious, credible pledge for what the US is prepared to do to meet their Paris Agreement commitments.\"\n Trump's interior department also cleared the way for new fossil fuel extraction on federal lands, including in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), one of the country's largest remaining pristine wildlife areas.\n Though there was ultimately little interest in the rights to drill in ANWR from bidders, experts say it could be difficult for the Biden administration and environmental groups to challenge those leases.\n \"Once the lease has been sold, it creates a property right,\" Gerrard said. \"There will be litigation about whether the leases were validly issued, but if any of them are upheld in court, it becomes more difficult to revoke them.\"\n Throughout the campaign and the transition period, Biden has made it clear that he intends to try and make a complete 180-degree turn on federal climate policy.\n He appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry to a new Cabinet-level position as special climate envoy, where he will have a seat on the National Security Council, and has tapped other Obama administration alums to join his climate team.\n During the presidential campaign, he unveiled a $2 trillion climate plan that calls for the US to reach 100% clean electricity generation by 2035, and make huge investments in green infrastructure, from expanding wind and solar to power generation to building a nationwide electric car-charging network.\n Experts say there is plenty of opportunity for his administration to push through parts of his plan to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions and to inspire action internationally.\n \"Trump took a wrecking ball to the nation's environmental regulations,\" Gerrard said. \"Fortunately, it's not Humpty Dumpty, and most of it can be put back together again.\"\n But the need to reverse moves finalized by his predecessor and the political realities of a razor-thin Democratic Senate majority could hamper Biden's more ambitious climate proposals.\n Some of Trump's rollbacks can be undone with the stroke of a pen or overturned by a simple majority in both houses of Congress through the Congressional Review Act, Gerrard said.\n Others like reinstating or tightening the Obama-era standards on car and truck emissions can be accomplished through EPA rulemaking, but the process takes time -- anywhere from a few months to a year, Gerrard said.\n Youth-led climate action organizations like the Sunrise Movement have indicated that they intend to hold the new administration accountable for delivering on Biden's climate promises.\n And a newly-minted Democratic Senate majority will open the door to some legislative opportunities that wouldn't have been possible in a chamber controlled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n Still, climate policy experts say that the narrow Senate majority will force Biden to find measures that can garner bipartisan support -- like spending on green infrastructure -- in the vein of the climate legislation that passed in the end-of-year Covid-19 stimulus package.\n \"When the Senate is sort of evenly split, the type of progress we're going to make on climate is not going to look like comprehensive climate legislation,\" Larsen said. \"It's going to be these targeted wins on things that can largely get bipartisan support.\"\n But whatever progress Biden's administration is able to make on halting climate change over the next four years, some say the lost time of the last four years will still loom large.\n \"The primary effect is that the new administration will be occupied for its first couple of years with reversing all the damage rather than continuing to make progress,\" said Ted Lamm, a senior research fellow at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at the University of California-Berkeley. \"Particularly in the case of climate change, where we are facing a ticking clock, that lost time is potentially disastrous and harmful.\"",

        "body_text": "California has become the first state in the nation to record more than 3 million Covid-19 cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project.\n The number of cases in the nation's most populated state has tripled in just the past two months.\n Current data shows 3,005,830 cases and 33,623 deaths resulting from the virus that has plagued the nation and debilitated the economy.\n Hospitals throughout the state remain overwhelmed with patients seeking treatment. Covid-19 hospitalizations have dropped to just under 21,000 patients, but the number of available ICU beds remain incredibly low. There are just 1,113 ICU beds available statewide.\n About 90% of the state remains under stay-at-home orders due in part to limited intensive care unit capacity. Regions of the state are eligible to have the order lifted once four-week projections show an ICU capacity of more than 15% available.\n More than 1 million of the state's cases are in Los Angeles County, where about 1 in 10 people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus. Health officials speculate the actual number may be as high as one in three.\n In another sign of the spread of the virus, an air pollution control agency said on Sunday that it has temporarily suspended limits on cremations to assist crematoriums in Los Angeles County with a \"backlog\" caused by the pandemic.\n Permits for crematoriums usually contain limits on the number of human remains that can be cremated each month, based on the potential impact they will have on air quality, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.\n But after requests from both the county coroner and health department, the agency issued an emergency order suspending permit conditions that limit the number of cremations, as long as crematoriums submit an email notice and meet certain requirements.\n The agency's district covers Orange County and major portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties, including the Coachella Valley.\n Los Angeles County is struggling to keep up with vaccination demand. While people 65 and older are eligible for the vaccine, the county is still inoculating health care workers.\n Dodger Stadium opened last week as a massive drive-thru vaccination site and the county is scheduled to open similar sites at other locations beginning Tuesday, including the Forum, Six Flags Magic Mountain, The Pomona Fairplex, California State University, Northridge, and the LA County Office of Education.\n \"Residents must more diligently follow the safety measures put in place to prevent additional cases, hospitalizations, and death,\" the health department wrote in its news release.\n The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest public school district, has requested authorization from state and local officials to administer the Covid-19 vaccine, Superintendent Austin Beutner said Monday.\n \"In a typical community we serve, there are about three drugstores, 2 fire stations, and 25 schools,\" he said. \"No organization has the infrastructure to provide easier access to vaccinations than schools.\"\n Testing in the Golden State ramped up over the weekend with more than 427,000 tests conducted in a single day. California's two-week positivity rate continues its slow slide downward and stands at 12.2%. Just over a week ago, the positivity rate reached 14%, the highest percentage seen since widespread testing began.\n California recorded its first coronavirus case on January 26, 2020.\n CNN's Douglas Wood, Hira Humayun and Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's egging on of rioters before the storming of the US Capitol -- and his silence as that mob overran the building -- was a deeply injurious moment for the country and a dark mark on his legacy. And it was all social media's fault...\n That last bit is according to Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman who said this on Fox News Sunday while defending the President's lack of leadership in those key moments as the rioters took the Capitol:\n \"On one hand, he should be censored by Big Tech and not be allowed to talk, he also shouldn't say anything because it's divisive?\" Gidley said. \"And then when he doesn't say anything and can't say anything because the platforms have removed him, they say, 'Where's the President?'\"\n Huh! So, Trump's deplatforming by Twitter and Facebook made it impossible for him to address the American public -- and the rioters? Interesting!\n Especially because the deplatforming came AFTER the January 6 riots. Facebook banned Trump from posting on its site on January 7. Twitter followed suit on January 8.\n Trump, in fact, posted several videos during and after the riots -- in which he offered a lukewarm urging for the demonstrators to disperse while telling them \"we love you, you're very special.\"\n But let's put aside for a minute the fact that Gidley seems very confused about the timing of the deplatforming of his boss.\n The President of the United States has the largest bullhorn of any person in the country -- and maybe the world. If Trump's administration reached out to the TV networks at any point on January 6 and said he wanted to address the country, he could have. He didn't ask.\n He could have also given the networks a 15-minute heads up and gone to the White House briefing room and made a statement. That, too, would have received wall-to-wall coverage on every radio and TV station -- not to mention every newspaper and all over social media. He didn't do that.\n What Gidley -- and, by extension, Trump -- is engaging in is a classic bit of scapegoating. Remember that Trump is fundamentally unable to ever blame himself for anything. And so, in the wake of the disastrous and dangerous events of January 6, he and his cronies are trying to foist the blame on the forces of so-called \"Big Tech\" that deplatformed Trump after he repeatedly failed to issue a forceful condemnation of the rioters.\n It's bunk. All of it.\n And what's worse is that Gidley (and Trump) know it. Even if Trump had been deplatformed by Twitter and Facebook prior to January 6, there would have been a slew of ways that the President of the United States could find to communicate with the American public if he had wanted to do so.\n Leadership isn't about scapegoating and making dumb excuses. It's about showing the public the right way to act and to treat each other -- especially in moments like on January 6 when so many of our fellow Americans were behaving so badly. But Gidley's excuses are in keeping with the fundamental failure of Trump's administration: An utter and total abdication of the moral leadership required of a president.",

In September, at least 16 workers in southwestern China died after they became trapped underground in a coal mine and exposed to unsafe levels of carbon monoxide, state media reported.\n And in 2016, dozens of workers were confirmed dead after a gas explosion at a coal mine in the city of Chongqing.",

The California Democrat also said she was calling for an probe \"into the circumstances of the NSA General Counsel selection process\" by the department's acting inspector general.\n \"The circumstances and timing -- immediately after President (Donald) Trump's defeat in the election -- of the selection of Mr. Ellis, and this eleventh-hour effort to push this placement in the last three days of this Administration are highly suspect,\" the letter read.\n \"Further, the efforts to install him or 'burrow' him into a highly sensitive intelligence position 72 hours prior to the beginning of a new administration manifest a disturbing disregard for our national security. Therefore, this placement should not move forward.\"\n The demand by Pelosi represents the most significant opposition to Ellis' appointment yet. Her letter came on the same day that the NSA said it was installing Ellis into the post, a move that Miller ordered NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone to carry out.\n Ellis, who worked for Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, one of Trump's staunchest supporters, before joining the National Security Council, was already facing opposition from Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Jack Reed. The two had also requested an investigation into the agency's selection process within days of Ellis being picked for the job last November.\n The agency's selection of Ellis is significant because the role of general counsel at the country's largest intelligence agency is a civil service position, not a political role, meaning it could be difficult for the Biden administration to remove Ellis.\n Pelosi, who wrote that there were \"irregularities\" in the selection process, noted in her letter that Ellis is \"a relatively recent law school graduate with a limited resume, was selected due to interference by the White House, and was chosen over much more qualified candidates.\"\n \"If Mr. Ellis did go through the traditional civil service hiring process, I request a detailed account of that process, to understand how someone with his credentials was chosen over other qualified candidates,\" Pelosi wrote.\n \"The General Counsel of the Department of Defense is the sole selection authority for the position of General Counsel of the National Security Agency - as well as all other senior career DoD General Counsel positions,\" according to a Sunday statement from the Department of Defense. \"The Director of the NSA does not select or approve of candidates for the position of the NSA General Counsel.\"\n \"To be clear, congressional or media interest in a particular hiring action are not justification under the merit system principles and process to delay placing a selected qualified individual in a position,\" the statement added.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Zachary Cohen, Jeremy Herb, Oren Liebermann and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

The role of the Black church will be critical because data shows Black Americans are currently receiving Covid-19 vaccinations at dramatically lower rates than White Americans, she said.\n \"Access issues and mistrust are leaving Black health care workers behind,\" Nunez-Smith said. \"We know there will be similar challenges across the broader population.\"\n CNN's Skylar Mitchell contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Rudy Giuliani voted with an affidavit ballot, which he bashed in failed effort to overturn election   ",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani personally voted in the 2020 election using a voting method he publicly disparaged and bashed in his attempts to overthrow the presidential election results, a CNN KFile investigation has found.\n Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, voted in Manhattan by an affidavit ballot, also known as a provisional ballot, after his name did not appear on the voter rolls when he showed up to vote.\n According to records obtained by CNN's KFile, Giuliani's registration was moved to his Long Island home in August and his registration in New York City was purged in September. Giuliani told CNN he did not know why his registration was moved to his Long Island home in August and contested that he changed his registration at all.\n Giuliani swore in an affidavit oath that he was registered to vote in the Manhattan district and cast his ballot there. A New York City Board of Elections official told CNN the vote would count, citing a provision in the state's election law.\n Giuliani has baselessly claimed that a high number of provisional ballots cast in Pennsylvania proved instances of fraud; he further suggested that voters were given provisional ballots when they showed up to vote after Democrats cast fraudulent ballots on behalf of voters.\n \"To give you another example, we have 17,000 provisional ballots cast in Pittsburgh. Do you know what a provisional ballot is? Provisional ballot usually happens [sic] this way, and about 15 of the 17,000 happened this way: you walk in and you say, 'I'm here to vote today.' 'Oh, Mr. Giuliani, you already voted.' 'I did? I don't remember voting.' 'Oh, yes. Yes. You cast an absentee ballot.' 'No, I didn't.' 'Yes, you did.' 'No, I didn't.' 'Yes, you did,'\" said Giuliani.\n Giuliani continued, \"Why did it happen 15,000 times that people in Pittsburgh walked in to vote and they had already voted, according to the Democrat election machine? Did they forget? That many people with bad memories in Pittsburgh? Or is the following correct, that, as witnesses will testify, they were instructed by the Democrat bosses when they had a ballot in which there was no one registered, just assign it to somebody, just assign it to Rudy Giuliani. So, maybe Rudy Giuliani won't show up to vote. And, if he does show up to vote, we'll give him a provisional ballot.\"\n In a statement to CNN, Giuliani claimed he never registered to vote elsewhere and said his case was another example of voter irregularities, if not fraud from the New York State Board of Elections.\n \"I have never been registered anywhere else. I have voted in NY County for 28 years and not move [sic].I was US Attorney there and Mayor. This was one of NY State's numerous voter irregularities, if not voter fraud. The signature on the Suffolk County registration is clearly a fraud,\" Giuliani said in a text message.\n CNN reached out multiple times to the New York State BOE for comment but did not receive a response.\n CNN obtained copies of Giuliani's voter file through open records requests to the New York State, New York City, and Suffolk County boards of elections. The file also shows Giuliani has voted by mail nine times in the past, dating back to 2002.\n The records initially indicated that Giuliani did not vote in the 2020 election, but a further search found that Giuliani voted in Manhattan on Halloween.\n Because Giuliani's name did not appear on the voter rolls in New York City when he showed up to vote early in Manhattan, he cast an affidavit ballot swearing he was registered to vote in the district where he voted. CNN obtained a copy of Giuliani's signed affidavit oath swearing he was registered to vote in New York City.\n Despite Giuliani not being registered to vote in New York City at the time, New York City Board of Election spokesperson Valerie Vazquez-Diaz told CNN the vote was valid and would be counted. The NYC BOE pointed to a paragraph from a 2019 press release from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office on landmark election legislation on the universal transfer of registration, which says that when a voter moves elsewhere in the state, their registration should \"seamlessly\" move with them.\n The law states that it shall transfer the registration and enrollment \"for any voter who submits a ballot in an affidavit ballot envelope which sets forth such a new address,\" effectively working as a way to change a voter's registration on Election Day.\n Jerry Goldfeder, a prominent New York election and campaign finance lawyer who previously worked for Cuomo when the governor was the New York attorney general, explained to CNN that the universal transfer of registration is \"elastic\" and that it gives voters who own multiple homes across the state a choice of where to vote from.\n \"If a voter has more than one bona fide residence, she or he can choose from which one to register and vote. And the law is sufficiently elastic to allow the voter to switch voting residences back and forth\u2014but of course they can't vote more than once in an election,\" Goldfeder said in an email.",

Last July, for example, New York City painted a large yellow mural on the avenue outside Trump Tower reading \"Black Lives Matter,\" spurring Trump to criticize the phrase as a \"symbol of hate.\"\n When asked about changes in security, NYPD spokeswoman Detective Denise Moroney said that they will continue to have a \"robust presence\" at Trump-affiliated locations, including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. After the inauguration, the department will reevaluate its security presence, she said.\n CNN's Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Don't delay key medical appointments in the pandemic -- advice from Dr. Wen",
        "body_text": "As many people postpone necessary medical care due to the pandemic, medical professionals are worried that their patients will get sick or even die from other causes.\n Some 25% of Americans said that they or someone in their household had delayed medical care in the past month due to coronavirus, according to a December Kaiser Family Foundation study. An earlier report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 41% of Americans delayed medical care, including 12% who postponed urgent or emergency care.\n We talked to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, to get her advice on which appointments can be postponed and which cannot, and what precautions people should be taking when going to their doctor.\n This could be a problem. I'm concerned that many patients may be going without the care that they need for their ongoing medical issues so it's important for people to check in with their doctors' offices.  Many conditions require ongoing monitoring, like high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease. If they are not monitored as closely, they could worsen and lead to worse problems that could have been prevented. It's not good for children to fall behind on their immunization schedules. Those who do not get cancer screenings could end up with later diagnosis and worse outcomes. Keeping up with routine medical appointments is important.\n If there are things you have to do in person, see if you can combine the visits. Perhaps you are due for a breast exam, bloodwork and a pneumonia vaccine. You can get them all done at the same time. It reduces your overall risk if you can have fewer visits.\n You may live in a part of the world that's going through a particularly difficult time with coronavirus. If that's the case, talk to your doctor about what's essential to do now versus important things that could wait a couple of months. For each person, that could be different. Someone who needs to get a lot of testing for a heart condition may need to get that done now, but perhaps that person could wait on getting a colonoscopy that could be done when numbers drop. Someone else may have a history of colon cancer, and the colonoscopy should not be delayed. It's a good idea to initiate these conversations with your doctor now.\n I also cannot emphasize this enough: Do not delay emergency care. If you have chest pain, difficulty breathing, sudden weakness in arms or legs, and other such concerning symptoms, you should go to your local hospital's emergency room. If you would have normally gone to the ER if it weren't for coronavirus, go to the ER now. Hospital emergency rooms have triage protocols and also infection control protocols. Do not hesitate to go if you need emergency care. It would be tragic to have people avoid the ER because they're scared of contracting coronavirus, only to die at home.\n Remember, too, that Covid-19 causes more severe disease in individuals with underlying medical conditions. Getting those conditions treated and optimized should be a priority in and of themselves, but also not getting them treated could predispose you to even more severe effects from Covid-19. That's another reason to continue to seek medical care even with a lot of coronavirus around.\n Ask about what happens when you go in. How does waiting work? Ideally, the time in the waiting area while you're in an enclosed space with others will be as short as possible. Some doctors will have you wait in your car or outside until they are ready to see you, and then usher you quickly into an exam room. Others have waiting rooms that have enforced physical distancing and good ventilation.\n Make sure you are wearing a good quality mask the entire time, at least a three-ply surgical mask or an N95 or KN95 mask. Bring your own water but try not to take off your mask unless absolutely necessary. The office should have lots of hand sanitizer, but bring your own and use it after touching frequently used surfaces like doorknobs.\n Also ask if the in-person visit is absolutely necessary. Can a lot be done over the phone, including speaking with the doctor? Maybe all you need to do when you show up is to get a blood draw or a procedure. Can your registration be done in advance to minimize in-person contact?\n Let's say that you don't have anything urgent going on right now, and you can get almost everything taken care of through telemedicine. Maybe all you need is a routine dental cleaning and your annual cholesterol check. Let's say also that you're an essential worker, you are over 65, and you probably can get the vaccine in the next couple of months. If that's the case, you should discuss with your doctor, but it might make sense to get vaccinated first and then go for your routine appointments.\n If you're not likely to be vaccinated until the late spring or early summer, that's a bit long to put off your regular appointments. It's probably better to go now and consolidate all the in-person tests and procedures into one visit.\n In general, if you have ongoing medical conditions that require an in-person visit, and certainly if you have an urgent issue, you should go to your doctor. Follow all precautions to reduce your risk. Coronavirus is one of the reasons people could get sick and suffer ill health outcomes, but you must also watch out for your health in all other ways, too.",

        "title": "Trump's impeachment trial looms as Congress prepares for the arrival of the Biden administration",
        "body_text": "There are just days to go until President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in, Donald Trump is no longer President and Democrats take control of the US Senate, but rank-and-file members on Capitol Hill are still waiting for signals from leadership about what the first month of Biden's presidency will look like.\n It seems the uncertainty of the Trump era isn't going to evaporate on Wednesday because Congress isn't quite finished with Trump yet.\n The focus this week is on Biden becoming the 46th President of the United States, protecting Washington on Inauguration Day and preparing for a peaceful transition of power after the attack on the US Capitol.\n Talks between incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's offices are ongoing about what makes the most sense for the timing of the trial. While Biden has made it clear that he wants to split the day in half to allow his nominees to be confirmed in the morning ahead of the trial, that takes agreement from everyone. And it's not clear that all 100 senators are going to agree to it even if McConnell and Schumer could come to a consensus. Again, those talks are ongoing. Aides and members do not expect the impeachment trial to begin until next week at the earliest, but no one knows for sure until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi makes it clear when she will send over the articles.\n A very important reminder: Don't take the lack of answer for when a trial will begin as a lack of orchestration behind the scenes. We are moving into another chapter in American history where the President, Senate and House are all controlled by the same party and unlike Trump -- who often caught his leadership off guard with rogue tweets or off-the-cuff statements -- Pelosi and Schumer are on the same page here. They don't need Biden to even tell them. They  know what's at stake with an impeachment trial.\n Once they go down that road, there is no turning back. The Senate is in session every day starting at 12 p.m. ET with members in their desks, six days a week for as long as the trial goes. Sending the articles too soon without a firm agreement between Schumer and McConnell jeopardizes Biden's first 100 days, his ability to get his nominees through, not to mention any goal Biden had to heal the country after the January 6 attack on the Capitol. If it feels like we are stagnant right now, it's because working through the potential challenges and ramifications of this trial is an incredible undertaking.\n As CNN reported last week, once Pelosi transmits the articles, it unlocks an entire series of steps that quickly have to follow. No one wants to move ahead until everyone is on the exact same page about what that is going to look like.\n As we've previously reported, once impeachment starts, the Senate has to convene every day at 12 p.m. for the trial. In order to do anything else, there has to be a unanimous consent agreement. That means all the senators have to be on the same page that they want to allow Biden to work through his agenda in the morning ahead of the impeachment trial unfolding every afternoon. Given the divisiveness of the moment, given the animosity some Republicans have about spending time on impeaching a President who won't even be in office, it's fair to consider whether an agreement like that is possible. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the incoming majority whip, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday there are always \"resistors,\" but he hoped that members could get behind dual tracking the day.\n There are five confirmation hearings on Tuesday for secretary of State, secretary of Treasury, CIA director, Defense secretary and secretary of Homeland Security. Aides say it is possible that the Senate could move as soon as Wednesday to confirm some of them to their posts hours after Biden is sworn in. Again, this takes agreement from all 100 senators. We should have more timing guidance Tuesday when the Senate returns.\n In order for Schumer to become majority leader, incoming Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both of Georgia, have to be sworn in. The state has until later this week to do that. Aides close to the process say the expectation is that certification will occur around January 20, but it's normal for the senators to not be sworn in until the day after that certification occurs. That means that it may actually be a day or so until Warnock and Ossoff are sworn in.\n In other words, the timing is fluid. Don't assume that Schumer becomes majority leader on January 20. We don't know for sure.\n Leadership has been working through how the two parties will run the next Senate. Given the narrow Democratic majority (a tie with incoming Vice President Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker), aides have pointed out there is an expectation that Schumer and McConnell will come up with a power sharing agreement modeled after the one in 2001 between Trent Lott and Tom Daschle. The talks are still ongoing so we can't say for sure what that agreement will look like, but in 2001 the agreement allowed for evenly divided Senate committees, evenly divided budgets on the committees, equal access to common areas in the Capitol for both Republicans and Democrats and members from both parties were able to preside over the Senate. Those talks are ongoing just like the talks over how an impeachment trial may be run.",

        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's expected batch of 100 pardons and commutations on the penultimate day of his presidency won't be the highest of his recent predecessors.\u00a0But his record of clemency could very well be the most controversial.\n Unlike past presidents, Trump has shown little interest in using the Justice Department's Pardon Attorney system for assessing requests for executive clemency. Instead, petitioners are approaching the White House directly, calling or emailing senior adviser Jared Kushner, chief of staff Mark Meadows or White House counsel Pat Cipollone -- when they can't get a hold of Trump himself.\n Many of the people Trump has chosen to pardon so far fall along predictable lines: associates such as Roger Stone and Michael Flynn who remained loyal to him through their legal troubles; criminals with friendly or familial ties to the administration, such as Jared Kushner's father Charles; celebrities or people connected to celebrities, such as Rod Blagojevich; and those whose cause was taken up by conservative media, such as Blackwater security guards who massacred Iraqi civilians.\n He has pardoned or commuted the sentences of some people serving lengthy prison terms for low-level offenses, such as Alice Johnson, who spoke at the Republican National Convention.\n But by and large, Trump's pardon record has broken with historical norms. Many of the high-profile criminals he has pardoned have shown little contrition or remorse for their crimes and few have argued they were wrongfully convicted.\n He is expected to adhere to that record on Tuesday when he issues around 100 pardons or commutations. The final batch of clemency actions is expected to include a mix of criminal justice reform-minded pardons and more controversial ones secured or doled out to political allies. White collar criminals, high-profile rappers and a prominent eye doctor from Palm Beach, Florida, who is in prison after being convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud, are expected to be on the list.\n There has been a crush of pardon requests during Trump's final days in office from allies, lobbyists and others hoping to cash in on their loyalty to Trump.\u00a0The New York Times reported Sunday some of those people were getting paid tens of thousands of dollars to lobby on behalf of felons hoping for pardons.\n \"Everyone assumed there's no formal process and they should reach out to the administration directly,\" a person familiar with the matter has told CNN. \"Everyone hopes they have a friend of a friend of a friend of a cousin who they hope will get them to read their email.\"\n The 11th-hour batch of clemency is in keeping with presidential tradition.\n President Barack Obama pardoned or commuted the sentences of 330 individuals on the day before he left office, a record number that went mainly to low level drug offenders serving mandatory sentences.\n President George W. Bush was more sparing with his use of pardons and commutations. He commuted the sentences of two border agents as he departed office (Trump later pardoned them). But he wrote in his memoir how a rush of requests came to him as he closed out his tenure.\n \"One of the biggest surprises of my presidency was the flood of pardon requests at the end. I could not believe the number of people who pulled me aside to suggest that a friend or former colleague deserved a pardon. At first I was frustrated. Then I was disgusted,\" he wrote in \"Decision Points.\"\n \"I came to see massive injustice in the system,\" he added. \"If you had connections to the president, you could insert your case into the last-minute frenzy. Otherwise, you had to wait for the Justice Department to conduct a review and make recommendation. In my final weeks in office, I resolved that I would not pardon anyone who went outside the formal channels.\"\n Bush said he told Obama in their shared limo ride to the US Capitol for Obama's inauguration to develop a pardon policy early on and stick to it.\n President Bill Clinton drew scrutiny for his pardons and commutations of 140 people on Inauguration Day in 2000, which included high profile donors and political supporters such as Marc Rich, his half-brother Roger and Patty Hearst. Some of them came after middlemen, paid high sums, intervened with Clinton to argue their case. But the majority of the people on his list still went through the Justice Department process.\n President George H.W. Bush pardoned a dozen people a day before leaving office. President Ronald Reagan pardoned around 25 people during his final week as president. And President Jimmy Carter, as he departed office, pardoned Pete Yarrow, of the group Peter, Paul and Mary, for an \"indecent liberties\" offense with a 14-year-old girl.",

        "body_text": "On the morning of January 20, Donald Trump and Melania Trump will depart the White House as President and first lady, but they will not invite their incoming counterparts, Joe and Jill Biden, inside before they do.\n The dissolving of one of America's most enduring transfer-of-power rituals -- the outgoing president welcoming the incoming president on the steps of the North Portico, and then riding with them to the United States Capitol -- is just one of the snubs the Trumps are perpetrating as they leave Washington.\n Instead of a president and first lady, the Bidens will be greeted by the White House chief usher Timothy Harleth, according to a source familiar with the day's events and planning. Harleth, a 2017 Trump hire from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, will likely not stay on in the Biden administration, the source said, noting the role of chief usher in all probability will be filled by someone more familiar with the incoming president and first lady.\n The afternoon of Inauguration Day, then-President Biden will participate in a ceremonial wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. It is during these hours the bulk of the Bidens' personal effects will be moved into the White House and unpacked, according to another source with knowledge of executive residence practices.\n By that time, all Trump paraphernalia will be gone, and a thorough top-to-bottom cleaning of the entire White House campus will have been completed. Deeper cleaning protocols were arranged via the White House with outside contractors, on top of regular cleaning done by staff, including specialized attention to rugs, carpets, curtains and surfaces, to tackle any possibility of lingering germs, of the Covid-19 sort or otherwise.\n \"Moving furniture and vacuuming, cleaning baseboards, vacuuming drapes, wiping down shades, cleaning chandeliers, washing windows, high dusting,\" are areas all covered during the traditional move-in of a new president and his family, according to the residence source. \"That cleaning will start as soon as Donald Trump and Melania Trump depart.\"\n A particular focus of this move will be paid to the bedrooms in the residence, where new mattresses and box springs for the incoming first family are standard operating procedure, according to the source. Yet one part of the bedroom set-up will be markedly different with the Bidens than it was for the Trumps: the Bidens will be sharing a bedroom. Melania Trump spent the majority of her time in the White House in the large bedroom suite typically reserved for Presidents and their spouse, adjacent to the West Sitting Hall, according to a source with knowledge of the arrangement.\n \"Donald Trump slept in his own bedroom, which was previously a study or den during other administrations,\" the source said of the arrangement.\n On Monday, moving trucks were spotted in the driveways of Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, with movers loading dollies of boxes and items and rolling them into the private club, which will serve as the Trumps' post-White House home, which is the plan for now, said another source with knowledge of the planned living arrangements and security arrangements set in place.\n The Inauguration Day snub of the Biden's comes on the heels of a series of broken norms and childish behavior that comes directly from the President of the United States, who has been vocal about his disinterest in preserving any semblance of decency towards the man who will succeed him.\n Trump, according to several sources, is even mulling whether to write a letter to Biden to leave for him in the Oval Office, a standard-bearing tradition.\n Melania Trump, who has not been seen in public in more than two weeks, has not reached out to Jill Biden, dashing expectations she would continue the passing along of hospitality to her successor, hosting her for a tour.\n Even after contentious election cycles, first ladies and presidents have set aside hard feelings and ego, no matter how bruised, until now.\n \"I recall both interactions that then first lady Hillary Clinton had with Barbara Bush in 1992 when she first arrived at the White House, and in 2000 when she hosted Laura Bush,\" a former senior official in the Clinton administration told CNN. \"Both were after contentious campaigns and both visits could not have been more gracious and welcoming.\"\n And though the Bidens have a unique perspective having visited the White House numerous times throughout Joe Biden's decades-long political career, the lack of politeness from the Trumps stings.\n \"It's abhorrent,\" said another former White House official who worked in the Trump administration.\n Small measures of decorum during the transition are being practiced, however. CNN has learned of at least three Trump administration officials who used private communication channels to reach out to their Biden administration counterparts in the last month, despite the President not conceding his loss.\n Over the weekend, Trump's official White House photographer Shealah Craighead was spotted by CNN giving a tour of the White House photo office to Adam Schultz and Chandler West, Biden's incoming official photographer and photo editor, respectively. While photographers mark one end of the spectrum, Vice President Mike Pence would signal the other.\n On Thursday, Pence spoke with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for the first time, the highest-level contact to date between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Their conversation was described as cordial, with Pence offering his congratulations and assistance, according to a person familiar with the matter. CNN reached out to the office of second lady Karen Pence to see if she had made the same gesture to incoming second gentleman Doug Emhoff and did not receive a response.\n On Sunday, the Pences were still doing official duties, visiting troops at Fort Drum in New York. Karen Pence was emotional referring to her last official trip during her remarks.\n \"Here I go,\" she said, pausing between sentences at a podium inside the hangar, trying to catch herself before more tears rolled down her face. \"It is such an honor to be here with you.\"\n On Sunday, invitations were issued to Trump's circle asking them to please attend -- and bring up to five guests -- his and Melania Trump's going-away celebration at Joint Base Andrews, prior to boarding Air Force One early Wednesday morning for their last trip on the storied aircraft, which will deposit them in Florida.\n Trump has told staff he wants his tarmac send-off to include all the pomp and circumstance he feels he deserves, including a 21-Gun Salute, red carpet and military Color Guard. On Monday afternoon, an administration official told CNN the bells and whistles might all be for a very big audience of one -- the President -- and a small audience of others: \"So far, there haven't been a lot of RSVPs.\"\n CNN's Kate Andersen Brower, Jeff Zeleny and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

But with job losses ticking up and millions still unemployed, Biden and congressional Democrats have made clear their first legislative priority will be a wide-ranging stimulus package.\n \"The pandemic has caused widespread devastation,\" Yellen says in her testimony. \"The damage has been sweeping, and as the President-elect said last Thursday, our response must be, too.\"",

        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden's shouldering of the presidency on Wednesday will finally end twice-impeached Donald Trump's four-year assault on truth and law and a corrupt administration set to test the propriety of the presidency to his final hours in office with a flurry of controversial pardons.\n The inauguration will be the culmination of an epic week for a battered nation haunted by sickness, death and political divisions in which constitutional principles will triumph over lies and insurrection with the transfer of power from one president to the next.\n The week begins amid unmistakable signs of a new presidency getting up to speed while an old administration dissolves in disgrace and disarray, with rappers and white collar criminals likely to be on Trump's list of pardons expected to be issued on Tuesday.\n Biden's new team will face the gravest national challenges of any new White House in 90 years, with the pandemic running riot, nearly 400,000 citizens dead, an economy in ruins and a vaccine rollout faltering.\n The week begins amid unmistakable signs of a new presidency getting up to speed while an old administration dissolves in disgrace and disarray, with Trump expected to issue a flood of pardons and commutations on Tuesday including for rappers and white collar criminals.\n A massive garrison of thousands of troops and security forces in Washington, DC, and the ugly scar of iron fences ringing the White House and the Capitol to protect the inauguration from violent pro-Trump mobs bear witness to Trump's legacy of incitement. There will be neither crowds thronging the National Mall nor footage of the new President and first lady waltzing at glitzy inaugural balls. The muted pageantry will underscore the mission history has assigned to the oldest President ever to be sworn into office -- that of digging his nation out of multiple crises.\n After four years in which Trump tore at America's racial wounds as a tool of power, there will, however, be a sense of history as California Sen. Kamala Harris becomes the first female, Black and South Asian vice president when she is sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n Biden's team, which has been hampered by Trump's refusal to allow a peaceful, cooperative transition, is gearing up a multi-front federal government effort to battle Covid-19, which a disinterested Trump always failed to initiate.\n The President-elect warns that the dire public health situation will get worse before it gets better but is preaching unity and seeking to inspire Americans beaten down by a gruesome 10 months to muster for a final assault on the virus.\n \"Out of all the peril of this moment, I want you to know, I give you my word, I see the promise,\" Biden said on Friday. \"Now we're being so optimistic about America, as optimistic as I've ever been. We have everything we need, but the will must be demonstrated. So come Wednesday, we begin a new chapter.\"\n Biden is preparing a series of executive actions as soon as he takes office, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and ending a travel ban for citizens from some mainly Muslim countries, which will change America's outward face to the world.\n Trump stayed hidden during his last White House weekend, with comings and goings of family members, officials and his legal team hinting at the pardon spree that sources said Sunday could cover around 100 people but is not expected to include a highly contentious self-pardon.\n And in a last-minute move that will make it harder for Biden's administration to shake Trump's influence, the National Security Agency agreed to install Trump loyalist Michael Ellis, a National Security Council staffer, as its general counsel. The position is a civil service job rather than a political appointment, a designation that makes it harder for Biden to fire Ellis.\n With Washington still traumatized by the assault on the Capitol, shocking new video released by the New Yorker showing a mob incited into an insurrection by Trump offered fresh evidence of the President's culpability in an attack on the American government.\n Claims by rioters wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats that they were acting on behalf of Trump are likely to take center stage in Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which threatens to slow Biden's hopes of a fast start to his own presidency.\n A new CNN poll released Sunday revealed the poisoned legacy Trump will leave behind. Only 19% of Republicans believe Biden was legitimately elected following weeks of lies perpetrated by the commander-in-chief and his conservative propagandists that the election was stolen. The lack of a shared national truth will hamper Biden's hopes of forging a national response to the pandemic and has left the Republican Party locked in civil war.\n And if recent history is any guide, the last two days of Trump's presidency will bring more chaos and challenges to the rule of law, before he leaves Washington Wednesday morning for a luxurious post-presidency in Florida.\n The Biden administration's most important priority will be to rescue the faltering rollout of new vaccines that carry the promise of finally ending a pandemic that has never been more deadly.\n Incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that \"we're inheriting a huge mess here ... but we have a plan to fix it.\" Biden hopes to administer 100 million doses of two-stage coronavirus vaccines in his first 100 days. The US is currently still well short of the 20 million doses in American arms Trump's team had promised by the end of December amid poor coordination in states and the lack of a federal plan.\n Rochelle Walensky, Biden's incoming director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned on Sunday that the already horrific toll of the virus would get worse in setting initial expectations for the new White House.\n \"By the middle of February, we expect half a million deaths in this country,\" Walensky told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n Medical experts had hoped that the pandemic would peak in its latest, most dangerous wave in the coming weeks and that cases and deaths would ease in the spring. But former Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned that a more transmissible variant of the virus would begin to dominate new cases in the coming weeks and maintain high infection rates.\n \"The only backstop against this new variant is the fact that we will have a lot of infection by then, so there'll be a lot of immunity in the population and we will be vaccinating more people, but this really changes the equation,\" Gottlieb said, also on \"Face the Nation.\"\n Biden plans to sign an executive order requiring masks on federal property and during interstate travel and is urging all Americans to wear face coverings for 100 days. But this is one area where Trump's efforts to shatter Biden's legitimacy could have a deadly consequence since it will be a challenge for the new President to convince Americans who falsely believe he stole the election.\n Klain also told CNN he was confident that the Secret Service and the National Guard would keep the inauguration safe on Wednesday but expressed concern about potential violence across the country.\n \"I think the events of the past few weeks have proven out just how damaged the soul of America has been and how important is to restore it. That work starts on Wednesday,\" Klain told Tapper.\n Exacerbating the multiple crises facing his new administration, Biden will enter office with a ghost Cabinet, without any of his key nominees confirmed by the Republican Senate that has shown little urgency despite the extreme circumstances. Democrats will take control since Harris will have the capacity to cast the deciding vote on deadlocked legislation in the 50-50 chamber, once the two Democrats who won Georgia Senate runoff races are seated.\n But Trump's looming trial after his historic second impeachment last week threatens to further slow Biden's early momentum and his $1.9 trillion pandemic crisis legislation. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is seeking to craft a trial that will allow the Senate to do two things at once.\n The Democrats' lead impeachment manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, told Tapper that it would be wrong to give the outgoing President a pass given the severity of his actions.\n \"I don't think anybody would seriously argue that we should establish a precedent, where every president on the way out the door has two weeks or three weeks or four weeks to try to incite an armed insurrection against the union or organize a coup against the union, and if it succeeds, he becomes a dictator, and if it fails, he's not subject to impeachment or conviction because we just want to let bygones be bygones,\" Raskin said on \"State of the Union.\"\n In recent days, Vice President Mike Pence has been performing many of the valedictory duties normally undertaken by a president since Trump has declined to deliver the kind of farewell address that is customary. On Sunday, in one of his final official speeches as vice president, Pence spoke at Fort Drum, New York.\n \"I have faith that the day will come when we put these challenging times in the past and emerge stronger and better than ever,\" Pence said.\n \"We will heal our land. We will renew our strength,\" he added, without noting Trump's denial and mismanagement of the pandemic and refusal to preside over a peaceful transfer of power that immeasurably worsened those challenging times.",

        "title": "French politics kills Canadian bid to create one of the world's top supermarket groups",
        "body_text": "The French government has put an abrupt end to a $20 billion takeover of the country's biggest retailer by Canada's largest convenience store operator.\n In a joint statement on Saturday, French supermarket chain Carrefour (CRERF) and Couche-Tard (ANCTF), the owner of Circle K, said that talks about a \u20ac16.2 billion ($19.5 billion) transaction \"are no longer continuing.\"\n The companies, which had confirmed the merger discussions only last week, said that they would instead explore partnerships in areas such as fuel purchasing, distribution and private label products.\n The deal would have created the world's fourth biggest supermarket chain based on 2019 sales, after Walmart (WMT), Lidl owner Schwarz Group and Kroger (KR), according to Euromonitor. Carrefour is one of Europe's biggest grocers with 10,000 convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets across the continent. Couche-Tard operates 9,000 convenience stores across North America and is growing its presence in Europe. The two groups are jointly worth about $50 billion.\n The about-face comes after Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told France's BFM TV that the government would block the deal if pressed. He had earlier voiced opposition to the transaction, a stance he clarified in an interview on Friday.\n \"It is a courteous but clear and final no,\" he said. \"What's at stake? It is the food security of our country,\" he added, noting that the pandemic has highlighted that \"food security is priceless.\"\n France has tightened rules governing foreign takeovers in recent years and in 2020 extended the list of sectors that require government approval to include agricultural activities that contribute to national food safety. Carrefour controls 20% of France's food distribution, according to Le Maire.\n But electoral politics may have played a bigger role. A takeover of France's biggest private sector employer by a foreign company would have bolstered the country's far-right National Rally 15 months before a presidential election, said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Fabienne Caron.\n The food security reason \"makes little sense,\" Caron wrote in a note to clients on Monday, adding that foreign-owned grocers such as Lidl operate effectively and sell mainly French products. Steps to block the deal are \"all about politics,\" she added. \"The deal is too close to the presidential elections and the risk of giving tailwinds to the far-right party is too big.\"\n The pandemic had also exposed how much France relies on foreign countries for vital healthcare equipment, such as surgical masks. In that context, and given the upcoming elections, the government \"had more to lose than to win from accepting such an offer,\" she told CNN Business. \"The timing was bad.\"\n Investors had been skeptical of a deal to combine two groups with significant differences in geography and format, sending Couche-Tard's share price nearly 11% lower last week.\n \u2014 Ga\u00eblle Fournier contributed reporting.",

FedEx is operating, but with modified service for FedEx Express and FedEx SmartPost.\n Most US banks are closed because they follow the holiday schedule of the Federal Reserve System, which is the nation's central bank. But that shouldn't stop you from being able to take out some cash at ATMs and of course online banking will be operating. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are also closed.\n Most DMV offices will be closed, as they are government agencies.
