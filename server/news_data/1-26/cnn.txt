        "body_text": "(CNN)The Wisconsin hospital pharmacist who in December allegedly removed 57 vials of Covid-19 vaccine from cold storage because he believed the vaccine could harm people has signed a plea agreement \"acknowledging that he was guilty\" of trying to make the vaccine ineffective, the Department of Justice said.\n Steven Brandenburg, 46, is charged with two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products, \"with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of death or bodily injury,\" the department said in a release.\n Brandenburg removed a storage container with 57 vials, containing more than 500 doses of the Moderna vaccine, at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton on December 24 and 25, according to police. The vaccine must be kept cold to remain effective.\n \"Tampering with vaccine doses in the midst of a global health crisis calls for a strong response, as reflected by the serious charges the United States has brought today,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice's Civil Division.\n CNN has reached out to an attorney for Brandenburg for comment.\n According to police, he allegedly provided public safety officials at Aurora Medical Center with a written statement saying he intentionally removed the vials, knowing that if they were not properly stored, the doses would be ineffective.\n Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, according to the release.\n Authorities say Brandenburg admitted to investigators he believed in conspiracy theories and believed \"the COVID-19 vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their DNA,\" according to a probable cause statement obtained by CNN affiliate WTMJ.\n Brandenburg \"believed in various 'conspiracy theories'; subscribed to notions of 'alternative history'; and was skeptical of vaccines in general and the Moderna vaccine specifically,\" according to the plea agreement, the release said.\n \"Brandenburg had communicated his beliefs about vaccines to his co-workers for at least the past two years,\" the release said.\n Aurora Medical Center has said Brandenburg is no longer employed there.",

        "title": "Indian farmers storm New Delhi's Red Fort during tractor protest",
        "body_text": "New Delhi (CNN)Thousands of Indian farmers protesting controversial agricultural reforms stormed New Delhi's historic Red Fort Tuesday, with others breaching barricades and clashing with police.\n Protesters scaled the walls of the iconic monument and a flag was hoisted alongside India's national flag.\n Tear gas and flash bangs could been seen on live streams from the city's streets as police moved to contain large crowds of protestors in tractors and on foot from breaking through barricades. Both police and protesters were spotted with large sticks in the streets.\n It was supposed to be a massive but peaceful rally, as hundreds of thousands of farmers drove their tractors in convoy into the Indian capital as part of ongoing, nationwide protests against three farm laws that protesters say put their livelihoods at risk.\n Many of the farmers, who had adorned their tractors with colorful flags, including the flag of India and various farmers unions, had been camping out in protest on the outskirts of the capital for more than two months. Others, including young farmers from the northern states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan, had gathered on the border over the past few days in time for the planned march on India's Republic Day.\n The national holiday marks the first time India's constitution went into effect in 1950 following independence from British colonial rule, and the day is annually celebrated with a huge military parade through the capital.\n Farmers planned their march to coincide with the government's parade, which has been scaled back because of the coronavirus pandemic. But as tanks paraded before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, tractors driven by protesters ran across the capital -- some could be seen almost crushing police personnel standing in their way.\n The massive protests have been a significant challenge to Modi as months of demonstrations and sit-ins across the country against his key agricultural policy have grown into a stalemate marked by deadlocked talks between farmers and his administration.\n Police had given permission for the rally to proceed on certain routes but confrontations broke out when protesters diverged from the agreed plan. Police had had created diversions along several major highways and main roads in city and the metro shut exits at least 15 stations close to protest sites.\n Tear gas and batons were used against protesters outside Delhi police headquarters and at two bordering areas of the city as farmers broke through barricades, protesters said Tuesday.\n \"Outside the Delhi police headquarters tear gas and batons were used, protestors also attacked the police buses stationed there,\" said Paramjeet Singh Katyal, a spokesperson for Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella group representing farmers' unions.\n \"We have broken the barricades, we have our tractors, people are marching, some leaders are also on horseback... thousands of farmers have already reached the capital,\" Katyal said.\n The statement thanked farmers for their \"unprecedented participation\" in Tuesday's event, but expressed regret over the \"undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today\" and dissociated the group from \"those indulging in such acts.\"\n At the Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, police used tear gas and batons to push back about 2,000 protesters, and tear gas was also used at the Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana on Tuesday morning, according to Ashutosh Mishra, a spokesperson for All India Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the unions leading the protests.\n Police placed a cap of 5,000 tractors to take part in the rally, according to Mishra. However more than 200,000 tractors were mobilized, with many young people coming from neighboring states, said Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union, one of several leading the protests.\n Singhal added that in view of this it was necessary for Delhi Police to \"maintain law and order,\" adding that the clashes had damaged property and injured a number of police personnel.\n For decades, the Indian government offered guaranteed prices to farmers for certain crops, providing long-term certainty that, in theory, allowed them to make investments for the next crop cycle. The new agricultural laws, first passed in September by Modi's government, instead allow farmers to sell their goods to anyone for any price -- giving them more freedom to do things such as sell directly to buyers and sell to other states.\n But farmers argued that the new rules would leave them worse off by making it easier for corporations to exploit agricultural workers, and help big companies drive down prices. While farmers could sell crops at elevated prices if the demand is there, conversely, they could struggle to meet the minimum price in years when there is too much supply in the market.\n The laws have been so contentious because agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India's 1.3 billion population, and farmers have been arguing for years to get the minimum guaranteed prices increased. They are the biggest voter block in the country -- making farming a central political issue.\n More than 100,000 people have been protesting the laws since late November. There have been sit-ins lasting days along each of New Delhi's three borders. Farmers have blocked roads and set up makeshift camps, some sleeping on the road or in their tractors. They arrived from numerous different states to participate in the mass protests, at times clashing with police.\n The government has held 11 rounds of talks with leaders of more than 30 farmers' unions that are opposed to the laws -- but the talks have gone nowhere.\n Earlier this month, India's Supreme Court issued an order putting the three contentious farm laws on hold and ordered the formation of a four-member mediation committee to help the parties negotiate. But farmers' leaders have rejected any court-appointed mediation committee.",

        "title": "Florida led the world in shark attacks again in 2020",
        "body_text": "(CNN)The US is once again the shark attack capital of the world in 2020. Thanks, Florida!\n Last year, the US reported 33 unprovoked shark attacks, accounting for about 58% of the total number of unprovoked shark attacks that occurred worldwide, according to the Yearly World Shark Attack Summary from the International Shark Attack File (ISAF).\n This is a decrease from 2019, when 64% of the global unprovoked bites occurred in the US.\n ISAF categorizes shark attacks by first deciding if they were provoked or unprovoked.\n \"Unprovoked attacks are defined as incidents in which an attack on a live human occurs in the shark's natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark,\" ISAF said.\n \"Provoked attacks occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way. These include instances when divers are bitten after harassing or trying to touch sharks, bites on spearfishers, bites on people attempting to feed sharks, bites occurring while unhooking or removing a shark from a fishing net and so forth.\"\n ISAF said it investigated 129 alleged shark-human interactions worldwide in 2020 -- 57 were unprovoked shark bites on humans, and 39 were provoked bites.\n Of the 33 unprovoked shark attacks in the US, 16 of them were in Florida. The state's 16 cases represent 28% of unprovoked bites worldwide.\n \"For decades, Florida has topped global charts in the number of shark bites, and this trend continued in 2020,\" ISAF said in its summary. \"However, the state saw a significant drop from its most recent five-year annual average of 30 incidents.\"\n Eight of the shark bites in Florida, or 50% of the state's total in 2020, occurred in Volusia County, according to the ISAF.\n ISAF said that while the incidence of bites both in the US and globally have been declining over time, \"2020's numbers represent a more drastic drop than would be expected.\"\n Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark research program, said that Covid-19's impact was something he and his colleagues speculated about back in March.\n According to Naylor, the pandemic hasn't necessarily caused a drop in cases -- but it has impacted researchers' ability to follow-up and confirm cases when they are reported.\n \"We typically talk to emergency room doctors and nurses to create our reports,\" Naylor said. \"However, they've been so overwhelmed with the Covid-19 response that they haven't always had time to talk to a bunch of scientists that are asking detailed questions about a shark attack.\"\n Based on its research in the last year, ISAF said the \"observed drop in shark bite incidents may have been caused by the widespread quarantines, closed beaches and minimized vacation travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n There were 13 shark-related fatalities this year, 10 of which were confirmed to be unprovoked, ISAF said in its Yearly Worldwide Shark Attack Summary.\n \"This number is above the annual global average of four unprovoked fatalities per year,\" ISAF wrote.\n But, \"despite 2020's spike in fatalities, long-term trends show a decreasing number of annual fatalities. Year-to-year variability in oceanographic, socioeconomic and meteorological conditions significantly influences the local abundance of sharks and humans in the water.\"\n Of the global fatalities, Australia saw \"a higher incidence of fatal bites than normal in 2020,\" ISAF said. The country had six confirmed fatal shark attacks.\n \"Australians are not naive when it comes to the inherent dangers of surfing and swimming,\" Naylor said. \"So I was surprised that the number was as high as it was this year.\"\n Meanwhile, in the US, there were three confirmed fatal shark attacks last year. This is an increase from 2019, when there weren't any confirmed cases in the US.\n The three fatal attacks happened in Hawaii, California and Maine. Although Florida is usually home to most of the unprovoked attacks, the state didn't have any confirmed fatalities last year.\n Most bites --  61% of the total cases in 2020 -- were related to surfing and board sports, ISAF said.\n But don't worry: \"Short-term trends still show both fatal and non-fatal bites to be decreasing,\" ISAF said.\n \"The total number of unprovoked shark bites worldwide is extremely low, given the number of people participating in aquatic recreation each year.\"\n Should you find yourself in the sea, ISAF said there are many ways to avoid a shark attack.\n ISAF encourages people \"avoid being in the water during darkness or twilight hours when sharks are most active and have a competitive sensory advantage.\"\n The organization also urges people to not enter the water if they are bleeding, because \"a shark's olfactory ability is acute.\"\n Shiny jewelry can also attract sharks, as \"the reflected light resembles the sheen of fish scales.\"\n ISAF also encouraged people to avoid wearing bright swimwear or dive gear, because \"any high contrast color apparel or gear used by a human in the water is especially visible to sharks.\"",

The 24-year-old, who entered the fighting scene in January of 2020, first propelled to fame on YouTube, where he has amassed more than 20 million subscribers who are drawn to his prank videos.\n In December, Paul told ESPN that his ultimate goal is to take on Connor McGregor, a former UFC double champion.\n \"I am dedicating my life to beating Conor McGregor,\" Paul said. \"Financially, it already makes sense.

He was an MMA fighter until 2019 and is currently listed as retired, according to UFC.\n \"I know Jake Paul is enjoying pretending he is a fighter,\" Askren told ESPN. \"I think on April 17 he is going to have a rude awakening to what being a fighter is really like. Jake has led a privileged life and doesn't really know what the meaning of being a fighter is.

        "title": "Trump adds another South Carolina lawyer to impeachment defense team amid questions of whether he will pay them",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Former President Donald Trump has expanded his impeachment legal team by tapping a former prosecutor-turned-criminal defense lawyer, an addition that comes as Trump and his allies scramble to prepare a defense with less than two weeks until the Senate trial.\n The addition of Deborah Barbier, a lawyer with a reputation for tackling high-profile, controversial clients, is the second attorney to join from South Carolina. Last week, Trump announced that Butch Bowers, an experienced political attorney who has represented numerous Republican elected officials, including former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, would lead his legal team.\n The all-South Carolina legal team has surprised some attorneys, even those in the Palmetto State, but it underscores the outsized influence of one of Trump's most loyal allies, Lindsey Graham, the state's senior Republican senator, who recommended Bowers to Trump. It also highlights the challenges Trump was experiencing in building a legal team as his previous lawyers have largely stepped away from him.\n Barbier joined Trump's impeachment team Monday, according to an email sent by the chair of the South Carolina State Committee of the American College of Trial Lawyers, where Barbier is a member. The email, which was first reported by The Post and Courier, was confirmed by three lawyers. Barbier did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n \"He certainly could not do better than Debbie. She is an astoundingly capable, skilled, experienced criminal lawyer who is used of handling very high-profile cases with controversial clients. He could never do better than Debbie,\" said E. Paul Gibson, vice chair of the state committee, who confirmed the email.\n Barbier spent 15 years as a federal prosecutor in South Carolina before eventually opening her own boutique criminal defense firm. Barbier has represented several high-profile clients, including a Republican consultant embroiled in a lobbying case and a friend of Dylann Roof, who was convicted in the 2015 shooting of nine people at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n The appointment comes as Trump is struggling to build out his legal defense. In particular, loyalist Rudy Giuliani is not able to represent Trump since he spoke on January 6, whipping up the pro-Trump crowd before they stormed the US Capitol. Others who worked on Trump's previous impeachment team have declined to work on the second team.\n Major law firms have also turned down the former president because of the stigma of the insurrection and out of concern they would lose clients, several lawyers told CNN.\n \"The big firms have too many clients who would say, 'We're going to take our business away from you.' I don't think Butch Bowers or Debbie Barbier have that concern,\" said Robert Foster, a partner with Nelson Mullins in Columbia, where Bowers was a former partner.\n Trump's allies have recently approached Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris, two prominent criminal defense lawyers in Columbia, people familiar with the discussions said. Gasser, a former interim US attorney for South Carolina, and Harris, a former federal prosecutor, have worked closely with Barbier on the defense side.\n Gasser and Harris declined to comment to CNN.\n Their possible additions would give a significant boost to the courtroom trial aspect of the impeachment proceeding, but Trump allies say they still need an attorney who's strong on constitutional issues.\n Trump aides declined to comment Tuesday on the ongoing formation of the legal team.\n Another looming question is whether Trump will pay the lawyers. Three attorneys who spoke with CNN said it was unclear if Trump was seeking to retain lawyers on a pro-bono basis and not pay them retainers or hourly fees. All three of those lawyers said they declined to join the defense team, at least in part because of that issue.\n Graham on Tuesday referred questions about payment to Trump.\n \"You'll need to ask them that. I'm sure they're getting paid.\"\n Foster said the legal community is buzzing about who else may join the impeachment defense. When news broke late afternoon on Monday about Barbier's appointment, he said, \"Our first thought was, 'What is it about South Carolina?' \"\n Foster said the response to the email announcing Barbier's hiring was unsurprisingly mixed.\n \"They were overwhelmingly congratulating her because of her stellar reputation. They were overwhelming in that regard, they were split as to a lot of other issues,\" said Foster. \"Just as with anything else with Trump you're going to have 51% of the people on one side and 49% on the other side.\"\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of convicted killer Dylann Roof.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Bangkok, ThailandThai lawmakers have voted in favor of allowing abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy while retaining penalties for later terminations, a move that pro-choice activists said fell short of protecting the rights of the mother.\n In a late night session of the Senate on Monday, legislators voted 166-7 in favor of amending a law that criminalizes abortion, backing a plan that seeks to tackle unregulated terminations by non-medical practitioners.\n Under the amendment, an abortion after 12 weeks would be allowed only in certain conditions and would otherwise be punishable by up to six months in prison, or a fine of up to 10,000 baht ($334) or both.\n \"This mean abortion is conditional and can only be done by doctors according to the law,\" Senator Wanlop Tangkhananurak told Reuters.\n The amendment was passed by the lower house last week and follows a Constitutional Court decision last February that ruled that criminalizing abortion was unconstitutional and violated human rights.\n Under the new criteria, a termination after 12 weeks would be allowed if a certified doctor deems there is a high risk of fetal impairment, danger to the life of the mother, or if a pregnancy was the result of rape, deception or coercion.\n But pro-choice activists said retaining penalties would maintain the stigma of abortion.\n \"We want all penalties to be revoked because it is a person's right to abort a pregnancy without being punished,\" Nisarat Jongwisan, councillor and activist at Tam Tang, a pro-choice group, told Reuters.\n \"The penalties will impede on a person's access to safe services and also tarnish the dignity of those women,\" she said.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Eighty-year-old Belma Requejo of Los Angeles County is trapped in her home with her 83-year-old husband and two other elderly relatives.\n Meanwhile, Covid-19 has ravaged their densely populated section of Long Beach; just last week the disease claimed the life of a neighbor.\n \"I can't even walk in the park -- I'm afraid,\" Requejo said. \"We are surrounded by Covid.\"\n As Covid-19 continues its rampage across the country -- and as new variants pose the threat of increased transmissibility -- the urgent campaign to vaccinate Americans has been frustratingly sluggish.\n Earlier this month in Fort Myers, Florida, seniors spent a night lined up outside a local health office for the chance to get their coronavirus vaccine. In Phoenix, computer glitches sent health workers driving across the state to remote vaccination locations.\n Many states -- including New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Florida -- have had to cancel or delay thousands of vaccination appointments.\n Although the reasons for the holdups vary depending on the state and county, the primary causes boil down to two problems: a shortage of supply and the unpredictability of shipment sizes, say more than a dozen experts and health officials who spoke with CNN.\n Meanwhile, there is concern among state and local health officials that the supply crunch will leave people who have gotten one dose of the vaccine unable to get the second and final dose in time.\n Some chalk up the logistical nightmare to the lack of a central message from Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to inoculate Americans.\n \"It feels like the feds' plan stopped at the state borders, and the states expected the feds' plan to stop at people's arms,\" Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, chief clinical officer for Providence health system, which includes 51 hospitals, told CNN. \"I think having a federal plan would absolutely stop the kind of 'Hunger Games' approach to every individual state, every individual county scrambling for their own set of rules.\"\n President Joe Biden has said he intends to ramp up vaccinations in the coming weeks.\n Six weeks into the rollout, 23.5 million shots have been administered, according a tracker from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n The pace of vaccination has been accelerating. Until last week, the US was administering about 462,000 doses a day. That rose to nearly a million over the last week.\n On Tuesday, Biden's Covid coordinator, Jeff Zients, informed governors on a call that Covid-19 vaccine allocations for states would increase by 16% starting next week, according to a source with knowledge of the call.\n And the administration announced that while it remains committed, for now, to delivering 100 million doses in the first 100 days -- an average of 1 million a day -- it will boost weekly supply, increase transparency and purchase additional vaccine from the two companies with circulating vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna.\n The goal of the plan is to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by summer's end and achieve herd immunity, in which the percentage of the immunized population is so high that person-to-person transmission becomes unlikely.\n But vaccine expert Peter Hotez says to achieve herd immunity by summer, the US will need 3 million doses a day.\n Noting the dangerous new variants, Hotez said time is of the essence, and stressed that other vaccines in addition to the two versions in use need to quickly be authorized.\n \"The variant seems to be accelerating and is scaring the crap out of everyone, including me,\" said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n Both vaccine makers -- Pfizer and Moderna -- say they are on track to provide the federal government 200 million doses each by July 31, as outlined in their contracts.\n \"Production and releases are not linear and we have explained that we have been successfully scaling up our production yields over time,\" said a Moderna spokesperson.\n Still, the granular, day-to-day realities of getting vaccines into the arms of people has been a logistical nightmare for many providers across America.\n Officials in Louisiana say they could be vaccinating more people were it not for one major, overarching problem.\n \"We are simply limited by the supply we get,\" said Dr. Joseph Kanter, the state's top health officer and the lead physician with the state's department of health. \"There is simply much more demand than there is vaccine available. There are many more people eligible and who want the vaccine than there is vaccine we have to give.\"\n Inside Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the mass vaccination center could be inoculating up to 2,000 people a day. But on Monday, it had just 150 appointments.\n \"We're preserving the appointments for how many doses are available,\" Sarah Apatov, a volunteer who was administering doses, told CNN.\n Health officials in Georgia said they are pushing out the vaccine as quickly as possible. Dr. Lynn Paxton, Fulton County district health director, said her team has the capacity to vaccinate 50,000 people a week, but have had to settle for around 10,000.\n \"We have to be very judicious in how we schedule our appointments,\" she said. \"And the important thing I want everyone to know is that we are in no way hoarding these vaccine doses.\"\n Some officials told CNN that the size of the dose shipments they've received have been wildly out of step with expectations, crippling their efforts to adequately plan.\n \"The things that the federal government said it was going to do, which was to allocate vaccines to states and give them a sense of how many doses they would get based on their population size, that seems itself not to even play out the way that they said,\" said Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \"States to counties to facilities don't have predictability or visibility on the number of doses they're going to get, either like in a week or two out or even the next month.\"\n Compton-Phillips of Providence health said the planning challenges have forced hospitals to turn away even people who are over 65 with heart disease.\n \"We're saying, 'We're sorry, but we don't have a vaccine for you today and we're not really sure what our supply is going to be and not sure when we can give it to you,'\" she said. \"So, it's a really uncomfortable position to be in.\"\n Lori Tremmel Freeman, of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, calls the situation a \"world of uncertainty.\"\n \"This becomes just a tremendous issue when they're trying to plan mass vaccination clinics, drive-through clinics, scheduling for all these priority groups and ... really getting things rolling,\" she said.\n In Washington state, a surprise change of plans will likely force thousands of residents to find a new location to get their second dose.\n \"We had a clinic in downtown Seattle that's been running for the past couple of weeks doing over 2,200 immunizations a day,\" said Compton-Phillips of Providence. \"We heard last week that our allocation would be cut back by 90 percent so that they could take the same amount of vaccine that the state is getting and spread it out. ... How are we going to get everybody dose two?\"\n Some state officials are so frustrated with the supply shortage they're tapping into the second-dose reserves.\n Last week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis directed providers \"to use all the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine they have including the ones that were designated as second doses to use them as first doses this week.\" The directive applied to those ages 70 and up.\n \"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,\" Polis said at a January 19 news conference.\n Similarly, in Utah, officials will redesignate second doses for people who haven't shown up to get them within a week as first doses.\n In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Biden should order governments across the country to reassign second doses as first doses immediately.\n \"Start using them right now,\" he said on MSNBC, adding that sitting on them \"doesn't make sense.\"\n A former Trump administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to comment publicly, said states that want a more predictable cadence of supply can solve the problem by stockpiling the vaccine for three or four weeks.\n \"But I don't think states or local public health departments would like that either, because the goal is to get vaccine out as quickly as you can,\" the official said. \"So, in that environment where you are shipping doses out on the edges of them coming off the lines, there is just inherent uncertainty.\"\n CNN's Drew Griffin, Nelli Black, Scott Bronstein, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Benjamin Naughton and Casey Tolan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "12 Houston police officers have been charged in connection with a botched 2019 raid",
        "body_text": "(CNN)A total of 12 officers have now been indicted in connection with a 2019 botched raid that left two people dead in Houston.\n Six officers were indicted last year, including Gerald Goines, who is accused of lying to obtain a warrant, and Steven Bryant, who is accused of tampering with government records.\n Six other officers were indicted Monday, according to a statement from Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. Those officers face a variety of charges including murder, tampering with government records and engaging in organized criminal activity.\n The raid took place January 28, 2019, when a tactical team raided the home of Rhogena Nicholas and Dennis Tuttle, who were both killed along with their dog. Several Houston officers on the team were injured in the raid, including Goines.\n \"The consequences of corruption are that two innocent people and their dog were shot to death in their home by police; four officers were shot, one paralyzed, and now all of them will face jurors who will determine their fate,\" Ogg's statement read.\n The Harris County District Attorney's Office Civil Rights Division investigated the raid and determined that Goines lied to obtain a warrant for a \"no-knock\" raid from a municipal judge, and misrepresented the victims' drug activity, threat level and other factors. He claimed a criminal informant bought heroin from a man at the address the day before and that the man selling drugs was known to have a gun.\n Last year, prosecutors said Bryant misrepresented facts surrounding the scene and the purchase of the drugs. Bryant gave a supplement to the original report that contained falsehoods, the prosecutor said.\n The investigation also found that officers were \"involved in a long-term scheme to steal overtime from the city,\" Ogg's statement read.\n Former Houston police officer Felipe Gallegos was indicted for the death of Tuttle, according to court documents. His attorney, Rusty Hardin, said Tuesday Gallegos didn't start shooting during the raid until two other officers had already been shot.\n \"A Harris County grand jury at the request of the District Attorney's Office indicted a hero,\" Hardin said. \"It appears they (Tuttle and Nicholas) were innocent of drug activity at that scene as alleged. But once they started shooting, or once Mr. Tuttle started shooting, he was not innocent. And there is no question, and nobody will contradict that Mr. Tuttle started shooting at the officers.\"\n Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tweeted a statement Monday saying he's \"disheartened\" the process to indict these officers took so long. An officer who was willing to testify was not given the opportunity, Acevedo said.\n \"I have said many times that the other officers involved in the incident, including the officer indicted today, had no involvement in obtaining the warrant and responded appropriately to the deadly threat posed to them during its service,\" Acevedo said, adding that all current active officers who were indicted were relieved of duty.\n CNN's Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.",

        "title": "How Oregon just proved Donald Trump isn't going anywhere",
        "body_text": "(CNN)On Monday night, the Oregon Republican Party issued a formal condemnation of the 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.\n Here's a sampling of actual lines from the Oregon GOP's, uh, proclamation.\n * Whereas history tells us that after George Washington appointed Major General Benedict Arnold to command West Point, Arnold conspired to surrender the fort to the British.\"\n * \"Whereas the ten Republican House members, by voting to impeach President Trump, repeated history by conspiring to surrender our nation to Leftist forces seeking to establish a dictatorship void of all cherished freedoms and liberties.\"\n * \"Whereas there is growing evidence that the violence at the Capitol was a 'false flag' operation designed to discredit President Trump, his supporters, and all conservative Republicans; this provided the sham motivation to impeach President Trump in order to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power, in a frightening parallel to the February 1933 burning of the German Reichstag.\"\n OK, OK, OK.\n So, just so we are clear here, the Oregon Republican Party is saying that in voting to impeach Trump, these 10 Republicans are the equivalent to the burning of the German seat of government that led to Adolf Hitler's seizure of absolute power? Or that they are in the same boat as legendary traitor Benedict Arnold who conspired to sell out America during the Revolutionary War?\n Oh, and also that the January 6 riot at the Capitol was also a \"false flag\" operation organized by anti-Trump forces designed \"to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power.\" (Worth noting: The claim that the Nazis purposely started the Reichstag fire is still up for debate.)\n Uh ... this is crazy.\n And yet, it's not an isolated incident.\n In recent days, the Arizona Republican Party has reelected Kelli Ward as its chair -- a woman who has repeatedly insisted that the 2020 election was stolen and that Republicans in Congress should have sought to overturn the results. And the state party censured its own governor -- Doug Ducey -- as well as Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, and former Sen. Jeff Flake.\n Those moves follow this tweet from the Arizona GOP's official account on January 1:\n \"As the sun sets on 2020, remember that we're never going back to the party of Romney, Flake, and McCain. The Republican Party is now, and forever will be, one for the working man and woman! God bless.\"\n Taken together, what the moves in Arizona and Oregon -- not to mention the Arkansas gubernatorial candidacy of former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and the attempts to oust Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership for her impeachment vote -- suggest that attempts by the likes of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky) and other prominent establishment Republicans to rid the GOP of the memory (and influence) of the 45th president are very likely to fail.\n As CNN's Michael Warren wrote Tuesday in a piece about the ongoing civil war within the GOP:\n \"Some in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach.\n \"The result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward -- and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party's grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump's presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him.\"\n As North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer (R), an ardent defender of the former president who did not vote to object to the Electoral College results on January 6, put it in an interview with CNN's Lauren Fox: \"There are a lot of Republicans who would like my head. I haven't been loyal enough.\"\n Add it all up and you get this: The GOP isn't at the end of this war for its future. It's at the very beginning, And it is going to get very, very ugly.\n CNN's Allison Gordon contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)California is revamping its coronavirus vaccine delivery system amid criticism over the slow and inefficient rollout of doses, the California Department of Public Health announced Tuesday.\n The new system aims to simplify eligibility, standardize information and data, and address the available supply of doses by streamlining the process, the department said.\n California has been hit hard by the pandemic.\n \"While vaccines remain extremely limited, the goal is to build a system to equitably and efficiently administer vaccines when supply increases,\" officials said in a statement.\n Thus far, 2.6 million doses have been administered in the state, which has a population of about 39 million.\n The announcement comes a day after the state lifted its regional stay-home orders, saying that four-week projections of the need for intensive care unit beds in hard-hit areas show enough capacity to exit the order.\n It also comes amid an effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom by political opponents who criticized the strict stay-home orders.\n Send us your questions for President Biden's Covid-19 team\n Starting next month, all Californians in Phase 1B Tier 1 will be able to make an appointment to receive the vaccine under a standardized system. This includes health care workers, residents over 65 years old, and workers in education, child care, emergency services and food and agriculture sectors.\n Instead of counties and hospitals running their own vaccination delivery systems, the state will use a third-party administrator to allocate vaccines directly to providers to maximize distribution efficiency, they said.\n Officials said the third-party administrator has not been selected.\n \"The vaccine provider network is expected to include public health systems, pharmacies, health systems, public hospitals, community health centers, pharmacies and pop-up and mobile sites,\" officials said.\n The new system will continue to focus on equity, and the state plans to make sure low-income neighborhoods and communities of colors will have access to the vaccine, officials said.\n In addition, \"providers will be compensated in part by how well they are able to reach underserved communities,\" state health officials said.\n \"We have learned that to accelerate pace we need to dial up the scale of our efforts to ensure vaccine supply goes into arms as quickly as it arrives in the state,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n The state is also launching a website called \"My Turn,\" through which residents can get notified once they are eligible for the vaccine.\n It will also track vaccination data and automatically report information into state data systems. Health officials hope this will reduce data lags and provide real-time information on the vaccination process.\n The overall vaccine supply into California will continue to be dictated by the federal government, state health officials noted.\n Last week, state epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said that it may take four to five months to get all California residents 65 years of age and older vaccinated at the current rate the state is receiving its doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Newsom on Monday said the state has tripled its rate of administration of the vaccine.\n More than 3.2 million people in the state have contracted the virus, and hospitals, especially in Southern California, have been overwhelmed. In that area, ICU capacity remains at 0%.\n CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)As the federal government promises more help against the coronavirus pandemic with better distribution of vaccines, the President is joining the chorus of officials reminding Americans they need to continue to wear face coverings and social distance for the rest of winter and spring.\n \"The brutal truth is it's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks, not vaccines, are the best defense against Covid-19,\" President Joe Biden said Tuesday while announcing the federal government would buy and distribute more vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer.\n Biden has pushed for 100 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of his presidency and for Americans to wear masks for that time.\n People are wrong to think the worst days of the pandemic are behind them, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n \"I think people, with all the talk about vaccines, you know, have started to look at this more in the rearview mirror,\" Gupta said. \"The percentage of people that think the worst is behind us and in front of us is half and half. Half the country thinks the worst is behind us (but) some of the worst days may be in front depending on the (coronavirus) variants.\"\n Health officials are \"extremely\" worried about the new coronavirus variants that have been detected in the United States and what they could mean over the coming months, one expert said.\n \"We've seen what happens in other countries that have actually had coronavirus under relatively good control, then these variants took over and they had explosive spread of the virus, and then overwhelmed hospitals,\" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday.\n Some countries are struggling with an increase in new cases. The number of cases worldwide since the pandemic began topped 100 million Tuesday. More than a quarter of those cases have been reported in the United States.\n How the new variants spread is a concern for health experts. Officials in Minnesota announced Monday they detected the P.1 variant of the virus in a traveler from Brazil. The variant is one of four being closely watched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and appears to be more easily transmissible. CDC officials have also said another variant -- called B.1.1.7 and first spotted in the United Kingdom -- has been detected in more than 20 states.\n \"If there is something more contagious among us, if we thought that going to the grocery store before was relatively safe, there's actually a higher likelihood of contracting coronavirus through those everyday activities,\" she said.\n \"Wearing an even better mask, reducing the number of times that we have to go out shopping, or in indoor crowded settings, all of that will be helpful,\" Wen added.\n The numbers are a far cry from where some officials hoped the United States would be by now, but Biden said Monday he is hopeful the country could soon be administering 1.5 million vaccines daily. That's about a 50% faster pace than the goal of a million doses per day that he's promised since before inauguration.\n Biden on Tuesday announced the government will soon increase vaccine distribution by 16% from 8.6 million doses to 10 million doses per week, He said the government is working to order 200 million more doses total from Moderna and Pfizer.\n Biden said he hopes to have most Americans vaccinated by late summer or early fall.\n States will get a three-week notice of how many doses to expect, he said.\n \"I think the three-week forecast will make the biggest difference,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha,  dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University. \"When I have been talking to state officials, they get basically no forecast whatsoever. ... (A) three-week forecast will make it much, much easier for states to make sure that they have places staffed and ready to go and give people vaccines.\"\n Across the country, health leaders and state officials have been working to enhance their vaccination strategies and boost the number of shots going into arms.\n CVS will begin offering on-site vaccinations at more than 270 locations across 11 states in February, Dr. David Fairchild, associate chief medical officer at CVS Health, said Monday.\n \"We're definitely prepared and want to play a large role in helping to get the vaccine out there,\" he added. \"Our internal goal is to have a capacity to perform 25 million shots a month or more.\"\n California is switching to a third-party system instead of counties and hospitals running their own vaccination deliveries, officials said.\n Officials from the state's health and human services agency and government operations agency said the new system will simplify eligibility, standardize information and data, and address the available supply of doses by streamlining the vaccination process.\n West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice debuted a new online pre-registration system Monday, which allows residents to pre-register to receive a vaccine. Since the system's launch Monday morning, more than 32,000 residents had scheduled a vaccine appointment, the governor said. That will work alongside an existing hotline that residents can call to pre-register.\n Illinois announced it was entering its next stage of vaccinations Monday, opening guidelines to people 65 and older and frontline essential workers including teachers, first responders and grocery workers. The governor added as more doses become available, more mass vaccination sites will open up.\n Chicago will target 15 \"high-need communities based on the City's COVID vulnerability index,\" the mayor's office said in a news release. The initiative will include \"strike teams\" that will reach \"those who may be disconnected from more traditional vaccine administration channels,\" it said.\n \"Our city is two-thirds people of color,\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a news briefing. \"Yet we are falling woefully behind in the number of people of color who've been vaccinated today.\"\n Lightfoot said that of the nearly 108,000 residents who have received their first vaccine dose, only 17% are Latino and about 15% are Black.\n Students in K-12 schools can go back to classrooms with the right mitigation strategies, according to a study published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n The study looked at more than 5,500 students and staff members at 17 schools in Wood County, Wisconsin.\n Staff were told to wear masks, social distance and limit time in shared indoor spaces. If a student was out of school with Covid-19 symptoms, their siblings also were told to stay home.\n Each student was provided with three to five double- or triple-layered cloth masks. Masks were required in schools and statewide, and more than 92% of students of all age groups wore them.\n A total of 191 people tested positive for the coronavirus. The researchers found that Covid-19 case rates in schools were 37% lower than in the surrounding community.\n Contact tracing and investigation determined that seven of those 191 cases were contracted in school. Three of the seven students who tested positive were from one elementary school class.\n The good news, Fauci told CNN in a separate interview Monday, is that current Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be effective against the new variants.\n \"The sobering news,\" he added, \"(is) as you get more and more replication, you can get more and more of evolution of mutants, which means you always got to be a step ahead of it.\"\n Moderna said Monday its vaccine created antibodies that neutralized Covid-19 variants first found in the United Kingdom and South Africa. There are concerns the vaccine may have a somewhat decreased efficacy against the strain first spotted in South Africa, and the company is working on a booster shot aimed at fighting it.\n But as Covid-19 evolves, it will be important to prove \"time and time again\" that vaccines provide protection against new strains, Moderna president Dr. Stephen Hoge said in a panel discussion Monday.\n \"Until we've got this thing sort of fully suppressed and in control, and people are broadly vaccinated or seropositive and protected against it, it's going to be an ongoing battle for the next couple of years,\" he said.\n Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is being tested in South Africa, the United States and Brazil, and those results could provide insight into how well it works against emerging variants, one of its developers said.\n \"If we see the efficacy results ... it'll give us insights not only into whether or not this vaccine candidate is effective, but it'll also give us insights into whether or not the variants that are circulating in South Africa might be a problem for vaccines,\" Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard Medical School professor, told CNN.\n Johnson & Johnson told investors Tuesday it expects to share further details on its Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine study results by early next week. Alex Gorsky, chief executive officer and chair of Johnson & Johnson's board of directors, said the company is \"hopeful\" efficacy and safety data from earlier trials is a \"good precursor\" to the kind of data in the larger population in its Phase 3 trial.\n CNN's Ray Sanchez, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Kristina Sgueglia, Lauren Mascarenhas, Chris Boyette, Taylor Romine, Gisela Crespo, Omar Jimenez, Amanda Sealy, Andrea Diaz, Leslie Perrot, Maggie Fox and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

Income hit $15.5 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with the $1.64 earnings per share Wall Street predicted.\n The company's stock shot up as much as 6% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. About two hours after the report, shares were up just over 3%.\n \"What we have witnessed over the past year is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"Microsoft is powering this shift with the world's largest and most comprehensive cloud platform.\"\n Commercial cloud revenue \u2014 which includes Office 365 Commercial, an essential tool for many businesses whose employees are still working from home \u2014 posted year-over-year growth of 34%, totaling $16.7 billion.\n \"This cloud shift and WFH dynamic looks here to stay and the company stands to be a major beneficiary of this trend,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday.\n Even as Covid-19 vaccines roll out and infection numbers begin to fall, analysts expect the move to the cloud will continue. The number of workloads run in the cloud is poised to reach 55% by 2022, up from 35% currently, according to Ives. He added that he believes \"health cloud budgets (are) already in place for 2021.\"\n Microsoft also expects the strong growth in its cloud business to continue \u2014 it projects that revenue from its intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure, will grow as much as 21.5% during the current quarter, which ends March 31, CFO Amy Hood said during a call with analysts Tuesday.\n Microsoft's new Xbox Series X and Series S consoles generated massive demand during the December quarter \u2014 so much so that retailers had a hard time keeping them stocked and Microsoft asked chipmaker AMD (AMD) for help in making more available.\n Revenue from Microsoft's \"more personal computing\" segment, which Xbox sales fall under, increased 14% year-over-year to $15.1 billion.\n \"The launch of Xbox Series X and Series S was the most successful in our history, with the most devices ever sold in the launch month,\" Nadella said on the Tuesday earnings call, adding that the company is gaining console share. Hood noted that the company expects \"significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S that will still be constrained by supply\" in the current quarter.\n For the full fiscal year 2021, Hood said the company expects to generate double digit growth of both revenue and operating income.",

In the nine months since March, there have been 19 student suicides in the district, a school official confirmed to CNN. In the year before, there were only nine.\n The district did not give evidence of a direct link between the deaths and remote learning. However, six students died by suicide between March 16 and June 30, and 12 students died between July 1 and December 31. There was one more death earlier this month, a district official confirmed to CNN on Monday.\n Citing in part social and emotional wellness, the Clark County Board of Trustees voted unanimously to start bringing students back for in-person learning at a meeting on January 14.\n \"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be very challenging for education,\" said Superintendent Dr. Jesus Jara. \"We will continue to make the health and safety of students and staff a top priority. As we continue to look at the academic and health crisis that the pandemic has caused, I believe that the plan proposed provides the first steps in returning our students and educators to the classroom.\"\n The district has an early warning system put in place to help monitor student's mental health and well-being. With the help of that system, students have received more than 4,300 virtual wellness checks and more than 1,400 in-person wellness checks. Suicide protocols were initiated 30 times since March 2020, according to a report put out by the district.\n The district's report also outlined the strain long-term remote learning is having on students academically, stating that 90.4% of schools have given more Fs this year than the previous year, and 77.2% of schools gave more Ds than last year. Among those who got an F during the Fall semester, 11.2% of them earned all As and Bs in the Fall of 2019.\n As Covid-19 cases climb across the country, school districts are faced with an impossible dilemma of protecting student mental health by returning to the classroom or physical health by keeping them home.\n In October, a group of researchers warned about the mental health consequences of Covid-19, predicting a second wave of issues like increased deaths from suicide and drug overdoses.\n However, some teachers in the US have died from the virus -- which has led to a push from some educators to move to all-virtual classes.\n In a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the kind of spread seen in crowded offices and long-term care facilities has not been reported in schools.\n In-school transmission has occurred, but the researchers said there is little evidence that it contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.\n To get help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454.\n CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report",

During that briefing, acting US Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman admitted her department knew there was a \"strong potential for violence\" targeting Congress, but did not take appropriate steps to prevent it.\n DeLauro said the revelation left her stunned and multiple federal law enforcement agencies failed by not acting on the intelligence they had.\n \"They had the information. They did not act on it. And a question that I have, and one that I think we need to get to the bottom of, is who made the decision not to act?\" DeLauro told CNN.\n \"People said today that there was ample evidence, that the intelligence agencies had ample evidence, that an angry mob was going to descend on Washington with Congress' meeting to certify the election as the intended target,\" DeLauro added.\n After participating in the hearing, Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Pennsylvania Democrat, told CNN, \"It was only by pure dumb luck that elected officials, staffers and more Capitol policemen were not killed.\"\n Cartwright said his theory of why there was not enough action to prepare was \"that people were more worried about optics more than they were worried about security.\"\n Cartwright said he directly asked those briefing the committee whether concerns about how security preparations would look was a reason for not acting.\n \"I got no denials, and I got a couple of confirmations,\" he told CNN, declining to say who specifically confirmed that optics were a motive behind inaction.\n The briefing came as US Capitol Police officers debate whether to hold a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day of insurrection, including Pittman. One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief the day of the siege at the Capitol and \"never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way, shape or form.\" Officers have told CNN that they felt abandoned and betrayed by the department's leadership.\n According to prepared remarks, Pittman told lawmakers that Capitol Police knew two days before the insurrection that militia and White supremacist groups would be at the Capitol on January 6, and some of those people planned to be armed.\n Pittman outlined four things that made the department ill-equipped to respond to the attack: a lack of manpower, not having the right equipment on hand or easily accessible, a lack of consistency in following the process for sealing the building and communication over radios and the public address system being hard to hear during the attack.\n CNN has attempted to speak to some of the Republican lawmakers who attended the briefing.\n Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the committee, described the briefing as a \"critical first step\" and joined her Democratic colleagues in calling out the failure to act on intelligence that could have prevented the attack.\n \"While many questions remain, it is clear that the failure was not due to a lack of intelligence, but rather a failure to properly act on this intelligence. This is unacceptable and left our law enforcement men and women on the ground unprepared for the danger they would face. These heroes not only deserve our gratitude for successfully keeping Members and staff safe, they deserve answers and a commitment to do better,\" Granger said in a statement.\n Rep. David Valadao, a California Republican, said in a statement to CNN, \"Today's security briefing with the House Appropriations Committee on the events of January 6 was very informative, and I hope the committee continues to hold them.\"\n DeLauro said members were not given a clear answer when they repeatedly asked for who was responsible for the lack of preparedness and response.\n \"No one would answer the question,\" DeLauro said to CNN, suggesting that it may be worth having one individual in charge going forward to avoid the kind of miscommunication that occurred the day of the attack.\n The Connecticut Democrat said there was no specific line of questioning around tours given prior to January 6 during the briefing, other than a mention from the FBI that all matters relating to the genesis of the insurrection are being investigated. She closed her remarks at the briefing by saying tours are something that need examined, and something she believed was being investigated.\n Cartwright shared that there was a \"good discussion\" about how to more \"carefully vet\" security forces, particularly those tasked with defending the Capitol.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Sen. Patrick Leahy returned home Tuesday night from the hospital after seeking treatment out of an abundance of caution, according to a spokesman.\n Leahy had been hospitalized just hours after presiding over the opening of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. A spokesman said he was not feeling well and the Capitol physician recommended he go to a local hospital.\n \"The Capitol Physician suggested that Senator Leahy go to George Washington University Hospital this evening for observation, out of an abundance of caution,\" spokesman David Carle said in a statement. \"After getting test results back, and after a thorough examination, Senator Leahy now is home. He looks forward to getting back to work. Patrick and Marcelle deeply appreciate the well wishes they have received tonight.\n As the Senate president pro tempore -- the longest-serving senator of the majority party -- the 80-year-old Vermont Democrat is presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in lieu of Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts, who oversaw Trump's first impeachment trial, chose not to oversee the proceedings because Trump is no longer in office, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n Sen. Dick Durbin, the second highest-ranking Senate Democrat, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier on Tuesday evening that Leahy could be back in the chamber Wednesday.\n \"Pat Leahy's wife, Marcelle, is a nurse, and she's with him, and this was just an abundance of caution,\" Durbin said. \"He was feeling uncomfortable, as you mentioned, so they wanted to give him a trip to the hospital so they can watch him for a little while. She says things are going well, so we have all got our fingers crossed he will be back tomorrow.\"\n Leahy's hospitalization came soon after the impeachment trial began Tuesday afternoon with his swearing in. Leahy then swore in the rest of the Senate, and senators went four at a time to sign an \"oath book\" as jurors for the trial.\n The deal that Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached last week pushed back the start date for the substance of the proceedings, but several ceremonial functions of the trial took place Tuesday.\n The trial is effectively on hold as the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial to begin in earnest.\n House impeachment managers, a group of Democratic lawmakers who will act as prosecutors presenting the case against Trump during the trial, delivered the single article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday, which typically triggers a quick start to an impeachment trial. But the move to delay the start gives Democrats more time to confirm Biden's Cabinet and potentially take up a new Covid-19 relief bill while Trump's defense team has more time to prepare for trial.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Jeremy Herb and Lauren Fox contributed to this report",

        "title": "WHO team in Wuhan to begin long-delayed coronavirus investigation after clearing quarantine",
        "body_text": "Hong Kong (CNN)A team of World Health Organization (WHO) investigators is preparing to leave quarantine in the Chinese city of Wuhan and begin a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Members of the 13-person international team will finish their two-week quarantine in the next 24 hours, stepping out into a city that was once the center of the global outbreak but is now, a year on, largely returned to normal. Scrutiny of the team's work will be immense, as they navigate what is likely to be a political minefield in uncovering how the virus that brought much of the world to a halt first emerged.\n \"The eyes of the world are focused on this, the opinions of the world are focused on this,\" Dutch virologist and team member Marion Koopmans told CNN Wednesday morning, as she prepared for a final round of meetings before leaving her quarantine hotel.\n \"We are aware of it, there is no way around that. That's why we really try to keep focused, we are scientists, we are not politicians, we are trying to really look at this from the scientific perspective.\"\n Part of that involves abandoning all preconceived notions about how the virus evolved and spread, to look at what the evidence says, and go from there, Koopmans said. The team has spent the past two weeks in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists, \"discussing what we know, what we don't know.\"\n Demand for answers will be great, especially after the investigation itself was delayed several times, but Koopmans cautioned patience.\n \"I think we really have to manage expectations, if you look at some of the earlier quests for the origins of outbreaks, they have taken years to complete,\" she said. \"The early and relatively easy studies have been done, have already been published.\"\n An earlier report by a WHO team in China, published in February 2020, found that \"key knowledge gaps remain\" about the virus, though it endorsed previous findings that the virus appeared to have originated in animals, with the likely first outbreak at a seafood market in Wuhan.\n While the WHO team will be attempting to ignore the political element to their work, doing so may be difficult.\n Last week, the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said that both WHO and China could have acted faster and more forcefully to contain the start of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n Several countries, most vocally the United States and Australia, have accused Beijing of downplaying the outbreak's severity during its early stages, and preventing an effective response until it was too late. In particular, officials in Wuhan have been accused of silencing whistleblowers and concealing evidence of the virus transmitting between humans, in a replay of the 2003 SARS epidemic.\n WHO itself also came under immense pressure, with then-US President Donald Trump saying last year that it was a \"puppet\" of China, and pulling Washington's funding for the organization. Soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden reversed that order.\n As China has got the pandemic under control domestically, in stark contrast to the ongoing chaos in the US and much of Europe, Beijing has begun to push back forcefully on any accusations of blame, advancing alternate -- and unfounded -- theories about the origin of the pandemic, including conspiracies about a US military germ lab.\n In Geneva last week, the head of the US delegation to WHO called on China to allow the team in Wuhan access to \"care givers, former patients and lab workers,\" and to share all scientific studies into animal, human and environmental samples taken from a market in Wuhan, Reuters reported.\n \"We have a solemn duty to ensure that this critical investigation is credible and is conducted objectively and transparently,\" US representative Garrett Grigsby said, sparking a rebuke from China's delegation, which accused him of \"political pressure.\"\n A year on from when Wuhan entered lockdown, after the city has been repeatedly scrubbed and sanitized to wipe out any trace of the virus, there is skepticism over just how much the team of investigators will be able to uncover.\n \"It's very challenging for anybody to find out the cause of this,\" said Jin Dongyan, a virology professor at the University of Hong Kong. \"It would be very difficult now to obtain any first line evidence to investigate the origin of the SARS-COV-2 and the index cases of Covid-19. It's really challenging. And I doubt these international experts can find anything. I'm not very optimistic.\"\n To what extent the Chinese authorities are willing to cooperate is unclear, particularly as even senior health officials have begun to question whether the virus originated in Wuhan, advancing the \"multiple origins\" theory that was first put out by the country's propaganda organs in an apparent attempt to deflect blame over the initial handling of the pandemic.\n Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that whether the WHO teams' trip would be successful \"depends a lot on how much the government is willing to be cooperative and accommodating in terms of sharing the research, allow them to have access to places of interest, talking to people they want to speak with.\"\n \"The main problem is that this issue itself has been so politicized, makes it really difficult to conduct independent, transparent, thorough investigation,\" Huang said, adding that \"the international society should also maybe lower their expectations, have a more realistic understanding of what this trip entails, especially given that they plan to wrap up the study in a few months, really we should not expect something magical.\"",

        "title": "Dr. Deborah Birx's shocking interview is way too late",
        "body_text": "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \"OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.\" Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n (CNN)Now she tells us.\n After nearly a year of supposedly coordinating the Trump White House's coronavirus response, Dr. Deborah Birx went public about the mishandling of a pandemic that has left more than 400,000 Americans dead. Dr. Birx went on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday night, and she dropped some bombshells.\n But it's not just the former president who came out looking bad. While Birx isn't wholly or even mostly responsible for Donald Trump's shocking negligence on a Covid-19 response, viewers were still left wondering: Why are we just learning about this now?\n Right off the bat, Birx said she was the only person in the White House working full-time on the Covid-19 response. A pandemic was raging, killing more Americans than any war in more than 150 years, and the Trump administration was fighting it with a dedicated team of one.\n Then Birx told her interviewer, Margaret Brennan, how the Trump administration simply passed the buck, ceding all responsibility to the states and offering them only \"support\" -- never fully explaining what that meant or understanding what they needed.\n And she disclosed that there was \"parallel data\" coming into the White House that Trump relied on. Birx said she suspected it came from Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist Trump put on the task force, who spent the pandemic spreading dangerous misinformation about Covid-19.\n She said her own ideas for fighting the virus, which she developed based on deep data-dives and extensive research and planning, were disregarded. She said she didn't know if the former president was told to listen to her at all. And she added that the Trump team muzzled her, refusing to let her speak with the national press and clearly explain the real threat of the disease to the American people.\n Another jarring revelation: That nobody but Birx and her one aide regularly wore masks in the White House.\n All of this would have been good to know back in the spring. Or summer. Or fall, as Americans were deciding whether or not to keep Trump in office.\n Birx's interview is shocking and enraging. But to be fair to Birx, there are mitigating circumstances. Unlike the many power-seeking enablers and hangers-on who eagerly attached themselves to the Trump administration, Birx is a public servant who went where she was called in an emergency. The country was in crisis. Refusing to work for Trump could have put more lives at risk.\n \"If I think I have something to add, I feel like it's my obligation to the American public to go in and do that,\" Birx told Brennan. \"That's what a civil servant is supposed to do.\"\n It would have been great if she had occasionally stood up to the president and swatted down his dangerous lies, the way Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did. But she occupied a different position, and lacked Fauci's experience navigating complex domestic politics. When Atlas came into the picture and had the ear of the president, Birx was, as Fauci himself explained, living \"with this person in the White House every day, so it was much more of a painful situation for her.\"\n Fauci was more distant from the administration, which gave him greater independence and wider leeway.\n And Birx was no Fauci, a well-known expert with a stellar reputation who quickly gained a devoted following and was widely trusted by the public. Some of that trust surely came from his willingness to gently contradict the former president. But Fauci had another advantage over Birx: while Trump is mercurial and vindictive toward anyone he perceives as contradicting him or threatening his authority, he is particularly awful to women who cross him.\n It's tough to imagine that Birx would have changed much of anything by speaking out. She had a choice: She could call out the president for lying, lose her job and leave the White House Covid-19 task force in the hands of people like Atlas. Or she could keep her mouth shut and try to clean things up from the inside.\n She said she chose the second option, setting off to meet with state governors and help them with their Covid responses -- the only effective strategy at her disposal, since the Trump administration punted everything to the states.\n Birx fundamentally sees herself as a person with technical expertise who helps to solve public health problems, not a supporter of any particular administration. But like so many long-time federal employees and creatures of Washington, she seems to have badly miscalculated just how political this administration would make a deadly virus, and just how willingly they would ignore the science and endanger the public to soothe the ego of a fragile, unpredictable man.\n Even all of this context, though, doesn't absolve Birx. Yes, she's finally spilling a few of the beans about the former president's rank mismanagement of this crisis. But even in this latest interview, she was hesitant to be too critical of the Trump administration. She outlined her frustrations, but avoided pointed criticism of her former bosses. Even now, with Trump gone and retirement looming, Birx was unwilling to hold the previous administration fully to account.\n At the very least, there should be a thorough investigation into how the Covid-19 response was so bungled. Who exactly is responsible for failing to protect millions of Americans from disease and death? How did all this happen?  Unfortunately, it's still not clear that Birx would be a transparent and fully forthcoming part of that process.\n Birx knows she made grave errors. \"I could have done more, been more outspoken, maybe been more outspoken publicly,\" she said. While she didn't know how far she could have pushed the envelope, she wished she had pushed harder.\n So do we.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress, a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page shows.\n Greene, who represents Georgia's 14th Congressional District, frequently posted far-right extremist and debunked conspiracy theories on her page, including the baseless QAnon conspiracy which casts former President Donald Trump in an imagined battle against a sinister cabal of Democrats and celebrities who abuse children.\n In one post, from January 2019, Greene liked a comment that said \"a bullet to the head would be quicker\" to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In other posts, Greene liked comments about executing FBI agents who, in her eyes, were part of the \"deep state\" working against Trump.\n In one Facebook post from April 2018, Greene wrote conspiratorially about the Iran Deal, one of former President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievements. A commenter asked Greene, \"Now do we get to hang them ?? Meaning H & O ???,\" referring to Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n Greene replied, \"Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.\"\n After CNN reached out to Greene, her personal Twitter account posted a statement in which she did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page.\n \"Over the years, I've had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet,\" she wrote.\n Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN's KFile.\n CNN reached out to Pelosi's office for comment multiple times but did not receive a response.\n Though her tenure in Congress has only lasted a few weeks, Greene is already facing calls to leave the House for her role in fanning the flames of the Capitol insurrection earlier this month after she objected to the election certification process and falsely insisted that Trump would remain president.\n After Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez called on Greene to be expelled from the House for her role in the insurrection, Greene condemned the violence at the Capitol and falsely accused \"Antifa/BLM terrorism\" and Democratic politicians of stoking the insurrection.\n \"I fully condemn ALL violence. The Antifa/BLM terrorism funded on ActBlue rests with Democrat accomplices like @CoriBush @Ilhan @KamalaHarris @AOC @timkaine & many more... Those who stoke insurrection & spread conspiracies have blood on their hands. They must be expelled,\" she tweeted.\n Last week Greene faced calls to resign from the survivors of the Parkland shooting survivors after Media Matters reported she agreed with comments calling the 2018 shooting a \"false flag\" operation, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.\n CNN's KFile found additional comments from Greene where she called David Hogg, a survivor and activist, \"#littleHitler\" and spread a conspiracy that he was a \"bought and paid little pawn\" and actor.\n Before she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene created a White House petition in January 2019 to impeach the House speaker for \"crimes of treason,\" citing Pelosi's support of so-called sanctuary policies that \"are serving illegals and not United States citizens\" and because Pelosi did not support Trump's border wall.\n In one speech, promoting the petition, Greene suggested Pelosi could be executed for treason.\n \"She's a traitor to our country, she's guilty of treason,\" Greene says in the video, which she posted on Facebook at the time. \"She took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold our laws. And she gives aid and comfort to our enemies who illegally invade our land. That's what treason is. And by our law representatives and senators can be kicked out and no longer serve in our government. And it's, uh, it's a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.\"\n In another Facebook Live broadcast from inside Pelosi's office on February 22, 2019, Greene suggested the House speaker will \"suffer death or she'll be in prison\" for her \"treason.\" Notably, Greene never mentions a trial. In another broadcast from later that day, she suggested California Rep. Maxine Waters was \"just as guilty of treason as Nancy Pelosi.\"\n In the comments of her Facebook posts, often promoting the petition, Greene liked a comment that said \"through removal or death, doesn't matter, as long as she goes,\" referring to Pelosi, and another that encouraged Greene to \"beat Pelosi's ass.\"\n The petition for Pelosi's impeachment and removal for treason amassed over 420,000 signatures as of January 2021.\n On social media, Greene portrays herself as an opponent to political violence and casts Democrats as the real instigators of political violence, either real or imaginary, who get away with threatening calls for violence.\n \"Do any of you remember a day when talking about assassinating the President resulted in getting arrested? As in arrested in real life, not FB [Facebook] jail. When was that? Pre-2016 I think, right??? But if you are a conservative that's a different story!\" wrote Greene in 2019.\n While Greene notes in Facebook posts that she disavows and denounces violence, within the comment sections of Greene's Facebook page, commenters frequently cheer for politicians to be executed by hanging or firing squad.\n Elsewhere on her Facebook page, Greene liked comments that advocated to \"arrest\" Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry and one comment that said, \"HANG that bitch,\" referring to either Obama or Kerry or possibly both of them. She also liked a comment that urged for \"civil war 2.0\" to begin.\n Greene, who has embraced and spread the baseless conspiracy theory about a \"deep state\" working to usurp Trump's agenda, suggested in Facebook posts that FBI agents disloyal to Trump were traitors.\n She liked a comment that said, \"Trump already said there were some great ones working with FBI but some have fallen and quite frankly need to be hung for TREASON!\" Another she liked said, \"These Traitors need to be put to death as an example of what will no longer be tolerated in our country!!!\"",

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n (CNN)The national reckoning over where and how schoolchildren should be educated as the pandemic drags on is finally here -- or at least it should be.\n So far this week, major districts in Chicago and New Jersey have shelved plans to physically return to the classroom at the last minute in the face of opposition from teachers. On Tuesday, the CDC released a study that found the risk of Covid transmission in the classroom is minimal when paired with precautions like mask-wearing and social-distancing.\n We know that remote learning is failing Black, Hispanic and poor students. Schools, as we've written before, are also at the fulcrum of unlocking the economy to get past Covid. Here's more evidence from Gallup about how parents of remote learners are less likely to work full time.\n The CDC's study focused on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, during in-person learning last fall. What's below is from CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, although the bolded words are mine:\n When a student or staff member tested positive for the virus, school officials used interviews to identify close contacts -- anyone who was within 6 feet of the person for longer than 15 minutes over the course of 24 hours. Those close contacts were required to quarantine at home, and if they developed symptoms during that time, officials investigated whether in-school spread was the cause.\n Here's a passage from a report by CNN's Elizabeth Stuart on Monday: Public schools in Montclair, New Jersey, were scheduled to reopen for hybrid learning for elementary school students on Monday, the first day of in-person learning for students since March 2020. But plans were scrapped at the last minute after the local teachers' union cited its safety concerns and its members refused to return to classrooms.\n Stuart, along with Mirna Alsharif, reported Tuesday the status of the 20 largest public school districts in the US:\n 9 are currently all online. (One district had briefly opened in the fall, but has been all online since the holidays.) 8 offer full in-person or a choice of full online (Several of these are in Florida, where the governor ordered brick and mortar schools to offer in-person learning) 2 have hybrid plans (some in-person and some online) 1 has a combination of plans (Hawaii's plans are based on island infection rates, so plans vary from island to island)\n Even in districts that are open, like New York, a large number of kids are still not in the classroom -- specifically middle and high school students. Spikes in positivity rates in places where schools have remained open or opened routinely led to heated debates about whether those schools should stay open.\n You cannot, if you're a kid, go to public school. My kids' district has set a mid-February target for younger kids who choose to return to the classroom. Schools have been completely closed since March. The number of children failing classes, particularly Black and brown kids, has skyrocketed.\n But the district has missed previous markers to put special needs kids back in classrooms. It has set metrics, based on the spread of Covid in the community. It seems very unlikely those metrics will be met. Parents are expecting a notice pushing off the mid-February delay.\n All that makes the CDC's newly released report so maddening to parents wondering when their dual roles as full-time workers and daytime school aides and IT assistants will end.\n \"It's not so much about the idea teachers aren't going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and as safely as we can rationally make it. We can do that. We should be able to open up every school kindergarten through eighth grade if, in fact, we administer these tests,\" he said.\n It's a bold promise, since the federal government does not currently -- nor will it soon -- control local school districts. Biden signed an executive order setting as policy his goal to help get kids back in school. Read it here.\n It's a policy to issue stronger and better recommendations -- direct guidance and advice for districts from the national level. It does not provide new funds to school districts that need to upgrade facilities and invest in tests and PPE for their students. He'll need Congress and the Senate to get those funds released. And he'll need the teachers' unions to get on board. Read more here.\n Last spring, when all kids were home, the concern was about how wealthier parents could afford the time or money to create pods or hire tutors.\n But now some American kids are going to school and a large portion are not. Some are following a hybrid model. Some are all virtual. Ten months after nearly every school kid spent some time out of the classroom, the nation's children are all over the place.

        "body_text": "(CNN)A federal judge's action Tuesday preventing President Joe Biden's 100-day pause in deportations demonstrated the land mines that await the new administration in the nation's courts.\n The short-term order by the Texas-based judge could also force a confrontation up to the US Supreme Court, where the Biden legal team already faces hard choices over how aggressively to press new legal positions before the nine justices -- six of whom are conservatives, with three appointed by former President Donald Trump.\n US District Judge Drew Tipton, also a Trump appointee, sided on Tuesday with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump loyalist who has challenged Biden's temporary suspension of deportations.\n The nationwide scope of Tipton's order further intensifies debate over broad-scale actions against the executive branch imposed by a lone judge, which were the bane of the Trump administration.\n \"These nationwide injunctions have frustrated presidential policy for most of the President's term with no clear end in sight,\" then-Attorney General William Barr declared in a 2019 speech.\n Trump Justice Department lawyers routinely were able to convince the Supreme Court to lift those injunctions, although that sometimes took months. The conservative Supreme Court majority may not be as sympathetic to Biden's ventures as it was to Trump's.\n All told, Tuesday's court action against an administration barely a week old reveals how tough it might be to advance a new agenda on immigration or any domestic policy if hit with lawsuits before judges who became increasingly right-wing during the Trump tenure.\n As Biden promotes new programs and encounters legal objections, there is no escaping that they will be resolved by life-tenured judges, 30% of whom were named by Trump.\n The pause on deportations, announced immediately after Biden's inauguration, reflects the desire to dismantle Trump's anti-immigrant practices. Biden also halted construction on the wall at the southern border.\n Department of Homeland Security officials said the 100-day hold on deportations would allow the administration to review current practices and to ensure \"a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety.\"\n The moratorium, which began last Friday -- the day that Paxton sued -- excludes some categories of individuals, including those who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, and have waived rights to remain in the US.\n Paxton, who led a failed lawsuit at the Supreme Court contesting Biden's election victory over Trump, contended that the 100-day suspension violated federal procedural requirements and breached a pact the Trump administration had made with Texas just before Trump left office. It dictated that the Department of Homeland Security would consult with the state before changing certain immigration practices.\n It is not clear whether such recent agreements made with various states could be legally enforced. Tipton said he would need more time and additional legal briefing to review the question as he set the 14-day temporary restraining order.\n But crucially, Tipton agreed with Texas that it appeared the suspension violated the Administrative Procedure Act's safeguards against \"arbitrary and capricious\" executive action.\n The January 20 memorandum \"not only fails to consider potential policies more limited in scope and time, but it also fails to provide any concrete, reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations,\" Tipton wrote.\n Tipton said Texas had shown it could be hurt by the policy because of the millions of dollars it puts toward social services and other state benefits for undocumented immigrants.\n Regarding his imposition of a nationwide order, he wrote that the \"100-day pause plainly affects national immigration policy, which demands uniformity.\"\n Federal judges often shudder at the suggestion that they would ideologically align with the presidents who appointed them, and Chief Justice John Roberts famously answered Trump's disparagement of an \"Obama judge\" with this admonition: \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n Regardless of Roberts' declaration, the fact remains that Biden may find a skeptical judiciary.\n Trump filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution's Russell Wheeler -- in addition to the three new Supreme Court justices.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Several hundred White House employees had been vaccinated for Covid-19 as of Tuesday, two Biden administration officials told CNN, with more expected in the coming weeks.\n Most officials who have received vaccinations work for the Executive Office of the President, meaning they operate inside the White House complex, either in the West Wing or Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door. Dozens of staffers are still working remotely but the White House is prioritizing vaccinations for people who work on site and aims to eventually vaccinate all in-person staff, an official told CNN.\n Even with the vaccinations, White House officials are still wearing masks when on the grounds and many are working from home or participating in virtual meetings from their offices.\n The staffers, including those who have been working remotely, came to the Eisenhower building on Tuesday for their first vaccinations.\n White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz told CNN that the latest round of vaccinations came after about three dozen members of the senior staff, national security team and incoming Cabinet nominees received their first doses in early January.\n He said the White House medical team was \"working toward vaccinating all in-person staff over the next few week to ensure a COVID-safe working environment around the President and key leaders who have national security and continuity of government responsibilities.\"\n The Biden administration's vaccination effort marks another clear break from former President Donald Trump's approach to White House coronavirus safety.\n Trump and other White House staff had regularly flouted US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for safety during the pandemic such as wearing face masks and social distancing.\n And Trump said last month that he had asked White House staffers to get the vaccine \"somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,\" after it surfaced that high-ranking administration officials were set to receive some of the first doses in the US in the US.\n But in Biden's nascent administration, many White House staffers are working from home, and will continue to do so in the coming days and weeks.\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a news briefing last week that all staff entering the complex will be required to undergo a Covid test, wear an N95 mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Acrylic glass barriers were also mounted on desks in the West Wing, something Trump officials had resisted.\n \"The President has asked us to also be models to the American people, and that's vitally important to us as well,\" she said.\n While many of the West Wing's offices have been assigned, the building will not be at capacity, as it was for much of last year despite the pandemic. The few places that did implement some work-from-home requirements under Trump, such as the National Security Council, will continue having officials work remotely.\n This story has been updated with additional information Tuesday.\n CNN's Kevin Liptak and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden wants schools to reopen but believes Congress must make the necessary investments to safely return to in-person learning, his chief of staff Ron Klain said Tuesday, on the heels of several school districts' last-minute canceled re-openings and a government study indicating teaching kids in person is possible with the right precautions.\n \"I'll give you a word: Money,\" Klain told CNN's Erin Burnett when asked why he thought some public schools across the country are still closed in places where private schools are open. \"That's why the President of the United States sent a plan into Congress, even before he took office, to make the investments you need to make the schools safe.\"\n Klain referenced a study published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which researchers looked at data on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, which conducted in-person learning last fall. They found lower Covid-19 case rates than in the community at large, and few cases of in-school transmission. Cohorts of 11 to 20 students from the same grade level met for classes and lunch indoors, where students were often seated next to the same person.\n \"Students in very small pods, classes of about 11 or 12, distanced, in a rural area -- they can go to school safely, and governors who made those investments,\" Klain said, adding that \"in other states, we haven't seen those kinds of investments.\"\n \"President Biden has sent a plan to Congress that will make sure that a majority of our schools can be open within 100 days,\" he continued. \"We need Congress to pass that plan so we can do the kinds of things you need to do so that the schools can be safe, so the teachers can be safe, so the students can be safe -- sadly, it costs money.\"\n Klain also defended the Biden administration's ambitious goal to vaccinate 1 million people per day in his first 100 days in office, even after criticism from some observers who say the administration isn't being ambitious enough.\n \"We've been here seven days, we've ramped up capacity higher than it's ever been. We're moving into the states faster with more certainty and clarity,\" he said. \"But there are just some limitations on this process -- the President has been very honest, we're inheriting a system that was built with limited capacity.\"\n He added, \"We are asking the drug makers to dial that up, there's only so fast they can increase that. So we are ramping this up, as you said, capacity up starting next week and the week after. We hope capacity will go up even more in March.\"\n When pressed on Biden's comments Monday that he expects that the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day -- raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more daily vaccinations -- and whether daily vaccinations could be increased further, Klain pointed to where vaccine efforts had been previously.\n \"Our goal is to hit a million, 100 days out of 100 -- no country in the history of the world has ever done that, never happened before, so that's a pretty ambitious goal,\" he said. \"Obviously the President is pushing us to see if we can do better than that -- we hope we can do better than that. But if we hit that 100 million shots in the first 100 days, that will be something that no one has ever done before.\"\n Klain added, \"No one is going to limit shots, we're going to get as many shots into as many arms as we can. We think 100 million shots in 100 days is an ambitious goal. If we can do better than that, of course we will.\"\n CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas and Zachary B. Wolf contributed to this report.",

Young actors Adrian Groulx, Bradley Constant and Uli Latukefu play Johnson -- known by his family as \"Dewey\" -- at those ages and are tasked with bringing to life stories from the superstar's past.\n The show delves into everything from Johnson's sometimes-rebellious ways to what he describes as his \"complicated\" relationship with his wrestler father, Rocky Johnson.\n A larger-than-life figure in real life and portrayed as such on screen by Joseph Lee Anderson, the WWE Hall of Famer died suddenly in January 2020 at age 75.\n \"I think really when I look back on this and I can reflect, the series has really allowed, in a way, me to appreciate those hard times that much more,\" Johnson said. \"Because through the brilliance of (executive producers) Nahnatchka (Kahn) and Jeff (Chiang), they were able to craft something that still made audiences -- I hope and I think and fingers crossed -- feel a certain way and know that we all go through these tough times.\"\n Balance was key, he said. For all the \"complications,\" as he calls them, there was \"so much good stuff\" about his past. Like a childhood with lots of travel and being surrounded by big personalities, formidable female figures and wrestling greats (many of whom are portrayed on the show).\n What Johnson is sure of, he said, is that his late father would have relished seeing the world of professional wrestling portrayed in a \"positive\" light.\n \"He would have loved this and he would have been so proud because for the first time, certainly in prime time, we are showcasing this world that he and all of his brothers of the ring, so to speak ... gave their life to,\" Johnson said. \"I know it would meant a lot to my dad.\"\n \"Young Rock\" premieres Tuesday, February 16, on NBC.",

The $10 million payout comes after Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3 billion after pleading guilty to charges the bank conspired to violate US anti-bribery laws in a massive scandal with 1MDB.\n In October, the bank said that Solomon would face a pay cut, along with other top executives including its CFO Stephen Scherr and COO John Waldron in light of findings from the investigation that involved the US Department of Justice and other authorities.\n The scandal relates to bond sales that Goldman Sachs (GS) arranged and underwrote for 1MDB, from which the US Justice Department alleges $4.5 billion was stolen. The Justice Department accused Malaysian financier Jho Low, who had ties to the film \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" of masterminding a plot to channel the money from the fund to former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's bank accounts.\n Scherr's pay was reduced to $15.5 million from $22.5 million in 2019. Waldron's pay was slashed to $18.5 million, down from $24.5 million in 2019. In total, the three executives' total compensation for 2020 was reduced by $24 million in response to the bribery scandal fallout.\n \"While none of Messrs.

The twister also ripped a hotel apart and tore off part of a church's roof.\n About 30 people in Fultondale were injured, the city's fire chief said Tuesday.\n \"Seventeen patients were tak(en) to the ER, with various injuries and some critical,\" Fire Chief Justin McKenzie said. At least 11 people were treated on the scene.\n A young man, possibly a teen, was killed when he was trapped in the basement of his home, Fultondale Police Chief D.P. Smith said, according to AL.com.\n Several of his family members were critically injured, Smith said.\n The family had taken shelter in the basement, but apparently a tree fell on the house and caused the home to collapse.\n \"They were doing what they were supposed to be doing,\" the police chief said, according to AL.com.\n Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Walter Gonsoulin said a ninth-grade student at Fultondale High School was killed in the tornado. He was 14.\n \"Out of respect for the family, we don't want to release too much information at this particular time,\" Gonsoulin said.\n The superintendent said the storm caused significant damage to Fultondale High School, forcing it to close for the rest of the school year.\n The tornado that struck Fultondale was an EF-3 with peak winds estimated at 150 mph, according to the National Weather Service. It was 500 yards across and traveled 9.5 miles.\n Six people trapped in their homes were rescued Tuesday morning, McKenzie said.\n Rescue teams are still sifting through a hotel that collapsed overnight after most primary structures were cleared out, the fire chief said.\n The tornado spawned from a line of storms among two large systems that have put more than 100 million people under winter weather alerts.\n Tornado warnings and watches have expired in parts of Alabama and Georgia. But the same storm system is now expected to dump snow in states farther north.\n Parts of the Hampton Inn in Fultondale were obliterated, video from CNN affiliate WVTM shows.\n Hotel guest Richard Ring was watching TV when rumblings from the storm drowned out the program's sound, he told WVTM.\n He went to the bathroom and crawled under the sink.\n \"All of a sudden, the windows blew out in my room,\" Ring said. \"The lights went out. And the sirens shrieked. And it was just surreal.\"\n Guests staying at the hotel escaped and sought shelter in a nearby restaurant when another line of storms came through, WVTM reported.\n About 9,000 people live in Fultondale, just north of Birmingham.\n At 10:54 p.m. local time Monday, the National Weather Service Birmingham \"confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado was located over Chalkville, or near Trussville, moving east at 50 mph.\"\n Early Tuesday morning, the NWS Birmingham tweeted it \"will inspect the damage to determine the strength of the tornado\" that impacted the Fultondale area.\n The city of Center Point, about 13 miles northeast of Birmingham, also saw \"quite a bit of damage\" from the storm, Mayor Bobby Scott told CNN affiliate WBRC. About 16,000 people live there.\n The back half of Hilldale Baptist Church's roof is missing, and the city's recreation center also suffered damage, Scott said.\n \"Looks like we will have a long day ahead,\" Scott said. \"Hopefully we can get everything covered up.\"\n There was a bit of good news, the mayor said: \"We don't have any injuries to report right now, so we're definitely grateful for that.\"\n The Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency urged people to stay out of the area as first responders try to reach the most damaged sites.\n \"On top of road dangers such as power lines and debris ... traffic is clogging the roads,\" the agency tweeted.\n Eleven schools in the area will be closed for in-person and virtual learning Tuesday following the storm, the Jefferson County EMA tweeted.\n A tornado warning was issued Monday night for Jefferson County, Alabama, NWS Birmingham tweeted. The agency later issued tornado warnings and watches for several counties as the line of storms moved northeast through the state.\n The storm system is now expected to dump significant snow from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic Coast through Tuesday night.\n The deepest snow will pile up across Iowa.

        "title": "SpaceX, Amazon spat pits world's richest men against each other over space real estate",
        "body_text": "Austin, Texas (CNN Business)SpaceX and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 companies run by the two richest men in the world \u2014 are sparring over their competing satellite-based internet businesses, with SpaceX accusing Amazon of \"stifling competition\" and Amazon accusing SpaceX of looking to \"smother competition in the cradle.\"\n Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has an estimated net worth of $209 billion. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, has an estimated net worth of $192 billion. (By comparison, even the lower figure was higher than the annual gross domestic product of more than half the countries in the world in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.)\n At the center of the back-and-forth is a recent attempt by SpaceX to modify its license for Starlink, a massive constellation of internet satellites, of which SpaceX has already launched more than 900. SpaceX already has permission from the US federal government to launch thousands of satellites to bulk up the Starlink constellation, and in recent filings with the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX said it wants to put a few thousand of those satellites in a lower altitude than previously planned or authorized.\n That proposed change could put Starlink satellites in the way of another constellation, called Project Kuiper, that's been proposed by Amazon. The company has not yet launched any satellites, but it has secured an FCC license for the project.\n Amazon's current plans include putting some of its satellites into orbit roughly 590 km (or about 366 miles) above the Earth's surface. The changes to its license that SpaceX is advocating for would allow the company to orbit nearly 3,000 of its satellites at an altitude of between 540 and 570 km (336 to 354 miles), which Amazon argues is too close for comfort. The company argued in its objection that Starlink satellites at that altitude could cause more signal interferences with Project Kuiper satellites and other nearby satellite networks.\n But SpaceX has brushed off those concerns. SpaceX's director of satellite policy, David Goldman, said in a January 22 letter to the FCC that its competitor only came to those conclusions by \"cherrypicking data\" and \"ignoring the majority of the modification\" SpaceX has proposed.\n Musk himself piled on in a tweet Tuesday, saying \"It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation.\"\n Amazon fired back in a statement, saying, \"The facts are simple. We designed the Kuiper System to avoid interference with Starlink, and now SpaceX wants to change the design of its system.\"\n \"Those changes not only create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space, but they also increase radio interference for customers,\" the statement reads. \"Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems. It is clearly in SpaceX's interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public's interest.\"\n SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment nor has it responded to questions from CNN in more than eight months.\n For its part, SpaceX has positioned its proposed change to the Starlink system as one that is better for managing traffic and potential collisions in space, which the industry has widely recognized as a growing threat. Cheaper satellites and rockets have spurred an unprecedented spike in the number of objects being deployed into space. Much of that increase and projected increase has been driven by companies like Amazon and SpaceX that want to deploy thousands of satellites into orbits below 2,000 km, which is already the most crowded area of space.\n Putting satellites into lower orbits is generally considered a best practice because, if a satellite were to malfunction, the Earth's gravity could drag it out of orbit -\u2014 and away from other satellites \u2014 more quickly. Satellites that die at higher altitudes can become uncontrolled projectiles that linger in orbit for years or even decades. For example, a defunct Russian communications satellite and a satellite belonging to US-based telecom firm iridium collided about 789 km above Earth in 2009, creating an enormous debris field that is still in orbit and poses a constant risk to nearby satellites.\n Amazon argued in documents filed with the FCC, however, that SpaceX's proposed changes could actually put Starlink satellites at risk of colliding with Kuiper satellites. SpaceX told the FCC that Starlink satellites could wind up in orbits up to 30 km above or below the orbit they're licensed to use, and that means SpaceX satellites stationed at 560 or 570 km could end up in the path of Project Kuiper satellites licensed at nearby altitudes, an Amazon spokesperson told CNN Business.\n SpaceX did agree, according to FCC documents, that it would restrict Starlink satellites to \"altitudes of 580 km or below.\" But crucially, that restriction would only begin once Amazon began launching its own satellites, and it's not at all clear if SpaceX would abide by it before Amazon begins building its own constellation. Amazon has not said when it will begin launches, but the company's FCC license gives it through July of 2026 to build at least half of its planned constellation.",

Rather, they were accused of not following quarantine requirements after arriving in the Canadian territory.\n According to a charging document, the Bakers are from Vancouver, British Columbia, southeast of the Yukon territory.\n \"I am outraged by this selfish behaviour, and find it disturbing that people would choose to put fellow Canadians at risk in this manner,\" Streicker said. \"Reports allege these individuals were deceptive and violated emergency measures for their own advantage, which is completely unacceptable at any time, but especially during a public health crisis.\"\n CNN was unable Tuesday to reach the Bakers for comment.\n Indigenous communities are one of the groups given priority for Covid-19 vaccinations, according to Canada's vaccine guidance. They are often also disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus because they can be in areas where health care access is limited.\n Beaver Creek, the westernmost community in Canada, is the home of the White River First Nation. It is just a few miles from the Alaska border.\n The Bakers allegedly chartered a plane from the city of Whitehorse in Yukon to Beaver Creek, which has about 125 residents, and claimed they were employees at a local motel, Streicker told CNN news partner CBC.\n The Bakers arrived in Yukon from Vancouver on January 19 and were supposed to be self-isolating for 14 days in Whitehorse, according to officials. According to a complaint made to law enforcement, they traveled to Beaver Creek on January 21. The travel was not allowed because of quarantine requirements, officials said.\n After getting their shots, the couple raised suspicions in the community by asking for a ride to the airport, Streicker told CNN news partner CBC.\n \"And people were like, 'Well, why would you be going to the airport?' \" Streicker said.\n Following an investigation, the couple was located at the Whitehorse airport, and Yukon officials told CNN the couple left the territory that same day.\n Members of the mobile clinic team called the motel and were informed the couple did not work there,  Streicker told CBC.\n CNN reached out to Streicker for comment on Tuesday but did not hear back.\n As for getting the vaccines, according to Streicker, the British Columbia and Ontario health cards wouldn't have necessarily prevented the Bakers from getting them, as there are many out-of-territory workers in the region.\n Rodney, 55, and Ekaterina Baker, 32, were each charged with failure to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry into the territory and failure to behave in a manner consistent with the declaration provided upon entry into the territory.\n Charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) may include fines up to $500; up to 6 months in prison; or both, according to Yukon's Covid-19 orders and directions. The Bakers were each levied a $500 fine and $75 surcharge on both counts.\n The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were alerted to the situation. The RCMP's Yukon office said Tuesday it is investigating; it would not reply to CNN questions.\n The Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, a hotel and casino company with 25 Canadian properties, told CNN that while it didn't comment on personnel matters relating to former employees, effective January 24, Rodney Baker was no longer the president and CEO of Great Canadian and is \"no longer affiliated in any way with the company.\"\n \"As a company, Great Canadian takes health and safety protocols extremely seriously, and our company strictly follows all directives and guidance issued by public health authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate,\" the statement added.\n The White River First Nation said it \"is particularly concerned with the callous nature of these actions taken by the individuals, as they were a blatant disregard for the rules in which keep our community safe during this unprecedented global pandemic.\"\n CNN's Paula Newton and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Retirements shake up 2022 map as Republican senators eye exits  ",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Senate GOP leaders are bracing for more retirements within their ranks, as a handful of senior Republicans decline to commit to running again -- following four tumultuous years in the Trump era and facing a polarized political climate ahead.\n Three Republican senators have already decided to retire in 2022, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, whose announcement on Monday stunned his colleagues and ignited an all-out scramble in both parties to line up candidates to fill the crucial seat.\n But in interviews with CNN, several other GOP senators sidestepped questions about their political futures or made clear they were truly undecided about running again, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Richard Shelby of Alabama.\n Thune, 60, said he would make his announcement \"at some point in the future\" while brushing aside questions about his thinking. Johnson, 65, said he didn't think he had to decide \"for a while.\" Grassley, 87, said he would make his announcement in \"several months.\" Shelby, 86, said, \"I'll let you know.\"\n The party out of power typically gains seats in a president's first midterm election, but Republicans will have to defend 20 of their Senate seats in 2022, while Democrats only have to defend 14 seats.\n And the retirements of Portman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey have given Democrats greater hope of winning those seats and retaining their slim Senate majority. The Republicans' decisions have sparked primaries that could cost millions and bruise whoever emerges as the party's nominees against the Democrats.\n The three retirements were somewhat of a surprise since Portman, Burr and Toomey hover around the Senate's average age of about 62 years old. Yet they've bemoaned the Senate as an increasingly divided institution without the willpower to break the partisan gridlock. As of now, there are no Democratic senators who have decided to step aside, though that could quickly change.\n Johnson's choice is the most crucial in terms of the future control of the Senate, since his swing state went for Biden in 2020 by less than a point. The Wisconsin senator said he would \"work hard\" to \"make it possible for either myself or somebody else to keep that seat in Republican hands.\"\n When asked why he would stay in the Senate, Johnson said \"to be a firewall\" against Democratic control of Washington.\n \"I'm not a fan of this place,\" Johnson said of the Senate. \"I think this place is horribly dysfunctional.\"\n Other Republican senators from competitive states sounded like they would run again, even though some wouldn't say so explicitly.\n Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership, said that he has not made an \"official announcement.\"\n \"When I do, that's when the campaign will officially start,\" he added.\n And as she entered the Senate subway in the Capitol, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN, \"I'm running.\" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney then interjected, \"for now,\" and smiled.\n A number of other senators from deep red states have not announced their new campaigns, but told CNN that they intend to run, including GOP Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Boozman of Arkansas.\n \"I am running for the border first, and reelection second,\" said Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy.\n While Republicans are uncertain which of their members may be the next to call it quits, the decision by Portman caught many off-guard. \"He's a big loss, a big loss for the caucus, really for the country,\" Thune said of Portman.\n The Ohio Republican also had a unique connection to his state, winning his last race in 2016 by 20 points against former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland.\n \"I was surprised,\" Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told CNN of Portman's decision. When asked if the NRSC would get involved in the primary, Scott said: \"I don't know. I know that people have in the past, so we'll see. It will be a new experience.\"\n Scott has personally urged each of his incumbents to run again but said that Republicans would keep the US Senate seat in Ohio.\n \"It's another race that we'll raise the money for and win,\" he said. \"We're off and running. We're talking to candidates, we're recruiting candidates, we're raising money.\"\n But Democrats said the GOP retirements would be a boon to their chances of keeping the Senate.\n \"With Ohio now joining Pennsylvania and North Carolina as another open seat liability in a major battleground state, Republicans are confronting messy and divisive primaries and a 2022 map that keeps getting harder to defend,\" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss.\n Aspiring senators are now mulling their options and jockeying for donors. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he raised more than $1 million in two weeks since announcing he'd consider a bid. In North Carolina, former GOP Rep. Mark Walker, and Democrats Jeff Jackson and Erica Smith, have already announced Senate campaigns, while others, including Lara Trump, former President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, ponder launching theirs.\n Within hours of Portman's announcement came speculation that Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a close ally and vocal defender of Trump, would run. Other possible GOP candidates include: J.D. Vance, the author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" Josh Mandel, who dropped out of the 2018 GOP primary race to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Jon Husted, the state's lieutenant governor. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also seriously eying a Senate bid, along with at least four other Republican members of Congress: Rep. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson. Rep. Tim Ryan is among the Democrats ruminating a run.\n The Senate is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes, giving Democrats control of the chamber.\n Two of the most competitive Senate seats in 2022 could be in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, which are held by Republicans Toomey and Burr. But two new Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock will have to defend seats in Arizona and Georgia, which have only recently trended blue.\n Republicans recognize that their work will be cut out for them if more of their colleagues step aside.\n \"It certainly creates more focus on candidate recruitment,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican who is running for reelection in South Carolina next year. Retirements, he said, amount to a \"loss of institutional knowledge on our side that's impossible to replace.\"\n \"But finding interesting, fascinating and exciting candidates will be our task,\" Scott said.\n CNN's Aaron Pellish, Clare Foran and Jeff Zeleny contributed.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)The day after President Joe Biden's inauguration, a large number of National Guard troops protecting the US Capitol moved to a nearby parking garage to rest. Outrage quickly grew among lawmakers over the situation.\n As CNN reported Friday, miscommunication and confusion surrounded the incident and it remains unclear how, exactly, the decision to move the Guard members came about.\n Republican and Democratic lawmakers have called for investigations into who was responsible for the initial decision.\n Thursday evening, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted out an image of the Guard members in the garage and asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \"Why are American troops who are tasked with keeping security at the Capitol being forced to sleep in a parking lot?\"\n On Monday evening, McCarthy went further on Fox News, claiming Pelosi removed the Guard members.\n After criticizing Pelosi's opposition to the use of federal forces during last summer's riots and protests, McCarthy claimed that \"after the inaugural, when these National Guard -- these men and women defending us sitting in the Capitol, she was kicking them out into the winter.\"\n According to CNN's reporting, multiple groups including the Capitol Police, National Guard, and the Senate Rules Committee have denied blame for the event, showing a significant breakdown of communication. But none of the different accusations from these groups place blame of making the decision on Pelosi. You can read CNN's reporting here.\n Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, told CNN on Tuesday, \"The Speaker's Office had no role in or knowledge of this matter until news reports emerged,\" adding that McCarthy's staff \"were briefed at the same time as our office was.\"\n On Thursday evening, when McCarthy first tweeted asking Pelosi and Schumer why the Guard members were quartered in the garage, his spokesperson Michele Exner told CNN that \"both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer oversee and ultimately are responsible for the Capitol's administrative matters.\"\n McCarthy's office did not return CNN's request for comment on the minority leader's new claim that Pelosi personally kicked the National Guard out of the Capitol.",

        "title": "8 myths about the Covid-19 vaccine -- Dr. Wen explains",
        "body_text": "(CNN)The United States crossed the terrible milestone of 400,000 deaths from coronavirus early last week, and there are currently over 2.1 million reported deaths worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n There are also new variants with mutations that could make Covid-19 even more transmissible and possibly even more deadly. However, there is also encouraging news, with two vaccines authorized for emergency use so far by the US Food and Drug Administration that are safe and very effective.\n Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they will try to get vaccinated and currently demand far outstrips supply, but 30% of Americans stated they will not, according to CNN poll results released January 21.\n For those who are vaccine hesitant, what are some common myths about the vaccines, and how can each of us work to address these misconceptions?\n We spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, about how everyone can debunk myths, ease concerns and spread accurate information about the Covid-19 vaccines.\n Another principle of public health is to meet people where they are. That means seeking to understand why someone may have hesitancy about the coronavirus vaccine. How you approach someone is going to be completely different if they are concerned about whether the vaccine is safe versus if they don't believe coronavirus is real. Listening to someone's concerns and then addressing them, with compassion and empathy, is crucial.\n There are common myths I often hear from my patients, but there are things that each of us can say if someone around us expresses these myths.\n Neither is true. If someone is concerned about this, you can say that none of the coronavirus vaccines being tested in the US contains live virus. So it's not possible to get coronavirus from the coronavirus vaccine.\n Another set of myths is around the mRNA platform that is used for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. I've heard people worry about whether the vaccine will somehow affect their genetic code and alter their genes.\n This is not true. It's helpful to explain what the mRNA technology is. The term \"mRNA\" stands for messenger RNA, which is a portion of the genetic code that teaches cells how to make a protein. The protein that's made by the mRNA then activates an immune response, teaching our bodies how to respond to coronavirus if we come into contact with it in the future.\n What's very important to understand is what the mRNA does not do: It never enters the nucleus of people's cells, which is where our DNA is contained. That means the vaccine does not interact with people's DNA at all, and therefore will not alter our genetic code.\n The US government and other governments invested a lot of money in the research. And, frankly, we got lucky with the research to have two vaccines already that are safe and so effective. But every phase of the clinical research was followed as it is for other vaccines, with tens of thousands of volunteers in the clinical trials. External committees of independent scientists vetted the data and there were no shortcuts taken in vaccine authorization.\n At the moment, it's not clear as to why these very rare allergic reactions are happening. That's why everyone getting the Covid-19 vaccine is required to stay around for 15 minutes after receiving it. And if you have a history of severe allergic reactions, you might be required to wait 30 minutes. If a severe allergic reaction occurs, it can be treated with an EpiPen.\n The remote possibility of a rare allergic reaction is no reason not to receive the vaccine. The very real and substantial benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the highly uncommon (and treatable) risks of allergic reactions. Those with food and medication allergies can still get the vaccine. The only reason you shouldn't get the vaccine is if you have a specific known reaction to a component of the vaccine itself.\n But just because you may need to get the vaccine again at some point again doesn't mean you shouldn't get it the first time. Think about the flu vaccine: Just because you have to get it every year doesn't mean you should never get it at all.\n Here's why. First, even those who are young and healthy may contract coronavirus and become very ill. It's less common, but deaths do occur in this population, too. Second, we need to strive for herd immunity through vaccination. That's the level at which the virus will substantially slow, and hopefully even stop, its spread. Public health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have estimated that we need about 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated to reach that point.\n The sooner we get people vaccinated, the earlier we can all return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy and end the devastation of this disease. And that requires not only the elderly and more vulnerable, but all of us getting the vaccine.\n That's why people still have to use caution even after they are vaccinated. At some point, though, as we approach herd immunity through vaccination, we will be able to do away with masks. In the meantime, think of vaccines as a tool that doesn't replace other tools but is essential to saving lives.\n Over the course of the next few months, many millions will be vaccinated. It's reasonable to point to these examples of people to say that we're showing, not just in tens of thousands of research participants, but in tens of millions of people, that the vaccine is safe and effective. You yourself getting vaccinated when it's your turn, and showing other examples of people in the community who are vaccinated, will also go a long way toward persuading reluctant friends and relatives.\n Humility and honesty are key. We should acknowledge that the vaccines are relatively new so we don't know the long-term consequences. But then add that there is no reason to believe that the vaccines will cause ill effects long-term. We have a long history of developing vaccines, and scientifically, there is no evidence for long-term harm with those vaccines.\n We know that Covid-19 can cause severe disease and death. We know that thousands of Americans are dying every day. These, too, are our family members, friends and colleagues. That's why getting the vaccine is so important. We are in the middle of a pandemic, and it takes all of us to protect ourselves and to protect others, too.",

        "title": "Washington Post editor Marty Baron announces his retirement",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business)Marty Baron, the editor who transformed the Washington Post into an international powerhouse and led the news organization to win 10 Pulitzer Prizes, is retiring next month.\n Baron, 66, said in an internal memo Tuesday morning that he feels \"ready to move on.\" His last day at the paper will be February 28.\n \"From the moment I arrived at The Post, I have sought to make an enduring contribution while giving back to a profession that has meant so much to me and that serves to safeguard democracy,\" Baron wrote. \"It has been my honor to work alongside hundreds of journalists who make The Post an indispensable institution.\"\n Baron also shared his plans in a virtual meeting with company executives and his managing and senior editors Tuesday morning. His retirement had been anticipated inside the Post for some time, and Baron had been in discussions about the exact timing with Fred Ryan, The Post's CEO.\n \"Although we have long known this day would come, it does not lessen the emotion we feel,\" Ryan wrote in his own memo Tuesday morning.\n \"Under Marty's eight years of newsroom leadership, The Washington Post has experienced a dramatic resurgence and has soared to new journalistic heights,\" Ryan wrote. \"As Executive Editor, he has significantly expanded our coverage areas, inspired great reporting, managed an awesome digital transformation and grown the number of readers and subscribers to unprecedented levels.\"\n Ryan pointed out that the Post employed 580 journalists when Baron arrived at the beginning of 2013. Later that same year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought the newspaper. Bezos retained Baron and gave him more money to work with.\n The Post's newsroom now exceeds 1,000 journalists and continues to grow. \"The newsroom of 2021 will be the biggest in history, an investment that signals overwhelming confidence in our prospects,\" Baron wrote. \"In sum, The Post has come a long way in a short time.\"\n Key to the Post's expansion was a digital subscription model fueled by scoops and other must-read stories.\n Both inside and outside the Post, Baron was credited with steadying the editorial ship through business model turbulence, political attacks and international crises.\n In 2014 and 2015, he demanded justice for the Post's Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, who was arrested by Iranian authorities and charged with espionage. Baron helped keep Rezaian's case in the news and worked for his release, which came in early 2016.\n In 2017, as President Trump bashed the Post and observers talked about a war between Trump and the media, Baron pushed back with a memorable turn of phrase: \"We're not at war, we're at work.\"\n A report by Harvard's Shorenstein Center said that Baron was \"widely considered to be one of the best editors working today.\"\n Baron arrived at The Post at the beginning of 2013 after twelve years running The Boston Globe.\n At The Globe, Baron's many accomplishments included oversight of a legendary expose of serial sexual abuse by priests within the Boston Archdiocese. Liev Schreiber played Baron in the ensuing 2015 film \"Spotlight,\" which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n \"Marty coming to The Globe was a great example of what a pair of fresh eyes can do,\" Globe reporter Sacha Pfeiffer said on \"Reliable Sources\" in 2015. \"There had been court files against priests sealed for years. And no one at The Globe had really questioned them or thought to unseal them. Marty showed up new to town and he asked, 'Why haven't we tried to seal them?' And he sent The Globe lawyers to court to do that. And he put the investigative team on the project. And we did it.\"\n Baron said he was motivated by reading a Globe column that said \"the truth may never be known\" about pedophile priests.\n \"When you say the truth may never be known, that should be a red flag to journalists to go after something and really find out what the truth is,\" Baron said.\n That spirit fueled his support of Washington Post reporters, as well. One of the paper's major investigations in recent years was based on a confidential trove of government documents. Named the Afghanistan Papers, the documents were only unsealed after a three-year legal battle by the Post.\n In a 2019 interview on \"Reliable Sources,\" Baron said \"it's absolutely central to our mission to do investigations, to hold government to account, to hold all-powerful individuals and powerful institutions to account. That's why we have a free press in this country.\"\n At the end of 2020, he announced that the Post was on the verge of \"full 24/7 coverage\" by adding news-gathering hubs in Asia and Europe.\n \"If you recall,\" Baron said, \"it wasn't that long ago that people were talking about news organizations like the Washington Post and the New York Times being on their deathbed. And here we are. We're growing, they're growing. There are enormous signs of success for news organizations like ours around the country.\"\n In his internal memo on Tuesday, Baron wrote, \"Please don't lose sight of how hard our gains as a commercial enterprise were to achieve. They would be easy to lose. In 2013, when our outlook was dire, we were given a second chance. We took it, engineering a turnaround with focus and creativity. Keep at it.\"\n He also reflected on some of the work that's unfinished. \"We aspire to greater breadth, depth and distinctiveness in our work,\" he wrote. \"We can improve how we practice our craft. We can do more and better in pursuing our digital destiny. We must cover all communities with deeper understanding. We need a wider diversity of life experiences and backgrounds represented in our newsroom and reflected in our coverage. On all these fronts we've made progress, but more is needed.\"\n The Post did not immediately announce a successor for Baron.\n Ryan said the search for a new executive editor \"will be a broad and inclusive one, considering both outstanding internal candidates as well as journalists at other publications with the vision and ability to build upon Marty's success.\"",

        "title": "Biden confronts Putin over several issues in first call, White House says",
        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden held his first call Tuesday with his Russian counterpart, according to the White House, confronting President Vladimir Putin over a range of issues from a recent massive cyberattack to the suspected poisoning of the country's leading opposition figure.\n The call, which occurred midday, amounted to Biden's opening bid at diplomacy with one of his chief adversaries, whom he has met previously but not dealt with as an equal.\n Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki said he entered the phone call with the intention of discussing the New START nuclear treaty, which the Biden administration hopes to extend; Russian aggression in Ukraine; the Solarwinds cyber hack, the extent of which is still being determined; reports Russia placed bounties on American troops serving in Afghanistan; Moscow's interference in US presidential elections; and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.\n \"His intention was also to make clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actions by Russia,\" Psaki said, noting the call had taken place during her briefing and that a more fulsome summary would come later.\n The lengthy list of topics for Biden's first conversation with Putin illustrates the troubled state of affairs between Washington and Moscow that he inherited from the previous administration. Biden has accused his predecessor, President Donald Trump, of being too weak on Russia, accusing him of being \"Putin's puppy\" during one of their general election debates.\n Biden hopes to take a firmer line with Putin, officials have said. He's ordered a review from administration agencies on issues related to Russia and could impose new sanctions on the country.\n But he's also made an opening bid for diplomacy on the nuclear treaty, suggesting he is open to fostering a working relationship with Putin.\n \"I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries, as a new START agreement, and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny, whether it's the Solar Winds or whether it's reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan,\" he told reporters on Monday.\n \"I have asked the agencies in question to do a thorough read for me on every one of those issues, to update me precisely where they are, and I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians,\" he said.\n Tuesday's call came at Moscow's request, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said Biden wanted to confer with leaders in Europe and his advisers before getting on the phone with Putin. The Kremlin requested the call shortly after Biden took office last week, which is standard for foreign leaders who are hoping to speak with the new president.\n Biden received a series of briefings ahead of the call from senior administration officials going over administration positions and Putin's likely responses when Biden raised issues like the Solarwinds hack and the Navalny poisoning, the person said.\n Biden's predecessor often entered his calls with Putin having not prepared and on at least one occasion disregarded the advice of his advisers not to congratulate Putin on winning his election.\n Biden also spoke Tuesday with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, a symbolic conversation given the defense bloc's role in defending against Russian aggression in Europe.\n Biden has also spoken with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, including on issues related to Russia.\n Putin was one of the last world leaders to congratulate Biden upon winning the presidency, waiting until it was clear Trump had lost the Electoral College count to offer formal regards.\n The two men met when Biden was vice president and he visited Moscow. During a tour of Putin's office, Biden later claimed he told the Russian leader, inches from his face, that he did not believe he had a soul.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)At least 150 people have now been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements, as a top prosecutor said charges of sedition are not out of the question.\n The milestone of 150 charged in the riot comes less than a day after the US House transmitted to the Senate an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump for inciting insurrection. Trump will now face a trial in the same Senate chamber that rioters -- aiming to stop Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's electoral win -- breached minutes after members of the Senate had been hurried to safety.\n Investigators have used 500 grand jury subpoenas and search warrants to gather information in the sweeping, unparalleled investigation, Michael Sherwin, the top US prosecutor in Washington, said in a news conference Tuesday.\n Sedition, among other charges, is \"what we're trying to build toward,\" Sherwin said.\n The dragnet has stretched across the country, with arrests in Florida, California, New Hampshire and Hawaii.\n Many of the at least 150 defendants that CNN has identified have been charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct in the Capitol. The more serious charges have ranged from theft of government property, conspiracy, interstate threats, to assault on law enforcement.\n The Justice Department now has more than 400 subjects in its investigation, Sherwin said Tuesday.\n The FBI's Steven D'Antuono said the agency has received 200,000 digital media tips from the public about the insurrection.\n Law enforcement officials have told CNN they expect hundreds of more riot participants to be arrested in the future. But they also say investigators have begun to focus on the more complex cases, like extremist groups that participated in the attack, and less on the low-hanging fruit arrests and charges.\n Sherwin said prosecutors are building toward charging Capitol riot defendants with sedition, as well as looking groups from various states who coordinated coming to the Capitol and in other long-term planning.\n \"We are going to reach a plateau I think in the very near future ... and the plateau will involve in looking at the more complicated conspiracy cases related to possible coordination among militia groups,\" Sherwin said.\n So far, the Justice Department had been bringing cases against people largely identified on the Internet, for violent entry and trespassing, and some violence toward police and weapons charges.\n The cases that have resulted in arrests already are progressing slowly, with many of the defendants going before federal judges in their home states before they move to Washington, DC. There's a bottleneck as well in the DC federal court, and many haven't yet seen a judge or had their charges formally indicted. The Justice Department has agreed to let many of the defendants be released as they await trials, with various restrictions including stay-away-orders from DC.\n A few defendants, such as men who allegedly threatened to kill lawmakers or brought bombs to the Capitol, will stay in detention, judges have ruled, and a handful are sitting in jail as federal judges review their detention decisions.\n Over the course of the riot, prosecutors say approximately 81 Capitol Police and 58 DC Metro police officers were assaulted. Capitol Hill officer Brian Sicknick died responding to the riot, \"due to injuries sustained while on-duty,\" according to a Capitol Police statement.\n D'Antuono, the FBI assistant director in Washington, DC, told reporters Tuesday that investigators are still looking for Capitol rioters who assaulted law enforcement officers and the person or people responsibility for planting pipe bombs outside of Republican and Democratic party headquarters buildings.\n The agency is still offering a $75,000 reward for help in the pipe bomb investigation, D'Antuono said.\n \"It is challenging, it is complex and it is big ... at the FBI, we do big, we do challenging, we do complex,\" D'Antuono said in a news conference. \"This case is unique in its magnitude and number of subjects.\"\n The flurry of arrests and charges takes place against the backdrop of the new Biden administration beginning to take the reins of the Justice Department, which could speak to their continued absence.\n Filing such major charges would likely require sign-off from the new Biden administration officials at Justice headquarters, which is currently led by acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson and acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. Senate confirmation for Biden's pick for Attorney General Merrick Garland and deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco is likely weeks away.\n Sedition is a Civil War-era law that brings up to 20-year penalties for plotting to overthrow the US government and to use force to oppose US government authority or to delay the execution of a US law. Last summer, amid street protests following the police killing of George Floyd, then-Attorney General William Barr encouraged federal prosecutors to use the law against leftist protesters, a move that no one made.\n This story has been updated with information from the FBI and Justice Department.",

        "title": "Democrats introduce bill to raise minimum wage to $15 by 2025",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Seeking to fulfill a long-standing Democratic ambition, a coalition of lawmakers introduced a bill on Tuesday that would raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n Democratic lawmakers have pushed for years to raise the minimum wage, which now stands at $7.25 and hasn't been increased since 2009.\n President Barack Obama pressed in his 2013 State of the Union address to bump up the hourly rate in stages to $9 an hour over two years, and state and local governments around the country have done just that. Voters have consistently approved even bigger minimum wage hikes when they appear on the ballot -- most recently in Florida, where voters supported a $15 minimum wage in November.\n But the legislative drive has stalled in Congress, where Democrats were in the minority in either the House or Senate, or both, from 2010 until this year.\n Now, with narrow majorities in both chambers and Biden in the White House, Democrats are renewing the push.\n Initially, Democratic leaders have said they will seek to pass the measure with at least some Republican support.\n Failing that, they will need to either end the Senate's legislative filibuster -- which requires 60 votes for a bill to get an up-or-down vote -- or use budget reconciliation, an arcane but frequently used process that allows legislation that affects the federal deficit to be enacted with a simple majority. If Democrats go that route, they could not afford to lose a single vote.\n The so-called Fight for $15 dates back to 2012, when fast-food workers walked off the job in New York City to call attention to their battle for higher pay.\n But the movement to raise the minimum wage -- by any amount -- has faced steep opposition from Republicans and businesses, particularly restaurants and other smaller employers, who often operate on tight profit margins. They argue that boosting wages will force them to lay off workers.\n The economic impact of a higher wage has been hotly debated among economists for years, with left-leaning experts countering that increasing salaries will allow workers to spend more and lift businesses and the economy.\n Since 1968, the minimum wage has lost more than 30% of its purchasing power, according to a fact sheet distributed by lawmakers.\n Sanders has been a longtime proponent of boosting the wage, saying no full-time worker in the US should be unable to afford to feed their families or pay the rent. He has slammed companies for paying wages that are so low that their workers need federal assistance, including food stamps.\n \"The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage,\" said Sanders, who introduced the bill Tuesday along with Washington Sen. Patty Murray and Reps. Bobby Scott of Virginia, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Stephanie Murphy of Florida. \"In the United States of America, a job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it.\"\n The legislation would raise the wages of nearly 32 million workers, more than half of whom are essential workers, according to Scott, citing legislation from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n It would increase wages for one-third of all Black workers and one-quarter of Hispanic workers. Also, nearly 60% of those helped would be women.\n \"The minimum wage today is one of the clearest examples of how weak labor standards can impose constant unrelenting hardship on millions of workers and their families,\" said Scott, noting one in nine full-time, year-round workers is paid a wage that leaves them in poverty.\n The coronavirus pandemic has shined a light on the financial struggles of low-wage Americans, many of whom are essential workers and have been hit hard by the outbreak. Those making the minimum wage are typically younger and work in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has suffered from steep job losses amid state lockdowns since the pandemic began.\n The shift in control of the agenda in Washington has quickly moved what was, in effect, a bill meant to signal Democratic intentions into the realm of the possible.\n \"Last session, the people's house, with Chairman Scott and Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi in the leadership passed the 'Raise the Wage Act' and we're ready to do it again,\" Jayapal said, before noting what has changed. \"And now, we have a President Biden who believes that we should pass a $15 minimum wage and a Senate led by Democrats ready to work for the people.\"\n Both Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the renewed effort.\n \"We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week -- working -- and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line,\" Biden said Friday.\n The legislation also calls for gradually phasing out the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, youth employees and workers with disabilities.",

        "title": "Republicans and Democrats see promise and uncertainty in Ohio's open Senate race",
        "body_text": "(CNN)The unexpected retirement of Republican Sen. Rob Portman has set off a frantic scramble in Ohio, leading numerous Republicans and a handful of Democratic lawmakers to consider making a run at the now open seat.\n The race, beyond being key to control of the Senate, will have significant implications for a state that has been steadily moving to the right for a decade and will speak volumes about the state of each party.\n For Republicans, the race represents a chance to further assert their dominance in the onetime battleground, signaling yet again that a state former President Barack Obama won twice is no longer a welcome place for Democrats. But the party is also in a precarious position after the tumultuous departure of former President Donald Trump. A contentious primary for a coveted Senate seat could further exacerbate these deep fissures.\n For Democrats, the seat offers a chance to prove that a member of their party not named Sherrod Brown can win a statewide election in the Buckeye State. But the race, alongside one for the governor's mansion in 2022, also threatens to expose the damage that years of Republican victories have done to the Democratic bench in Ohio, a reality that could allow younger talent to test their statewide ability.\n \"It changes the landscape,\" Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat seen as a top contender for the Senate seat, said of the Portman decision. \"I don't think people are very happy [in Ohio], in terms of their families, their communities and how they feel about their future. And in Ohio, the only people who have been in charge are Republicans. So I think that gives us a great opportunity.\"\n Republicans have dominated Ohio ever since Obama won the state during his reelection bid in 2012. The party swept statewide office races in 2014. Two years later, Trump carried the state by 8 points while Portman easily beat former Gov. Ted Strickland in his bid for reelection. The party again showed its strength in 2018, electing Mike DeWine to his first term as governor. And last year, Trump once more carried Ohio.\n This dominance on both the congressional and statewide level has created a deep bench of Republican office holders, many of whom quickly sprang into action at the chance to run for an open Senate seat.\n \"These seats don't open up very often,\" said Mike Hartley, a longtime Republican strategiest in Ohio. \"So if you are in any position and have ever wanted to do it, you do it.\"\n Hartley later joked that when national Republicans called him on Monday to talk about who is thinking about filling the seat, he simply said, \"Every name you could possibly think of.\"\n The most significant divide in Republicans seeking the job will be between the state's congressional delegation and the statewide elected officials.\n At least four members of Ohio's congressional delegation are considering running, but the person seen as the best positioned is Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch conservative with deep ties to Trump. Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup and Mike Turner are also considering bids, people close to the process said.\n Because these lawmakers come from reliably Republican districts aided by gerrymandering in the state, they are more conservative than others considering running for the seat, and none more so than Jordan. But the congressional candidates won't clear the field. Multiple statewide elected Republicans in Ohio are considering a run, including Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n Unlike Jordan and the other congressional lawmakers, Ohio's statewide elected officials, while conservative, have not been as deeply devoted to Trump and, at times, have been seen as out of step with the Trump base of the party.\n Both Husted, who has been an elected official in Ohio since 2001, and LaRose, who served as a Green Beret in Iraq and is a former member of the state Senate, would be seen as more establishment choices, in line with DeWine, who has, at times, been a Trump critic. The two have been critical of Trump in the past, including when Husted was heckled at a Trump rally for urging attendees to put on masks to combat the coronavirus.\n \"In my humble opinion, it starts with Congressman Jim Jordan,\" said Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life. \"He has an opportunity to be either a king or a king maker.\"\n The Trump factor will loom large over the race. The former president is so close to Jordan he gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a president can bestow on a civilian, shortly before he left office. And Trump has been critical of DeWine, especially after the Ohio governor broke with other Republicans to say Biden won the election.\n And there is no indication that Trump's grip on the party -- especially on the right -- will weaken over the next two years.\n \"I live in rural Ohio, 25 miles from the Capitol. There are five Trump signs or flags that remain on my street,\" said Colton Henson, a Republican operative in the state. \"If a candidate thinks there won't be a Trump litmus test for many Republican voters, they may want to rethink strategy.\"\n Democrats face a markedly different issue. While the party is largely unified in Ohio, significant losses in the last eight years have diminished the bench of talent in the state and left the party searching for big names who could mount campaigns for statewide office.\n \"It is a good opportunity to show Democrats can be viable in the state,\" said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio House Democratic Caucus.\n In order to succeed, however, some Democrats believe the infighting inside the Republican Party needs to continue, hoping it further splits the party ahead of the general election.\n \"The Republican Party is having such a massive civil war,\" said former Ohio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper. \"They have more of a bench, but the way they have won through gerrymandering has also shaped the politics of their office holders and [the possible candidates] from Congress are much further to the right because they have been living in these gerrymandered districts.\"\n The two Democrats seen as top candidates for the Senate seat are Whaley and US Rep. Tim Ryan, both of whom said they were considering their options in the wake of the Portman news. But the list of candidates does not stop there.\n Danny O'Connor, the county recorder in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, told CNN he is considering mounting a campaign. Some Democrats are looking to recruit Dr. Amy Acton, who rose to prominence as DeWine's public health director as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Other Democrats have looked at Emilia Sykes, the young, Black minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, as someone who could mount a historic campaign and motivate Democrats.\n For Ohio Democrats, the model for someone who can win statewide is Brown, the populist senator who, despite being an avowed liberal, has found success in the state by relating to both independents and Republicans. While that legacy has led some in the state to believe nominating candidates like Brown is the surest way to win, the last decade has demonstrated that his appeal is not only unique, but also difficult to replicate.\n \"I'm considering this because Ohioans have been left behind time and time again,\" said O'Connor. \"I'm from a small town that gets smaller every year. I know the decency of our people but also that our niceness isn't going to put food on the table. We need someone who will fight, scrap and claw for every worker who hasn't had a pay raise or is looking for work.\"\n Other possible candidates argued that trying to be Brown is what Ohio Democrats have done for the past decade -- and it hasn't worked.\n \"One thing that we have an opportunity to do is show that with diverse candidates, with women and people of color, there is a pathway to win,\" said Sykes, who told CNN she is considering a bid. \"What we are learning is that when you put women on the ballot, women win. When you put people of color on the ballot, we win.\"\n Sykes pointed to Melody Stewart, a Black Democrat who won a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2018.\n Whaley made a similar case, too, noting that many of the Democratic losses over the last decade have come when Democrats put up White male candidates.\n \"We don't need to be insane as a party,\" she said. \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Certainly, trying something new would be good after decades of trying things the other way.\"\n And while almost all Democrats argued that the path to victory comes through organizing the base and creating excitement, people like Shannon Hardin, the president of the Columbus City Council, backed up Sykes and Whaley.\n \"We have to get real organizing and real voter registration efforts in urban communities and in some of our rural areas,\" said Hardin. \"A Black man, middle named Hussein, last name Obama, won this state in 2012. It is still right, we have a lot of work to do, we have some cultural hills to climb here, but I think with the right candidate and that message on the working class, I think we have a real shot at this thing.\"",

        "body_text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)China wants to lead the global recovery from the pandemic and become more influential on the world stage than ever before. It might just have the momentum \u2014 and the confidence \u2014 to pull that plan off.\n The world's second largest economy shrugged off much of the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, and its ability to keep growing while the world crashed into recession could mean its GDP exceeds that of the United States later this decade, years earlier than expected.\n \"China emerged from the Covid-19 shock earlier than the rest of the world and authorities are already planning for the long term,\" wrote Fran\u00e7oise Huang, senior economist for Asia-Pacific at Euler Hermes, in a report last week titled, \"The world is moving East, fast.\"\n China just outpaced the United States in attracting foreign direct investment for the first time. And as 2020 was drawing to a close, it signed a trade agreement with the European Union with the aim of boosting growth and giving European companies greater access to its 1.4 billion consumers. Now, Beijing is starting the new year without one of its most aggressive political adversaries, former US President Donald Trump, breathing down its neck.\n President Xi Jinping has already made it clear that he sees China taking pole position in the coming year and beyond.\n And he touted China's ability to propel the global economy by injecting \"more momentum into growth.\"\n China will \"leverage its big-market advantages and the potential of domestic demand to provide more opportunities for cooperation between countries and the global economic recovery,\" Xi said.\n But a host of geopolitical challenges \u2014 including clashes over Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region \u2014 have exacerbated tensions with the West and may stymie efforts to foster multilateral cooperation.\n \"[Xi] is squandering China's global influence through increasingly provocative actions in Xinjiang, in Hong Kong, in the South China Sea, and with respect to Taiwan,\" Reinsch told CNN Business. \"These actions are unacceptable to democracies, and I think we will continue to see them pulling away from China despite its attractiveness as a market,\" he added.\n All told, harsh quarantine measures and additional actions intended to spur growth \u2014 the country also funded major infrastructure projects and offered cash handouts to citizens \u2014 helped China's economy expand 2.3% in 2020 while much of the world was mired in recession.\n \"In and out of lockdown ahead of everybody else, the Chinese economy powered ahead while much of the world was struggling to maintain balance,\" wrote Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC, in a report last week.\n Given China's rapid growth over the last few decades, many economists were already predicting that it would overtake the United States some time after 2030. But the country's ability to weather the pandemic is accelerating that trend.\n \"The skilful management of the pandemic and the hits to long term growth in the West mean that China's relative economic performance has improved,\" researchers at the Centre for Economics and Business wrote in a December report. They now expect China to over take the United States five years earlier than previously forecast.\n Chinese state media \u2014 often seen as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials \u2014 has been touting the country's economic success. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, on Sunday seized on the report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that showed China receiving more foreign direct investment than the United States last year.\n \"China has faced the US-initiated trade war and the country's strategic containment against China. But China has generally withstood the test,\" The Global Time's editorial board wrote. \"These all add to the outside world's confidence in China.\"\n The investment trend will likely flip back as the United States and Europe recover, according to Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian studies at American Enterprise Institute.\n \"[Foreign] companies will be squeezed out over time by Chinese competitors and China's panoply of anti-competitive practices,\" he said. \"Still, given China's scale and ambition it is a formidable competitor to the US.\"\n China isn't without its challenges.\n Economists stress that there are still threats to the country's future growth. The International Monetary Fund said in December that China's recovery has relied heavily on government support, while private spending hasn't kept up. Others note that a slew of bankruptcies and loan defaults at state-run firms have strained debt markets.\n \"The policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic, while effective in the short-run, is pushing more resources to inefficient state firms and will add to China's debt burden,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research report last week.\n Debt woes have followed China for years, casting a shadow over economic policy.\n On Monday, a policymaker at the People's Bank of China expressed concern during a speech in Beijing that local governments were setting overly aggressive GDP targets. That heightened the risk of accumulating debt, given the relative ease with which the economy can be juiced by borrowing more money, said the official, Ma Jun.\n Ma even suggested that Beijing should abandon nationwide GDP goals, and instead prioritize employment and controlling inflation.\n There's another potential drag on China's growth in the years ahead. It has generally been trying to reduce its reliance on the West in recent years. (China's leading chipmaker, SMIC has been hobbled by recent US restrictions on its business, for example.)\n That's related to a bigger concern for China. While President Joe Biden might strike a more nuanced tone with Beijing than Trump, they don't expect him to completely unwind the trade war, nor abandon efforts to reassert the United States as the world leader on economics and trade.\n Biden \"has prioritized combatting Covid and restoring growth to our economy, but he is at heart a multilateralist,\" said Reinsch of CSIS. \"Once he has made progress on his domestic goals, he will turn his attention to global trade issues as well.\"\n \u2014 Laura He contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Brazil's Health Minister under investigation over health crisis in Amazonas ",
        "body_text": "Sao Paulo (CNN)A Brazilian court has approved an investigation into Heath Minister Eduardo Pazuello's handling of the Covid-19 crisis, after oxygen shortages collapsed the health system of Manaus, capital city of Amazonas state, last week.\n Federal Supreme Court Judge Ricardo Lewandowski greenlit the investigation on Monday. Pazuello now has five days to provide testimony to the federal police.\n It is alleged that the Ministry of Health was alerted to the city's looming shortages of oxygen -- often critical for treating severe cases of Covid-19 -- on January 8, but only took action on January 12, according to a request for a probe sent to the Attorney General's Office (PGR) by the political party Cidadania.\n Pazuello himself visited Manaus on January 11, and the federal government subsequently sent supplemental oxygen to the city, but neither were enough to prevent a crisis. Hospitals in Amazonas soon ran out of oxygen, and on January 14 and 15 at least 29 patients died due to the shortages, according to an ongoing investigation.\n \"The reality is that there's a lower supply of oxygen,\" Pazuello acknowledged later. \"Not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen.\"\n Pazuello and other top federal officials have defended the government's reaction to warnings of a crisis in Manaus, arguing that no one could have predicted the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases that strained hospitals.\n \"This was a situation completely unknown to everyone. It was too fast,\" Pazuello told a press conference on Tuesday.\n He added that the city's health crisis was compounded by a number of issues including \"oxygen problems, lack of professionals, low number of beds.\"\n A separate report by Brazil's Solicitor General has also alleged that during Pazuello's trip to Manaus, he encouraged medical professionals to adopt an \"early treatment\" kit against Covid-19 that includes unproven drugs including hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. The health minister has since denied doing this.\n House of Representatives President Rodrigo Maia told a Monday press conference that he believed Pazuello had \"committed a crime\" not only by letting the state's health system collapse, but by promoting ineffective treatments for the city's surging Covid-19 cases and by failing to obtain vaccines for the country earlier.\n The growing criticism of Pazuello's pandemic response in Manaus follows a recent investigation by CNN Brazil, which found that top executive Abert Bourla sent a letter to the Brazilian government in September offering 70 million doses of its vaccine, which was co-developed with German pharmaceutical company BioNTech.\n But Pfizer received no response from the government, according to CNN Brazil.\n He also said that certain conditions of the sale were unacceptable to the Brazilian government -- including a payment guarantee and an agreement that contractual issues be tried in a US court -- and accused the drugmaker of \"creating embarrassing situations for the Brazilian Government, which will not accept market impositions -- which will also not be accepted by Brazilians.\"\n Brazil began its vaccination campaign last Saturday, but the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro has faced mounting criticism for its mishandling of the pandemic.\n Since the pandemic began, the country ratcheted more than 8.8 million infections and the second highest number of deaths in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.",

        "title": "Why swearing is a sign of intelligence, helps manage pain and more",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Polite society considers swearing to be a vulgar sign of low intelligence and education, for why would one rely on rude language when blessed with a rich vocabulary?\n That perception, as it turns out, is full of, uh ... baloney. In fact, swearing may be a sign of verbal superiority, studies have shown, and may provide other possible rewards as well.\n \"The advantages of swearing are many,\" said Timothy Jay, professor emeritus of psychology at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, who has studied swearing for more than 40 years.\n \"The benefits of swearing have just emerged in the last two decades, as a result of a lot of research on brain and emotion, along with much better technology to study brain anatomy,\" Jay said.\n Well-educated people with plenty of words at their disposal, a 2015 study found, were better at coming up with curse words than those who were less verbally fluent.\n Participants were asked to list as many words that start with F, A or S in one minute. Another minute was devoted to coming up with curse words that start with those three letters. The study found those who came up with the most F, A and S words also produced the most swear words.\n That's a sign of intelligence \"to the degree that language is correlated with intelligence,\" said Jay, who authored the study. \"People that are good at language are good at generating a swearing vocabulary.\"\n Swearing can also be associated with social intelligence, Jay added.\n \"Having the strategies to know where and when it's appropriate to swear, and when it's not,\" Jay said, \"is a social cognitive skill like picking the right clothes for the right occasion. That's a pretty sophisticated social tool.\"\n Science has also found a positive link between profanity and honesty. People who cursed lied less on an interpersonal level, and had higher levels of integrity overall, a series of three studies published in 2017 found.\n \"When you're honestly expressing your emotions with powerful words, then you're going to come across as more honest,\" said Jay, who was not involved in the studies.\n While a higher rate of profanity use was associated with more honesty, the study authors cautioned that \"the findings should not be interpreted to mean that the more a person uses profanity, the less likely he or she would  engage in more serious unethical or immoral behaviors.\"\n Want to push through that workout? Go ahead and drop an F-bomb.\n People on bikes who swore while pedaling against resistance had more power and strength than people who used \"neutral\" words, studies have shown.\n Research also found that people who cursed while squeezing a hand vice were able to squeeze harder and longer.\n Spouting obscenities doesn't just help your endurance: If you pinch your finger in the car door, you may well feel less pain if you say \"sh*t\" instead of \"shoot.\"\n People who cursed as they plunged their hand into icy water, another study found, felt less pain and were able to keep their hands in the water longer than those who said a neutral word.\n \"The headline message is that swearing helps you cope with pain,\" said lead author and psychologist Richard Stephens, in a prior CNN interview. Stephens is a senior lecturer at Keele University in Staffordshire, England, where he leads the Psychobiology Research Laboratory.\n Stephens said it works like this: Cussing produces a stress response that initiates the body's ancient defensive reflex. A flush of adrenaline increases heart rate and breathing, prepping muscles for fight or flight.\n \"That would make evolutionary sense because you're going to be a better fighter and better runner if you're not being slowed down by concerns about pain,\" Stephens said.\n \"So it seems like by swearing you're triggering an emotional response in yourself, which triggers a mild stress response, which carries with it a stress-induced reduction in pain,\" he added.\n Careful, however, the next time you decide to extend your workout by swearing. Curse words lose their power over pain when they are used too much, research has also discovered.\n Some of us get more out of swearing than others. Take people who are more afraid of pain, called \"catastrophizers.\" A catastrophizer, Stephens explained, is someone who might have a tiny wound and think, \"Oh, this is life threatening. I'm going to get gangrene, I'm going to die.\"\n \"The research found men who were lower catastrophizers seemed to get a benefit from swearing, whereas men who are higher catastrophizers didn't,\" Stephens said. \"Whereas with women there wasn't any difference.\"\n Swearing appears to be centered in the right side of the brain, the part people often call the \"creative brain.\"\n \"We do know patients who have strokes on the right side tend to become less emotional, less able to understand and tell jokes, and they tend to just stop swearing even if they swore quite a lot before,\" Emma Byrne, the author of \"Swearing Is Good for You,\" said.\n Research on swearing dates back to Victorian times, when physicians discovered that patients who lost their ability to speak could still curse.\n \"They swore incredibly fluently,\" Byrne said. \"Childhood reprimands, swear words and terms of endearment -- words with strong emotional content learned early on tend to be preserved in the brain even when all the rest of our language is lost.\"\n Why do we choose to swear? Perhaps because profanity provides an evolutionary advantage that can protect us from physical harm, Jay said.\n \"A dog or a cat will scratch you, bite you when they're scared or angry,\" he said. \"Swearing allows us to express our emotions symbolically without doing it tooth and nail.\n \"In other words, I can give somebody the finger or say f**k you across the street. I don't have to get up into their face.\"\n Cursing then becomes a remote form of aggression, Jay explained, offering the chance to quickly express feelings while hopefully avoiding repercussions.\n \"The purpose of swearing is to vent my emotion, and there's an advantage in that it allows me to cope,\" he said. \"And then it communicates very readily to bystanders what my emotional state is. It has that advantage of emotional efficiency -- it's very quick and clear.\"\n What makes the use of naughty words so powerful? The power of the taboo, of course. That reality is universally recognized: Just about every language in the world contains curse words.\n \"It seems that as soon as you have a taboo word, and the emotional insight that the word is going to cause discomfort for other people, the rest seems to follow naturally,\" Byrne said.\n It's not just people who swear. Even primates curse when given the chance.\n \"Chimpanzees in the wild tend to use their excrement as a social signal, one that's designed to keep people away,\" Byrne said.\n Hand-raised chimps who were potty-trained learned sign language for \"poo\" so they could tell their handlers when they needed the toilet.\n Does that mean that we should curse whenever we feel like it, regardless of our environment or the feelings of others? Of course not. But at least you can cut yourself some slack the next time you inadvertently let an F-bomb slip.\n After all, you're just being human.",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 26 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n (CNN)President Joe Biden had it right last week in his inaugural address, when he anticipated how his effort to bridge America's catastrophic political divides would go down in the tumult of post-Trump Washington.\n Biden's dream of recreating an idealized era when lawmakers and presidents worked across partisan lines to benefit everyone is popular with voters -- but nearly impossible to implement.\n Even moderate Republicans people like Utah's Sen. Mitt Romney and Maine's Sen. Susan Collins are worried about the size and speed of Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan. Other Republicans, who are intimidated by Donald Trump's hold on their party base or have future presidential ambitions, are already accusing the President of forgetting his idealistic aspirations.\n \"President Biden sounded a lot of notes of unity in his inaugural address. But unfortunately when he got back to the White House, he implemented a bunch of far-left policies,\" Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton told Fox News last week.\n The disingenuous logic of such arguments is that if Biden actually carries out  the policies on which he campaigned (rejoining the Paris climate accord or  investigating police violence, for example) he will be a hypocrite on unity -- because Republicans disagree with him. Donald Trump's looming impeachment trial is not doing much for the mood between parties either.\n But Biden's naive-sounding hopes for compromise and cooperation are often misunderstood. The President does not believe in some pie in the sky world where bitter rivals drop their differences. He just thinks the disagreements should not spark endless political warfare. In a news conference on Monday, Biden defined unity as simply the absence of \"vitriol\" and personal attacks from politics.\n It still seems a bit of a long shot in bitter Washington. But it's hard to argue that it wouldn't be better for everyone.\n Democratic House impeachment managers were led through the Capitol on Monday to deliver an article of impeachment against Trump.\n By now, it's a familiar scene for most Americans -- just over a year ago, Democratic impeachment managers did the same thing ahead of the former President's first impeachment trial.\n In his first speech since Trump left office, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pointedly called for more global cooperation, multilateralism and free trade following years of trade tensions with the previous US administration.\n \"We should reject the outdated Cold War and zero-sum game mentality, adhere to mutual respect and accommodation, and enhance political trust through strategic communication,\" Xi told a (virtual) gathering of global elites at the World Economic Forum's Davos event. \"It is important that we stick to the cooperation concept based on mutual benefit, say no to narrow-minded, selfish beggar-thy-neighbor policies, and stop the unilateral practice of keeping advantages in development all to oneself.\"\n If only some countries would \"abandon ideological prejudice\" (the West's nagging of China on human rights comes to mind) a path of peaceful coexistence and \"win-win cooperation\" awaits, he added.\n But while Biden spent the weekend phoning world leaders to assure them America is back, he is in no hurry to reconcile with China, and especially not on Xi's terms.\n A few hours after Xi spoke, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki threw cold water on the idea of \"win-win.\" \"We're in a serious competition with China, strategic competition with China is the defining feature of the 21st century. China's engaged in conduct that hurts American workers, blunts our technological edge and threatens our alliances and our influence in international organizations,\" Psaki told reporters at the White House's daily press briefing.\n \"What we've seen over the last few years is that China's growing more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad and Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity and values in significant ways that require a new US approach. ... We want to approach this with some strategic patience,\" she said.",

        "title": "Newark and New Jersey officials reach settlement in yearslong lawsuit over lead contamination of city drinking water",
        "body_text": "(CNN)The city of Newark, New Jersey, resolved yearslong litigation Tuesday in connection to its water crisis, in which city drinking water was contaminated with illegally high levels of lead.\n Officials from the city and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) reached an agreement with the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Newark Education Workers Caucus, which sued city and state officials in June 2018 for ongoing violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, including their failure to address the lead crisis on a timely basis.\n A New Jersey federal judge signed an order Tuesday approving the settlement.\n Around the time the lawsuit was filed, quality reports published by the city found drinking water in parts of Newark to be unsafe for 18 months. In 2018, according to the city's water quality report, lead levels at several sites were above 47 parts per billion; federal EPA guidelines say lead levels should fall below 15 parts per billion.\n The report said \"corrosion of household plumbing\" was one source for lead.\n The settlement requires the city to replace all lead service lines free of charge to residents, a process the city estimates it will finish early this spring, Mayor Ras Baraka says.\n More than 17,000 of Newark's lead service lines have been replaced already, closing in on the total, just shy of 19,000, according to an NJDEP news release.\n City workers continued installing the new service lines during the several months when Newark was under a novel coronavirus stay-at-home order, replacing 40 to 50 lines per day while taking additional safety precautions, Water and Sewer Director Kareem Adeem told reporters in July.\n Until the job is complete, the city must continue to provide free drinking water lead testing kits and water filters to residents, according to the agreement.\n The NJDEP will also launch a dedicated web page for Newark water system updates such as ongoing tap water and water quality sampling and corrosion control testing in February that will be maintained through at least the end of the year, per the agreement.\n \"By the grace of God we are near completion of our lead service line replacement program and I am thankful that we were able to identify the issue, do the work, and are able to help make our residents safer,\" Baraka said in a statement Tuesday.\n The lawsuit against the NJDEP and the city of Newark has been dismissed and as part of the settlement, the advocacy groups cannot bring further actions related to the past city water situation.\n The parties did not seek monetary damages in the suit.\n Officials with the Natural Resources Defense Council credited the settlement agreement to Newark officials' \"significant progress\" in removing the lead pipes.\n \"Newark's aggressive lead service line replacement program, at no direct cost to residents, could serve as a model for the nation once it is completed,\" the group's senior strategic director for health, Erik D. Olson, said in a statement.\n In October, the federal Environmental Protection Agency awarded the Newark Board of Education a $7.5 million grant to help fund its effort to deal with remaining lead pipes and fixtures in city schools, according to an EPA news release.\n The Newark Board of Education detected lead levels in school drinking fountains for years beginning in 2010.\n \"Modernizing the nation's aging water infrastructure is vital in ensuring access to clean, safe drinking water and protecting our communities from the dangers of lead exposure. Our administration is committed to confronting this challenge head on and having New Jersey lead the nation in updating critical water infrastructure to benefit all residents and future generations to come,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n CNN's Susan Scutti contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)A US bankruptcy judge has approved a Weinstein Company liquidation plan that allocates over $17 million for Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and assault victims, an attorney for the Weinstein Company confirmed to CNN Monday.\n \"It is true that Judge (Mary) Walrath approved the settlement plan at a hearing today,\" Attorney Paul Zumbro said, adding that they are \"pleased with Judge Walrath's ruling, and particularly so given there is now a mechanism that allows victims to receive compensation without having to endure the hardships and uncertainties of litigation.\"\n CNN has reached out to Elizabeth A. Fegan, an attorney for the class action plaintiffs, for comment.\n The Weinstein Company Holdings LLC and 54 affiliate companies previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2018 and were later sold to Lantern Capital, a Dallas-based private equity firm, for $310 million. The company also said at the time that it would release victims of, and witnesses to, Weinstein's alleged misconduct from any nondisclosure agreements.\n The company's $35.2 million liquidation plan allocates $17,064,525.30 for the establishment of a \"Sexual Misconduct Claims Fund\" and a liquidation trust for the payment of sexual misconduct claims, according to court documents.\n The approved plan also provides $9.7 million for legal costs, none of which provide any reimbursement for any defense costs and expenses incurred by Harvey Weinstein. An additional $8.4 million will be allocated to a liquidation trust to settle claims unrelated to sexual misconduct, the documents state.\n Harvey Weinstein, the company's former chief executive, was sentenced to 23 years in prison in March 2020 on charges of criminal sexual act and rape. He still faces six more sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.\n After new charges were lodged in October, his spokeswoman said, \"Harvey Weinstein has always maintained that every one of his physical encounters throughout his entire life have been consensual. That hasn't changed.\"",

        "title": "Did Liz Cheney risk everything to impeach Trump?",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Less than two weeks removed from her vote to impeach then President Trump, Wyoming Rep, Liz Cheney (R) faces an effort to oust her from party leadership in Washington, a series of censure motions in the state and a primary challenger from a prominent conservative state legislator. Heck, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is even headed to Wyoming to campaign against her.\n So, how much trouble is Cheney in? I reached out to Nick Reynolds, a political reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune, for that answer -- and more!\n Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n On the other hand, Cheney has amassed an incredible amount of power in a very short amount of time, which has had some huge benefits for Wyoming. In the last four years, she has not faced a serious primary challenge and for the most part, has been a pretty effective voice for Wyoming interests even while serving in the minority.\n Being in Congress isn't just about passing bills, but about the details of your amendments, your ability to grease the wheels with federal agencies, and your ability to work with the other party. Power comes in handy there, and I think people recognize that.\n But some of her positions do conflict with the interests of the state's conservative establishment, including her occasional pushes back against former President Donald Trump, who is incredibly popular here. That, as we've seen in recent weeks, has resulted in quite a lot of blowback from the conservative base.\n It's a pretty unusual development given some of her past positions that have conflicted with Trump. Her criticism of the former president for his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria barely moved the needle here, and she was a very early critic of Trump when she came out against his decision to withdraw from NATO in 2017.\n At the same time, she's also voted with Trump very closely throughout her career, and has supported key initiatives he pushed for, including funding for the border wall. Beyond her foreign policy stances, her conservative credentials have never really been in question.\n But the perception of her being an outsider was a persistent one in that first campaign, and wasn't helped by some of the gaffes she made on the campaign trail -- including improperly applying for a resident fishing license. When I inherited my desk when I started here, I found a \"Cheney for Virginia\" bumper sticker in the top drawer of my desk scattered among the rest of the political memorabilia from past campaigns reporters have collected over the years.\n It was a legitimate campaign issue then, and people still use it against her, even though she's owned property in Teton County for the better part of a decade. For what it's worth, it certainly didn't hurt Foster Friess when he ran for governor in 2018: it's a pretty open fact that he splits his time between his properties in Jackson Hole and Scottsdale, Arizona, and I rarely heard that brought up on the campaign trail then.\n Enzi, up to that point, had followed the traditional progression of federal candidates follow in Wyoming politics. Like his predecessor, Al Simpson, Enzi had earned his stripes. He was a mayor for a while, served some time in the Wyoming Legislature, and had a proven record as a policymaker in Wyoming.\n It was also a different time. Enzi's first campaign was probably the first time we had serious money coming in from out-of-state, but in 2014, politics here was still extremely local. The city of Milwaukee has more residents than Wyoming, meaning to be successful, you needed deep-seated relationships with community leaders in small towns all across the state. Not everybody can do that.\n Cheney didn't make those mistakes in 2016. Most importantly, she also had a lot of money to back her up, helping her to defeat people like Leland Christensen (a long-time state legislator who currently works for Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming) and Tim Stubson, a Casper attorney who served close to a decade in the Wyoming legislature. The fact that there has been no serious primary challenge the last few years says a lot. But of course, not many people can match her fundraising capability... something I wrote about for the Star-Tribune the weekend after her vote.\n At the same time, a large number of very influential people in Wyoming politics -- attorneys, former governors, you name it -- have risen to support her as well. Shortly after her impeachment vote, former Wyoming Governors Matt Mead (a Republican) and Mike Sullivan (a Democrat) signed onto on op-ed in the Star-Tribune supporting her efforts to push back against Trump's attempts to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Petroleum Association of Wyoming, one of the state's most powerful industry groups in the state, has also put out a statement supporting her on Monday, saying Cheney's voice \"carries tremendous weight for all of Wyoming\" in Congress. For a state with just three representatives in Washington, that's a big deal.\n As far as a consensus as to why she did it, I really can't say. There is open speculation that she is considering a higher office -- something she denied as a motivation for her vote when talking to the Wyoming press corps the day of the vote. And from what I've seen from Washington DC, it seems like the conference remains rather divided on what its future is. Given Trump's performance here, Cheney is probably very well aware that her vote would have caused some of this blowback -- something I think is worth remembering when she called her vote a \"vote of conscience.\" You don't make a decision like that lightly.\n After two consecutive defeats for a seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives, Bouchard later rode that reputation to a narrow victory in one of the state's few gerrymandered Republican districts in 2016 and, this year, scored a massive, 30-point victory over one of the best-funded Democratic state house campaigns in Wyoming history.\n Whether the people who dislike Cheney are simply a vocal minority or a sign of a credible grassroots effort to replace her remains to be seen. In Cheney's crowded 2016 primary election, the standard bearer of the Wyoming GOP's conservative wing at the time, Darin Smith (who is also floating a primary challenge, per Wyoming Public Radio), only managed about 15% of the vote, and in this year's Republican primaries, the winner of the Wyoming GOP's straw poll, Bryan Miller, barely broke 10% of the electorate in a Senate primary loss to Lummis.\n But there is some potential for growth. If you look at the state's six-way 2018 Republican primary for governor, eventual winner Mark Gordon won with only about one-third of the total vote, while the two runners-up --  Friess and current Wyoming Republican Party National Committeewoman Harriet Hageman -- combined for nearly 48% of the vote. Both of those candidates were much more conservative than Gordon.\n The best chance for the party's right wing lies with them being able to produce a single, credible candidate with a strong ability to fundraise. Bouchard has sought to use the Internet and conservative media outlets to raise his own profile nationally and expand that donor base in an effort to even the odds.\n However, it's really hard to say whether the 2018 primary elections really inform how many voters would go against Cheney. She still has a very conservative voting record, and still has two years to prove her credentials against a Democratic trifecta in the Oval, the House and the Senate.\n Wyoming also has very loose restrictions on voter registration, leading to a large amount of crossover voting in those primary races as well. While it wasn't significant enough to impact the final result in Gordon's favor in 2018, a contentious enough election could compel some more liberal-minded Wyoming voters to stay in the Republican Party and support Cheney in 2022.\n And the dynamics of each campaign are completely different from one another. But we'll see. In the past few years, we've also seen candidates like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Lauren Boebert come out of nowhere to upend more establishment campaigns in their districts. It'd be na\u00efve for anyone to say it couldn't happen here.",

        "title": "What Biden and Congress can do to support unions",
        "body_text": "Richard Trumka is president of the 12.5 million member, 55 union AFL-CIO, America's labor federation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n At the ballot box, working people pushed America in a new direction. Two years ago, even two months ago, the idea of a pro-worker control of the US House of Representatives, Senate and White House was far-fetched. Following the victories of President Joe Biden in November and Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock three weeks ago in Georgia, that is now America's governing reality.\n Union members were a major reason these victories happened. But we know the value of these wins is in what happens after Election Day. If lawmakers don't ensure the economy works for working Americans, then what is the point?\n Amid the chaos of the Covid-19 pandemic, frontline workers are showing the world what heroism looks like. And as we confront the coronavirus with courage, big businesses and corporate executives are profiting from the service and sacrifice of American workers. Billionaires have increased their collective net worth by more than $1 trillion in the past three years. The profits these billionaires have seen could cover half the cost of Biden's bold relief package to rescue our entire nation \u2014 over 330 million people \u2014 from financial ruin.\n America's inequality crisis began long before this public health crisis, but failed leadership has deepened it. President Donald Trump lost his job and Senator Mitch McConnell lost his Senate majority because they lost control of this virus. On the verge of bankruptcy, state and local governments are cutting public sector workers from payrolls. The absence of a standard for infectious disease \u2014 a set of rules that require employers to protect workers from hazards \u2014 means employers can risk workers' lives with impunity, although Biden's executive order calling for a standard is a good first step. Food and housing insecurity is spreading just like the virus. Throw in the lack of safeguards for equal pay, fair scheduling and other long-overdue rights, and worker protections in America are among the weakest in the world.\n Sure, Trump and McConnell could have secured passage of the HEROES Act to provide relief back in May, but they shot it down. They refused to pass a dire relief package until December \u2014 after working people sent them a message with our votes, our power \u2014 and even that was a modest package.\n In the last Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the US House of Representatives passed the most significant worker empowerment legislation since the Great Depression by creating a much fairer process for forming a union. It is called the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. After an anti-worker majority blocked it in the Senate, reintroducing the PRO Act, passing it in both chambers of Congress and getting Biden's signature is vital to our economic recovery.\n The PRO Act would protect and empower workers to exercise their freedom to organize and bargain. It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after a union is recognized, end employers' practice of hiring permanent replacements to punish striking workers and finally hold corporations accountable by strengthening the National Labor Relations Board and allowing it to impose penalties on employers who retaliate against collective bargaining. It would also repeal so-called \"right to work\" laws, which make it harder for working people to form unions and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.\n Democrats can't afford to leave workers out to dry and repeat the missed opportunities of previous administrations and congresses. Workers know that too many Democratic candidates in the past were quick to cash our checks and court our votes, but they postponed our priorities \u2014 especially labor law reform \u2014 when they assumed power. This time must be different.\n The PRO Act is a generational opportunity that will transform America's labor landscape and marshal economic recovery for working people. Unions bargain for higher wages and better health care, and help ensure a more secure retirement. For instance, 79% of union members have access to defined benefit pension plans as opposed to 17% of non-union workers.\n The PRO Act is more than labor law reform, it's also civil rights legislation. We secure contracts that protect workers who have to care for a loved one and ensure our workers' voices are heard as technology evolves. We also defend women, people of color, LGBTQ people and people with different abilities from discrimination.\n The PRO Act is also an economic stimulus bill. Unions give more of us the collective power to win better pay and safer working conditions, putting additional money in workers' pockets, driving demand and creating jobs. And research from MIT shows nearly half of non-union workers \u2014 nearly 60 million people \u2014 would vote to join today if given the opportunity.\n I was in the meeting where Biden, just days after he was elected, looked a group of CEOs in the eye and said that in his administration, \"unions are going to have increased power.\" The CEOs just nodded, completely shocked to hear such a clear pro-worker message directly from an incoming president. Biden, who proudly calls himself \"a union guy,\" rightfully pointed out that worker power is \"not anti-business. It's about creating economic growth [and] creating good-paying jobs.\"\n I could not agree more, Mr. President. And that's why we need to make the PRO Act the law of the land.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden is set to order a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with his plans.\n The move is expected to be the most prominent in a series of climate actions the President will take on Wednesday, including elevating the climate crisis as a national security issue.\n The halt on new leases, which would fulfill a campaign promise by Biden, would apply to federal land and water areas, but wouldn't affect existing leases. It would allow the administration to conduct a comprehensive review of the federal leasing program.\n Biden is also expected to take action on protecting 30% of the country's land and water by 2030, known as \"30 by 30.\" \u00a0A 2018 study by the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy organization based in Washington, found that only 12% of the country's land has been conserved, including as national parks and national wildlife refuges.\n The moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands expands the 60-day moratorium Biden signed on his first day in office.\n The New York Times first reported on several of Biden's Wednesday climate plans, and The Washington Post first reported about the Wednesday halt on new oil and gas leases on federal lands.\n The President has moved swiftly to take action on climate since taking office last week, including rejoining the Paris climate accord, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and directing agencies to review and reverse more than 100 actions taken by the Trump administration on the environment.\n The actions underscore the Biden administration's prioritization of combating the climate crisis. The President has appointed former secretary of state\u00a0John Kerry\u00a0as his special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry will be a\u00a0Cabinet-level official\u00a0in Biden's administration and will sit on the National Security Council. Biden has also named Gina McCarthy, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as his White House climate czar.\n Biden said on the campaign trail he wanted to halt new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. He said at a September CNN town hall that he supports the continued the use of hydraulic fracturing\u00a0to open underground natural gas formations, a practice known as fracking, as a way to \"transition\" to cleaner kinds of energy.\n The President, who has said he will not ban fracking, was pressed during the presidential campaign by several 2020 Democratic primary rivals and climate activists to call for a nationwide ban on fracking.\n Fracking is a controversial method of drilling that involves shooting high pressure water, sand and other compounds underground to make small fractures in rock to release oil and gas.\u00a0There have been questions about the effect fracking has on drinking water, methane emissions, and it has been tied to a rise in earthquakes.",

        "title": "Kobe Bryant wasn't just an NBA star. He was an ambassador for all sports, right up to his death",
        "body_text": "(CNN)NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who died last year at age 41, will likely be best known for his gifts with the roundball. He was one of the best to take the court and one of basketball's greatest ambassadors, heralding the men's and women's game at its youth, college, pro and international levels.\n Yet the Los Angeles Lakers luminary was multifaceted -- serving as a writer, producer, spokesman, philanthropist, mentor and #girldad. The Black Mamba appreciated greatness in all its forms -- and saw sport as transformative.\n He believed, like Nelson Mandela whom he quoted in an Instagram post in 2014, that \"sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers.\"\n This belief permeated the mission at Mamba Sports Academy, to which Bryant, daughter Gianna and seven others were en route when their helicopter crashed a year ago in the Santa Monica Mountains in Calabasas, California.\n Here's a look at the times he directed his considerable light on the world's other sporting pastimes.\n Sharia Washington, one of Bryant's two sisters, played volleyball for Temple, with a sportswriter declaring in 1997 that she was \"every bit the athlete Kobe is\" (and she was able to dunk before her little brother!). Bryant's oldest child, Natalia, followed in her aunt's footsteps so, of course, he loved the game.\n An enormous fan of the international game, Bryant spent time as a child in Italy, where he learned to play soccer and love AC Milan, one of the country's most storied teams.\n Game recognize game, as they say, so it should surprise no one that his social media is littered with references to the sport's best players and teams, including the US Women's National Team, the men's Brazilian, German and Italian teams and stars Lionel Messi, Megan Rapinoe, Mia Hamm and Ronaldinho. He even once gave a shout-out to Clint Dempsey after the American slotted one off the post to open scoring against Ghana in the 2014 World Cup.\n Bryant joined Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Olympics (the city was selected for the 2028 Games instead) and appeared with fellow gold medalist Michael Phelps at the Golden Goggles to give yet a third gold medalist, Katie Ledecky, the 2017 female swimmer of the year award. He's also been a stalwart for parasports.\n \"The lesson I cherish the most is how important it is to love what you do,\" Bryant, freshly retired from the NBA, told Special Olympians in a 2016 video message. \"If you love what you do and it's making you happy, all the hard work and perseverance will pay off. When you know you're truly giving it your all, there's no greater feeling in the world.\"\n Bryant returned to the United States when he was 13. After middle school, he played ball at Lower Merion High School, outside of Philadelphia, before heading straight to the pros. The City of Brotherly Love was anything but when Bryant returned in the Lakers' purple and gold. Philadelphians regularly booed their hometown prodigy, but Bryant always remained true to his Eagles.\n He also spoke with reverence for stars like Tom Brady, Richard Sherman and Ray Lewis, who, like Bryant, fought to restore his image following criminal allegations away from the field of play. During a 2012 national championship matchup, Bryant showed his love for the college game, applauding Alabama's AJ McCarron and Barrett Jones after a midgame scuffle.\n Bryant showed more GOAT-on-GOAT love with snaps alongside Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, who he described as \"top of the line for me\" when it came to tennis players.\n Bryant often had the next generation on his mind, and Williams served as a muse for one of his literary creations, \"Legacy and the Queen,\" about a 12-year-old tennis player who must win a tournament to keep an orphanage open.\n \"I want kids to learn by reading our novels, and in our latest book, our main character has to learn to use her passion for tennis to rise above those around her and shine,\" the father of four said of the book.\n OK, OK, Bryant didn't talk about auto racing so much. This header is more an excuse to include his \"Mamba on the track!\" post, featuring the Lakers shooting guard, during a trip to the town of Maranello, Italy, flying by in a canary-yellow Ferrari.\n Bryant enjoyed combat sports, and he regularly lauded mixed martial arts stars, including Ronda Rousey and Junior dos Santos, as well as boxing's Muhammad Ali and Floyd Mayweather.\n One fighter, however, stood above the rest: the inimitable Bruce Lee. Not only did Mamba tell a Chinese newspaper in 2017 that the famed martial artist's Jeet Kune Do philosophy helped him learn the importance of being able to adapt and react, but Nike has released multiple Bruce Lee editions of Bryant's line of sneakers.\n \"Bruce Lee was always one of my muses growing up,\" Bryant told the newspaper. \"I've read everything he's ever written; I've watched every film he's ever been in, and I've watched pretty much every interview he's ever done.\"\n He grew up a Yankees fan, but Bryant said he always had love for the Dodgers. He once joined then-Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp, President Bill Clinton and Olympic gold medalist sprinter Allyson Felix for a roundtable about the importance of children playing sports.\n A regular at Los Angeles Kings games, Bryant applauded the team after it twice in three seasons hung championship banners from the Staples Center rafters, where Bryant's teams hung five.\n Many National Hockey League players lamented his death, including superstar Alex Ovechkin. New Jersey Devils defenseman P.K. Subban, one of a few dozen Black players in the NHL, revealed after Bryant's death that the baller had served as a mentor.\n Hardly a shocker that when Bryant brought up snowboarding, he focused on the sport's greatest, Shaun White.\n Bryant and Lakers teammate Pau Gasol once owned an interest in a horse, Siempre Mio -- Spanish for \"Always Mine.\" While that is a little-known factoid, better known is that Bryant took inspiration from the best, including the best of the best: Secretariat.\n \"I was like a wild horse that had the potential to become Secretariat, but who was just too f**king wild. So part of that was (Lakers coach Phil Jackson) trying to tame me,\" he once said.\n During \"Dancing With the Stars,\" Bryant backed actor and singer Zendaya, using the hashtags #differentanimalsamebeast and #beastmode, which he typically reserved for athletes he admired.\n More importantly, this provides an opportunity to tidily end the story with a clip of a 12-year-old Kobe Bean popping and locking to a Vanilla Ice classic circa 1990.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n (CNN)Republican Sen. Rob Portman's retirement announcement caught Washington DC by surprise. Portman, who won reelection in Ohio in 2016 by 21 points, was seemingly not on anyone's radar for potential retirement.\n This is bad news for Republicans. Not merely because defending an open seat is more difficult than when an incumbent, especially a popular one like Portman, is running for reelection, but also because the departure of smart conservative workhorses like Portman leaves extreme candidates more likely to win a primary.\n If they win, the party is changed for the worse. And if they lose, those extreme candidates still tend to define how the Republican Party is perceived.\n That perception reflects a longtime trend.\n 2010 was a great year for Republicans. They gained more than 60 seats in the US House of Representatives and six US Senate seats. But two  congressional candidates, both unsuccessful, planted the seed that Republican candidates were increasingly outlandish in their performance and beliefs. That seed grew.\n In Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, a Tea Party-backed Republican Senate candidate, was forced to go on the defensive in an effort to explain her earlier remarks about \"dabbl[ing] into witchcraft.\" Instead of focusing her attacks on her opponent, Democrat Chris Coons, she was running an infamous ad that began, \"I am not a witch.\"\n Meanwhile, in Nevada, Tea Party-supported Sharron Angle emerged from a crowded GOP field only to have her campaign against a potentially beatable Democrat, Harry Reid, sidetracked with her strange claims that some American cities were governed by sharia law (Islamic religious law) and her avoidance of the press -- in part, because of her odd statements.\n In 2012, Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin, a candidate running against the vulnerable Democrat, Claire McCaskill, found himself on the defensive over comments about women's bodies supposedly blocking pregnancy after what he called \"legitimate rape.\" Akin apologized, but later unapologized, and McCaskill won the election by some 15 points.\n Akin practically had an ideological soulmate in Indiana's GOP Senate nominee, Richard Mourdock, who, in addition to questioning the constitutionality of Medicare and Social Security -- popular programs among seniors, the most reliable of voting blocs -- also made controversial comments about abortion. Specifically, he said God \"intended\" rape pregnancies. Though Mourdock later apologized for the \"misinterpretation\" of his comments, the damage was done. In another blown opportunity for Republicans, Democrat Joe Donnelly won election.\n What these candidates all have in common is not simply costing the GOP winnable US Senate seats. It's that they began to define the party in the run up to former President Donald Trump's rise.\n In 2010, O'Donnell became a household name and laughingstock. In 2012, Republican candidates throughout the country were taken off their messages as Democrats effectively nationalized the Akin and Mourdock comments, causing Republicans yet more problems with women voters.\n While these candidates shared a willingness to stoke anger and use fiery rhetoric, they did not have Trump's command of media or ability to dominate the political conversation.\n Which brings us back to the Portman retirement. Along with Portman, Sens. Richard Burr and Pat Toomey are retiring in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, respectively. And Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey says he won't run for US Senate in 2022.\n It's possible Republicans might nominate Trump loyalists Rep. Jim Jordan to replace Portman and Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, to replace Burr. Meanwhile, the Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, another Trump supporter, may run in the US Senate race in Arizona, in which Democrat Mark Kelly will be up for reelection. Not to mention that Trump's former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, announced Monday she was running for governor of Arkansas -- and received the former president's endorsement shortly after.\n Win or lose -- and, to be clear, Ward, who has already lost two Republican primaries, could certainly lose again -- these candidates would further define the GOP as the party of Trump even as the former president's popularity has dropped following the insurrection he inspired. For the Republicans who hoped to put Trump in rear view mirror, this could spell disaster.\n State parties may not care. Indeed, by attacking fellow Republicans, party officials in places like Arizona, Oregon and Virginia scare away potential moderate Republican voters who do not subscribe to Trumpism. Through censure and resolutions, these officials seek to cast out any Republican they view as not sufficiently loyal to the former President.\n This was misguided enough during the Trump years. Traditionally, parties have believed it is important to grow their base -- not shrink it through loyalty tests. But as the GOP continues to go further down the road of tribalism, mistaking Trumpian tactics and controversy for long-term strategy, they risk further electoral and policy losses.",

        "title": "America's billionaires have grown $1.1 trillion richer during the pandemic",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business)Billionaires are minting money during the pandemic, even as millions of Americans join the ranks of the poor.\n US billionaires have collectively become $1.1 trillion -- nearly 40% -- richer since mid-March, according to a report published Tuesday by progressive groups Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness.\n In other words, not only have the uber-wealthy recovered their losses from the spring, many are faring much better than before. That's in large part because of the sizzling stock market. Elon Musk alone is about $155 billion richer, boosted by Tesla's skyrocketing market valuation.\n Forty-six people joined the ranks of billionaires since March 18, 2020, the week after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, according to the report.\n Clearly, the pandemic is worsening America's already troubling inequality crisis. The staggering gains at the top contrast sharply with the financial struggles of those at the bottom, many of whom are on the front lines of the pandemic and have lost their jobs or had wages cut.\n America's 660 billionaires now hold $4.1 trillion in wealth -- two thirds more than the amount held by the bottom 50% of the US population, the report found.\n More than 8 million Americans fell into poverty during the final six months of 2020, according to real-time estimates published by economists at the University of Chicago, University of Notre Dame and the Lab for Economic Opportunities.\n The US poverty rate declined during the first few months of the pandemic, in large part because of the federal government's stimulus checks. However, the poverty rate climbed 2.4 percentage points during the second half of the year -- nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s, the economists found.\n Some groups have suffered more than others. The poverty rate for Black Americans is 5.4 percentage points higher today than in June 2020, translating to 2.4 million people who have fallen into poverty, the economists found.\n For those with a high school education or less, the poverty rate has surged to 22.5%, compared to 17% in June.\n Florida, Mississippi, Arizona and North Carolina were among the states that suffered the largest increases in poverty rates. The state-level findings \"suggest that poverty rose more in states with less effective unemployment insurance systems,\" the economists said in the report.\n The wealth and poverty statistics provide further proof of America's K-shaped economic recovery.\n The stock market is at record highs, the housing market is booming and Big Tech is thriving. However, other industries including airlines, restaurants, hotels and movie theaters are still in disarray.\n Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden's newly confirmed Treasury secretary, has acknowledged this problem and suggested it's nothing new.\n \"Well before Covid-19 infected a single American, we were living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built on wealth while working families fell further and further behind,\" Yellen told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing last week.\n Biden and Yellen are calling for bold action from Congress to ease inequality. Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks, $350 billion in state and local aid and enhanced unemployment benefits. The White House is also expected to push for a multi-trillion infrastructure package that would be aimed at further boosting the economy -- and could be financed in part by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n The pandemic has been a boon to the housing market, with existing home sales hitting a 14-year high in 2020. Home prices, a major source of wealth, hit a record high.\n The stock market has played a significant role in the divide between rich and poor.\n Even though the US economy has not fully recovered from the pandemic, the S&P 500 is up by 72% from its low point in March. That V-shaped recovery reflects optimism about vaccines, trillions in relief provided by Washington and unprecedented steps from the Federal Reserve that have essentially forced investors to bet on stocks.\n Not surprisingly, surging stock prices are especially helpful to the wealthy because they have more skin in the game. As of early 2020, the wealthiest 10% of US households owned 87% of all stocks and mutual funds, according to the Federal Reserve. By contrast, millions of less affluent Americans can't feel the stock market boom.\n Tesla's (TSLA) skyrocketing share price has lifted Musk's wealth by more than 600%, according to the wealth report. Other big gainers include Amazon (AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, whose wealth has climbed by more than $68 billion during the pandemic. Facebook (FB) co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is about $37 billion more wealthy than in mid-March.\n Inequality isn't just an American problem.\n It will take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recoup their losses from the pandemic, according to Oxfam International's annual inequality report released Sunday. By contrast, it took just nine months for the world's top 1,000 billionaires to recover.",

        "title": "Rand Paul calls impeachment 'dead on arrival' after most Republicans signal that trial is unconstitutional",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN)The Senate tabled an effort by Sen. Rand Paul Tuesday to force a vote on the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, but the vote offered an indicator for how Republican senators -- who overwhelmingly voted for Paul's measure -- feel about the trial.\n Paul's motion was killed on a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all Democrats, meaning 45 Republicans voted for Paul's effort. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n In order to convict Trump at his trial, at least 17 Republicans will need to vote with all Democrats when the trial begins next month. Significantly, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sided with Paul in the vote -- a potential indicator that he agrees the constitutionality of impeaching a former President is in question.\n Paul argued after the vote that the fact that 45 Republicans sided with him \"shows that impeachment is dead on arrival.\"\n \"If you voted that it was unconstitutional then how in the world would you ever hope to convict somebody for this?\" Paul asked, adding ,\"45 of us, almost the entire caucus, 95% of the caucus, voted that the whole proceeding was unconstitutional. This is a big victory for us. Democrats can beat this partisan horse as long as they want -- this vote indicates it's over, the trial is all over.\"\n Even those Republicans who voted against Paul's measure -- including Collins -- said Tuesday's vote was a sign of the eventual outcome of the trial.\n \"Do the math,\" she said. \"I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that the President will be convicted.\"\n Still, the trial will offer both sides a chance to make their case, and some lawmakers who voted with Paul left open the idea that they still could vote differently next month.\n John Thune, the Senate minority whip, argued that the vote won't bind lawmakers after the trial gets into full swing.\n \"It was a question on the constitutionality of it. I don't think it binds anybody once the trial starts,\" he said, adding, \"But I think most of us thought that the threshold issue of whether or not you can remove as the Constitution suggests somebody who is no longer in office -- I think most of our members concluded that from a constitutional standpoint is on really shaky ground.\"\n Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who recently announced he won't seek reelection in 2022, said he voted with Paul because he thinks there should be a debate on the constitutionality of an impeachment trial for a former president.\n \"I want to hear it debated,\" Portman told reporters. \"The vote to table is inconsistent with that, you know, but I've not made my mind up. I'm a juror. And I mean I've the same position Mitch McConnell has. He didn't do that to be tabled either, even though he wants to have, you know, a fulsome discussion.\"\n The Democratic-led House has already voted to impeach Trump, charging him with incitement of insurrection for the attack on the Capitol that left multiple people dead. But two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to convict Trump after a trial, an extremely high bar to clear.\n The Senate vote on Tuesday effectively put senators on record as to whether they believe a trial of a former President is constitutional. Given the limited language in the Constitution on impeachment, legal experts disagree about whether the Senate can convict a former president. But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional.\n Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said earlier on Tuesday of the possibility Paul could force the vote, \"he has a wealth of very unusual ideas.\"\n Paul said in a floor speech ahead of the vote, \"I want this body on record, every last person here: Is this how you think politics should be?\"\n \"Democrats insist on applying a test of incitement to a Republican that they refuse to apply to themselves,\" he said. \"I want Democrats to raise their hands if they have ever given a speech that says 'take back,' 'fight for your country,' who hasn't used the words fight figuratively?\"\n He went on to say, \"Are we going to put every politician in jail -- are we going to impeach every politician who has used the words fight figuratively in a speech? Shame!\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Ali Zaslav and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN Business)Two of TikTok's rivals in the United States are joining forces at a time when TikTok itself now appears to be here to stay.\n On Tuesday, Clash announced it was acquiring Byte, a short-form video app launched by a cofounder of Vine, the beloved six-second video app owned and shut down by Twitter.\n Terms of the Byte deal were not disclosed.\n It's just the latest example of M&A activity and strategy shifts among TikTok rivals after a roller coaster year. TikTok appeared to be on the cusp of getting banned in the US, where it counts 100 million users, only to outlast the Trump administration, which had been pushing to shut it down in the country because its parent company is based in China.\n Dubsmash, another TikTok competitor with a similar algorithmic feed serving up entertaining videos, was acquired last month by Reddit. Meanwhile, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, which launched a TikTok clone called Reels days after then President Donald Trump said he would ban TikTok, recently admitted \"TikTok is ahead.\" He also hinted at a need for Instagram to simplify or consolidate its video product offerings.\n Clash was one of the many competitors that seemed poised to benefit from TikTok's troubles. Like TikTok, Clash lets users upload short videos set to music and offers an algorithmic feed serving up content it thinks you'd like. Byte offers a similar experience, except with hidden follower counts and likes.\n As headlines swirled about a potential TikTok ban, social media creators quickly started posting about Clash as they tried to find ways to fill a potential TikTok void. The app, which officially launched in August, saw 100,000 new downloads in just three days. To date, Clash said it's had more than 500,000 downloads.\n But with Trump now out of office, TikTok's future in the US looks less uncertain.\n The Byte app will \"continue to have the same great in-app experience\" Clash said, but it will add new ways to monetize and other features. Clash said it's working on ways for its creators to earn money directly on the platform, including from viral videos and top fans giving payments on a regular basis, which it hopes will help it stand out in a crowded market.\n The competition for social media creators is fierce. TikTok has established a fund that will top $1 billion to pay its stars, while Snapchat is giving away $1 million a day to the people who create the most entertaining videos for its Spotlight short-form video feature.",

        "title": "Airbnb was ensnared in the Capitol Riot fallout. It somehow still came out on top",
        "body_text": "Washington, DCBrian Chesky had some air mattresses, but not much more, in 2008 when the presidential election triggered an idea for his then-fledgling startup, Airbnb.\n To draw attention to their site, Chesky and his co-founders started selling politically themed cereals. There were Obama-os, \"the breakfast of change,\" and Captain McCains, \"a maverick in every bite,\" as Chesky has recalled in interviews. Money had been so tight that year, Chesky said, that he lost 20 pounds as he ate less.\n Luckily, the cereal gimmick was a hit, selling out in days, Chesky said in a 2013 interview with the tech publication Pando. Airbnb sold about $30,000 of cereal, and got mostly out of debt, he said. Politics could be part of the marketing strategy, especially for a company just scraping by.\n Just over 13 years later, Chesky doesn't have to worry about his next meal. He's worth billions of dollars after Airbnb's December 2020 initial public offering. The company's stock doubled on its first day.\n But the most recent presidential election and inauguration have proven radically different than the first for which Airbnb was around.\n In a world in which American corporations can no longer maintain a sense of detached indifference, Chesky and Airbnb must increasingly wrangle with politics and power beyond what a company like Airbnb would usually have to deal with, as Washington, DC's violent insurrection illustrated. Few in the hospitality industry could have imagined having to consider issues like an insurrection when Chesky first launched Airbnb.\n But somehow, Chesky and Airbnb might come out on top all over again.\n Earlier this month, Airbnb hosts were alarmed to find their homes used as staging grounds for violence. Calls came for Airbnb and competitors to restrict rentals.\n Organizers calling for a DC shutdown said that their volunteers messaged 3,400 DC Airbnb hosts and encouraged them not to rent their properties.\n Chesky and Airbnb faced questions of their responsibility to the American democracy. Any move in either direction could have had a significant financial impact on Airbnb, as presidential inaugurations historically attract thousands of visitors who are willing to pay top dollar to stay in the nation's capital.\n Get it right, and Chesky would look like a responsible corporate steward. (Both Chesky and Airbnb declined to comment for this story.)\n Days after the Capitol insurrection, Airbnb released a \"Capitol Safety Plan,\" saying it would review DC reservations and ban individuals involved in criminal activity at the Capitol. But that didn't quiet critics. DC residents continued to call on Airbnb to halt reservations. Government officials like DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan called for people to not attend the inauguration in person.\n Chesky announced a revised plan Jan. 13, canceling all short-term reservations in the greater Washington, DC area, not only refunding guests' payments, but reimbursing lost reservation income to hosts, too. Long-term reservations that extended outside Jan. 15-21 were unaffected.\n Peter Kern, CEO of VRBO's parent company Expedia told CNN Business Jan. 18 that there were \"a lot of completely legitimate and appropriate uses of the properties.\" A day later, though, Expedia announced that new reservations would be blocked in Washington, DC, following updated guidance from government officials.\n In a blog post in which it announced its decision Airbnb warned of \"armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration\" in its blog post.\n Airbnb seems to have navigated the situation without any major issues. But doing so wasn't a given.\n It was unclear before the inauguration how effective Airbnb's reservation review process was, and if it led to meaningful cancellations, or any at all. Airbnb declined to say how many cancellations were made before the inauguration. Its competitor, VRBO, also declined to say if its own reviews had led to cancellations.\n Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president, public affairs and policy at U.S. Travel Association, which represents travel industry companies like Airbnb and Expedia Group, believes that there could be more coordination and information sharing in the future to benefit the industry. Hotels and rental car companies could receive the same access to security threats as airlines do.\n \"We're witnessing these kinds of events in a way that in most of our lifetime, we haven't seen,\" Barnes said. \"The more engagement, the better.\"",

        "title": "Biden wasting no time naming officials to reverse Trump's immigration policies",
        "body_text": "(CNN)The Department of Homeland Security, largely hollowed out over the last four years, is moving with urgency to staff agencies with people who had front row seats to the hardline immigration limits rolled out under former President Donald Trump, in order to rescind them.\n The department -- the third largest in the US government -- was closely tied to Trump's immigration actions and will continue to play a critical role in the coming months and years as those policies are reversed. Over recent days, the department has started to hire staff with extensive backgrounds in immigrant rights, immigration law and refugee resettlement.\n \"It will have a substantial difference in the ability of the department to execute because people understand what's going on,\" said Peter Boogaard, communications director at FWD.us and a DHS official under President Barack Obama. \"The Trump administration weaponized the immigration system for four years. There's a clear understanding for many of these folks going back in what's at stake here.\"\n Ashley Tabaddor, for example, will serve at US Citizenship and Immigration Services as its top lawyer after nearly 16 years as an immigration judge and holding various positions at the Justice Department before that.\n During the Trump administration, Tabaddor, in her capacity as the president of the immigration judges' union, was outspoken about the impact of Trump's policies -- like imposing case quotas, reversing rulings and curtailing judges' ability to exercise discretion in some cases -- on judges and immigrants.\n President Joe Biden's administration has begun taking steps to shift the tone -- from restricting immigration to welcoming immigrants -- in its first few days. Shortly after taking office, Biden released a slew of immigration executive actions and orders, including reversing the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, halting border wall construction and placing a 100-day pause on deportations.\n Over the weekend, White House officials previewed more actions on the horizon, including creating a family reunification task force, addressing legal immigration and outlining a holistic approach to regional migration.\n If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick for Homeland Security secretary, will be among those leading the charge. The Cuban-born Mayorkas was among Biden's earliest announced nominees and would be the first Latino and immigrant to serve at the helm of the department.\n \"The principles of homeland and security have been tremendously important in shaping my life. My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism and to provide me with the security, opportunity and pride that American citizenship brings to each of us,\" Mayorkas told lawmakers last week, drawing on his own immigrant background.\n The Senate Homeland Security Committee will vote on Mayorkas' nomination on Tuesday. If he receives approval from the committee and then the Senate, Mayorkas will be flanked with staffers well versed in the abundant policy changes of the last four years.\n David Shahoulian, who worked at DHS under the Obama administration, is assistant secretary for border security and immigration. Shahoulian also served as Democratic chief counsel of the House Judiciary Committee -- one of the key committees that obtained documents from the Trump administration about the controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy that resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant families.\n He's joined by Adam Hunter, who serves as deputy assistant secretary on immigration for DHS. Hunter comes from the Refugee Council USA, a coalition of 29 nongovernmental agencies focused on refugee protection. Biden has committed to raising the ceiling for how many refugees can come to the US after years of historic lows.\n Angela Kelley, who has an extensive background in immigration policy, is joining as senior counselor on immigration.\n Early on, the makeup of the Biden-Harris transition team reviewing DHS signaled the incoming administration's awareness of those actions, with Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, as the team lead. Jaddou is rumored to be filling the role of director at that agency.\n \"The Biden immigration team is stocked with seasoned professionals who understand the nuances of immigration enforcement,\" said John Sandweg, who served at DHS under Obama.\n Sharmistha Das, who worked for then-Sen. Kamala Harris, is the deputy general counsel for DHS. Her name has since appeared on a document delaying a Trump regulation that would bar asylum seekers from countries with disease outbreaks.\n Other familiar names in immigration circles, like Tyler Moran and Esther Olavarria, have also come to fill top roles. Moran, who also served under Obama and as senior policy adviser to then-Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, is now special assistant to the President for immigration for the Domestic Policy Council and playing a critical role in the administration's immigration legislative push.\n During the US Conference of Mayors winter meeting Saturday, Olavarria and Moran previewed upcoming immigration actions. Olavarria cited a future executive order that would rescind Trump proclamations that had largely barred the admission of low-income immigrants.\n \"These are policies that ignored the decades -- and centuries, actually -- of contributions that immigrants have made to our economy, to our society, to our culture,\" Olavarria said. \"We'd rescind those policies and return to a country that welcomes immigrants and acknowledges their contributions.\"\n Another executive action would present a new vision for migration, like providing funding to address root causes of migration and standing up a refugee admissions program for Central Americans, according to Olavarria, who also nodded to actions that would put in place a \"fair but efficient asylum program\" on the US-Mexico border and restore the US refugee admissions program.\n Moran stressed, however, that while Biden can make inroads on immigration policy through executive authority, it's still necessary to pass legislation.\n \"The President does have a lot of authority to fix the immigration system in a number of different ways,\" Moran said. \"But what really the President cannot do is provide permanent status to people, and we've made so many runs at this but we really have to get it done to make sure that people are on a path to citizenship.\"",

Cases continue to rise sharply in some parts of the world, and every day the losses mount, as more people lose loved ones to Covid-19, lose a business or lose their livelihood.\n On January 15, the official global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpassed 2 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n While the 2 million figure is horrifying, experts say the real death toll is likely much higher. Only confirmed Covid-19 deaths are included in the tally, which means that people who die without a firm diagnosis may not be included.\n Similarly, many people will have been infected with the coronavirus without having a positive test to confirm it. In the early stages of the pandemic fewer tests were available, and testing remains inadequate in many countries now.\n Nonetheless, with a world population of some 7.67 billion, according to the latest World Bank figures, the global case tally suggests that about one in every 76 people has now had the virus.\n Despite countries imposing measures ranging from travel bans to school closures to full national lockdowns, the coronavirus has continued its inexorable spread, reaching every continent by December and leaving a trail of financial hardship, struggling hospitals and heartbreak in its wake.\n The world passed the threshold of 1 million confirmed cases on April 2, and 10 million on June 28, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n It took until November 7 for the world to register 50 million confirmed cases. Since then, the trend has accelerated sharply. The 90 million case mark was passed less than three weeks ago, on January 10.\n Almost a quarter of the 100 million cases reported so far have occurred in the United States, data from Johns Hopkins University shows. And more than 400,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US, a tragic milestone reached on the last full day of Donald Trump's presidency.\n The second-worst affected country in terms of overall case numbers, India, accounts for just over one-tenth of the global confirmed cases. There have been more than 152,000 deaths there, according to Johns Hopkins.\n Brazil has reported more than 8.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and 217,000 deaths, the second highest death toll after the United States.\n Excess mortality figures released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, indicate that around 297,500 more deaths occurred in the EU between March and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2016 to 2019.\n As governments around the world seek to limit further spread of the virus, the emergence of new, more infectious variants is causing great concern to scientists.\n One such variant was first detected in southeast England late last year; another has been detected in South Africa and two more in Brazil. A variation has also been seen in the US state of California that may or may not be driving renewed spread there.\n The B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain has now been found in at least 60 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this month it could worsen the spread of the pandemic.\n Scientists have been racing to see whether the changes in the virus will make it as susceptible to available treatments and vaccines, amid fears that the mutations will allow them to evade some of the immunity induced by vaccination.\n Research released this week provided some reassuring evidence that despite those mutations, people vaccinated against Covid-19 will be protected against the emerging new variants.\n Mass Covid-19 vaccination programs seem to offer the fastest path out of the pandemic -- but countries' access to vaccine supply and the capacity to distribute and administer jabs varies greatly.\n Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the US, Denmark and the UK have led the way in the rate of doses administered per 100 people, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. But some countries have yet to start rolling out inoculations.\n In the US, President Joe Biden has set a target of administering 100 million doses of vaccine in his first 100 days in office. More than 17.5 million doses had been administered across the country as of Thursday, a day after he was sworn in.\n Infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said that despite challenges with the distribution and administration of vaccines, the US \"can and should\" vaccinate 70-85% of US adults by the end of summer, which could mean a semblance of normality by the fall.\n In the UK, the government aims to give everyone in the most vulnerable groups at least a first dose by mid-February, and to have vaccinated all adults by the fall.\n Meanwhile, all those globally who are not vaccinated must continue to rely on the social distancing, hygiene and mask-wearing measures that have become all too familiar since Covid-19 arrived on the scene.\n No one knows how many tens of millions more people worldwide will be infected with the coronavirus -- or how many millions more will die -- before this pandemic is brought under control.\n According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 500 million people, or one third of the world's population at the time, became infected during the 1918 influenza pandemic. That virus caused at least 50 million deaths, of which about 675,000 were in the United States, the CDC says.\n In 2021, hopes remain high that science and modern medicine can prevail against Covid-19 with a fraction of that death toll.\n CNN's Byron Manley and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Here's a little secret for why Congress gets nothing done",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Consider these two data points:\n 1) The 116th Congress was one of the five least productive Congresses in the last five decades, according to an analysis by Pew. The 116th passed a total of 344 bills that became law, 44% of which were done in the lame-duck session held after the 2020 election.\n 2) The 116th Congress produced more than 2.2 million tweets and Facebook posts combined, eclipsing the totals of the 114th Congress by more than 738,000 posts, again according to Pew.\n These two facts are, as you might guess, related. And what they reflect is how the incentive structure has changed for elected officials in Washington.\n In the time before social media -- and even cable news -- the goal of every single member of the House or Senate was simple: Build relationships with your colleagues, demonstrate your knowledge of the intricacies of policy, pass bills and, most of all, accrue seniority. The acme of serving in Congress in those days was (through political savvy and years of service) to chair one of the big committees: Appropriations, Ways and Means, Judiciary or, for the foreign-policy focused, Foreign Relations.\n Those committee chairs were treated like demigods; they ruled their fiefdoms with total and complete authority and could not only make or break a specific policy proposal, but also a more junior colleague's career. That was the path to power -- with apologies to Robert Caro -- in Washington. The only one.\n The arrival of 24-hour cable news began to change that dynamic. And the surge of social media over the last decade has now fundamentally altered it.\n What those two new(ish) platforms have provided is a way to power and influence -- inside and outside of Washington -- that has nothing to do with how long you've served in Congress or what committees you're on.\n Consider this from Pew:\n \"The 10 members of the million-follower club in the 114th Congress contained no first-term lawmakers. But the members of the 116th Congress who had more than 1 million followers included five first-term lawmakers, as well as nine lawmakers who passed the million-follower mark over the course of the most recent Congress.\"\n Five members of Congress who were in their first terms -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Dan Crenshaw (R-Florida) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) as well as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) -- all have more than 1 million followers. (Romney, obviously, benefits from his previous high profile as the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.)\n And while some members of congressional leadership have been quick to dismiss those with massive social media followings -- \"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in July 2019. \"But they didn't have any following\" -- there's absolutely no question that the likes of AOC and Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz (1.1 million followers)have been able to parlay their social media following into real prominence and power.\n AOC is, without question, the face of young liberals in the country. Gaetz has leveraged his willingness to say (and tweet) controversial things into a major national platform -- as he is regularly featured on conservative talk shows and has become such a hot commodity among pro-Trump people within the party that he is traveling to Wyoming this week to campaign against Rep. Liz Cheney.\n Members of Congress see social media then as a way to cut past the traditional path to power. Why spend years making nice with older members and serving as the 14th ranking member of the minority party on the House Appropriations Committee when you could be a weekly guest on Sean Hannity's primetime show on Fox News and gets thousands of retweets for anything you put on Twitter?\n What the focus on Twitter and Facebook incentivizes is a willingness to take the most extreme stances. It gives priority to the loudest voices in the room, which are not always the smartest voices in the room. And it disincentivizes those not willing to throw rhetorical bombs in the constant hunt for retweets and likes.\n Of course, what the social media shortcut, uh, shortchanges, is the actual work that members of Congress are elected to do. Like legislate. And pass bills. And find ways to deliver for their constituents.\n You can absolutely argue -- and be right! -- that the old way of doings things in Congress tended to reward longevity over effectiveness. And tilted heavily to keeping older white men in positions of power while offering few avenues of opportunity for women and people of color.\n But what has replaced that old system is also deeply flawed. Congress was envisioned as a deliberative body -- where members of both parties engaged in lively debate and, while not always agreeing, found ways to work together. None of that can be done with a tweet -- no matter how fire it is.",

        "title": "Republicans still have one big card to play this year",
        "body_text": "(CNN)There's no question that Republicans are\u00a0not in a good spot politically at the moment.\n Not only are they out of power in the White House, the Senate and the House, they are in the early stages of a civil war between pro-Trump forces and the establishment wing of the party that is going to get much, much uglier.\n But before you start writing the political obituary for the Republican Party in Washington, you need to consider this oft-ignored but critically important card that the GOP still has in hand: The Republican Party will control the bulk of the redistricting processes in the country.\n Wrote David Wasserman, The Cook Political Report's House editor, in his big look at the state of redistricting on Tuesday:\n \"Republicans may not be as dominant as they were in 2011 when they redrew nearly five times as many congressional seats as Democrats. But they still hold far more raw power. They fared well in 2020's state legislative elections and maintained control of several huge prizes: Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which are collectively poised to gain six seats from the Census.\"\n (Remember that following the census every decade, all state legislative and congressional lines are redrawn based on population gains and losses.)\n While the 2020 election wound up being a\u00a0very\u00a0mixed one for Republicans -- particularly once they lost both Georgia US Senate seats -- the down-ballot races for House and state legislatures were actually a major bright spot.\n Despite significant vulnerabilities, Republicans didn't lose their majorities in a single state legislative chamber, while they retook control from Democrats in two: the New Hampshire House and Senate.\n According to Wasserman, that means Republicans will have the final say in 188 House seats, while Democrats will be in total control of the lines in just 73 seats. (Another 45 seats will be under divided control between the two parties and 122 will see their lines drawn by independent or bipartisan commissions.)\n That's a 115-seat line-drawing edge for Republicans. And that's why the party has at least some reason for optimism heading into the next two years.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Dale Moss has opened up about his broken engagement with Clare Crawley.\n The couple made \"Bachelorette\" history this season after they fell in love and she withdrew from the show.\n Moss and Crawley got engaged and former \"Bachelor\" contestant Tayshia Adams replaced her to finish the season.\n But Moss recently announced that the engagement had ended and on Monday posted videos on the Instastory portion of his verified Instagram account, saying he finally felt \"comfortable getting on here after having some time to process everything that's gone on.\"\n \"I know a lot of y'all have seen me smiling on social media and say I don't seem as hurt or burdened by this, but that's the farthest thing,\" he said. \"This time has sucked.\"\n The former football player credited his friends and family with helping to support him through this difficult time and pointed out the challenges of having such a public relationship.\n \"Media will take things and run with them. People will spread lies or always want to point the finger,\" Moss said. \"But the fact of the matter is, there's no one person to blame in this situation.\"\n He said his relationship with Crawley had its \"ups and downs\" and he appeared to refute her earlier statement that she became aware of their break up at the same time as the public.\n \"The statements that came out, this didn't come out of nowhere,\" he said. \"I love Clare and respect Clare enough to let her know how I feel, even if that's against the expectations of everybody else.\"\n Crawley had earlier posted a statement on her verified Instagram account which read \"I was made aware of a 'mutual' statement at the same time you all were, so I've needed some time to really digest this.\"\n \"Speaking for myself, my intentions with this relationship have always been very clear, so the truth is I am crushed,\" the statement read. \"This was not what I expected or hoped for and am still trying to process this.\"\n In his video Moss said he was hurting and insisted that he was invested in building a healthy relationship with Crawley.\n \"While this is going to be difficult, what you'll see from me is trying to practice what I preach and continue to put my best foot forward each and every day,\" he said. \"While trying to find some sense of normalcy, I'm also going to try and find joy and happiness in each day and continue to share that. Everything else is in God's hands.\"",

        "title": "Democrats signal they could take next steps on Covid relief package as soon as next week",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Democrats are swiftly moving to unlock an arcane Senate budget process to pass a Covid-19 relief bill with just Democratic votes even as the Biden administration continues their outreach to Republican senators to make the bill bipartisan.\n Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday that the Senate could move as soon as next week to pass a budget resolution. That would be a first step in beginning the process to write a bill that would include Democratic priorities and could pass the Senate with just 51 votes.\n \"In keeping our options open, on our caucus call today, I informed senators to be prepared that a vote on a budget resolution could come as early as next week,\" Schumer said.\n Still, passing a budget resolution is just the first step in what is known as reconciliation, a specific and technical Senate budget process that allows passage of some legislation with just a simple majority. A vote on the resolution, which could bypass committee, according to multiple aides, would then allow the Senate to give a committee specific instructions to craft the language of the relief proposal. After that, the legislation would have to undergo a rigorous review process by the Senate parliamentarian who would decide if each provision in the bill met the rules required under reconciliation.\n Democrats have argued that moving ahead with the budget resolution is hardly a sign that they are giving up on bipartisan talks, but they argue they need to kickstart that process now in case those bipartisan talks falter.\n \"Time is of the essence to address this crisis,\" Schumer said. \"We are keeping all options open.\"\n House Democrats are working on a parallel track also preparing to vote as soon as next week on their own budget resolution.\n \"We are prepared to go to the floor as early as next week,\" Rep. John Yarmuth, the Democratic House Budget chairman told CNN Monday. \"We will be ready to go.\"\n Looming over the legislative effort is the reality for Senate Democrats that an impeachment trial set to begin in two weeks will bring all other Senate business to a halt. Acting now, Democrats argue, is essential in ensuring they don't waste time later.\n The incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Bernie Sanders said that his panel is already writing its budget resolution.\n \"I think that there is a consensus that Republicans are not prepared to come on board. That's fine,\" Sanders said.\n It is still unclear which committees will ultimately have a role in writing the relief bill. It's expected House Ways and Means as well as Senate Finance will play a pivotal role, although other committees may be given instructions as well.\n Republicans, however, say they aren't done talking. While many have signaled they can't support a Covid relief package that costs nearly $2 trillion just a month after they passed a $900 billion bill, senators are still having conversations with their Democratic colleagues. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas who has been part of the bipartisan talks, told reporters on Tuesday that White House officials had just reached out to him again to follow up. Other Republicans such as Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, said it would be \"irresponsible\" for Democrats to move ahead with reconciliation so soon.\n \"If the House decides to go ahead with the reconciliation approach, which is a way to get around working with Republicans, I think that would be not just a big mistake at this stage at the start of this administration, but irresponsible given what's happened with the Covid-19 package,\" Portman said on Tuesday. \"We're willing to work with them, and we said that on Sunday. We're willing to sit down and work out again, a proposal that is bipartisan that can be passed by both chambers that helps to expand on what we just passed.\"\n Republicans used the reconciliation tool to pass their own tax bill in 2017. They also attempted to repeal and replace Obamacare using reconciliation, an effort that ultimately failed.\n Republicans have been largely critical of President Joe Biden's maiden legislative push, arguing its inclusion of raising the minimum wage to $15 and expanding the child tax credit have little to do with battling the outbreak or the resulting economic downturn.\n Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said there is consensus in recognizing the need for more money for vaccine production, distribution and people to administer the vaccine, but that there is larger disagreement about other provisions.\n She told reporters she had \"a good discussion\" with a high ranking White House official Monday but said, \"This package should focus solely on the persistent pandemic and should not be used as a vehicle for a wish list that certain Democrats have.\"\n Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also on the call, agreed.\n \"I think there's bipartisan support for a number of measures, particularly related to vaccine development, distribution, testing, PPE and perhaps PPP,\" he said, adding that he wanted to wait to hear what other senators thought before he would be able to tell if there's support for additional measures.\n Biden said Monday he does not want to \"cherry pick\" his Covid relief bill, instead saying he wants it to pass as one encompassing bill, as opposed to pulling out specific issues.\n \"Time is of the essence, and I must tell you I'm reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here and then have to go through it again because they all go sort of hand in glove,\" he said.\n The President has said he sees about two weeks as the window for bipartisan negotiations over the bill. And there's the question of how much patience Democrats will have for Republicans during the negotiating process.\n \"Quick is relative,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. \"But if we can get the money out to people and businesses and institutions expeditiously, that's the singular goal. This fixation on bipartisanship is just that \u2014 it's a fixation. I love to work on a bipartisan basis. But if they're gonna block coronavirus relief, then we're gonna move without them.\"",

The company declined to elaborate on the specific allegations.\n On Sunday, The Times published an investigation led by media reporter Meg James into the culture at CBS' TV stations. Dunn has managed CBS' 28 TV stations, which together employ 2,800 workers, since 2009, according to the article.\n The Times' investigation included allegations that Dunn disparaged female and Black employees. Friend, who works closely with Dunn, allegedly took part in the conduct and was also accused of verbal abuse, according to The Times' report.\n \"These comments I may have made about our employees or prospective hires were only based on performance or qualifications \u2014 not about anyone's race or gender,\" he said in the statement. Dunn declined to comment to The Times on the allegations.\n CBS has been no stranger to scandal in recent years. CBS chief executive Les Moonves left the company in 2018 amid a number of allegations of sexual misconduct made against him. Moonves admitted to consensual relations with three of the women named in a New Yorker investigation but he insisted that never abused his power and said he can only surmise that the allegations \"are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation and my career.\"\n The Times reported that CBS hired two law firms to look into the sexual misconduct claims, but some staffers had concerns that the investigators fixated on Moonves and didn't pay enough attention to other alleged abuses at the TV stations. CBS told The Times, \"In response to a CBS investigation in early 2019, senior management at the time addressed the situation with Mr. Dunn, and the company has not received any complaints about his conduct during the period since then.\"\n The National Association of Black Journalists met with ViacomCBS executives on Sunday to discuss the allegations.\n \"It is clear that there is a massive problem among CBS owned-and-operated stations, and in order for the company's culture to be transformed, it must begin with the firing of Dunn and Friend,\" NABJ said in a statement.",

        "title": "Biden continues push to put racial equity at the forefront",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Nearly a week into his administration, President Joe Biden is focused on creating a path toward equity after inheriting a deeply divided nation.\n After picking the most racially diverse Cabinet in US history, Biden jump-started his efforts by proposing a sweeping immigration overhaul, disbanding the 1776 commission and reversing a Trump-era ban on most transgender Americans joining the military.\n \"President Biden believes gender identity should not be a bar to military service and that America's strength is found in its diversity,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. \"America is stronger around the world when it is inclusive.\"\n On Tuesday, Biden signed a range of executive orders that could potentially help bridge the gap in homeownership between people of color and White people, strengthen the fight against bigotry faced by Asian Americans and ease the anxiety of families with incarcerated relatives.\n \"I firmly believe the nation is ready to change but government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day, today, tomorrow and every day,\" Biden said during his remarks before signing the orders on Tuesday afternoon.\n While previous administrations have had \"an interest in advancing justice and equity,\" a senior administration official told reporters earlier on Tuesday that \"never before has there been this whole of government approach\" in which every agency has been mandated to advance equity and be held accountable for it.\n The Biden administration intends to promote fair housing in a country where the cost of housing is continuously slipping out of reach for millions of people.\n On Tuesday, Biden signed a memorandum directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take steps to promote equitable housing politics, according to a senior administration official.\n Lisa Rice, president and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance, said every year about 4 million people face discrimination when they are trying to purchase or rent homes, or while getting home loans and insurance for their houses or apartments.\n But discrimination is not centered on those transactions, Rice says. \"There are systems in place that drive and perpetuate discrimination.\"\n \"We hoard resources in predominantly White communities. And then we starve predominantly Black communities of resources. We starve Native American and Latino communities of resources,\" Rice said.\n America's long history of housing and mortgage market discrimination practices such as redlining, the biased housing practice that stopped banks from providing mortgages in low-income, largely minority neighborhoods, has impacted generations of Black and Hispanic households, according to research by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n Researchers found that nearly two-thirds of the Black, Hispanic and Native American populations living in poverty reside in communities with poverty rates above 20% and are underrepresented in higher-income areas.\n Among those who own homes, Black people lag behind White homeowners. In the third quarter of 2020, nearly 76% of White households owned their homes compared with 46.4% of Black households and nearly 51% of Hispanic households, according to US Census data.\n The Covid-19 pandemic has also disproportionately hurt Black and Latino renters and homeowners, advocates and researchers say. When people lost their jobs due to the economic downturn forced by the pandemic, renters couldn't pay their rent and began living on the edge of eviction.\n Last week, Biden signed an executive action to extend the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium that is protecting millions of struggling renters from eviction until at least the end of March. The CDC's order first went into effect in September and was previously extended until January 31.\n Biden's push for housing equity comes after the Trump administration ended the Obama-era rule known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing in 2020. The rule was enacted in 2015 as a way to bolster the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which outlawed restrictions on selling or renting homes to people based on race.\n Since the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, racism and xenophobia against Asian Americans spread across the nation, from violent attacks to racist slurs or jokes.\n Biden is taking a stand against discrimination against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community with an executive order on Tuesday acknowledging the harm and directing the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing Covid-19 guidance to advance language access and sensitivity toward these communities, according to a senior administration official.\n \"It does send a signal to the Asian American community that we have an administration that cares about the community and wants to protect the community,\" said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC, which advocates for the civil and human rights of Asian Americans.\n Yang said rampant ignorance, misinformation and former President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Covid-19 led to anti-Asian sentiment.\n \"Unfortunately the pandemic was really two pandemics for the Asian American community,\" Yang said.\n Trump, some GOP lawmakers and administration officials used terms like \"the Chinese virus\" or \"the Wuhan virus,\" even after the World Health Organization and the CDC provided the official terminology for the virus in February. The WHO has advised not to use geographic locations in naming diseases because it creates a stigma.\n Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC was among the dozens of organizations that sent a letter to Congress in March asking them to take \"tangible steps to counter the hysteria around the novel coronavirus, such as passing a joint resolution denouncing the racism, xenophobia, and misinformation surrounding it.\" The US House of Representatives addressed it by passing a resolution in September.\n In response to the spike in incidents, Yang said his organization along with Hollaback!, an initiative aimed at combating harassment, have trained over 15,000 people in techniques to intervene and de-escalate if they witness an incident.\n Biden will seek to address mass incarceration and one of his first steps will be ending the use of private prisons, according to a senior administration official. The Obama administration moved to phase out the use of private prisons in 2016 but the decision was reversed by the Trump administration.\n According to a 2020 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, about 2.1 million adults were held in America's prisons and jails at the end of 2018. In federal prisons, Black people represent nearly 39% of all detainees, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons though they make up only about 13% of the US population.\n Several states already have passed legislation involving for-profit prisons. In 2019, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill to end the use of those facilities and privately run immigration detention facilities by 2028.\n Jail and prisons have struggled for years with crowded conditions and inadequate resources and they have not been spared by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Some of the country's largest Covid-19 outbreaks have been reported in correctional facilities. The Covid-19 mortality rate in state and federal prisons has been twice as high as in the general population after adjusting for sex, age and the race/ethnicity of those in prisons, according to an analysis by Kevin T. Schnepel, an assistant professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.\n A coalition of civil rights groups are urging Biden to create a White House office dedicated to leading federal efforts in advancing racial equality and confronting systemic racism in the country.\n The NAACP, National Urban League, UnidosUS, Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum; and Faith in Action are some of the organizations that are part of the coalition.\n In a memo sent in December, the coalition proposed the creation of an office that would be responsible for supporting federal agencies in their racial equity work, supporting the collection of racial data, fostering partnerships between federal agencies and civil society and training federal employees on racial equity.\n \"Even before 2020 exposed our pandemic of triple deadly disease and economic hardship and racial unrest, America was a nation that still had only begun to grapple with the legacy of White supremacy,\" said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \"Establishing a White House Office on Racial Equity and Inclusion is our best hope of nurturing that awakening and achieving our true potential.\"\n Members of the coalition met with Biden's transition team on January 12 to discuss their vision for the office and conversations with the administration are ongoing, said Elana Needle, director of the Racial Equity Anchor Collaborative.\n CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Homeland Security secretary nomination advances as top Democrat rejects GOP request for delay",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN)Alejandro Mayorkas' nomination to be Homeland Security secretary moved forward Tuesday after a Senate panel vote as a top Democrat rejected Republican calls for another hearing that would delay his confirmation.\n President Joe Biden's nominee was voted out of the Senate Homeland Security Committee with all Democrats voting yes, paving the way for Mayorkas to helm the third-largest federal department. GOP Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Rob Portman of Ohio also voted yes.\n Meanwhile, Republicans also want a hearing for Mayorkas before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in addition to his hearing before the Homeland Security Committee that was held last week.\n Several GOP senators, led by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, called for the additional hearing, citing Mayorkas' role overseeing many of the Biden administration's immigration policies, the lawmakers said in a letter released Tuesday\n But Sen. Dick Durbin, who will now chair the Judiciary Committee, threw cold water on the GOP demand.\n \"I don't see why that's necessary,\" Durbin said told CNN's Manu Raju. Durban called the demand \"an indication of mindless partisanship that at a security agency like this one if a man with his background is being held, it's totally political as far as I'm concerned.\"\n \"This is indefensible. We are withholding the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security,\" Durbin added.\n The department has been without a Senate-confirmed leader since Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted in early 2019. DHS, which was saddled with leadership turmoil for most of the Trump presidency, faces national security concerns, a pandemic and an incoming president prepared to roll out ambitious immigration plans.\n Last Tuesday, the Homeland Security Committee held an extensive hearing into Mayorkas' qualifications to lead the department. During the hearing, Mayorkas reiterated Biden's commitment to stop further construction of the wall on the southern border of the US and said the dismantling of existing immigration policies created under Trump will take time. He told lawmakers that he does not recommend defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n Mayorkas also called the threat of domestic extremism \"is one of the greatest challenges the Department of Homeland Security confronts, and it has unique capabilities in confronting that challenge.\"\n However, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, moved to block Mayorkas' quick consideration after the hearing due to his border answer, delaying confirmation.\n Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, the outgoing Homeland Security Committee chairman, also objected to the confirmation of Mayorkas, citing a controversial inspector general report.\n \"He violated his own guidelines when he provided preferential intervention for these politically connected individuals for EB-5 visas,\" Johnson said last week.\n During the Obama administration, the inspector general investigated allegations of improper influence in the EB-5 investor visa process while Mayorkas served as director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The inspector general was unable to determine Mayorkas' motives for his actions and found each of the decisions was \"legitimately within his purview.\"\n Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has urged senators to quickly confirm Mayorkas, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and domestic terrorism, among other concerns, according to a letter obtained by CNN.\n \"DHS is facing several immediate homeland and national security concerns that require confirmed leadership immediately,\" McAleenan wrote in a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Manu Raju, Clare Foran, Ali Zaslav and Lauren Fox contributed to this story.",

        "title": "The GameStop saga is captivating Wall Street \u2014 for good reason",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\n London (CNN Business)The meteoric rise in GameStop's stock, as traders congregating on Reddit and Discord take on short sellers and hedge funds, is hard to look away from. It's the closest thing Wall Street has to David vs. Goliath.\n What's happening: Shares of GameStop (GME), a legacy company whose stores are often located in struggling malls, have soared dramatically over the past two sessions as day traders push the stock with growing fervor. The stock, which closed out 2020 at $18.84 per share, finished the day at $76.79 after trading was halted multiple times due to volatility. At one point, it climbed to nearly $160, a record high.\n You read that correctly. GameStop, which is expected to lose money this year and next, has more than quadrupled in value in under a month because it's effectively become a meme stock. Since the beginning of 2020, it's jumped more than 1,100%, outpacing even Tesla's gains. Shares are up another 20% in premarket trading.\n Investors on social media had been arguing that GameStop was seriously undervalued and cheered earlier this month when the company added Chewy founder Ryan Cohen, who has been pushing a digital overhaul, to its board. Now, the focus is on momentum, as small investors hope the hype can help the stock keep rising.\n It's evident, however, that the saga has grown into much more than an argument over the future of a video game retailer, or the merits of different trading approaches. As no-fee apps like Robinhood democratize access to financial markets, some are reading it as a generational fight between the old and new guard of the investing world.\n Users on Reddit cheered when veteran short seller Citron Research said it would stop commenting on the stock, citing harassment from GameStop's backers. Melvin Capital Management, which bet against GameStop's rise, has had to accept an infusion of cash after suffering steep losses, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n \"As someone who started trading stocks in the late '90s in college, I would always remember watching when the small retail trading groups would get crushed by hedge funds and savvy short-sellers,\" Oanda analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients this week. \"What happened with GameStop's stock is a reminder of how times are changing.\"\n David certainly now has Goliath's attention.\n \"Starts opening r/WSB with my usual morning tabs,\" market strategist Michael Antonelli of R.W. Baird tweeted Monday, referring to the Reddit message board where much of the GameStop action has been coordinated.\n Traders on such platforms have been plugging other stocks with major results, too. BlackBerry shares, another fan favorite, are up more than 170% in 2021. They jumped 28% on Monday alone.\n Big picture: The wisdom of such trading decisions is certainly debatable. After all, it's near impossible to argue that GameStop's value has actually increased exponentially in a matter of weeks. Some gains are also attributable to a so-called \"short squeeze,\" as those who bet against the stock rush to buy in so they can cover some of their losses.\n But once the GameStop dust settles, expect Wall Street's asset managers to watch where the retail trading hive mind wanders next. Clearly, it can have an impact.\n Lawmakers confirmed Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary on Monday, making her the first woman in American history to hold the position.\n Now, she's tasked with shepherding President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package through Congress. And with former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial set to begin in the Senate in just two weeks, there's pressure to act fast.\n That could be a problem, given opposition to parts of the package from Democrats and Republicans.\n The latest: Members of both parties expressed reservations about spending so much money on a Sunday call with Brian Deese, head of the National Economic Council, multiple aides told my CNN colleagues.\n \"It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope,\" Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said in a statement.\n While lawmakers acknowledge more money for testing and vaccines is essential, billions in state and local funding, $1,400 stimulus checks and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour are proving more controversial.\n Conversations in the coming days will test Biden's commitment to promoting bipartisanship.\n Biden and Yellen are angling to get members of both parties on board. But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Sunday that Democrats would use a procedural tactic to pass major parts of the measure if Republicans don't budge. Biden didn't rule the method out on Monday.\n Investor insight: With Democrats in control of both houses of Congress and the White House, investors have been banking on the swift passage of additional stimulus measures. As the battle lines are drawn, some are getting nervous.\n Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's remarks that a bill could take four to six weeks to pass were a wake-up call.\n \"[This] seemed to remind markets of the underlying risks to a market trading at the highs,\" he said in a note to clients Tuesday.\n Delays over delivering vaccines from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) in Europe are a harsh reminder that successful vaccination campaigns remain dependent on output from the private sector.\n The latest: AstraZeneca has informed EU leaders that it will not be able to deliver as many doses of its vaccine as promised, putting government rollout plans at risk. The news comes after Pfizer delivered fewer doses of its vaccine than expected last week.\n Government leaders in Europe are furious, claiming the holdups will have serious consequences.\n \"The European Union wants the ordered and pre-financed doses to be delivered as soon as possible,\" EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a statement. \"And we want our contract to be fully fulfilled.\"\n Big picture: The full consequences of the delays will become apparent in the coming weeks. Pfizer said it will resume deliveries as scheduled this week after upgrading its plant in Belgium so it can churn out more doses; problems at AstraZeneca, which pointed to lower-than-expected yield at a European site, are believed to be more severe.\n The situation highlights how fragile vaccine supply chains are as they get up to speed, and underscores the risks to estimates from economists and investors about when life will return to normal.\n \"We will have more of these ups and downs until we get to a stable process,\" Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, told me.\n 3M (MMM), Alaska Air (ALK), American Express (AXP), GE (GE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Lockheed Martin (LMT), UBS, Verizon (VZ) and Xerox (XRX) report earnings before US markets open. Capital One, Microsoft (MSFT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Texas Instruments (TXN) follow after the close.\n Also today: US consumer confidence data for January posts at 10 a.m. ET.\n Coming tomorrow: A massive earnings week continues with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA).",

        "body_text": "Dr. Irene Butter is a Holocaust survivor. She came to the United States in 1945. Since the late 1980s, Dr. Butter has been teaching students about the Holocaust. Her memoir, \"Shores Beyond Shores,\" details that journey. She is a co-founder of the Raoul Wallenberg Medal and Lecture series at the University of Michigan, and one of the founders of Zeitouna, an Arab-Jewish women's dialogue group in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n (CNN)I am a survivor of the Holocaust and a proud American. I first landed on the shores of this country in Baltimore Harbor on December 25, 1945, under a brittle blue, clear sky. My lifeboat was lowered from a Liberty ship into the watery space between ice floes and I stepped onto the land that welcomed me.\n I was a 15-year-old refugee with a sixth-grade education, broken English, no money and a small knapsack of belongings. America allowed me to receive an education, build a career, a family, and a new life -- away from the Nazis.\n Just as America was there for me and people like me, we must now be there for America. Ours is the land of opportunity. We must now rebuild and protect it against the current fascism that threatens it.\n I was born in Berlin in 1930, a Jewish girl who grew up in Nazi-occupied Europe. My childhood was quite idyllic: I had loving, funny parents and grandparents, and a beautiful, music-filled home. I was three years old when the Nazis came to power and began targeting the Jews, step by step.\n Early on, Jews were forbidden from owning or working in banks under Nazi race laws, and my father lost his job. He left for Holland in search of one, as well as to escape Hitler. My family -- me, my mom and older brother -- were able to follow not long after. We settled in Amsterdam.\n In 1940, the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands and the persecution of Jews escalated. We were eventually deported in cattle cars to Camp Westerbork in eastern Holland, and ultimately to the infamous Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp in Germany.\n Having barely survived hunger, forced labor, beatings, disease and cold at Bergen-Belsen, my family was included in a prisoner exchange. We were among the limited number of Jews to be traded for German civilians and boarded a train bound for Switzerland.\n On January 23, 1945, my father died on the train from malnutrition and a brutal beating by the Nazis. He had gotten his family to freedom. My mother and brother were so ill that they were hospitalized immediately upon arrival in Switzerland. However, the Swiss would not let me stay with my family. So, at age 14, I was separated from them for the first time in my life and sent to a refugee camp in Algeria, North Africa.\n A year later, I landed in America, and eventually was reunited with my brother and mother. Up until that moment on Baltimore's shores, my journey had been by command and not by choice. My parents hadn't chosen to move to Amsterdam -- they were forced to. We didn't choose to be sent to the concentration camps -- we were forced to. I didn't choose to live in Algeria alone as a refugee -- I was forced to.\n But finally, in America, I had choices and could exercise my free will. There were no restrictions. No yellow stars on clothing. No men with guns stopping people to see papers. Only opportunity.\n Now, 75 years later, I see something I never imagined: echoes of the Nazis and their regime. What happened in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, was an attempted coup of our government and an unraveling of the democracy that protects all of our rights. I saw a T-shirt with the words \"Camp Auschwitz,\" as well as other anti-Semitic symbols and slogans used by the rioters.\n Decades earlier, I heard an interview on the radio with Auschwitz survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who said, \"If you were in the camps, if you smelled the air and heard the silence of the dead, then it's your duty to be a witness and tell the stories.\" It took me 40 years to start talking, and I am not finished yet.\n The disinformation, distortion and denial of human rights and democracy that resulted in the Holocaust must not happen again. We must speak truth to fascism. The United Nations and UNESCO were founded in 1945, the same year as my liberation, in the wake of the Holocaust. Today, the UN and UNESCO educate the contemporary world about this history and how to recognize threats to democracy when they occur. Their work helps to establish an accurate historical record and encourages witnesses and others to speak out and teach truth.\n The massive, violent assault on our Capitol is an awakening for us that our American democracy is vulnerable and needs protection. Democratic institutions need to be strengthened and government officials held responsible and accountable.\n Four years ago, we could not have guessed that rioters with Nazi symbols would break into the Capitol to subvert a fairly elected president. None of us can afford to be a bystander to history. We all must confront racism and hatred when we see it. We must establish a record, encourage witnesses and others to speak out, and teach truth. Each of us can and must make a difference.\n To me, education is the quintessential endeavor to combat the threat of fascism. The crisis in our country today brings opportunities for positive change. Each of us has the opportunity to make a choice:\n to be a survivor defined by the life we make for ourselves, and not a victim defined only by the harm done to us;to refuse to be enemies, seeking our common humanity;to never be a bystander to injustice, standing up for others even if we do not know them;to fill the world with love and hope, not hate and division.\n As I share my history through my book, and in schools across the country, I am overcome with gratitude and amazement at students' wisdom and curiosity. Young people are hungry to learn how to stand up against hatred, bullying, oppression and discrimination. They are wise, strong and ready.\n Let's stand with these students and continue to educate and involve them -- and allow them to educate us. They will one day be the leaders of this democracy. Let's build a better America and a better world, together.",

        "title": "Biden announces purchase of 200M vaccine doses",
        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden announced a series of measures on Tuesday aimed at ramping up coronavirus vaccine allocation and distribution, including the purchase of 200 million more vaccine doses and  increased distribution to states by millions of doses next week.\n With those additional doses, Biden said there would be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans -- nearly the entire US population -- by the end of summer or early fall.\n He described efforts to combat Covid-19 as a \"wartime undertaking.\"\n \"We now have a national strategy to beat Covid-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it is detailed,\" he said.\n As part of the new efforts announced Tuesday, the US will buy 100 million more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million more from Moderna -- the two-dose vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer and Moderna are working to step up production, and Biden said that the additional doses will be available this summer.\n The new purchase will increase the planned Covid-19 vaccine supply from 400 million to 600 million, an official told reporters on a call on Tuesday ahead of Biden's remarks.\n The President also took action on Tuesday to increase the weekly vaccine supply to states, tribes and territories -- upping the current 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses weekly. Additionally, the White House will be providing three week vaccine supply look-ahead reports to states as opposed to one week look-aheads.\n Biden's Covid coordinator, Jeff Zients, informed governors on a call Tuesday afternoon that Covid vaccine allocations for states would increase by around 16% starting next week.\n A White House document explaining the move says the Biden administration is committing to maintaining this as the minimum supply level for the next three weeks.\n The new efforts come one day after the President said he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, which is a notable increase from the administration's previously stated target of 1 million per day. The President said that the US could surpass that initial target in about three weeks, and said that he thinks anyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get it by this spring.\n Biden's official goal on administering vaccines still remains 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, multiple White House officials told CNN, after Biden raised the new 1.5 million doses a day aspiration. That initial goal is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses.\n There have been about 22.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered to Americans as of Tuesday afternoon, according to data provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n About 3.3 million Americans have received two doses of a vaccine as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the CDC.\n The President said Monday that the key factors involved in ramping up vaccinations are having enough of the vaccine, syringes and other necessary equipment and people administering them.\n The vaccine supply and the question of whether there will be enough doses to go around has been a key concern for the Biden administration, CNN has reported.\n Biden signed an executive order on his first full day in office to ramp up supplies for vaccinations. The order was part of a series of actions Biden took that day to address the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to devastate the nation and has claimed the lives of more than 421,800 Americans as of Tuesday afternoon.\n The Biden administration believes it did not inherit a working federal coronavirus vaccine distribution plan from the Trump administration.\n \"The sad part is the last administration didn't leave anything, didn't leave a plan,\" Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond said on CNN over the weekend.\n Before taking office, Biden was openly critical of what he described as a \"dismal\" rollout of the Covid vaccines under President Donald Trump.\n CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Europe threatens to restrict vaccine exports after AstraZeneca and Pfizer hit production problems",
        "body_text": "London (CNN Business)The European Union is calling out vaccine makers AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) over delivery delays that could slow its recovery from the pandemic. Officials are even threatening to restrict exports and take legal action as anger mounts.\n AstraZeneca will not be able to deliver as many doses of its vaccine as promised, according to EU officials, putting government rollout plans and the economic recovery at risk. The news comes after Pfizer said it had delivered fewer doses of its vaccine than expected last week.\n EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides on Monday expressed dissatisfaction on talks with AstraZeneca and said conversations would continue. She said the drugmaker \"intends to supply considerably fewer doses in the coming weeks than agreed and announced.\"\n European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen turned up the heat on the pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday, saying the bloc \"means business.\"\n \"Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines, to create a truly global common good. And now the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations,\" she said during a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.\n EU countries counting on the vaccines to rein in the health crisis and jumpstart their economies are now being forced to modify their plans. Italian Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri told TV channel Rai 1 on Sunday that people over 80 years old would be vaccinated four weeks later than planned as a result of the delays. The country is threatening legal action against the drugmakers.\n \"By the [fall] we could vaccinate up to 45 million Italians, but I don't believe in these companies,\" Sileri said. \"I want to see the vaccines.\"\n The European Union has ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which could be approved for use as soon as this week, with an option to purchase an additional 100 million.\n The company said that production has been hampered by a manufacturing issue.\n \"While there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,\" AstraZeneca said in a statement. \"We will be supplying tens of millions of doses in February and March to the European Union, as we continue to ramp up production volumes.\"\n The news has sent the bloc reeling, just as it was racing to assess the impact of delays announced by Pfizer. The US company said on Jan. 15 that it would deliver fewer doses than planned last week while it upgraded its manufacturing facility in Puurs, Belgium.\n The drugmaker said it would still be able to meet first quarter targets, and as a result of the changes to its Belgium plant would be able to churn out 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. That's up from the 1.3 billion it had originally estimated.\n Pfizer said Monday it would return to its original schedule of deliveries for the European Union this week.\n European governments are demanding answers, pointing out that the success of their vaccination efforts is dependent on the private sector.\n \"On the one hand we can only welcome the result of science, and on the other hand they have a monopoly and we are totally dependent,\" Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said on Saturday. \"There may be production issues, but these uncertainties and announcements make it very difficult to organize the campaign.\"\n Kyriakides said on Monday that the bloc would now demand \"full transparency concerning the export of vaccines\" from the European Union.\n \"In the future, all companies producing vaccines against Covid-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. Humanitarian deliveries are of course not affected by this,\" she said on Twitter.\n German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the controls were not about putting the \"EU first\" but about making sure Europe got its fair share.\n \"In my view it makes sense that we have an export limit, meaning that vaccines which leave the European Union have a license so that we know what is being produced, what is leaving Europe, where it is leaving so that there is a fair distribution,\" he told German broadcaster ZDF.\n Supply chain experts are much more concerned by the news from AstraZeneca than Pfizer, given the latter company's commitment to increase output soon. AstraZeneca's vaccine, developed with Oxford University, is also much easier to distribute because it can be stored at higher temperatures than the Pfizer alternative.\n A delay for a week or two \"is not a big problem,\" said Burak Kazaz, a professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. \"[Though] I certainly understand that a delay means lives.\"\n The scope of the problems facing AstraZeneca, which appear more serious, would become clear in the coming weeks, he said.\n Delays from both firms are a sign that there are still kinks in the supply chain that need to be ironed out as distribution ramps up, according to Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.\n \"We will have more of these ups and downs until we get to a stable process,\" Yadav said.\n Given the rocky attempts to get up to speed \u2014 and concentration of production at just a few manufacturing sites \u2014 the public should expect monthly manufacturing capacity to fluctuate for the time being, he added.\n Richard Wilding, a professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield University in England, noted that there are at least 50 items necessary to run vaccination sites, from alcohol wipes and syringes to personal protective equipment. Supply chains for those items need to run smoothly, too.\n Crucially, the delays aren't just a problem for Europe.\n \"The price will be paid by developing countries who don't have access yet, because their deliveries may be delayed further down the line,\" Yadav said.\n \u2014 James Frater, Chris Liakos, Amanda Sealy and Stephanie Halasz contributed reporting.",

        "body_text": "Washington (CNN)The US government is urging Americans not to travel abroad after new restrictions went into effect Tuesday requiring all passengers traveling by air to present negative Covid-19 tests taken within three calendar days of departure or proof of recovery from the virus within the last 90 days.\n \"Seriously reconsider going overseas right now,\" acting Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters on a call Tuesday. \"US citizens who choose to go abroad, whether it's for a holiday or a genuine emergency, everyone needs to be prepared to be potentially seriously disrupted in their trips.\"\n \"If you cannot easily access a Covid-19 test, or if you test positive, you will end up overseas for much longer than you planned,\" Brownlee added. \"If that happens, you will be responsible for covering your own lodging and medical costs during that time.\"\n The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions' director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Marty Cetron, said on the same call that the \"bottom-line message is this is really not a time for people to be engaging in discretionary travel, and that all travel should be postponed until we get a better handle on getting this virus under control, and accelerating our vaccination strategies.\"\n Despite the warnings, Brownlee said the State Department is not considering issuing a global Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory and will continue to issue advisories on a country by country basis. The department issued the worldwide warning against international travel last March and lifted it in August, but it said at the time that it continued \"to recommend U.S. citizens exercise caution when traveling abroad due to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic.\"\n Brownlee said Tuesday that the State Department is \"committed to helping US citizens overseas who find themselves in dire situations, but that assistance is likely to be limited.\"\n \"Our goal is to help people avoid those dire straits in the first place,\" he said. US embassies will be able to provide information about where to get medical care and Covid tests, Brownlee said, but will not provide those tests.\n The new testing requirement went into effect shortly after President Joe Biden's reinstatement of Covid-19 travel restrictions on non-US citizens who have been in Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom and much of Europe. It comes as new Covid variants have been detected in countries around the world. The CDC's Cetron noted that the US government is watching the variants \"very closely\"\n \"As these variants increase, the risks of international travel really are highlighted by the urgency that President Biden and this administration have taken to combat the virus and use all measures that we have at our disposal here,\" he said. \"As a consequence we reposted the original order that CDC issued on January 10, January 12, that came into effect today.\"\n \"Most importantly, the waiver that was initially contemplated to extend the deadline of implementation by a couple of weeks has been removed from this order, although we've specifically added a particular humanitarian emergency exemption to take into account,\" Cetron added.\n He said the decision to remove the waiver had been made because \"it was determined that we needed to bring this testing strategy into implementation rapidly today and not allow for an additional two weeks.\"\n \"Additionally, when we looked at the surges of this virus that have happened, in particular in the months before Thanksgiving and through the holiday season -- Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's -- we were just seeing surge upon surge in the virus at a time when more of the variants were proving themselves increasingly contagious,\" he said. \"And it was a combination of all these factors which led to the urgency of removing the two-week additional extension for implementation, and to move this into effect immediately at 12:01, midnight.\"\n Cetron told reporters they \"are holding daily morning operation calls with the airlines to ... get feedback on the early rollout and implementation.\" He said any issues that have come up overnight were \"anticipated\" and they \"have various hotlines that are available in order to adjudicate things that may come up in the middle of the night.\"\n Both officials suggested conversations were ongoing about possible restrictions for travel over land borders.",

The chain used its own special \"vine-ripened tomato sauce\" because it found that it keeps the thick crust light and airy.\n The new offering comes in four options, including the \"Detroit Double Pepperoni\" which Pizza Hut describes as a \"work of pizza art\" because it includes 80 pepperoni slices. The other options are the \"Double Cheesy,\" \"Meaty Deluxe\" and the \"Supremo,\" which has Italian sausage, red onions and green bell peppers. Prices start at $10.99.\n Competition among big chains has been fierce during the pandemic, which has fueled a surge in pizza demand from Americans who are spending more time at home and avoiding dine-in restaurants. Sales and revenue rose last year at Pizza Hut, Domino's (DMPZF) and Papa John's (PZZA) as consumers relentlessly shoveled pizzas down their throats.\n Peter Saleh, a restaurant analyst with research firm BTIG, expects last year's rising sales to continue this year. \"What we saw in 2020 was that many of these pizza delivery guys had a big boom in their sales because there was no where else to go,\" he told CNN Business. Several US states limit in-restaurant dining and have enacted capacity controls because of the virus.\n Saleh predicts that pizza sales will remain healthy in 2021 as the \"environment for dining continues to be challenged.\"",

The orphanage told the abductors it does not have the money and is asking for people to pray for the safe return of the children.\n \"They told me they knew that the kids were orphans,\" he said. \"I feel so sad that because these are just little innocent kids; the oldest among them is just 16 years old and most of the others are between the ages of 5 and 6,'' said Odewu.\n The culprits have not yet been identified, but the police are on their trail, he said, adding that kidnappings like this one are \"not new in the community.\"\n Hundreds of students were abducted in December by gunmen in Katsina State in northwestern Nigeria. They were missing for nearly a week before the Nigerian military rescued them from bandits masquerading as the Islamist terrorist group, Boko Haram.\n While kidnapping for ransom by criminal elements in Katsina State have seen a disturbing increase, an abduction on this scale has not been reported previously. It recalls the kidnapping of 276 girls from Chibok in 2014. More than 100 of those girls never returned home.",

        "title": "Democrats weigh whether they need witnesses to make a visceral case against Trump at impeachment trial",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Facing highly skeptical Republican senators, House impeachment managers are preparing a case to show the visceral evidence of the Capitol insurrection and how former President Donald Trump's words and actions motivated the rioters to breach the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.\n The Senate's 55 to 45 procedural vote Tuesday is not deterring the House from making what they see is a clear case against Trump for his role inciting the insurrectionists. There are still key questions for them to decide before next month's trial: They haven't made a final decision, for instance, on whether they will call witnesses. They're preparing for the possibility they won't have any witnesses -- but they may decide to use them if they find a witness willing to voluntarily step forward, according to sources.\n Even without witnesses, Democrats are considering using evidence from video and social media to help illustrate how Trump's words, actions and tweets motivated the rioters to attack the Capitol, the sources say.\n The House managers are also preparing to make the constitutional argument -- they're led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a former constitutional law professor -- that the Senate can convict a former President, just as it's held trials for other former officials in the past. It's a case that's taken on newfound importance in the wake of the Senate's vote Tuesday that Sen. Rand Paul forced as part of his argument that most of the Republicans think the trial is unconstitutional -- and there simply aren't 17 Republican votes needed for conviction.\n But Senate Democrats say that the case the House managers make can still sway some Republicans, particularly if they can use witnesses who would help corroborate Trump's mindset and actions leading up to the January 6 Capitol riots.\n \"I think that the core of this case is Trump's incendiary and inciting words, the words out of his own mouth,\" Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told reporters. \"But his intent to do harm, to cause injury and maybe even death may come from witnesses who were with him when he was watching the assault on the Capitol. So witnesses can corroborate and powerfully document what we know but they need to prove.\"\n One complicating factor for the House impeachment team is whether potential witnesses would be willing to be called -- particularly those who were in the White House. The House impeachment managers want to avoid any kind of court fight over witnesses like the House had to deal with during the first impeachment of Trump.\n Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Tuesday it was an open question whether executive privilege would still apply to former White House officials after Trump left office who could be called as potential witnesses. King argued that such testimony could shine light on the President's thinking during the time of the trial.\n \"It will be either witnesses or documents, and what was given in the way of intelligence,\" King said.\n The opening day of Trump's second impeachment trial showed just how high the bar is for House Democrats to get anywhere close to the votes needed for conviction, with just five Republicans voting with Democrats to defeat Paul's procedural motion.\n While not every Republican who voted with Paul said the trial was unconstitutional outright, the 55 to 45 vote was as clear a sign as any that the path to the 67 votes needed to convict Trump and bar him from running again was all but impossible. Paul claimed after the vote it showed the trial was already over before it started.\n Even one of the Republicans who voted with Democrats and is opened to convicting Trump said the writing was on the wall.\n \"Do the math. I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that the President will be convicted,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of the five Republicans to break with Paul.\n Following Tuesday's procedural vote to defeat Paul's point of order that the trial was unconstitutional, the Senate adjourned the impeachment trial until February 9, when arguments will begin.\n Senate Republicans have coalesced in recent days around the argument that the trial is not constitutional, giving them a way to push back on House Democrats' impeachment without condoning Trump's conduct when rioters attacked the Capitol on January 6, breaching the very chamber where the impeachment trial will be held.\n \"I think it showed that impeachment is dead on arrival,\" Paul said of the vote he forced Tuesday. \"If you voted it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?\"\n Democrats argued that Republicans were skirting their responsibility to hold Trump accountable for his behavior by claim the trial was unconstitutional. \"They don't want to be held accountable on that vote so they're going to try to make it another argument that is all about the Constitution,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.\n There were signs ahead of Tuesday's vote that most Senate Republicans would stay united. At their party lunch Tuesday, Senate GOP leaders hosted Jonathan Turley, one of the leading conservative law scholars arguing that the trial is unconstitutional.\n While Turley has argued against holding an impeachment trial for a former president, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote this month that \"most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.\"\n Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has said Trump committed impeachable offenses and voted against Paul on Tuesday, expressed frustration with the vote that occurred before the trial even started -- and with less than a day's notice.\n \"I think it was a little unfortunate that we had this very spontaneous vote on an extraordinarily significant matter without the considered debate and analysis. People had to make really quick decisions,\" Murkowski told reporters Tuesday. \"I'm not saying there's bad faith, but I do think this is significant enough that it deserved greater consideration by this body and I think what you've seen now is people have been forced to take a quick position. Whether or not that changes as we move forward I think remains to be seen.\"\n Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, downplayed the significance of Tuesday's vote, saying that he saw it as only a procedural motion and not a statement of whether the trial was constitutional or not.\n \"I want to hear it debated,\" Portman said. \"I do have questions about the constitutionality, and as a practical matter the precedent, but I want to hear it briefed, and we will hear it.\"\n But Senate GOP leaders remained united with Paul. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has expressed an openness to hearing the impeachment arguments, voted with Paul on Tuesday, in a sign he has questions about the constitutionality of the process. Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership who is up for reelection in 2022, said following the vote he believes the trial is unconstitutional.\n \"I believe the constitutional purpose of impeachment is to remove a president from office, not to punish a person after they have left office,\" Blunt said in a statement. \"No consideration was given to impeach President Nixon when he left office in 1974. The Constitution hasn't changed and the Congress should not set a new, destructive precedent.\"\n Several GOP senators have cited the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding over the trial -- with Senate president pro tempore Pat Leahy of Vermont presiding instead -- as the clearest sign that the trial doesn't pass constitutional muster.\n \"That would send a pretty clear signal to me what Roberts thinks of the whole thing,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.",

The Biden administration should reunite the separated families in the United States and provide them citizenship, resources, care, and a commitment that family separation will never happen again.\"\n President Joe Biden has pledged to undo Trump's policies and on Friday is expected to announce a task force that will focus on reuniting separated families.\n In a statement to CNN, a Justice Department spokeswoman called the \"zero tolerance\" policy \"inconsistent with the Department's longstanding principle that we exercise judgment and make individualized assessments in criminal cases.\"\n \"Today's action restores to prosecutors their traditional discretion to make charging decisions based on a careful review of the particular facts and circumstances of individual immigration cases,\" the spokeswoman said.\n The policy had long-term ramifications for the thousands of families it affected.\n Since the policy ended, a series of government watchdog reports have detailed the disarray within agencies when the policy was implemented, the lack of planning, and trauma it inflicted on the children separated from their parents.\n Earlier this month, the Justice Department's inspector general revealed that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions knew early on migrant families would be separated when the Trump administration implemented the policy and proceeded with it anyway.\n READ: Justice Department IG report on family separations\n \"[T]he Department's single-minded focus on increasing prosecutions came at the expense of careful and appropriate consideration of the impact that prosecution of family unit adults and family separations would have on children traveling with them and the government's ability to later reunite the children with their parents,\" the IG report stated.\n This story has been updated with additional details of the zero tolerance policy.",

That means Beyond Meat will be able to enter more categories and bring new products to market more quickly, according to a Beyond Meat spokesperson. The US joint venture may include a future expansion into China  and the United Kingdom, the spokesperson added. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.\n The news prompted a surge in Beyond Meat (BYND) stock. Shares closed up about 18% Tuesday.\n Pepsi's marketing prowess could also get more people to try Beyond Meat's product.\n \"Historically, [Beyond's] marketing spend has been nominal (primarily social media),\" UBS research analyst Erika Jackson wrote in a note on Tuesday. Pepsi could help push that marketing to a new level, and bring more customers into the fold.\n For PepsiCo (PEP), the partnership is a way to get a piece of the plant-based protein pie.\n \"Consumer demand for plant-based products is large enough to make an impact in sales, as the plant-based alternative industry continues to grow,\" said Ramsey Baghdadi, consumer analyst at data and analytics company GlobalData, in a statement Tuesday. \"PepsiCo's decision to widen its existing selection of plant-based snacks will be a game changer in the long-term, as more consumers naturally gravitate towards the trend.\"\n Other consumer packaged goods companies have entered the market with acquisitions and new lines. Nestl\u00e9 (NSRGY) sells plant-based meat through Sweet Earth, a vegetarian food company it acquired in 2017.

        "title": "These 7 Earth-size exoplanets named after beer may be incredibly similar",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Just 40 light-years from Earth is a planetary system that has intrigued scientists since its discovery in 2016.\n While some of the planets in this system will be observed by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in October, researchers continue to uncover new details that make TRAPPIST-1 even more distinct.\n The planets, which are too small and faint to be seen by any current ground or space-based telescopes, have such similar densities that they may have equally similar compositions, new research has suggested.\n Given that these planets are about 8% less dense than Earth, researchers have taken a stab at trying to understand how much iron, oxygen, magnesium and silicon these planets contain.\n The study published last week in The Planetary Science Journal.\n The TRAPPIST-1 system includes seven planets, all rocky and similar in size to Earth -- and the most planets like this found orbiting one star. In contrast, the planets in our solar system vary both in size and composition, including smaller rocky planets like Venus, Mercury and Earth and giant gaseous ones such as Jupiter and Saturn.\n The TRAPPIST-1 system is a reminder that no two planetary systems are alike.\n Astronomers announced in February 2017 their discovery of the seven Earth-size planets orbiting a star 40 light-years from Earth. Initially, the researchers only identified three planets around the star in 2016, but they used multiple telescopes and discovered the other four planets using the transit method -- measuring dips in starlight as planets passed in front of the star.\n The seven exoplanets were all found in tight formation around an ultracool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1, and the planets bear the TRAPPIST name -- which the researchers borrowed from their favorite beer.\n These planets are so close to their star that they would all fit within the orbit of Mercury around the sun, which is the closest planet in our solar system to our host star. This proximity means that if you were to stand on the surface of one of these planets, the other planets in the system would appear like large moons in the sky.\n Astronomers were able to obtain precise measurements of the masses and diameters of the TRAPPIST planets using the transit method, which also enabled them to determine the planets' densities.\n Their densities are so close that there is no more than a 3% difference between them, the researchers concluded.\n Even though these exoplanets are only 8% different in density from Earth and Venus, this difference suggests that the TRAPPIST planets are made differently. The researchers determined that they could be similar to Earth in every element with the exception that the composition of the seven planets could be 21% iron while Earth is 32% iron.\n The iron in the TRAPPIST planets could contain more oxygen, which would actually form iron oxide -- otherwise known as rust.\n In our solar system, Mars gets its telltale red hue from iron oxide on the surface. Despite this, Mars has an iron planetary core, much like the other rocky planets in our solar system of Venus, Mercury and Earth.\n If the TRAPPIST planets contain more of this oxidized iron, they would not include solid iron cores, which could account for the density difference.\n Researchers believe that a combination of lower iron content, as well as some iron oxide, accounts for the difference between the TRAPPIST planets and Earth.\n The TRAPPIST system has intrigued scientists for many reasons, and this suggestion about their composition is one of the latest findings.\n Astronomers previously have suggested that some of the planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star are in the star's habitable zone, meaning some of the middle planets could be at the right surface temperature to support liquid water, and perhaps life, on their surfaces.\n The closest planets would be too hot and the furthest planet from the star may be covered in ice.\n Astronomers have estimated that TRAPPIST-1 is between 5.4 billion and 9.8 billion years old, meaning it could be nearly twice as old as our own solar system, which formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n When some of the TRAPPIST planets are observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the future, astronomers could learn if these planets have atmospheres and if so, what those atmospheres contain.\n \"The night sky is full of planets, and it's only been within the last 30 years that we've been able to start unraveling their mysteries,\" said study coauthor Caroline Dorn, an astrophysicist at the University of Zurich, in a statement.\n \"The TRAPPIST-1 system is fascinating because around this one star we can learn about the diversity of rocky planets within a single system. And we can actually learn more about a planet by studying its neighbors as well, so this system is perfect for that.\"",

After she became the first Black and South Asian woman nominated to a major party's presidential ticket this summer, Harris said, \"I know she's looking down on me from above.\"\n Turning to NIH employees Tuesday as she reflected on her mother's passion for science, Harris added: \"The importance of NIH is that this is about an essential function of government, which is to provide for the public health.\"\n \"The work that happens here has one goal: to improve public health. And the importance of the pursuit of the work that happens at NIH is it's not about profit. It's about the people. And so I want to say to everyone who works here, I know who you are. I know what you do,\" she continued.\n \"I know that you work around the clock with those experiments that have to be checked on every few hours, and they don't care about what time it is on the clock. I know the work you do and the collaboration that is required.\"\n Harris had also received her first vaccine dose on camera last month. She reiterated Tuesday that the shot is \"really pretty painless\" and urged everyone \"to take the vaccine when it is your turn.\"\n \"It will save your life. So thanks to all who are doing this great and important work. Let's make sure everyone gets the vaccine. On behalf of President Biden and myself, I thank you for everything you do every day.\"",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business)Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person on the planet, but he's apparently still happy to shop on handmade craft site Etsy. And in a sign of just how much influence Musk has on social media, shares of Etsy (ETSY) soared nearly 10% in premarket trading Tuesday just because he said he's a fan.\n \"I kinda love Etsy,\" Musk tweeted, adding in a follow up tweet that he bought a wool Marvin the Martian helmet (the alien from the Bugs Bunny cartoons) for his dog -- fitting as Musk, of course, wants to one day go to Mars with his other company, SpaceX.\n The stock pulled back later in the day though. It opened 8% higher but was down 2% by afternoon.\n Still, given there was no other company news from Etsy Tuesday morning, it seems safe to say that Musk's tweet was the primary catalyst for the stock's premarket surge.\n That, of course, is ridiculous. It's also yet another example of the increasingly short-term nature of the stock market, one where algorithms can drive prices and individual investors using services like Robinhood are eager to make a quick buck.\n Recently, shares of companies that many professional investors are shorting -- because they expect the stocks to go down since the companies are struggling or overvalued -- are instead surging thanks to support from traders on a popular Reddit board. GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Macy's (M) and AMC (AMC) are just a few examples.\n But Etsy is nothing like these companies in that it's thriving, in part due to strong demand for masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts are forecasting that Etsy's sales nearly doubled in 2020 and that earnings per share soared more than 175%.\n Musk's tweet put a bigger spotlight on Etsy, though, and it isn't the first time he's sparked a big move in an asset that isn't Tesla. The price of digital currency dogecoin popped late last month when he touted it on Twitter.\n Still, it's a bit ironic that Etsy is benefiting from Musk's endorsement. Although Tesla was finally added to the S&P 500 in December, many on Wall Street were surprised when Tesla was snubbed for the index in September. The company that was added back then instead of Tesla? Etsy.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)A teenager left to care for his family. One who found his faith, and another who watched his father relapse into addiction. They are the firsthand accounts of a group of New Jersey high school students living during the pandemic, brought together in one powerful memoir.\n The idea for the memoir came from Shawn Adler, an English teacher at Cliffside Park High School, who wanted to document what his students were going through -- both as a way for them to take ownership of their experiences and to share it with the world through creative writing.\n \"I was devastated to know that they were going through this, and many of them are going through this feeling alone.\" Adler said. \"You know, your first reaction as a teacher is always, 'What can I do? How can I help?'\"\n Adler, a former journalist, said his students were over the moon with the idea.\n \"I was expecting them to roll their eyes. I was expecting them to give me the teenage cynicism,\" he said. \"They were so immediately on board with the project, I was flabbergasted.\"\n The students' accounts are actually part of a second volume of stories, \"The Class of Covid-19: Second Wave,\" published by Adler, which came out this month. The first volume, \"The Class of Covid-19: Insights from the Inside,\" came out in June with contributions from 46 students. A deluxe edition with both volumes was released in January as well.\n After what Adler described in the book's introduction as a \"never-ending roller coaster due to COVID,\" the 24 memoirs in the second volume are a bit darker than the first.\n Adler said new students reached out to him wanting to share their experiences, so he spoke to the administration about publishing the second volume.\n \"I approached the administration and they were really on board and it became a club.\" Adler says he contacted all the new kids who were \"desperate to tell their stories\" and did the \"same thing again.\"\n In the second volume, 16-year-old Wilbert Alvarez writes he and the other five members of his immediate family caught Covid-19 at the same time.\n Wilbert explained that when his parents grew feeble, he had to take on their responsibilities.\n He \"had to think about the incoming bills, because they weren't working,\" he wrote. The food supply at home dwindled, and he had to make a trip to the grocery store with his sister, putting on two masks and \"all kinds of protective gear.\"\n \"There was truly no one left to care for us when we needed care the most,\" Wilbert wrote.\n While Wilbert dealt with the physical effects of the virus, Sofia Loiacono struggled with the mental and emotional effects.\n Loiacono said publishing the memoirs gave Sofia and her classmates a sense of relief.\n \"You see them brighten up, you see them sit up straighter, you see them speak more eloquently about their experiences,\" Loiacono said.\n Adler said the book encouraged students to control their own narrative after months of living through the pandemic.\n \"They kept feeling powerless,\" Adler said. \"And I thought, what an opportunity to share their stories and share their voices and to claim some of that power back from the universe.\"\n Student Julianna Baldwin said that's exactly how she felt when she contributed to the memoir.\n \"I was feeling helpless,\" the 16-year-old said. \"By me writing this book, it was giving me the potential to help even one person by sharing my story. And that filled me with the strength to keep going every day.\"\n Sixteen-year-old Nareg Kassardjian said writing about the impact Covid-19 had on his Christian faith was healing.\n \"No one ever asked, 'How do you feel about church being closed? Or how are you feeling?'\" Nareg said. The writing was \"like therapy,\" he said, and helped him appreciate going to church: \"You never know the true worth of something until you lose it.\"\n In the books is also a memoir from Benjamin Luderer, a beloved teacher and coach who died in March due to complications from Covid-19.\n The books can be purchased on Amazon, and according to Adler, 100% of the profits will go toward a scholarship fund for the students.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)The acting head of the US Capitol Police told congressional members during a closed-door briefing Tuesday that the \"department failed to meet its own high standards\" on January 6 when a crowd of pro-Trump rioters overran the Capitol building.\n Acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman called the insurrection a \"terrorist attack\" and offered her \"sincerest apologies on behalf of the department,\" according to her prepared remarks during a briefing for lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee with a number of agencies that had a role in security on January 6.\n Pittman also said the department was aware of a \"strong potential for violence\" targeting Congress and did not take the appropriate steps to prevent it.\n Pittman's admission comes as US Capitol Police officers are debating whether to hold a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day of insurrection, including Pittman. One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief the day of the siege at the Capitol and \"never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way, shape or form.\"\n Officers have told CNN that they felt abandoned and betrayed by the department's leadership.\n \"Let me be clear: the Department should have been more prepared for this attack,\" Pittman said Tuesday. \"By January 4th, the Department knew that the January 6th event would not be like any of the previous protests held in 2020. We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event.\"\n Ultimately, Pittman took responsibility for mistakes that were made in protecting the Capitol.\n \"As the Acting Chief, I take responsibility for the mistakes that were made by the Department, and I pledge to this Committee, the Congress, the American people, and my USCP colleagues, that we will do better going forward, but we need to make changes,\" she said.\n Acting Sergeant at Arms Timothy Blodgett issued a blunt assessment Tuesday of the security failures that occurred, both in preparing for a protest of this nature and reacting to events as they unfolded, according to his prepared statement during Tuesday's briefing in front of lawmakers.\n \"It is clear there was a failure of preparation. Whether it was insufficient or conflicting intelligence, lacking ability to translate that intelligence into action, insufficient preparation or an inadequate ability to mobilize partner agencies for immediate assistance, a series of events, once thought unfathomable, unfolded allowing our most sacred halls to be breached. And, sadly, several lives were lost, including Officer Brian Sicknick and Officer Howard Liebengood,\" Blodgett said in his remarks.\n Pittman outlined four things that made the department ill-equipped to respond to the attack, including the lack of manpower. The acting chief said USCP officers did not have the right equipment on hand or easily accessible, and the process for sealing the building \"may not have been consistently followed.\" Lastly, Pittman stated that the department was told that communication over their radios and the public address system were hard to hear during the attack.\n Since the insurrection, Pittman said USCP has coordinated with the National Guard to secure the Capitol and the complex surrounding it and has \"taken steps to ensure\" that USCP is sharing and receiving critical intelligence information from its law enforcement partners. Pittman also said that the department's intelligence director is now holding daily internal intelligence briefings with USCP officials.\n Pittman said that going forward, \"the Capitol's security infrastructure must change and that the Department needs access to additional resources -- both manpower and physical assets.\"\n This story has been updated.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen and Peter Nickeas contributed to this report.",

        "title": "'It's time to act': Biden moves to address racial inequity",
        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden signed a series of executive actions revolving around racial equity policy on Tuesday, focusing on nondiscrimination policy, prison reform and public housing, saying it is \"time to act.\"\n \"It's what the core values of this nation call us to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- share these values and want us to act as well,\" Biden said during a signing ceremony at the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris. \"We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives.\"\n He added that \"it's time to act now not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it.\"\n Biden also credited protests over the death of George Floyd as having \"stirred the conscious of tens of millions of Americans, and ... marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice.\"\n As part of Tuesday's executive actions, the President directed the Justice Department not to renew federal contracts with private prisons. Biden had campaigned on eliminating the federal government's use of private prisons.\n Biden established that it is the policy of his administration to condemn and denounce anti-Asian bias, specifically addressing anti-Asian bias in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The President will be working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice on the matter.\n Biden issued a memorandum to the Department of Housing and Urban Development he said will \"redress historical racism in federal housing policies.\" He also took steps on Tuesday to reaffirm the federal government's commitment to tribal sovereignty and consultation.\n The President indicated during the signing ceremony that while previous presidential administrations have had interest in addressing equity, his administration intends to integrate racial equity policy holistically across its domestic policy efforts.\n A senior administration official said on a call with reporters earlier Tuesday that cost implications of the move away from private prison was not a \"motivating factor.\"\n \"The motivating factor, however, was the fact that private prisons are not only encouraged profiteering off of human lives but more importantly, I've been shown by the Department of Justice inspector general's report to be subpar in terms of safety and security for those incarcerated,\" the official said.\n The housing memorandum will \"make clear we have to acknowledge the role that the federal government has played through much of the 20th century and implementing discriminatory housing policies across the United States from redlining to mortgage discrimination, to destructive federal highway construction to redress this history,\" the official said.\n Reporters were also told by the official that \"the President has asked (the Office of Management and Budget) to examine opportunities to embed racial equity in its work(.)\"\n Biden has specifically asked the office, which plays a role in crafting the administration's annual budget proposals, to evaluate opportunities to allocate funding \"more equitably to target groups who have been underserved or harmed by federal investments in the past\" in its annual budget submission, the official said.\n Tuesday's executive actions are the first among more Biden administration initiatives related to equity -- including supporting future legislation in Congress.\n An earlier draft of Tuesday's plans indicated that the President was going to issue an executive order creating a policing commission, something he promised he'd create if elected to office. It also indicated that Biden would sign an order to reinstate an Obama-era policy barring the transfer of military equipment to local police departments.\n White House domestic policy adviser Susan Rice indicated during a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon that policing and criminal justice reform initiatives will be addressed in the coming weeks.\n Biden's voting history in Congress on criminal justice and prison reform issues had an impact on his presidential campaign. And Tuesday's actions, coming less than a week into his presidency, seem to be an apparent attempt to correct what he has admitted was one of his shortcomings.\n \"You know I've been in this fight for a long time. It goes not just to voting rights. It goes to the criminal justice system,\" Biden said on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2019. \"I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried.\"\n Biden helped draft the 1994 crime bill, which set strict federal sentencing standards and which critics argue led to an era of mass incarceration.\n In a 1993 Senate floor speech speaking in favor of the crime bill, Biden warned of \"predators on our streets.\"\n \"We have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created,\" Biden said. \"They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,\" Biden continued. \"And it's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.\"\n Biden's vice president, who was once his 2020 presidential race opponent, said in 2019 that she believed the bill caused mass incarceration.\n Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris said she disagreed with Biden, who had said at the time that the crime bill \"did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n \"That crime bill -- that 1994 crime bill -- it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states. So, I disagree, sadly,\" Harris said.\n Biden also expressed unequivocal support, in both 1994 and in the years following, for the law's billions in funding to build state prisons, including in his home state of Delaware. He argued in 1994 that the law should include less money for prison construction than Republicans wanted to spend -- but he emphasized that he too wanted to spend billions.\n He was also a longtime proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure while serving as a senator, which critics have said would have made investigating police officers for misconduct more difficult.\n CNN's DJ Judd, Daniel Dale, Andrew Kaczynski and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.\n This story has been updated to include additional reporting.",

Cici's dropped \"pizza\" from its name in 2015 and expanded its menu to focus on its unlimited soup, salad and dessert options. The company was bought by Arlon, a food and agriculture investment firm, a year later.\n Unlike other pizza chains, Cici's hasn't benefited from delivery. The company said that the at home dining trend \"poses significant challenges\" to its buffet model and admitted it \"must work harder and more creatively\" to differentiate itself from competitors.\n Cici's has between $50 million to $100 million in liabilities. The chain came to an agreement in December for its primary lender, D&G Investors, to purchase the company and its $82 million in debt.\n The pandemic has decimated the restaurant industry. Restrictions on indoor dining and the challenging economics for making money from delivery or take out have forced a number of chains to file for bankruptcy in recent months, including Sizzler USA, Friendly's, California Pizza Kitchen and Vapiano.",

        "title": "Where Joe Biden's moon rock came from ",
        "body_text": "Robin George Andrews (@SquigglyVolcano) is a volcanologist-turned-freelance science journalist, writing for The New York Times, Scientific American, National Geographic, The Atlantic and more. He is also the author of an upcoming book on volcanoes around the solar system. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN\n (CNN)The day after the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Washington Post reported on the aesthetics of the newly redecorated Oval Office. Among all sorts of noteworthy items, a moon rock was found to be sitting on a bookshelf. Social media rejoiced at the sight, an indubitably cool artifact to find inside the White House. But what many didn't know was that this rock, dubbed Lunar Sample 76015,143, had been on an Odyssean journey to get there, one 3.9 billion years in the making.\n The current thinking is that 4.5 billion years ago, a protoplanet the size of Mars slammed into a magma ocean-covered Earth. Debris from the baby planet and the spaceborne projectile was sent into orbit, eventually clumping together to make the moon.\n The solar system was a bit like the inside of a pinball machine back then, with countless would-be worlds crashing into each other. Like the adolescent Earth, the youthful moon was a target too, with several enormous impacts carving out ginormous basins on its surface. And around 600 million years after it was formed, the moon rendezvoused with a rock the size of New Jersey, weighing about 25,000 trillion tons and moving at a speed of around 52,000 miles per hour.\n This interloping giant rock, which hit the moon at an inclined angle, disintegrated upon impact, sending boulders shooting across the lunar surface, cutting deep, long grooves into the crust as if it were attacked by a cosmic, clawed beast. The impact would have been way more powerful than a gargantuan volcanic explosion like Mount St. Helens, which itself had unleashed more energy than the sum total of all the explosives used during World War II, including the two nuclear bombs. The rock carved out a circular chasm some 710 miles across. For the sake of comparison, the asteroid that careened into Earth 66 million years ago and heralded the end of the age of the dinosaurs excavated a pit a mere 110 miles in diameter.\n Around 250 million years later, lava later poured into this great depression, forming a sea of molten rock named Mare Imbrium, the \"Sea of Rains.\" And as lava lapped at the shores of this magnificent desolation, a curious rock sat nearby: a mangled amalgam of crushed sediment and once-molten matter, a product of the ferocity of that ancient, colossal impact.\n For what seemed like an eternity, that rock sat silently on the moon, hit by the occasional micrometeorite. And 3.9 billion years after it was formed, in the twilight days of 1972, two visitors from another world, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt -- Schmitt was the first and only geologist sent to the moon -- saw it glinting in starlight.\n The last two people to set foot on the moon carved off a chunk and brought a sample back home. Like the other rocks brought back by the Apollo missions, it was housed at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, it was broken up, and its pieces -- including number 76015,143 -- were examined by scientists hoping to unravel the secrets of the moon's origins and its evolution, as well as providing them with a window into Earth's obfuscated distant past.\n That we can host such stunning off-world geologic treasures on Earth and decode the epochal stories they tell without needing to invent time travel is a remarkable achievement. But Lunar Sample 76015,143 isn't sitting in any old building. It's in the office of the most powerful person in the world. That imbues this lithic archive with novel significance.\n For the last four years, the Trump administration threw science into the sewers, treating it like an inconvenience at best and a shameful pursuit at worst. More than 400,000 Americans died of Covid-19 during Donald Trump's time in office. We may never know how many lives could have been saved had the former president not shown an allergic reaction to reality -- not only on the pandemic, but on another death-dealing existential crisis: climate change.\n Biden is clearly ushering in a new era. Immediately after the inauguration, the new administration went to task, initiating their 198-page plan to defeat the pandemic while beginning the difficult work of stemming climate change. The Oval Office's moon rock is, for many, a cathartic sight, a symbol of the new President's science-driven agenda, of his administration's adherence to facts and to objective truths, something America needs now more than ever.\n Landing astronauts on the moon was a political ambition first and foremost. But that rock, on loan from NASA at the request of the Biden administration, represents what can happen when a national priority is made of the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. If America can send people across the expanse and bring them back with geologic treasures, then it can also bring an end to a pandemic.\n Ideally, this rock also represents a calling card to the stars. We can only comprehend our place in the cosmos if we go out and explore it -- and look not just to the moon, but beyond it. NASA is about to land its Perseverance rover on Mars, the first step in an 11-year operation to bring back the first pristine rocks from that planet's surface. One day, astronauts will be hauling Martian rocks home themselves. But who will be the first Earth-born emissaries to the Red Planet?\n A future president of the United States may have a piece of Mars sitting on her bookshelf. If so, I suspect Americans will look back in pride at the moment they saw a moon rock sitting in Biden's Oval Office. It may mark the day the White House was exorcised of its ignorance, transforming once again -- and, we hope, forevermore -- into a place that champions science.",

        "title": "Xi Jinping touts coronavirus cooperation as China persists with vaccine disinformation push",
        "body_text": "Hong Kong (CNN)Addressing the world's economic elite on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that \"containing the coronavirus is the most pressing task for the international community.\"\n In a speech to the World Economic Forum, Xi called for \"closer solidarity and cooperation, more information sharing, and a stronger global response,\" as well as \"international cooperation on Covid vaccines.\"\n China has been praised for its \"vaccine diplomacy,\" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots.\n Along with hyping reports of deaths allegedly related to vaccines -- a dangerous game that could undermine not only confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna candidates targeted by Chinese media, but all coronavirus shots -- China's propaganda organs have also pushed alternate theories about the origins of the pandemic itself, including a long-debunked claim that it began in a US army lab.\n \"If the United States truly respects facts, it should open the biological lab at Fort Detrick (and) give more transparency to issues like its 200-plus overseas bio-labs,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last week, adding that the US should invite World Health Organization (WHO) investigators \"to conduct origin-tracing\" as they are in China.\n The leading US military germ lab, Fort Detrick briefly became a trending topic on Chinese social media after Hua's comments, which were heavily promoted online by the Communist Youth League, among other Party and state-backed accounts. Previously, Chinese officials have suggested -- without evidence -- that even if the pandemic did originate in Wuhan, the coronavirus could have been brought to the city by US soldiers taking part in the Military World Games in October 2019.\n Beijing has also pushed the idea that the virus could have entered the country on frozen food or other goods, despite most outside researchers disputing claims that it could be easily spread this way.\n Asked by CNN about her Fort Detrick comments, Hua claimed there was evidence that \"the epidemic broke out in multiple places earlier in the autumn of 2019 and there might be links between the seasonal influenza in the US and the epidemic,\" adding that it was \"not for China, but for the US, to offer the answers.\"\n Claims that the pandemic had \"multiple origins\" have not been supported by most scientists, and even if true, do not change the fact that the Chinese city of Wuhan was where the first major outbreak occurred, and where local officials were found to have downplayed the danger, allowing the virus to spread.\n Wuhan remains the most likely origin of the pandemic itself, providing scientists with important data about how the virus evolved and what lessons we could draw from this for the future.\n After months of delays and diplomatic wrangling, a WHO research team arrived in the city earlier this month to begin an investigation, bringing with them additional scrutiny, which seems to have prompted the sudden resurgence of the Fort Detrick conspiracies.\n The WHO team has already said that they have no intention of assigning blame, nor is it necessarily their job to do so. However, any suggestion of uncertainty about the origins of the pandemic, or how the virus first began spreading, will likely be seized upon by Beijing to reinforce the alternative theories state media is already advancing.\n New outbreaks of the virus in China itself, after months of having largely got the pandemic under control, also add to the urgency of deflecting blame outwards, particularly as cities are plunged back into lockdown and potential economic misery.\n Xi has repeatedly emphasized the success of the Chinese Communist Party in tackling the pandemic, an achievement that is all the more striking when compared with the US and much of western Europe. As it rolls out vaccines both domestically and internationally, the chance of turning the coronavirus from a reputational disaster into a propaganda win must be all the more alluring.\n But the promotion of vaccine disinformation could have major repercussions, not only in the US but also in China.\n On Monday, Global Times, the state-backed tabloid which has led the charge on attacking the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines, used the death of a single patient in California to claim without evidence that the shots were dangerous. Health experts have said repeatedly that deaths will occur after vaccination -- especially in the early stages, when most people inoculated are elderly and sick -- but this does not mean they were caused by the shot itself.\n Global Times even cited health authorities in Placer county, who it said reject \"the link between the person's death and the vaccine.\" But this did not stop the paper using this as a peg to quote anonymous Chinese experts claiming mRNA shots were dangerous and \"may contain unknown risks.\"\n This reporting goes beyond attacking the specific Pfizer shot too, suggesting that the technology used to develop the newer mRNA vaccines is itself untrustworthy -- a claim that has no substance and could have repercussions for future Chinese products as well as the existing Pfizer/Moderna shots.\n Such reports are having an effect. Last week, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pointed to reports -- heavily promoted by Chinese officials and state media -- of deaths in Norway, where the Pfizer vaccine is being distributed. Norwegian health authorities have said there was no correlation between receiving the Pfizer vaccine and increased risk of death among the 23 deceased patients who had previously received the shot.\n \"Almost everybody that I know is scrambling to buy this Pfizer (vaccine),\" Duterte said in addressing calls from some lawmakers to prioritize the US manufacturer's shots over Chinese vaccines. \"If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead. Nobody would stop you.\"\n His comments were quickly picked up by Chinese media, feeding another round of disinformation.\n Writing this week, Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China's success in tackling the pandemic at home may have left the country with a false sense of security when it comes to vaccines. Huang cited polling data showing that a surprising number of Chinese respondents cited \"not being enough at risk from Covid-19\" as a reason to refuse taking a shot, an unusual result even in countries where vaccine hesitancy is far more widespread than in China.\n Similar sentiment could be behind the Chinese government's willingness to play fast and loose with vaccine misinformation. China has among the least vaccine hesitant populations in the world, according to a recent Nature study, and even if skepticism were to increase, the ability of an authoritarian state to force mass inoculation is not in doubt.\n But as Xi himself noted Monday, vaccines are vital to the global pandemic response, indeed, this is why Beijing has invested in providing inoculations to developing countries. But such an effort will be undermined if, along with vaccines, China is also exporting misinformation and hesitancy.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Justin Timberlake and wife Jessica Biel want to keep their children out of the spotlight but for good reason.\n Timberlake, who grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, recently appeared on actor Dax Shepard's \"Armchair Expert\" podcast and explained why he and Biel try to limit their children's exposure to fame.\n \"I try to be conscious of making sure we can live a life where we're not weirdly private but we're conscious of making sure they can be kids for as long as possible,\" he said. \"And not have the weight of somebody else treating them differently because of something that their parents do.\"\n The couple, who welcomed their second son last year, rarely post any photos of their eldest son on social media and have yet to post photos of their newest addition.\n Timberlake, whose new movie, \"Palmer,\" is out this week on Apple TV+, talked with Shepard about how they explain fame to their children.\n Shepard told a story about how his daughters told their classmates that their mom, Kristen Bell, is Princess Anna from Disney's \"Frozen.\" And although she does voice the popular princess, Shepard tried to explain that it might upset the other kids in her class.\n \"I know you're proud and you should be able to say that, but I'm just warning you, that'll probably make other kids jealous and they won't know how to handle that feeling,\" Shepard said.\n This was something that resonated with Timberlake, who plays Branch in the \"Trolls\" franchise.\n \"For guys like us, you know, the hope is that we just keep instilling in them that we got really fun jobs, but it's not who we are,\" he said. \"Hopefully down the road, then that has more weight to it I guess.\"",

        "title": "What the Biden administration means for the future of Silicon Valley ",
        "body_text": "(CNN)The biggest tech companies spent much of the last four years in Washington playing defense: Answering to threats of regulation and repeatedly being called before congressional committees; serving as former President Donald Trump's foil on social media moderation; and protesting his approach to immigration and tariffs.\n Now, with President Joe Biden in the White House, Big Tech may be hoping to turn a page. The industry's trade groups are already lining up proposals to the new administration in hopes of shaping a more favorable agenda.\n But despite Biden's early moves like overturning Trump's travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries and tapping tech industry staffers to serve in his government, Silicon Valley's future remains as uncertain as ever. Even with Congress under Democratic control -- with a razor-thin margin -- many of the tech-related challenges for policymakers remain the same.\n Among them are what to do with an enormously powerful social media industry that largely continues to spread misinformation and hate, despite the platforms' efforts to crack down on it; how to ensure that all Americans have affordable high-speed internet access amid a global pandemic; and responding to a suspected Russian intrusion into US computer networks that's been described as the worst government data breach in years. It's also unclear if the government's approach to Chinese-linked companies, including TikTok, whose business deal with Oracle and Walmart still hasn't been approved, may change.\n Here are the big tech issues that policy experts say America's new government will likely confront.\n Policy experts say tech companies are still in for a reckoning in Washington, even with the departure of Trump \u2014 the industry's chief antagonist for the last four years. Perhaps nowhere is that more apparent than with Section 230, the liability shield that largely protects tech companies from lawsuits over their content moderation decisions.\n Democrats and Republicans disagree, however, over what the problem is.\n GOP lawmakers have lobbed baseless claims of unconstitutional censorship at the hands of tech platforms (the Constitution does not require private companies to carry user speech). At the same time, Democrats including Biden say tech companies haven't done enough to combat misinformation and must be held accountable. One of Biden's top tech advisors, Bruce Reed, said in December that it's \"long past time to hold the social media companies accountable for what's published on their platforms.\"\n For their part, companies including Google and Facebook have said they've hired thousands of human content moderators and ramped up artificial intelligence-based content filters.\n With Democrats enjoying a slim margin in Congress, policy experts anticipate the conversation on Section 230 to drift away from Republican-driven legislation targeting perceived censorship. That's particularly the case now following the Capitol riots earlier this month, which were facilitated by online misinformation about the 2020 election outcome, said Carl Szabo, general counsel at NetChoice, a tech trade group.\n \"I believe Democrats are going to be much, much more aggressive in pushing for reforms of Section 230 to force stricter moderation of content,\" he said.\n The threats to big tech companies don't end there. Major platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google received a great deal of scrutiny last year over their dominance, with a House Democratic-led report finding that the companies enjoy \"monopoly power.\" Facebook and Google are battling multiple lawsuits by federal and state officials, and Apple and Amazon have been hit by private antitrust lawsuits. All of those suits are expected to continue.\n With Democrats in control of the House and nominally in the Senate, that provides an opening for the party to push for some of the more aggressive changes to competition law contemplated in the House antitrust report. While Republicans had expressed support for some proposals, such as giving the Federal Trade Commission more resources, they had balked at others, such as a bill that might prevent tech companies from both owning a digital platform and competing on it, as Amazon does with its e-commerce site.\n \"If Congress does flip, you could end up with some kind of new [regulatory] scheme for the big digital marketplaces,\" Columbia University law professor Tim Wu predicted in October.\n One of the Trump Federal Communications Commission's first actions in 2017 was to repeal the US government's net neutrality regulations, which had prohibited internet service providers from blocking, slowing or selectively speeding up websites and apps. The move was widely opposed by tech companies, internet activists and consumer groups, while telecom providers welcomed the de-regulation.\n Now, with control of Congress and the White House, Democrats have an opportunity to restore those rules \u2014 either by re-introducing them at the FCC, or by passing legislation to enshrine the regulations into law.\n That could put an end to what had become a ping-pong match in Washington, with different FCCs enacting different rules each time the Oval Office changed hands.\n \"We might find a permanent solution for net neutrality,\" said Chip Pickering, a former US congressman from Mississippi who now leads INCOMPAS, a telecom trade group. Pickering said a likely path would be for Congress to impose net neutrality obligations on providers including Comcast, Verizon and others without explicitly regulating them like the FCC does with legacy telephone service, a key fault line in past debates.\n As the pandemic has driven many Americans to remote work and schooling, it's highlighted how rural and low-income Americans don't enjoy the same access to high-speed internet as those with more resources. Closing that digital divide has historically been a rallying cry for both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 making investments in broadband a potentially easy, bipartisan accomplishment, policy experts say.\n Expect broadband funding to become a part of infrastructure talks on Capitol Hill, following Biden's campaign promise to extend high-speed connectivity to \"every American.\" The FCC is likely to expand existing federal subsidy programs for connectivity, according to the Brookings Institute. And industry leaders have called for streamlining the rollout of 5G wireless service.\n The devastating breach of US government and corporate networks by suspected Russian hackers will be an enormous challenge for the Biden administration, as investigators continue to assess the damage.\n It will be up to Biden to determine how the US will respond and there are numerous tools at his disposal for doing so, said Keith Alexander, retired general and former director of the National Security Agency. But any response would need to be carefully calibrated to avoid an escalation, he said.\n \"You can respond by indicting individuals and by diplomatic and economic measures, which they should do,\" Alexander told CNN. \"But any response in cyber in the physical space would probably develop into a bigger attack on us, and we're not prepared to defend against that.\"\n Speaking to reporters Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to say what the administration will do.\n \"We reserve the right to respond at a time and manner of our choosing to any cyberattack,\" she said.\n With the Biden administration's executive actions last week, Silicon Valley appears hopeful for a more welcoming US immigration policy \u2014 one that supports the industry's use of immigrant talent.\n Companies including Apple, Airbnb and IBM quickly applauded Biden's reversal of Trump's travel ban and his efforts to preserve the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. That program, which Trump had sought to limit, protects undocumented immigrants from deportation who had arrived in the United States as children.\n Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week he was \"inspired\" by Biden's moves. In a blog post, Airbnb said it celebrated the executive actions to undo restrictions that it said went \"against Airbnb's mission and values.\" And IBM said those who benefit from the DACA program \"make vital contributions to our communities and economy.\"\n \"We look forward to a permanent, bipartisan solution in the future,\" the tech giant said.",

        "title": "US Capitol officers debating no-confidence vote for leaders in charge during Capitol riots",
        "body_text": "(CNN)US Capitol Police officers are in preliminary discussions over holding a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day when Donald Trump supporters led an insurrection into the building, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n The vote would target acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman, who was promoted into the agency's top job following the resignation of Steven Sund after the insurrection. At least four additional chiefs may be targeted as part of any no-confidence vote, the three sources said.\n News of the discussion comes as Pittman spoke to congressional members during a closed-door briefing Tuesday, where she said the \"department failed to meet its own high standards\" on January 6, adding that police \"knew there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.\"\n One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief that day and \"never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way shape or form.\"\n One Capitol police source said stewards from the USCP Labor Committee, the union representing rank-and-file officers, visited section roll calls to take the temperature of officers on the potential no-confidence vote.\n Another source within the department says a no-confidence vote was likely forthcoming for senior leadership. \"The rank-and-file of this department has no faith in any of our chiefs, especially the ones in that were here on January 6th,\" the source told CNN.\n A Capitol Police spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.\n Union President Gus Papathanasiou told CNN that no vote is underway. \"Officers have been calling for a vote of no confidence since January 6th,\" Papathanasiou said. \"At this time we have not initiated a vote of no confidence. Doesn't mean we can't think about it. There's a big difference.\"\n LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Biden presidency and Trump impeachment trial\n Officers have told CNN that they felt abandoned and betrayed by the department's leadership.\n Prior to her appointment, Pittman had served as head of intelligence operations since October 2019. In that role, Pittman was responsible for the safety and security of the US Capitol, congressional members, congressional staff and Capitol visitors, including detecting any threat and preventing it. On the day of the insurrection, she was second in command of the US Capitol Police force.\n In her prepared remarks Tuesday, Pittman outlined the department's failure to act on intelligence that pointed to a likelihood of violence.\n \"We knew that militia groups and White supremacists organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target,\" she said.\n The department responded to the threat by canceling days off for some officers and putting civil disturbance teams on standby. The SWAT team was available to wade into the crowd to make arrests, though officers told CNN that was not possible because of how badly officers were outnumbered that day.\n Officers also described to CNN a hasty attempt to get helmets into the hands of officers before the event, without clear instruction on when to use them and where to store them.\n Pittman said the department had adopted a new perimeter around the Capitol based on \"instructions it received from the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms.\" But officers have told CNN, and videos indicate, that the bike-rack-type fencing used that day created a danger because it provide no security and can be easily weaponized by violent protesters.\n \"The department prepared in order to meet these challenges, but we did not do enough,\" she said.\n Pittman also acknowledged that two pipe bombs and a van with explosives had forced police to divert officers just as the main body of protesters was arriving at the Capitol.\n Officers told CNN they believe the assault on the Capitol was timed to the bombs being found and was coordinated between insurrectionists on the east and west fronts of the building. The lack of any quick backup left officers stranded in thin lines attempting to keep a crowd of thousands from entering. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "London (CNN)Increases in air pollution are linked to an increased risk of irreversible sight loss, according to a new study.\n Researchers from University College London (UCL) found that even low exposure to air pollution across England, Scotland and Wales appears to impact the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among people over 50 in high-income countries. AMD is linked to the loss of central vision -- needed for reading, performing fine detailed tasks and recognizing faces -- and the biggest risk factors for the disease are genetics, old age and smoking.\n Researchers found that people living in the most polluted areas were at least 8% more likely to report having the condition, in a study published Monday in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.\n The team studied data from 115,954 people aged between 40-69, who had participated in the UK Biobank, a large study of half a million people focusing on the medical diagnoses and biological measurements of participants.\n Using eye measurements and data from questionnaires, experts studied those who said they did and did not have macular degeneration, and then compared the results to the amount of pollutants estimated to be at their residential addresses.\n \"People who live in a more polluted area report macular degeneration more frequently,\" Paul Foster, a professor of glaucoma studies and ophthalmic epidemiology at UCL and senior author of the paper, told CNN.\n Foster said that the main pollutants linked to macular degeneration were particulate matter PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide and oxide nitrogen.\n PM2.5 is tiny particulate pollution that can move deep into the lungs when inhaled and enter the bloodstream. The particles, made up of dust, dirt, soot or smoke, originate from construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires, and can contain different chemicals. But most particles are a mix of pollutants from power plants, industrial and vehicle emissions.\n Nitrogen oxides refers to nitric oxide gas and nitrogen dioxide gas, as well as other gaseous oxides containing nitrogen. The main source of these gases in urban areas are motor vehicle exhausts, indoor gas stoves and kerosene heaters.\n Foster told CNN that the pollutants enter the body through the lungs, and seem to cause particular damage to the eyes because of high blood flow in the eye wall.\n \"It's people breathing the stuff in, and it going down into the lungs, being absorbed into the blood, carried round in the blood,\" he said.\n \"There's definitely a relationship between the more disadvantaged members of society and higher risk of getting this condition,\" he added.\n Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which says such deaths occur largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.\n WHO data shows that nine out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds guideline limits on high levels of pollutants.\n Chris Inglehearn, a professor of molecular ophthalmology at the University of Leeds said that the UCL research is similar to a 2019 study from Taiwan. \"Both show a link between air pollution and age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness in older people,\" he told the Science Media Centre.\n \"The profile of pollutants the two groups looked at is slightly different but the source is the same, combustion. Of course, correlation does not prove causation, but the fact that these two independent studies reach similar conclusions gives greater confidence that the link they make is real,\" Inglehearn, who was not involved in the UCL study, said.\n Inglehearn said such studies \"provide further evidence that links air pollution with detrimental impacts on human health.\"",

        "body_text": "(CNN)This winter has been incredibly quiet for some places in the Northeast, where millions in big cities who are used to shoveling in January haven't had much work to do.\n That could change this week.\n A shot at snow and ice is in the forecast for the Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. New York City could see a wintry mix on Tuesday, making commutes hazardous. The city is under a winter weather advisory through midnight with snowfall amounts around an inch and a glaze of ice possible.\n The ice will make travel exceptionally treacherous. There could also be potential power outages with the accumulation of ice on trees and power lines. This will be the first time many Northeast areas along the Interstate 95 corridor will see measurable snowfall since mid-December.\n New York City is currently running about 5.5 inches below normal for snowfall for the month of January. This entire season, much of the areas surrounding New York City have received less than an inch of snow.\n New York City isn't alone. Even Boston is running well behind for snow. January 2021 has been the least snowiest January on record for Boston. Boston should have more than 10 inches of snow in January, and the city hasn't even received half an inch.\n Philadelphia hasn't seen more than a trace of snowfall in January, and even Portland, Maine, is nearly a foot below normal for January snowfall.\n \"Cities in upstate New York that are known for snow are well below normal,\" says CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. \"Buffalo is 15.9 inches below normal for the month of January and Rochester is 10.4 inches below normal.\"\n We are currently in a La Ni\u00f1a pattern and it's expected to last the rest of the winter. This phenomenon that occurs along the equator has weather consequences around the world.\n In the US, we typically see wetter than normal winters for the Northeast, but blaming the lack of snow solely on La Ni\u00f1a is tricky.\n \"It is difficult to say how much of an impact the La Ni\u00f1a we are currently in is having on the lackluster snow season in the Northeast thus far this winter, but it does fit the pattern,\" says CNN climate expert Brandon Miller.\n \"The winter outlook from NOAA, issued before the season began, called for warmer than normal temperatures for the entire East Coast, largely because of the jet stream's usual response to La Nina,\" says Miller.\n The warmer-than-average temperatures do not always correlate to low snowfall seasons, but so far this year they have for large portions of the Northeast.\n This week, the Climate Prediction Center has put out their new seasonal forecast, and is forecasting warmer than normal temperatures for the Northeast to last through April.\n This won't completely wipe out snow chances for the region, but it could mean more rain and less snow overall.\n \"There also hasn't been a big amplified jet stream this year. This is limiting snow systems from moving through the region. That has resulted in a more southerly storm track, which has brought more snow to some southern locations, and less snow to the cities in the north that typically get snow,\" Chinchar says.\n The winter season is still far from over, giving these cities plenty of time to make up for the lack of snowfall.\n A few long-range forecasts show a slight change in the forecast pattern that will give some of these big cities in the Northeast a better shot of snow during the next few weeks.\n There could be another winter storm Sunday into Monday that could bring additional snow to these areas.\n All it takes is one blockbuster snowstorm to get the snowless cities back on track.",

        "title": "The Republican Party is at war with itself as it charts its post-Trump future",
        "body_text": "(CNN)A cold war is underway within the Republican Party as its members begin to navigate how former President Donald Trump and his legacy fit into the GOP's future.\n Some in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach.\n The result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward -- and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party's grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump's presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him.\n \"Republicans are entering the wilderness and looking desperately to point blame,\" said Erick Erickson, the conservative commentator and radio host. \"They're going to have to make room for each other or let the Democrats run over them in the midterms.\"\n Disunity could present a more existential threat to Republicans. In his final days in the White House, Trump raised the idea of starting a new political party, a senior Trump adviser told CNN. While others around him dismissed this scheme to launch a \"patriot party\" as unserious, the potential of a split among right-of-center voters looms for Republicans.\n Erickson says the divide in the party isn't just philosophical but literal, with both sides having their own redoubts within the GOP infrastructure.\n \"The pre-Trump establishment right now largely runs the policy-making arm of the party, and the Trump wing controls the state party arms,\" he said. \"That can't last and have the party winning.\"\n For Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a six-term Illinois congressman and one of just 10 Republicans in the House to vote for impeachment, the party is in the midst of a difficult fight about its own identity.\n \"I do think we are in a battle,\" Kinzinger told CNN's Jim Sciutto Monday. \"And it may be a battle that really needs to happen for our party to say, what does it we stand for? Not when it comes to policy, but as much as anything, are we aspirational or are we a party that feeds on fear and division?\"\n Two announcements on Monday reflected how much the Trump wing of the party remains in the GOP's driver's seat -- and that members of the pre-Trump establishment are fading.\n The first was from former Trump White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who declared her candidacy for governor of Arkansas with a press release touting her allegiance to the former president.\n \"A trusted confidant of the President, Sarah advised him on everything from press and communications strategy to personnel and policy,\" read the release. \"For two and a half years, Sarah worked closely with the president, battling with the media, working with lawmakers and CEOs, and accompanying the president on every foreign trip, including dozens of meetings with foreign leaders.\" Trump endorsed Sanders later on Monday, saying in a statement that she \"is a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct.\"\n The second came from Sen. Rob Portman, the moderate Ohio Republican and veteran of the George W. Bush administration who announced he would not seek reelection in 2022 -- prompting a free-for-all for the GOP primary in a state that has taken an increasingly Republican turn in the Trump era.\n Portman's decision to leave a \"safe seat tells you that he doesn't think much is going to get better in Washington, and we are unlikely to take the majority in '22,\" one strategist close to Republican fundraisers told CNN.\n \"We need all the moderates we can get,\" said a second GOP strategist familiar with Ohio Republican politics. \"He's exactly the type we want, and now he will be replaced by someone more 'conservative' by ideology or by positioning.\"\n But \"more conservative\" -- or at least more dedicated to Trump -- is exactly what those most loyal to the former President want.\n For the party's current problems, they blame Republicans too willing to toss Trump overboard following the election. That includes Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. Liz Cheney, two GOP leaders in Congress who publicly condemned Trump for his actions surrounding the January 6 insurrection.\n Cheney, the chair of the House Republican conference, was among the House Republicans who voted for impeachment earlier this month. For that vote, some of the most strident Trump allies in the GOP conference are threatening to strip her of her leadership role. And one of them, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, is going to Cheney's home state of Wyoming this week to speak out against her vote.\n McConnell, meanwhile, has only gestured at his openness to voting to convict, but that has been enough to turn up the pressure from some Republican colleagues. And in two recent speeches on the Senate floor, the Republican leader harshly criticized Trump's actions surrounding the attack and denounced the lie propagated by the President that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n All of that's made McConnell a target of pro-Trump voices in the conservative media.\n \"Mitch McConnell, if you're not going to fight, we deserve better,\" said Fox News host Sean Hannity last week. \"You can go back to representing the people of Kentucky and let somebody that knows how to lead, lead.\"\n Many Republicans with potential White House ambitions are therefore treading lightly.\n Sens. Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, for example, did not object to counting electoral votes like their other ambitious colleagues Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley did. But Trump remains popular among Republican voters, and most polls show little appetite among them to impeach Trump.\n So both Rubio and Cotton, along with other senators who may be looking at running for President, have already indicated they won't support convicting Trump -- a potential hedge against primary voters who may be counting fealty to Trump as an asset in a presidential nominee.\n In some states, party committees and local activists have been lashing out at those who have not sufficiently defended Trump. Backed by Trump himself, Republicans in Georgia have gone after their own elected officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, for not trying to overturn the election.\n In a statement following the January 13 House vote on impeachment, the Texas Republican Party blasted the vote as \"frivolous and cruel.\" And last week, the Oregon Republican Party released a lengthy, fiction-filled statement calling the 10 GOP votes to impeach Trump a \"betrayal.\"\n Over the weekend, the Arizona Republican Party, which had just narrowly reelected its pro-Trump chairwoman Kelli Ward, passed resolutions censuring three of the state's most prominent Republicans: Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake, and Gov. Doug Ducey.\n What happened in Arizona -- a longtime Republican state that Trump lost and where Democrats are ascendant -- worries longtime GOP operatives like Michael Steel, a former top aide to House Speaker John Boehner.\n \"If you say to the people of Arizona that your successful, conservative, two-term governor is somehow a problem, you are dooming yourself to minority status,\" Steel told CNN.\n Erickson agrees.\n \"A party that isn't big enough for Dick Cheney's daughter, Trump's secretary of transportation's husband, John McCain's wife, and the sitting governors of Arizona and Georgia is a party not big enough to win,\" he said.\n CNN's Fredreka Schouten, Jim Acosta, and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Vaccine rollouts lay bare the Middle East's deep inequalities ",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Around the world, the vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities. Rich countries take the lion's share of inoculations, and poorer states scramble to have even the prospect of life after coronavirus.\n The Middle East is a microcosm of that global problem.\n While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus.\n The first Arab countries to begin vaccinating their citizens and residents were also the richest: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.\n The UAE stands out. The country of almost 10 million, which has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, also has one of the highest vaccination rates globally. More than 2 million residents and citizens have already been vaccinated using the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and China's Sinopharm vaccine.\n The Gulf state has already vaccinated more people than middle-income Jordan plans to inoculate in the first phase of its roll out. Lebanon, currently in the throes of a financial meltdown, has not yet had any vaccines delivered.\n Regional states battered by war do not have concrete plans for procuring and distributing the vaccines even as international organizations step in to help.\n Arnaud Bernaert, the head of global health and healthcare industries at the World Economic Forum (WEF), said the world shouldn't be \"naive\" about these inequities.\n \"High-income countries have political and legal reliability, which allows them to organize the fastest possible plans to protect their populations,\" he said. \"It will always be that way.\"\n \"[Gulf Arab] countries have smaller populations, larger amounts of funds and strong health systems, so they're in a better position to start their rollout earlier, and that is a fact,\" Dr. Yvan Hutin, director of communicable diseases at the World Health Organization's (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, said.\n \"The Middle East is simply categorized by substantial inequity.\"\n For the non-Gulf Arab states, ridden with poverty, endemic corruption or conflict, the vaccination plans are complicated not just by poor administration, but by a deep distrust for the political leadership.\n \"You need to have a clear vision for the plan [to vaccinate a population], which requires strong governance as well as the capacity to pay,\" Hutin told CNN. \"Most countries in the region don't have either.\"\n In Lebanon, a ruling elite widely accused of corruption has for decades bled the country's resources dry, culminating in a financial downward spiral last year. The medical system has not been spared, and buckled under medicinal shortages and an exodus of health care workers. Last August's Beirut port explosion, which damaged some major hospitals, exacerbated what the country's president has called a full-fledged \"health state of emergency.\"\n Despite having some of the lowest case numbers in the region in the early months of the pandemic, Lebanon now leads the Arab world in cases per million population.\n Two million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are expected to arrive in early February, but they are expected to only cover around 20% of the country's population. On Lebanon's streets, few people believe that the rollout is imminent, or that it will be conducted safely.\n It's a similar story in Iraq and Jordan, countries suffering from economic turmoil and where people have regularly protested to demand political reform.\n Jordan's free Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination program is already underway, but only a very small percentage of the population has signed up to receive it, citing an absence of trust, according to health officials. In Iraq, only 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be available for its 40 million-strong population, despite the country having grappled with repeated surges in Covid cases over the last year.\n But where governments falter, the international community says it's trying to fill in the gaps. WHO is organizing the distribution plans for middle to low-income countries through programs like the COVAX alliance, a global initiative with 190 participating nations aimed at working with manufacturers to provide countries worldwide with equitable access to vaccines.\n Bernaert says he expects a fast rollout despite the myriad challenges. \"Although there will be a lag in vaccinating lower-income countries against Covid-19, it will be far shorter than what we've seen in the past,\" he said.\n Iran and Egypt are the two most populous countries in the region, with Iran at close to 85 million people and Egypt at over 100 million -- complicating distribution for two states that have struggled economically in recent years.\n Egypt started vaccinating its people, starting with medical workers, with the Sinopharm shot on January 24. GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX, will also supply inoculations for 20% of the population, while the Egyptian government said it has signed a deal for 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, covering an additional 10% of the North African state's inhabitants.\n Buckling under sanctions imposed by former US President Donald Trump, Iran is the hardest-hit country by the virus in the region. It has had over 1 million cases and more than 50,000 deaths.\n But Iran is the only regional state that says it plans to produce its own vaccine. Officials say the country also intends to import almost 2 million doses from India, Russia and China by the end of the first quarter of 2021. The imported vaccines will barely cover 2% of the population.\n In the region's conflict zones, governments are incapable of buying their own vaccines, or even distributing them in territories crisscrossed with armed factions and competing spheres of political control. They must almost completely rely on international organizations to do so.\n COVAX has secured nearly 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to be distributed across all its participating 190 countries. But Hutin says that's not enough.\n \"We really wish we had more to give,\" he said. \"We're working on securing more doses, but it's just not going to happen tomorrow.\"\n Syria, already on its knees after almost a decade of civil war, is facing an economic crisis. The country's president, Bashar al-Assad, does not control all of its territory -- much of it was wrested from his regime by opposition groups during the conflict. The government in Damascus -- repeatedly accused of war crimes and human rights abuses -- will rely on GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX. Opposition groups in Syria's largely Kurdish northeast, and rebel-controlled northwest will do the same.\n In war-torn Yemen, suffering a devastating humanitarian crisis, rival governments in the country's south and north appear to have only a vague notion of what the vaccine rollout will look like.\n In Aden, the seat of the Saudi-backed government, Deputy Health Minister Dr. Ishraq Al-Subei said that Yemen may receive its first batch of the vaccine in March, but that shipment will cover only 20% of the country. It is unclear if this will include territories controlled by Houthi rebels, recently designated terrorists by the former Trump administration.\n In Israel and the Palestinian territories, region-wide vaccine disparities also come into sharp focus. Israel's world-leading vaccination campaign, which is on course to meet the government's target of inoculating the entire country by the end of March, leaves at least 4.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza behind.\n So far none have had the injections, and most are unlikely to get them any time soon -- because there is no Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the Palestinian territories.\n According to United Nations experts, a policy of immunization that differentiates between those with Israeli IDs, and those without, is \"unacceptable.\"\n A UN expert report, published by the UN's Office High Commissioner for Human Rights in January, says that Israel is the occupying power in and over Gaza and the West Bank, and has been since 1967, and is thereby ultimately responsible for the health care of those living under occupation.\n Israel disagrees, pointing to the Oslo accords, signed in the mid-1990s with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Included in the first of those agreements is a clause that hands responsibility to the PA for the health of all Palestinians under its civil administration.\n Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told CNN: \"If we'll get to the situation where everyone in the country who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated, we will be more than ready to share the vaccines with our neighbors.\"\n The Palestinian Authority health minister, Dr. Mai Al-Kaileh, says they expect to get hold of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of March, but that there is no specific date set yet for their arrival. The ministry says it has contracts with four companies producing the vaccine. These vaccines will cover 70% of the Palestinian population and the WHO will provide doses for a further 20%, the PA said in a January 9 statement.\n According to Hutin, the WHO has approached rich countries, including the Gulf nations, to share their doses, and that they have complied but that it's still a work in progress.\n Abu Dhabi's Department of Health launched a local collaboration called the Hope Consortium, which is set to deliver 18 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021.\n The undersecretary at the department, Jamal Mohamed Al Kabbi told CNN's Becky Anderson that the plan represents a complete supply chain solution to address and facilitate vaccine availability across the world.\n Bernaert told CNN despite the delay in vaccinations in lower-income countries, he is more optimistic than he was a few months ago.\n \"Are we going to be able to vaccinate everyone in 2021? No, I don't think so. Is the vaccination tale going to continue in 2022, or even 2023? Yes, I think so. But what we've managed to do so far is a sign that we may be at the beginning of a new era.\"\n CNN's Mostafa Salem in Abu Dhabi, Aqeel Najm in Baghdad, Eyad Kourdi in Gaziantep, Gul Tuysuz in Istanbul, and Andrew Carey, Sam Kiley and Abeer Salman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",

        "title": "What Marco Rubio gets wrong about impeachment (it's a lot)",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Marco Rubio isn't a big fan of the House's decision to impeach former President Donald Trump over the incitement of rioters who overran the US Capitol on January 6.\n \"Waste of time impeachment isn't about accountability,\" the Florida Republican senator tweeted on Tuesday morning. \"It's about demands from vengeance from the radical left. And a new 'show' for the 'Political Entertainment Industry.'\"\n Now, it's not clear whether Rubio actually believes that or whether he is simply posturing to appeal to the pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party as he contemplates another fun for president in 2024. (Maybe it's a little of both!)\n But either way, he's wrong.\n Here's the thing: There is a legitimate argument to be made as to whether impeaching a former president is Constitutional. (Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is expected to force a vote later Tuesday about that very thing.) The Constitution is very, very vague on that subject.\n But that's not at all what Rubio is arguing here. He is suggesting that the reason for an impeachment trial next month in the Senate will be because of \"demands from vengeance from the radical left.\"\n Which, well, here's the thing: The reason that the House impeached Trump because he egged on his supporters at a massive rally in Washington earlier this month that eventually led to the violent occupation of the Capitol.\n \"You'll never take back our country with weakness,\" Trump told the crowd on January 6. \"You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.\"\n Trump also used the words \"fight\" and \"fighting\" more than a dozen times in that address. So yeah, message received.\n Rubio must also be unfamiliar with the fact that 10 Republicans -- including Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in House leadership -- voted for the impeachment of Trump. And that even Mitch McConnell, the leader of Senate Republicans, has assiduously avoided taking a position on whether he could see himself voting to convict the former president.\n Does the liberal left loathe Trump? And do they believe the Senate should not only vote to convict him but also ban him from ever running for federal office again? Absolutely! Is that the same thing as suggesting, as Rubio does, that the reason for the impeachment trial is because of a desire for \"vengeance\" from liberals and the media's never-ending desire for drama -- or something? Nope.\n What sits at the heart of the effort to decide what to do with Trump isn't vengeance. It's accountability.\n The question before the Senate is whether it's OK for a sitting president to act the way Trump did on January 6. (It wasn't just what he told the crowd before the Capitol storming; it was his delayed and lukewarm responses amid the violence.)\n The Constitutional vagueness may allow some (many?) Republican senators to sidestep that fundamental question, voting to \"acquit\" because Trump isn't in office anymore and removing him is pointless.\n But what Rubio is doing is simply irresponsible -- and the same sort of rhetoric that hatched the mentality of January 6. This isn't about Democrats or the media. This is about Donald Trump and how a president should act.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)Senators were sworn in for the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid an immediate challenge to the constitutionality of the trial from a Republican ally of the former President.\n Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a procedural vote on the constitutionality of the trial Tuesday afternoon, in what amounted to the first test of how Senate Republicans view the upcoming trial, the substance of which will begin with arguments next month. The Senate voted to table, or kill, Paul's point of order, 55 to 45, with just five Republicans joining Democrats to vote against dismissing the trial.\n The five Republicans who voted against Paul were Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.\n The Kentucky Republican said Tuesday that he forced the procedural vote to show there already aren't sufficient votes to convict Trump, which would require two-thirds of senators. Many Republicans have taken the position in recent days that the trial is not constitutional because Trump is no longer President, in what's become the most common argument to acquit Trump.\n \"I think it showed that impeachment is dead on arrival,\" Paul said after the vote. \"If you voted it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?\"\n LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Biden presidency and Trump impeachment trial\n Tuesday's test vote showed that it's likely next-to-impossible for Democrats to find 17 Republican votes for the two-thirds needed to convict and bar Trump from running for office again. Several Republicans said they were surprised Tuesday they were already taking a vote on the constitutionality of the trial, as the question is something that both the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team are likely to address in their presentations next month.\n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said he's going into the trial with an open mind about Trump's guilt, voted with Paul on Tuesday, suggesting he has constitutional concerns about the trial.\n The trial began Tuesday afternoon with the swearing in of Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, the Senate president pro tempore, who will preside over the trial. Leahy then swore in the rest of the Senate, and senators went four at a time to sign an \"oath book\" as jurors for the trial.\n David Carle, a spokesman for Leahy, said Tuesday evening that the senator was not feeling well after performing his duties and was taken to a local hospital.\n \"This evening, Senator Leahy was in his Capitol office and was not feeling well. He was examined in the Capitol by the Attending Physician,\" Carle said in a statement. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated.\"\n The Senate passed its pre-trial organizing resolution, laying out the rules heading into the trial, 83-17, before the Senate adjourned as a \"court of impeachment\" until February 9, when the trial arguments are scheduled to begin.\n At their party lunch Tuesday ahead of Paul's planned vote, Senate Republicans hosted conservative legal scholar Jonathan Turley, one of the lead scholars arguing that impeaching Trump when he is out of office is unconstitutional.\n Turley has written extensively in recent days about his belief that while reasonable people can disagree about whether or not it is constitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a former President, he wrote recently on his blog, \"even if the Senate does not view this as extraconstitutional, it should view this trial as Constitutionally unsound.\"\n Given the limited language in the Constitution on impeachment, legal experts disagree about whether the Senate can convict a former president. But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional, because the Senate has held trials previously for former officials.\n Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, charged that Republicans were fixated on the constitutional issue because \"they don't want to be held accountable for President Trump's incitement of a mob to attack the United States Capitol.\"\n \"They don't want to be held accountable on that vote so they're going to try to make it another argument that is all about the Constitution,\" Durbin said.\n Several Senate Republicans say they agree it's constitutional, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said her review \"has led me to conclude that it is constitutional, in recognizing that impeachment is not solely about removing a president, it is also a matter of political consequence.\"\n Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who just won reelection, said Tuesday, \"I think there's probably a constitutional basis for it.\"\n \"I have more problem with the process and the expedited nature of it,\" he added.\n Several Republicans have pointed to the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding over the trial, while the Constitution says the chief justice should preside for the trial of a president.\n \"That would send a pretty clear signal to me what Roberts thinks of the whole thing,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, who declined to say how he would vote on Paul's motion.\n On Monday, the House impeachment managers, a group of Democratic lawmakers who will act as prosecutors presenting the case against Trump during the trial, delivered the single article of impeachment to the Senate. The article, approved by the Democrat-led House, charges Trump with incitement of insurrection for provoking the attack on the US Capitol that left multiple people dead.\n The two-week break until the trial begins will give both sides more time to prepare for the trial. Trump is still hiring lawyers for his impeachment legal defense team, which is being led by South Carolina lawyer Butch Bowers.\n As the House impeachment managers put together their plans for the trial, they are considering using a variety of video evidence to show how the rioters were responding to Trump's own words when they breached the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.\n The impeachment managers are still wading through the huge amount of video that exists from January 6 to determine what they should use at the trial, the sources said, including video posted to the conservative social media site Parler. The House's impeachment team has taken an interest in a 10-minute video compilation from the national security forum Just Security, which uses social media posts from rioters on Facebook and Parler to illustrate how they were reacting in real-time to Trump's comments at the January 6 rally as well as Trump's social media posts when they attacked the Capitol.\n No decisions have been finalized about how to use the video. The Washington Post first reported on the impeachment managers' interest in the Just Security clip.\n At the first Trump impeachment trial, House impeachment managers also used video to bolster their case that Trump had pushed for Ukraine's help to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden. The use of video for the upcoming trial is even more compelling given the disturbing images and video that have emerged of rioters ransacking the Capitol and attacking police officers.\n The transmission of the article typically triggers a quick start to an impeachment trial, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and McConnell reached a deal last week to push back the start date for the substance of the proceedings. That move will give Democrats more time to confirm Biden's Cabinet and potentially take up a new Covid-19 relief bill while Trump's defense team will have more time to prepare for trial.\n It remains to be seen how long the trial will last, whether the House impeachment managers will seek witnesses and what the exact contours of the President's legal defense will be.\n When the trial gets underway, one visible difference between the proceedings and Trump's first impeachment trial will be that instead of Roberts, the president pro tempore of the Senate, Leahy, will preside.\n It would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict Trump, a high bar to clear that looks increasingly unlikely to happen as a number of Senate Republicans are already arguing that it's illogical and may be unconstitutional to impeach a former president.\n Under the agreement reached by Schumer and McConnell, several ceremonial functions of the trial will take place this week. On Tuesday, the Senate is also expected to issue a summons to Trump, another step in the process of organizing for the trial to kick into high gear.\n Then the trial will effectively be put on hold as the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial to begin in earnest.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)A court in India has ruled that groping a child through their clothing does not constitute sexual assault, drawing outrage across the country and frustrating campaigners battling to address widespread sexual abuse against women and children.\n In a judgment last week, Bombay High Court judge Pushpa Ganediwala found that a 39-year-old man was not guilty of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl as he had not removed her clothes, meaning there was no skin-on-skin contact.\n According to court documents, the man brought the child to his house on the pretext of giving her guava in December 2016. While there, he touched her chest and tried to remove her underwear, according to the judgment.\n He was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to three years in prison in a lower court, but then appealed to the High Court.\n In her judgment on January 19, Justice Ganediwala found that his act \"would not fall in the definition of 'sexual assault,'\" which carries a minimum three year prison term which can be extended to five years.\n \"Considering the stringent nature of punishment provided for the offense, in the opinion of this court, stricter proof and serious allegations are required,\" she wrote. India's Protection of Children From Sexual Offenses Act 2012 does not explicitly state that skin-on-skin contact is needed to constitute the crime of sexual assault.\n Justice Ganediwala acquitted the accused of sexual assault but convicted him on the lesser charge of molestation and sentenced him to one year in prison.\n \"It is the basic principle of criminal jurisprudence that the punishment for an offense shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the crime,\" she said.\n The National Commission for Women said it planned to mount a legal challenge to the judgment, which it said will have a \"cascading effect on various provisions involving safety and security of women.\"\n Karuna Nundy, a lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, the country's top court, called for judges who passed judgments that were \"completely contrary to established law\" and basic rights to be retrained.\n \"Judgments like this contribute to impunity in crimes against girls,\" she tweeted.\n Ranjana Kumari, the director of non-profit Centre for Social Research, which advocates for women's rights in India, said the judgment is \"shameful, outrageous, shocking and devoid of judicial prudence.\"\n Sexual assault is huge issue in India, where sexual crimes are often brutal and widespread, but are often poorly dealt with under the country's justice system. Based on official figures from 2018, the rape of a woman is reported every 16 minutes.\n Following a high-profile case in 2012 when a 23-year-old student was raped and murdered on a New Delhi bus, legal reforms and more severe penalties were introduced.\n Those included fast track courts to move rape cases through the justice system swiftly, an amended definition of rape to include anal and oral penetration, and the publication of new government guidelines intended to do away with the two-finger test which purportedly assessed whether a woman had sexual intercourse recently.\n But high-profile rape cases have continued to hit headlines. Last year, number of cases sparked outrage, including the case of a 13-year-old girl who was raped and found strangled to death in a field, and an 86-year-old woman who was allegedly raped while she waited for the milkman.\n Activists have pointed to ongoing issues in the justice system. Under India's legal system, for instance, sexually abusing a transgender person carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.\n CNN's Swati Gupta and Manveena Suri contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Biden plans to reopen Obamacare enrollment",
        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden is expected to reopen enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges on Thursday as part of a series of executive actions related to health care, taking a step to help uninsured Americans that his predecessor rejected.\n It will be Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.\n Open enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the Trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on December 15. But Biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies, under a special enrollment period.\n Former President Donald Trump refused to do so last year, despite heavy lobbying from elected officials of both parties and the health care industry. Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame.\n Biden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.\n He has signed 33 measures in his first six days, including mandating masks on federal property, reversing Trump's ban on transgender Americans joining the military, providing additional nutrition assistance and accelerating the manufacturing and delivery of supplies for vaccination and testing.\n On Tuesday, his actions focused on equity, including creating a police commission and promoting equitable housing policies. Wednesday is scheduled to center on combating climate change, according to a draft calendar document viewed by CNN.\n Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.\n Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.\n Anyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. Enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the Trump administration said in June.\n Also, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to Medicaid. Between February and August, Medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late December.\n During the most recent open enrollment period, overall Obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under Trump. But the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.\n The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.\n The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appear to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.\n Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.\n Thursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act and roll back Trump administration health care actions.\n Among Biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.\n The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.\n Biden will also likely want to reverse various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.\n Biden's health care officials are also expected to focus on Medicaid.\n The Trump administration made many historic changes to the health insurance program for low-income Americans, in line with Republicans' long-standing wish list. Officials allowed states to introduce work requirements and just approved Tennessee's request to shift its federal Medicaid funding to a type of block grant.\n The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.\n These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.\n Also, Congress has limited states' ability to trim their Medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. The Biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.\n CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

But the real future for dramatizing the Trump years likely resides in the former President's preferred medium, TV.\n For those who have been paying close attention -- and a lot of people were -- there does seem to have been a certain inevitability to Trump's tenure ending as tumultuously as it began. As New York Times reporter Peter Baker says in \"American Carnage,\" the events that unfolded in January were \"mind-boggling ... and yet, wholly predictable.\"\n The well-documented arc of those years -- already presented in numerous bestselling books and documentaries and one scripted miniseries, \"The Comey Rule\" -- underscores why the pop-culture aftermath of the Trump years probably won't resemble the last administration to which the Trump scandals have often been compared, Richard Nixon's.\n Nixon's resignation in 1974 yielded the blockbuster book, \"All the President's Men,\" and a movie adaptation two years later. It also triggered what amounted to a golden age for paranoid conspiracy thrillers in the latter half of the 1970s, movies like \"The Parallax View\" and \"Three Days of the Condor.\"\n The entertainment world, however, moved at a different pace back then. There wasn't real-time reporting on the internet or streaming channels to pounce on a story as juicy as this one. Even the TV miniseries was still in its infancy, before \"Roots,\" in 1977, demonstrated its colossal ratings power.\n The end of the Trump years, by contrast, has had to compete in our imaginations with over-the-top portrayals of Washington, from \"House of Cards\" to \"Veep\" to the presidential corruption featured in \"24\" and \"Homeland.\"\n Cultural critics and Hollywood creative types have joked about the Trump administration giving those writers a run for their money, \"They're either taking from our show or doing their own version of it,\" \"Veep\" executive producer David Mandel told Politico.\n The HBO series was hardly alone in its cynical view of politics. The movie business, meanwhile, has significantly changed in terms of the kind of films that reliably attract audiences and has been damaged to a still-unknown degree by the fallout from the coronavirus.\n The 1970s movies mentioned above, along with similar titles like \"Marathon Man\" and \"Capricorn One,\" were hits in their day but would be hard-pressed to compete with the blockbuster-driven world of superhero sequels, \"Star Wars\" and the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise.\n Inevitably, the Trump years will still be dissected and dramatized. The first exposure for most of those projects, though, will likely be in living rooms, catering to smaller audiences.\n Writing in Esquire, Chris Nashawaty noted that films in the 1970s reflected the anxiety of the times, when \"messy truths weren't dismissed as bitter medicine and box-office poison.\" While TV has filled \"that vacuum\" for such fare, he lamented that the movie business no longer possesses much appetite for it.\n In \"American Carnage,\" the narration describes the Trump presidency and its violent end as \"a crisis in plain sight for his party, his country, democracy.\" Those elements certainly provide the stuff of great drama, with various books already painting vivid portraits of what transpired behind the scenes.\n Yet while stories of the Trump years will be told and retold, as opposed to the post-Watergate movies, look for them on HBO or streaming or expanded into four-part docuseries and multi-episode limited series. Indeed, there are already plans for one of the latter about the UK response to coronavirus, with Kenneth Branagh cast as Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n That approach might deprive future generations of the memorable theatrical movies that Watergate helped inspire. But in terms of how and where we get our entertainment now, it's very much a sign of the times.\n \"Frontline: Trump's American Carnage\" premieres January 26 at 10 p.m. ET on PBS.",

        "body_text": "London (CNN Business)The pandemic could slam the brakes on a global economic turnaround this year despite mass vaccination programs and unprecedented levels of stimulus, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n The IMF expects the global economy to grow by 5.5% this year, it said on Tuesday, or 0.3 percentage points faster than its previous forecast in October. The upgrade reflects \"expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity later in the year and additional policy support in a few large economies,\" the group said. (The IMF estimates that the world economy shrank by 3.5% in 2020, its biggest peacetime contraction since the Great Depression.)\n But it also warned that surging infections in late 2020, renewed lockdowns and logistical problems with vaccine distribution could hamstring growth. If new variants of the coronavirus also prove difficult to contain, global output this year would be 0.75% less than the IMF expects.\n Looking further ahead, the IMF expects global growth to slow to 4.2% in 2022.\n \"Much now depends on the outcome of this race between a mutating virus and vaccines to end the pandemic, and on the ability of policies to provide effective support until that happens,\" Gita Gopinath, chief economist of the IMF, said in a blog post.\n Some countries will recover more quickly than others. China, which was the only major economy to grow in 2020, is forecast to achieve growth of 8.1% this year. The United States should emerge from its deep slump to expand by 5.1%, a pace that's 2 percentage points faster than the IMF predicted in October.\n The 19 countries that use the euro are expected to see growth of 4.2% in 2021. The United Kingdom, which endured a 10% contraction last year as it left the European Union and is now battling a new coronavirus variant, would rebound with relatively modest growth of 4.5%.\n \"The wide divergence reflects to an important extent differences across countries in behavioral and public health responses to infections, flexibility and adaptability of economic activity to low mobility, preexisting trends, and structural rigidities entering the crisis,\" the IMF said.\n The pandemic is causing \"exceptional uncertainty,\" according to the IMF.\n \"Although new restrictions following the surge in infections (particularly in Europe) suggest growth could be weaker than projected in early 2021, other factors pull the distribution of risks in the opposite direction,\" the IMF said.\n If the vaccine distribution and efficacy go smoothly, for example, output could exceed expectations by as much as 1% globally, with companies hiring and expanding capacity in anticipation of rising demand.",

        "title": "In-person learning during the pandemic is possible with the right precautions, CDC researchers say",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Many parents and caregivers remain worried about the safety of their children in schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, but experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that with the right mitigation measures, there is a path to low-risk, in-person learning.\n Experts have stressed the importance of in-person learning for students' development and access to essential services. On the other hand, Covid-19 case, hospitalization and death rates remain high across the nation.\n In an effort to strike the right balance, schools have adopted varying approaches that include in-person learning, online learning and a hybrid of the two.\n In a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, CDC researchers noted that the kind of spread seen in crowded offices and long-term care facilities has not been reported in schools. In-school transmission has occurred, but the researchers said there is little evidence that it contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.\n \"Committing today to policies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in communities and in schools will help ensure the future social and academic welfare of all students and their education,\" the researchers wrote in the JAMA paper.\n Two new studies from the CDC published Tuesday in agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report demonstrate that with the right precautions, children can return to school safely.\n In the first study, researchers looked at data on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, that conducted in-person learning last fall. They found lower Covid-19 case rates than in the community at large, and few cases of in-school transmission.\n Of 5,530 students and staff, 191 tested positive for Covid-19. The researchers found that Covid-19 case rates in schools were 37% lower than in the surrounding community.\n Contact tracing and investigation determined that seven of those 191 cases -- 3.7%, all among students -- were contracted in school. Three of the seven students who tested positive were from one elementary school class.\n The schools did not conduct routine Covid-19 screening, but they implemented mitigation measures.\n For example, students were each provided with three to five double- or triple-layer cloth masks. Masks were required in schools, and statewide, more than 92% of students of all age groups wore them.\n Cohorts of 11 to 20 students from the same grade level met for classes and lunch indoors, where students were often seated next to the same person. Cohorts were asked not to mix, and the researchers found no in-school transmission between different cohorts.\n Staff were told to mask, social distance and limit time in shared indoor spaces. If a student was out of school with Covid-19 symptoms, their siblings were also told to stay home.\n When a student or staff member tested positive for the virus, school officials used interviews to identify close contacts -- anyone who was within 6 feet of the person for longer than 15 minutes over the course of 24 hours. Those close contacts were required to quarantine at home, and if they developed symptoms during that time, officials investigated whether in-school spread was the cause.\n The team says their findings suggest that even with varying positivity rates in the community, students are not necessarily at increased risk for the virus if they attend in-person classes. In fact, they say that being in a monitored environment such as the classroom may increase adherence to public health measures.\n Extracurricular activities, such as indoor sports, may be another story, according to a separate CDC report published Tuesday.\n Two Florida high school wrestling matches became superspreader events in December when 54 of the 130 attendees -- wrestlers, coaches and referees -- were tested for Covid-19, and 38 were positive. Among 91 close contacts of infected people, 43% tested positive for the virus. One contact, who was over agef 50, died.\n It is not possible to maintain physical distancing in the high-contact sport, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against mask wearing while wrestling because it poses a choking hazard.\n After calculating the amount of time everyone involved had to quarantine and isolate, the researchers estimated there were 1,700 in-person school days lost due to the outbreak -- a number they say would likely have been higher if the outbreak had not occurred so close to the end of the semester.\n \"Outbreaks among athletes participating in high contact sports can impact in-person learning for all students and increase risk for secondary in-school and community transmission with potentially severe outcomes including death,\" the researchers wrote.",

        "title": "Biden should look beyond leverage to rejoin the Iran deal",
        "body_text": "Ellie Geranmayeh is a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Yar Batmanghelidj is the founder and CEO of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n (CNN)President Joe Biden took office at a moment of global crisis, and tensions with Iran are among his most pressing foreign-policy challenges. After four years of nonstop hostility between Washington and Tehran, the first weeks of his presidency could determine the level of danger moving forward.\n President Donald Trump famously yanked the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal despite the fact that Iran was abiding by its terms, and European allies fiercely opposed the move. He ordered the killing of a top Iranian general and sustained a \"maximum pressure\" campaign of unparalleled financial sanctions against Iran. Soon after his election loss to Biden, Trump reportedly asked advisers for options to strike Iran militarily. That Trump's presidency concluded without open US-Iran conflict may be lucky for everyone.\n Biden has stated an intent to rejoin the nuclear deal, while also signaling he hopes a more expansive agreement can be reached soon after. If he is serious about a diplomatic course correction on Iran that contains its nuclear activities, his administration needs to move fast in doing so.\n As part of its response to mounting pressure from the Trump administration, Iran recently announced it will enrich uranium at more than five times the rate permitted under the nuclear deal. It also has threatened to restrict access to international inspectors if economic sanctions rallied by the Trump administration are not eased.\n As the UN's atomic watchdog chief warned on Jan. 11, there is a matter of weeks rather than months to salvage the nuclear deal.\n Most importantly, Biden should steer clear of the fallacy that President Trump's flawed policy of maximum-pressure sanctions provides the US with ample leverage and time to skip over the nuclear deal and squeeze more concessions from Iran. As the future of the nuclear accord was debated during confirmation hearings for Biden's top appointees, some senators and observers argued just that. They suggest that even if Trump was wrong to pull America out of the deal, his successor could benefit from the \"leverage\" that Trump-era sanctions created, to force a broader deal that not only further restricts Iran's nuclear activities but also curtails Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups in the Middle East. Trump had squeezed Iran's economy to such an extent that its leaders are willing to make more concessions than they had in 2015, the logic goes.\n But it is unclear why Tehran, having resisted similar maximalist demands under Trump and having already absorbed heavy costs of US sanctions, would be willing to make a deal with Biden under such terms.\n Those arguing to maintain sanctions wrongly claim that the Iranian economy is in such dire straits that Tehran will be forced to capitulate. Against the backdrop of unprecedented sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic, Iran's economy has demonstrated resilience to external shocks and will likely limp along. Recent projections from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Institute of International Finance predict Iran will achieve growth rates of anywhere from 1.5% to 3.2% this year even if sanctions remain in place. As at least one Trump official admitted, there are so many sanctions on Iran that they've become an exhausted tool.\n At this stage, maximum pressure is delivering dismal marginal returns. Iran's non-oil economy, which accounts for more than 85% of GDP according to Iranian government statistics, can grow under sanctions given both significant non-oil export revenue and also Iran's massive domestic market. Plus, China has continued to buy Iranian oil in defiance of US sanctions, according to the US government, The New York Times, and others.\n Low levels of growth will not fully alleviate the fiscal pressure facing Iran's government nor the weakness of the Iranian currency, but would mark a significant improvement after three years of steep contraction. The expectation that Iran's economy will return to growth this year has already seen the Iranian rial gain more than 9% against the dollar since the beginning of January.\n Not only is Iran retooling its economy to sustain US sanctions, but the maximum pressure campaign has reinforced hardline security logic in Iran that means the country's leaders are unlikely to cave. Iran's leadership and public alike are increasingly skeptical of any promises that sanctions will be eased \u2014 even under the Obama administration, which concluded the nuclear deal that saw much of the US sanctions regime rolled back, the hesitancy of international banks to transact with Iran stymied economic growth. Iran is unlikely to expand the scope of negotiations beyond the nuclear accord until it can have more confidence that a lifting of US sanctions would deliver real benefits.\n If Biden intends to contain Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy, he should make concrete economic relief felt on the Iranian streets. The cost of US sanctions have so far been felt most by ordinary Iranians, who have been hit with high inflation. The worsening economic situation did not lead to regime collapse or capitulation as the Trump administration had bet on, but instead contributed to low election turnout in Iran and protests that were met with brutal force by the security apparatus. Public sentiments around diplomacy with the West are much more negative than when the nuclear deal was first agreed. The Trump experience has given ammunition to hardline camps inside Iran to argue the US will never negotiate in good faith.\n If Biden adopts a gung-ho approach to renegotiating the deal, instead of honoring America's international commitments, Iranian proponents for talks won't have a leg to stand on.\n In reality, the leverage argument is a fig leaf for a continued maximum pressure policy that has backfired on US security interests. It produced an expanded Iranian nuclear program and escalation in the Middle East. If Biden is seen to be holding back from sanctions relief to drive a hard bargain, Tehran will likely continue to build up leverage of its own.\n In response to the November assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist, widely suspected to have been perpetrated by Israel, Iran passed legislation that could restrict international oversight of its nuclear facilities if Western sanctions aren't eased by late February. Iran's leap to 20% uranium enrichment this month signals it is not bluffing. Unless Iran's leaders see early signs that Washington is serious about a deal, they are likely to escalate further.\n Iran has also been explicit that it will not renegotiate the nuclear agreement or broaden it to restrict Iran's regional activities or missile capabilities. While Iranian officials have not shut the door to wider diplomacy with the West, the implementation of the nuclear deal is clearly a necessary prelude to any broader negotiations.\n As such, Biden should focus on a two-step approach toward diplomacy with Iran. First, the US and Iran should agree on technical steps required for mutual compliance with the nuclear deal, cool regional tensions and build confidence. A second step will then be for the US -- together with European allies -- to pivot toward follow-up talks that could give both Iran and the West greater benefits.\n The US can keep Iran walking the path of diplomacy not by sustaining Trump's sanctions, but by reentering the deal and restoring its ability to snap sanctions back into place in the future if Iran violates its obligations or blocks follow-up talks.\n By providing the sanctions relief required of the US under the nuclear deal it agreed to, the Biden administration can restore confidence that America sticks to its words as well as create an opportunity cost for Iran in the future. Today's incentives are tomorrow's leverage. And if Biden gives diplomacy with Iran a real shot, he may find he won't need that leverage after all.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration's pause on deportations Tuesday, delivering a blow to one of the administration's first immigration actions.\n The early defeat, even if temporary, demonstrates the limits of President Joe Biden's executive actions, which are expected to be challenged in court.\n Tuesday's order stems from a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenging the 100-day pause on deportations, which took effect Friday. The complaint cited in part an agreement signed between the Department of Homeland Security and Texas in the waning days of the Trump presidency that required the department to consult the state before changing or modifying policies.\n Judge Drew Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, however, said the temporary restraining order was appropriate under the Administrative Procedure Act. Tipton blocked the Biden administration from executing its deportation pause for 14 days.\n Tipton, appointed by President Donald Trump, also found that Texas could be harmed if the moratorium were to continue. \"In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the threat of injury to Texas outweighs any potential harm to Defendants and the public interest is served and protected by the issuance of this TRO,\" he wrote.\n The moratorium has only been in place for five days.\n The White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment on the ruling.\n Paxton applauded the ruling, saying in a statement: \"The Court's decision to stop the Biden Administration from casting aside congressionally enacted immigration laws is a much-needed remedy for DHS's unlawful action. A near-complete suspension of deportations would only serve to endanger Texans and undermine federal law.\"\n Biden's first days in office have been marked by the release of his ambitious immigration agenda, but the ruling has whiplashed immigration attorneys, who just days earlier were trying to make sense of the new memo.\n \"In a word: unbelievable. Despite the limited nature of the TRO grant (a two week pause of the pause), the decision is breathtakingly wrong,\" said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney based in North Carolina and the American Immigration Lawyers Association first vice president.\n The Biden moratorium covers most deportations but excludes individuals who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, have waived rights to remain in the US or who've been determined removable by the acting director, according to an agency memo.\n Just as swiftly as the new memo took effect, so came a legal challenge from Paxton.\n The Republican led an attempt to void Biden's Electoral College victory last month and will be a constant presence in federal court attempting to block the Biden administration's policies on immigration.\n During the Trump administration, Paxton also led a lawsuit challenging the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. The case is ongoing. He is also at the head of the latest lawsuit at the Supreme Court challenging the Affordable Care Act.\n The case over the deportation pause has moved quickly.\n On Monday, Tipton asked the Biden administration to clarify its moratorium after Texas submitted a Fox News report to the court that cited an internal email instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to \"release them all, immediately.\"\n The Justice Department submitted the correspondence, which originated in the Houston field office, on Monday afternoon. An official appears to notify the workforce about the moratorium announced the previous day, telling them to \"stop all removals\" as of midnight, but that email is later followed by another official calling for the directive to be retracted immediately.\n \"Please direct your supervisors to follow the memorandum issued. Operational guidance is being developed and will be issued in the coming days,\" the email stated, adding: \"Any questions on removals, releases, and/or arrests that we cannot determine fit squarely into the directive will be forwarded up through me to HQ for further discussion and decisions.\"\n The Justice Department also told the court that some undocumented immigrants with removal orders had been released from custody, but as part of separate litigation relating to Covid-19. DHS has discretion in who it releases, the Justice Department added.\n \"There are going to be times that the Department of Homeland Security uses its discretion in manners that Texas disagrees... Texas has different views about immigration policy than the current administration,\" said DOJ attorney Adam Kirschner.\n The Justice Department is likely to appeal the ruling.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

The woman told police that one of the times Shiflett choked her to the point that she couldn't breathe, and she felt like she was going to die.\n The woman told police she slapped Shiflett in self-defense and he slapped her back and admitted to choking her, the affidavit said.\n A background check run by Northern York County Regional Police conducted for Shiflett produced an active warrant for his arrest for theft. He was immediately taken into custody, according to the affidavit.\n Shiflett was arrested on January 10, charged with simple assault, along with making terroristic threats, harassment and one count of strangulation. His initial court appearance occurred January 19 and he is being held on $20,000 bail, according to court documents filed in York County Magisterial District Court.\n CNN has reached out to Shiflett and Walt Disney World for comment, but at the time of publishing, it has not heard back from either party.",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business)Michelle Bennett is trying to keep life inside her Waldorf, Maryland, home as normal as possible during Covid-19. Three of her four daughters are learning remotely, while she makes them three meals a day. But outside, the relentless threat of eviction keeps knocking.\n She lost her job as a receptionist at a doctors' office in March and hasn't been able to collect unemployment because she is waiting to be approved for disability. It's by the grace of a court-ordered stay that she can remain in her home while she fights the eviction through appeal.\n \"I'm basically living in fear because I don't want to be homeless,\" said Michelle Bennett. \"I don't really have anywhere to go without an income during the pandemic.\"\n The eviction crisis is just one of the economic disasters the Biden administration needs to tackle -- it's also staring down massive unemployment and a growing hunger problem. Even with the proposition of a historic $1.9 trillion relief package, President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to get the economy back to where it was before the pandemic.\n Last week, Biden signed an executive order extending a ban on evictions through the end of March. Despite the ban, it doesn't help Bennett, whose lawyer says her landlord is using a legal loophole that is growing common during the pandemic.\n Bennett is a month-to-month tenant and failure to pay rent means she has technically outstayed her lease. Landlords are filing evictions as \"tenant hold overs\" -- when renters remain in a property after the lease expires. Many judges are ruling in favor of the landlords despite the extenuating circumstances and federal and state evictions bans, according to Maryland Legal Aid.\n \"A loophole has been created that allows landlords to continue evicting tenants that cannot pay rent\" said Nicole Portnov, a lawyer with Maryland Legal Aid, representing Bennett. \"Ms. Bennett is a quintessential example of this phenomenon, and in Ms. Bennett's case this has led to the use of a relatively seldom used eviction statute to put people in the street during a pandemic.\"\n An Emergency Rental Assistance program was created under the Trump administration to help renters like Bennett, but she says she was unable to apply because the funds dried up.\n \"When you call it's like -- no money. Or call back next month, maybe there'll be money then. And then you call back the next month is still 'oh we're out of money,'\" said Bennett.\n President Biden proposed about $30 billion in additional rental assistance to renters and small landlords as part of his Covid-19 relief plan. He also wants to extend the eviction moratorium until the end of September.\n \"I'm not asking for a handout, I'm just trying to keep me and my kids together,\" said Bennett, who has not been able to find another job. \"We're in a FEMA like situation -- we don't have a flood or hurricane -- but were in a pandemic.\"\n Weekly unemployment claims are hovering near 1 million. Last month, the economy shed jobs for the first time since April, and women were hit the hardest: Of the total, a net 156,000 jobs were lost by women, and 16,000 were gained by men.\n \"It's maddening, it's frustrating, it's defeating,\" said Gabbie Riley.\n In March, Riley was furloughed from her sales job at the Loews Hotel in Minneapolis, with the hope it would return. The leisure and hospitality industry has lost more jobs than any other US industry since the pandemic began.\n \"I don't know how I can describe it. I was the one that put in the work...and to know that I just had to hand that off to the men is a lot to process,\" said Riley who detailed her story in op-ed for CNN the day before she found out she was laid off.\n As a single mother, Riley can no longer afford health insurance for her and her 19 year-old son. She's on unemployment, but says her savings is keeping her family afloat.\n As part of his Covid-19 relief plan, Biden plans to extend enhanced unemployment benefits, increasing them from $300 a week to $400. But what Riley really wants is her career back.\n \"Two years ago this week, I was accepting an award in front of 500 people for the 'Hotel Rep of the Year - East' - earned from industry client and peer nominations and voting. This year I am unemployed trying to figure out what comes next.  A total 180,\" she said.\n On a recent Friday afternoon, the line for food at The Campaign Against Hunger in Brooklyn, New York, stretched down a city block. The scene repeats seven days a week.\n Since the beginning of the pandemic, this Brooklyn food bank alone has served 1.4 million people -- made possible, in part, from government funding that is drying up fast.\n \"I don't know what I'm going to do because I still have food to buy,\" said Melony Samuels, Executive Director of The Campaign Against Hunger. \"I need assurance from all our policymakers that listen, you started, we need to finish this thing.  We started helping families, we can't leave them in thin air.\"\n Last week, President Biden signed an executive order addressing the growing hunger crisis by asking the Department of Agriculture to increase the value of special pandemic food stamp benefits 15%. The extra benefit gives money to low-income families to cover the cost of missing meals in school. But as the need for food grows, many Americans will fall through the cracks.\n \"Many people are not eligible for SNAP (food stamps), but they're here because they're not eligible and they still cannot make ends meet,\" said Samuels. \"SNAP needs to be fixed and money needs to be in the budget directly to food pantries, food banks that are actually working on the ground.\"\n -- CNN's Kate Trafecante contributed to this report",

        "title": "White people are getting vaccinated at higher rates than Black and Latino Americans",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Black and Latino Americans are receiving the Covid-19 vaccine at significantly lower rates than White people -- a disparity that health advocates blame on the federal government and hospitals not prioritizing equitable access.\n A CNN analysis of data from 14 states found vaccine coverage is twice as high among White people on average than it is among Black and Latino people. The analysis found that on average, more than 4% of the White population has received a Covid-19 vaccine, about 2.3 times higher than the Black population (1.9% covered) and 2.6 times higher than the Hispanic population (1.8% covered).\n CNN's findings come as the government struggles with vaccine supply shortages and a chaotic rollout that has caused delays in vaccinating the elderly.  The federal government has recommended that states open up vaccination to more groups of people, including everyone 65 and older. Initial guidance from the CDC had suggested health care workers and elderly in long-term facilities be the first to receive the vaccine.\n Health experts and advocates say the federal government can help alleviate the disparities by strengthening partnerships with leaders and churches in Black and Latino communities -- and be intentional about not leaving people of color out of vaccination efforts.\n Hospitals, for example, must ensure their entire workforce, including the food and maintenance staff, receive all correspondence about signing up to get the vaccine, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n Black, Latino and Asian Americans make up 41% of health care workers while 59% are White, according to Kaiser. And the majority of workers in long-term health care settings, 52%, are people of color.\n Benjamin said the vaccine also needs to be administered outside of traditional hours so people who work hourly, frontline jobs don't have to take off work. Communities, he said, should consider a plan for transporting poor families without vehicles to health facilities to get the vaccine.\n \"You have to say, 'I want to make sure everyone gets this,'\" Benjamin said. \"We have to make sure we think about all the ways that people can give in (to getting vaccinated) and we have to make sure we have vaccine available for them when they call in.\"\n Some researchers said it was alarming to have disparities so early in the process when most of the people getting vaccinated are health care workers.\n Dr. Fola May, a health equity researcher at the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity, said she would expect health care workers to be the most informed and the least hesitant about science.\n May fears this could be indicative of bigger racial gaps when the vaccine becomes widely available.\n \"I think we've botched this,\" May said. \"If we're seeing it in this population that should have the least biases against science, then when we look into the bigger populations we're going to have even fewer people who have the right information and access.\"\n In many states, the number of White people who have been vaccinated exceeds the Covid-19 case count for their racial group, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Meanwhile, Black and Latino people have fewer vaccinations than their case and death counts in some of those same states.\n For example, in Pennsylvania Black people make up 13% of Covid-19 deaths but only 3% of vaccinations.\n Pennsylvania also has the most striking disparity: White people have been vaccinated at four times the rate of Black people when accounting for the population of each racial group, the CNN analysis found.\n Andrea Custis, president and CEO of the Urban League of Philadelphia, said the vaccine data in Pennsylvania raises a \"warning flag\" about racial inequality and the federal government should address it with urgency.\n Custis said she believes the Black community is becoming less hesitant about the vaccine after seeing other Black Americans receive the shot and administer it. Last month, a Kaiser study found that more than a third of Black Americans would probably or definitely not get the vaccine if it was determined to be safe by scientists and widely available for free.\n But Custis said if the federal government allows \"trust messengers\" to help roll out the vaccine and educate the public, Black people will get the shot.\n \"The ones who are dying, the ones who need it are Black folks,\" Custis said. \"Everybody needs it, but you've got a fire going in the Black community and you need to be running to the community to vaccinate them.\"\n Black pastors and community advocates are also urging President Joe Biden's administration to act swiftly in its promise to reach communities of color with the vaccine and lean on them for help doing it.\n \"I think the biggest problem we have with the vaccine is the distribution methods and the availability,\" said Debra Fraser-Howze, founder of Choose Healthy Life -- a national group of Black pastors who are fighting the pandemic's impact on the Black community. \"All of the real estate in the community should be used.\"\n Fraser-Howze said former President Donald Trump's administration failed to partner with Black churches and trusted leaders that could help administer the vaccine and reach the people of color who qualify for the first phases but are hesitant or don't know where to get the shot. She said she is confident Choose Health Life and other Black advocacy groups could help boost the number of Black people getting vaccinated.\n Biden and his administration have released details of an ambitious national vaccination strategy with the hopes of combating concerns with vaccine access and hesitancy among people of color.\n Biden's five-point plan includes putting federally supported vaccination centers in high-risk neighborhoods, setting up mobile vaccination sites in medically underserved areas, administering the vaccine at independent pharmacies, partnering with community health centers and ensuring high risk facilities such as jails and homeless shelters have access to the vaccine.\n \"We are going to make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, in Black and Latino communities and rural communities as well,\" Biden said.\n CNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn and Priya Krishnakumar, contributed to this report.",

        "title": "'Bizarre' dinosaur Spinosaurus behaved like a giant, flightless stork, study says",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Paleontologists have long been puzzled about how the Spinosaurus -- a giant dinosaur and aquatic predator -- would have behaved.\n Now, they believe it would have been less like an otter, and more like a huge, flightless stork or heron.\n Rather than hunting fish in the water, the massive dinosaur would have likely caught prey out of the water from a position on the shoreline, researchers from Queen Mary University of London and the University of Maryland found in a study published Tuesday.\n Spinosaurs were a group of large-bodied theropods that were bigger than both Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus, growing to around 15 meters (49.2 feet) in length. These dinos lived during the Cretaceous period -- between 145.5 and 65.5 million years ago.\n The study compared Spinosaurus fossils with skulls and skeletons of dinosaurs and reptiles that lived both in and out of the water, concluding that a wading, heronlike behavior was the most likely.\n This behavior has been debated since the Spinosaurus was first discovered in 1915.\n \"Some recent studies have suggested that it was actively chasing fish in water but while they could swim, they would not have been fast or efficient enough to do this effectively,\" lead study author David Hone, senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said in a news statement.\n \"Our findings suggest that the wading idea is much better supported, even if it is slightly less exciting.\"\n Spinosaurus has proven hard to understand because it's \"a bizarre animal even by dinosaur standards, and unlike anything alive today,\" said study coauthor Tom Holtz, a paleontologist and principal lecturer at the University of Maryland's department of geology, in a statement.\n \"We sought to use what evidence we have to best approximate its way of life. And what we found did not match the attributes one would expect in an aquatic pursuit predator in the manner of an otter, sea lion, or short-necked plesiosaur.\"\n The researchers compared Spinosaurus to crocodiles in order to illustrate its relatively poor adaptation to aquatic life.\n Crocodiles are excellent in water compared to land animals, Hone said, but they can't actively chase fish.\n \"If Spinosaurus had fewer muscles on the tail, less efficiency and more drag then it's hard to see how these dinosaurs could be chasing fish in a way that crocodiles cannot,\" Hone said.\n There remains a lot to learn about Spinosaurus, said Hone, who explained that there is a lack of good fossils.\n There is still some debate as to whether there were distinct species of Spinosaurus that preferred different environments, or a single species that adapted, Hone told CNN.\n The best way to start solving some of these mysteries is to carry out more digs, said Hone, who added that there is good Spinosaurus material in Egypt, Morocco and possibly Algeria.\n The study was published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.",

        "title": "Former Army secretary says DC National Guard had no plan ahead of Capitol riot beyond local traffic control",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told a House panel on Tuesday that the National Guard only planned to deal with traffic in Washington, DC, the day the deadly US Capitol insurrection occurred, with \"no contingency\" in place if things escalated in the city, according to a copy of his prepared testimony obtained by CNN.\n But McCarthy also told Congress that alternate plans would only have happened if the US Capitol Police or local authorities in Washington requested it.\n \"114 citizen soldiers ... were spread out over 20 city blocks ... with no contingency or recall plan for a change of mission in place,\" his statement reads.\n A relatively small number of guardsmen were in DC on January 6 to assist the city's police force with traffic control in an effort to allow the local authorities to focus on anything related to demonstrations planned in the city. McCarthy's statement underscores the lack of preparedness on the part of the government and federal law enforcement agencies to aggressively respond to a crisis that day, which ultimately saw a violent attack on the Capitol that resulted in the death of five people, including a US Capitol Police officer.\n The comments from the former official come the same day acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman told the same committee that the \"department failed to meet its own high standards\" on January 6. Pittman, who apologized on behalf of her department, also told the panel the department was aware of a \"strong potential for violence\" targeting Congress and did not take the appropriate steps to prevent it.\n Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the Washington National Guard, meanwhile, is claiming his authority was restricted by the Department of Defense before the Capitol riot, a move he says prevented his forces from arriving to the attack sooner than they did, The Washington Post reported earlier Tuesday.\n Walker told the Post that authority he usually has to dispatch troops in dire situations as well as other powers were stripped from him ahead of the riot. That meant \"he couldn't immediately roll out troops when he received a panicked phone call\" from the US Capitol Police chief warning him that a crowd of then-President Donald Trump's supporters were about to breach the iconic building in an attack.\n \"All military commanders normally have immediate response authority to protect property, life, and in my case, federal functions -- federal property and life,\" Walker told the Post. \"But in this instance I did not have that authority.\"\n Asked by the newspaper how quickly his troops could have been able to arrive to the Capitol, which sits near the DC National Guard's headquarters, Walker said: \"With all deliberate speed -- I mean, they're right down the street.\"\n In the days leading up to the protest, defense officials pulled Walker's ability to deploy the 40-person quick response force (QRF) on his own, requiring instead that he seek the Army secretary's approval. In a letter from McCarthy to the Department of Justice written two days before the riot, he said the QRF could only be deployed as a last resort.\n This decision was made in the days before January 6 during the planning for what was expected to be a far less violent protest. If deployed, the QRF was only able to help with traffic control and crowd management, which were the tasks approved for Guardsmen on the street.\n Walker's call with former US Capitol Police Chief Steve Sund was at 1:49 p.m. that day, according to an official timeline of events from the defense secretary, which is 15 minutes after the Army secretary spoke to the DC mayor. The DC National Guardsmen who were already on the streets for traffic control were pulled a short time later to refit with riot gear.\n On Monday, Walker acknowledged that he does not have the authority to deploy troops on his own, even with a direct request from the mayor's office.\n \"Since I've been in charge, we've been very responsive to (DC Mayor Muriel Bowser). She provides a request, it comes to me. I conduct mission analysis. I send it to the Secretary of the Army for his approval,\" Walker said, speaking alongside the head of the National Guard Bureau Gen. Daniel Hokanson and acting Army Secretary John Whitley.\n Defense officials have acknowledged that the \"overly bureaucratic\" process required to activate and deploy the DC National Guard consumed valuable time as the riot was unfolding on Capitol Hill.\n \"There's too many people that are involved with the decision, and ultimately no one, one single person responsible,\" McCarthy told CNN last week, adding, \"It makes it very difficult and slow in the response.\"\n Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied accusations that it denied or delayed the deployment of additional troops as the riot worsened, though McCarthy said the response was hampered by an \"archaic system.\"\n The comments from Walker add to the already complicated chain of events from January 6, and could face intense scrutiny by Congress during any potential investigations into the attack and the government's preparations ahead of a rally held by Trump that day in which he, along with several others, incited the attack on the Capitol.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Ellie Kaufman, Whitney Wild, Annie Grayer and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Fact-checking 7 statistical claims from Biden's (quite factual) economic speech ",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN)President Joe Biden recited a flurry of figures in a Friday speech in which he urged Congress to pass the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package he calls the American Rescue Plan.\n We fact-checked many of the statistical claims Biden made in the speech -- and found Biden was highly factual, though there are some nuances worth noting. Here's an assessment of seven of the claims we looked into:\n Biden noted that his plan includes funding for local governments to keep critical public employees on the job; his predecessor Donald Trump and other Republicans resisted this kind of direct aid to state and local governments. Biden said: \"Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns.\"\n Biden's claim is based on official federal data about people employed in \"local government education.\" That data does indeed show a loss of more than 600,000 jobs -- 681,400 jobs, specifically -- between January 2020 and December 2020. (The data for the month of December is preliminary and might be adjusted later.) It's worth noting, though, that these numbers count everyone who is employed by local educational institutions -- including such people as cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and students who are on the payroll for various reasons -- so \"educators\" shouldn't be interpreted to mean teachers specifically.\n Biden said, \"All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the Black community by one third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent.\"\n Among other assumptions, the scholars assumed an average of 6% unemployment for 2021. That's plausible -- the December rate was 6.7%; the Federal Reserve expects a decline to 5.0% in 2021. \"These estimates are totally reasonable,\" Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, said of the numbers Biden cited. Strain added: \"The Biden plan has several provisions that would substantially increase the incomes of low-income households. You would expect this to have a significant impact on child poverty rates, and the estimates produced in this report are very reasonable.\"\n Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, said \"their assumptions seem reasonable and they are known for doing careful analysis.\"\n You can click here for a summary of what is in Biden's plan. It includes additional direct payments, increased unemployment benefits, billions in rental assistance and food assistance, billions for child care, an increase to the child tax credit, and an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour.\n Biden touted an executive order that seeks to ensure people can still receive unemployment benefits if they turn down a job offer because they think the job will put them or their families at risk from Covid-19. He said, \"Right now, approximately 40 percent of households in America have at least one member with a pre-existing condition.\"\n A Gallup poll in November found that 48% of respondents said they or a family member living with them had a pre-existing condition, Gallup told CNN. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in 2019 that 45% of non-elderly families had at least one non-elderly adult member with a pre-existing condition. If you include people age 65 and older in the analysis, Cox noted, the figure would be even higher.\n Speaking about the US coronavirus crisis, Biden said, \"We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000.\"\n There were more than 413,000 US coronavirus deaths as of the day Biden spoke, according to Johns Hopkins University data. A model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation now projects a total of 569,000 deaths by May 1, and there will almost certainly be additional deaths after that date. Marc Lipsitch, epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Biden's statement is \"a reasonable projection.\"\n Touting his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour from the current $7.25 per hour, Biden said, \"No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line.\"\n The CBO said families below the poverty line under current law would see a 5.2% average increase in income because of the increased minimum wage, while families above the poverty line under current law would see an average 0.1% reduction in income (in part because of a reduction in business income). The CBO added: \"In an average week in 2025, the $15 option would boost the wages of 17 million workers who would otherwise earn less than $15 per hour. Another 10 million workers otherwise earning slightly more than $15 per hour might see their wages rise as well. But 1.3 million other workers would become jobless, according to CBO's median estimate.\"\n Though the overall economic impact of a federal minimum wage increase is complicated to assess, it's easy to understand the basics of how it would improve the outlook for some workers. The weighted average 2019 poverty threshold for a family of four was $26,172. At the current $7.25 per hour federal minimum wage, someone would be more than $11,000 below that poverty threshold even if they worked 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year. Making $15 per hour, that person would exceed the threshold if they worked 44 weeks a year.\n \"So as a labor standard -- yes, a $15 minimum wage could be accurately described as getting most families over the poverty line if they are working full-time year round,\" said Jeannette Wicks-Lim, associate research professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n Wicks-Lim noted that there are nuances here. Some people have part-time work hours, part-year employment or bigger families; the cost of living varies widely by location, but the official poverty line doesn't adjust for this fact; exceeding the poverty line may mean only someone has \"escaped severe deprivation,\" she said, not that \"they are able to sustain a decent living standard.\"\n Biden said, \"We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. One in seven households in America -- one in seven -- more than one in five Black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat.\"\n Between December 9 and December 21, 14% of adults, 24% of Black adults and 21% of Latino adults reported that they often or sometimes did not have enough to eat in the last seven days.\n Biden's plan includes a variety of measures intended to address hunger, including an extension, through September, of a 15% increase in food stamp benefits that Trump signed into law in December. The extension is currently scheduled to expire at the end of June.\n Biden said, \"Approximately 14 million Americans -- 14 million -- have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction.\"\n The bureau's experimental survey for December 9 to December 21 found that 10.1 million renters lived in households that were not caught up on rent. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank, came up with the 14 million figure by adjusting the Census Bureau data to account for the fact that many renters did not respond to the survey.\n CNN reported in December that investment bank and advisory firm Stout had found that more than 14 million American households were at risk of eviction at the time. The Census Bureau survey found that 5.2 million people said it was either very likely or somewhat likely they would have to leave their home due to eviction in the next two months.\n Biden's rescue package would provide $25 billion in rental assistance for low- and moderate-income households who have lost jobs during the pandemic (in addition to the $25 billion Trump approved in December). Another $5 billion is directed toward helping struggling households pay utility bills. And an additional $5 billion is for states and localities to assist people at risk of experiencing homelessness.\n Separate from the rescue package that must be approved by Congress, Biden took executive action on his first day in office to extend, through the end of March, pandemic moratoriums on many evictions and foreclosures. The moratoriums approved by Trump had been scheduled to expire at the end of January.\n CNN's Katie Lobosco and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

Photos from the event show him taking the oath of office on a copy of the US Constitution.\n With Blinken's confirmation, President Joe Biden now has a number of key members of his national security team in place. In addition to national security adviser Jake Sullivan -- who does not require Senate confirmation -- Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was confirmed on Inauguration Day and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed last Friday.\n Blinken's confirmation was welcomed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as the professional association for the US Foreign Service.\n \"Leadership of the Department of State, our nation's oldest cabinet agency, represents a great responsibility,\" the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) said in a statement.  \"As we have done for his predecessors, AFSA extends our congratulations and welcome to Secretary Blinken. We wish the Secretary and his team the best of luck in the years ahead. AFSA and its members pledge to work alongside them to strengthen the career Foreign Service and protect and enhance the institution that is American diplomacy.\"\n The 71st secretary of state faces the challenges of restoring America's standing in the world and reinvigorating a department where many felt demoralized under the past administration.\n He will also be on the forefront of directing a sharp turn from \"America First\"  foreign policy to one that focuses on multilateralism and coalitions.\n During his confirmation hearing last week, Blinken pledged to reengage with Congress on key foreign policy concerns.\n He was pressed on Iran and efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. While Blinken made clear the Biden administration feels the world was safer with the Iran nuclear deal in place, he did not offer specifics on plans to rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018.\n \"The President-elect believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too,\" Blinken said at his hearing a day before the inauguration last week. \"But, we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners who would once again be on the same side with us, to seek a longer and stronger agreement. And also, as you and the chairman have rightly pointed out, to capture these other issues, particularly with regard to missiles and Iran's destabilizing activities. That would be the objective.\"\n \"Having said that, I think we're a long way from there, we would have to see once the President-elect is in office what steps Iran actually takes and is prepared to take,\" Blinken said.\n On China, he conceded that President Donald Trump \"was right in taking a tougher approach to China.\"\n \"I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, and I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy,\" Blinken said.\n He pledged to restore the agency he now leads, saying he is \"committed to advancing our security and prosperity by building a diplomatic corps that fully represents America in all its talent and diversity.\"\n And where his predecessor Mike Pompeo pledged to bring \"swagger,\" Blinken called for \"humility and confidence.\"\n \"Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. And humility because most of the world's problems are not about us, even as they affect us. Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone -- even one as powerful as the US,\" he said. \"But we'll also act with confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good.\"\n CNN's Nicole Gaouette and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)If there was any doubt about the urgency of President Joe Biden's mission to tackle racial inequality, it was erased in the searing moment an insurrectionist rioter brazenly paraded the Confederate flag through the US Capitol.\n Just 20 days on from one of the most shocking moments in modern US history, Biden on Tuesday made his most detailed policy moves yet on the issue with a series of executive orders on the one crisis haunting his presidency sure to endure once Covid-19 and its economic pain are just a horrible memory.\n He said that the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, in a notorious instance of police brutality against Black Americans last year, had unleashed a common realization among citizens that they could no longer ignore systemic racism.\n \"Those eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around all over the world,\" Biden said. \"It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten.\"\n Biden pressed ahead in the looming shadow of his predecessor Donald Trump after House Democrats on Monday delivered an article of impeachment relating to his role inciting the Capitol riot.\n The uprising, incited by an ex-President who fueled white nationalism, underscored how America's oldest fault line is also one of its freshest following last summer's national racial reckoning.\n Yet subsequent events have also left a sense that while the country has rarely been more divided since a Civil War that was fought over slavery, progress is possible and as necessary as ever.\n In another striking image, on Monday, for example, the first Black, South Asian and female Vice President Kamala Harris swore in the first Black Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two juxtaposed episodes less than three weeks apart encapsulated the nation's deep divides that Biden must confront but also a democracy's potential for change.\n The President has picked the most diverse Cabinet in US history. He has instructed his nominees at the Justice Department to prioritize civil rights and to root out racism and prejudice to apply equality under the law for all Americans. This is no doubt heartfelt. But it is also smart political positioning since he owes his victory in the Democratic nominating race, his triumph over Trump and his party's capture of the Senate to Black voters especially.\n \"The President has committed the whole of our government to advance racial justice and equity for all,\" Susan Rice, the head of Biden's Domestic Policy Council said Tuesday, previewing a major address on race by the President later in the day.\n \"These aren't feel good policies, the evidence is clear -- investing in equity is good for economic growth and it creates jobs for all Americans,\" Rice said, previewing an agenda that is far broader than the most familiar racial issues, including policing and discrimination.\n Biden tackled four areas on Tuesday, including fair housing, reforming the penal system to crack down on private prisons, recommitting the government to lifting up Native American communities and tribes and combating xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n Biden has worked hard to meet the moment, after several clumsy or discordant remarks related to race earlier in his long political career.\n During a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, during the election campaign, Biden argued that the nationwide tide of emotion that followed yet another shooting of a Black man by police, that paralyzed Jacob Blake, was the catalyst for a new effort to tackle all forms of racism and inequality of opportunity.\n He also signaled understanding of the spirit of the resurgent racial justice movement by acknowledging that White Americans could never fully appreciate the historic pain felt by their Black compatriots, an experience shared by many other citizens.\n \"I can't understand what it's like to walk out the door or send my son out the door or my daughter and worry about just because they're Black they may not come back,\" Biden said.\n Soaring words and symbolism are important -- they are part of a President's armory in mobilizing the public and affecting political change. But alone, they cannot transform a country or the lived reality of African Americans. The limited social mobility of millions and the busted promises of many previous \"conversations about race\" sometimes seem little changed from the reality noted by Martin Luther King Jr. in his book \"Where do we go from here: Chaos or Community\" that was first published in 1967.\n \"Loose and easy language about equality, resonant resolutions about brotherhood fall pleasantly on the ear, but for the Negro there is a credibility gap he cannot overlook,\" King wrote.\n In a more recent lesson, the presidency of the first black commander in chief Barack Obama shows that the very act of breaking down barriers that at the time can seem epochal and irreversible can incite new prejudice and breed extremism.\n Biden's effort will require action from the Justice Department to tackle civil rights abuses and to guarantee fairness in the judicial system for all. Former national security adviser Rice's new White House job includes a sweeping mandate across all government agencies.\n Biden is also soon expected to seek reforms on policing, partly in response to the death of Minnesota man George Floyd with a policeman's knee on his neck last year.\n Last week, in the first hours of his presidency, Biden signed an executive order requiring all government departments to put racial and other forms of equality at the center of everything that they do during his term.\n One established that \"advancing equity for all -- including people of color and others who have been historically underserved and marginalized -- is the responsibility of the whole of our government.\" Biden also countermanded an earlier executive order signed by Trump.\n Like much of Biden's presidency, his capacity for action, and to secure the massive funding that serious reform requires, will be constrained by narrow majorities in Congress and Washington's fractured political scene in the post-Trump era. But he does have the moral authority of having won office against a President who tore at the nation's racial chasm with a hard line \"law and order\" campaign based on false claims that the Democratic nominee wanted to dismantle policing as it is currently known.\n The debate over what Biden has said is \"systemic\" racism in the criminal justice system puts the President between two absolutist positions. He finds himself confronted on his right by conservatives keen to demagogue him as anti-police and an enemy of White heartland values.\n Conservative media has already accused Biden of wrongly equating every Trump voter with White nationalists and racists. And many Republicans are now seeking to draw false equivalence between the Trump-inspired violence on January 6 in Washington and clashes that broke out during Black Lives Matter protests last year. Biden has condemned violence in all cases. And violence that erupted in the summer in many cities was not the true expression of the attitude of millions of people who marched to protest racial injustice. The attack on the Capitol represented an unprecedented assault on another branch of government by a US President trying to steal an election.\n To his left, Biden is confronted by progressives who want sweeping reform -- some of whom defined the term \"defund the police\" that many party leaders say helped cost Democrats victories in some key swing state races in the House.\n This particular issue also pulls Biden between two versions of his own political persona. He was severely criticized for his role in 1990s criminal justice legislation that ushered in mandatory minimum sentences that sent many young Black men to jail for years. But he has also always had a strong relationship with the police and their unions during his long political career.\n But the shocking events of last summer and the long litany of videotaped examples of police brutality against African Americans have irrevocably shifted the potency of race and policing in the Democratic Party. And Biden's positioning, though obviously sincere, is also enforced by political reality.\n Still, some of Biden's longtime contacts in policing have told CNN that his experience and familiarity with both sides of this most difficult issue may uniquely equip him to oversee a policy response that goes some way to reconciling the extraordinary, and multi-racial national protests after Floyd's death.\n This story has been updated with additional details.",

        "body_text": "(CNN Business)Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, was banned from Twitter Monday night, according to a Twitter spokesperson.\n Twitter made its decision based on a new policy it enacted after the Capitol insurrection whereby people who repeatedly share election misinformation can be permanently banned.\n \"The account you referenced has been permanently suspended due to repeated violations of our Civic Integrity Policy,\" the spokesperson told CNN.\n It is not immediately clear which tweets led to Lindell's ban.\n Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling MyPillow products after Lindell voiced continued support for former President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and voicing false statements publicly about the validity of the election. Lindell, a major Republican donor, called the attack \"very peaceful\" and blamed \"undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people\" for the chaos, according to The New York Times. \"Donald Trump will be our president for the next four years,\" he said earlier this month.\n According to that policy, the more violations a person commits, the more severe the ban. Two strikes result in a 12-hour lock, for example, while five or more strikes can result in what the company calls a \"permanent suspension.\"\n \"You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes,\" Twitter said of its civic integrity policy in January. Civic processes include: political elections, censuses and major referenda and ballot initiatives.\n Twitter also banned Donald Trump's the @realDonaldTrump account earlier this month, citing the insurrection.\n \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter said.\n \"In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action.\"\n Twitter's decision followed two tweets by Trump that violated the company's policy against glorification of violence, Twitter said, and \"these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President's statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks.\"",

        "title": "Blinken becomes Biden's top diplomat after a friendship forged over decades",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN)It was February 2008 when a snowstorm suddenly overwhelmed the flight path of two American helicopters, forcing them to make an unexpected landing on a mountaintop in Afghanistan.\n On board the aircrafts overlooking Taliban territory were Joe Biden and Antony Blinken, his then-top adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with a few other members of the committee, according to two sources on the trip.\n When the helicopters landed, soldiers accompanying them established a perimeter around the narrow mountain peak while they decided what to do next. Blinken hopped out of his helicopter to check on Biden.\n The source on the trip told CNN that they \"remember Tony being unbelievably calm throughout the entire thing and occasionally quite funny. He did not blame anyone for what had happened.\"\n \"Tony just knew how to keep everything under control. He mirrors Biden in that way. They are both calm under pressure,\" they said.\n Blinken, the newly confirmed secretary of state, has worked with Biden for almost 20 years, and many describe him as having the closest personal relationship with the President of anybody in the Cabinet. They forged that bond in the field, on a tremendous number of foreign trips they took together when Biden was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but also through a US presidential campaign, the shared experience of personal loss and ties between their families.\n Over the years, Biden has relied on Blinken to deal with crisis scenarios in an even-keeled manner, to morph his foreign policy ideas into reality, to support his political endeavors, and to be a loyal friend.\n \"Tony has been a part of Joe's evolution, learning, and changes as he has confronted challenge after challenge over decades,\" said Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on the foreign relations committee and called Blinken \"an irreplaceable part of Joe Biden's inner core team.\"\n Blinken is expected to be privy to every major decision Biden makes as President, according to multiple sources who spoke with CNN. That deep level of involvement will be driven by Biden administration's belief that foreign policy is intrinsically tied to domestic policy and the need to strengthen democracy at home, but it is also a reflection of their sturdy comfortable relationship, the sources explained.\n \"They will continue to nurture their relationship, and it will be wide ranging,\" said an official who is planning to join Blinken's State Department. \"They will see each other a lot. And some of it may be over casual dinners at the White House.\"\n When Blinken began working with Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2002, the Iraq War debate was ongoing, accelerating their relationship, which may have otherwise matured at a slower pace.\n \"The war drums were beating,\" said a source who was working on the committee at the time. \"The relationship forged pretty quickly.\"\n Blinken worked alongside Biden when he voted in favor the Iraq War -- a vote that has been repeatedly scrutinized, and one that Biden and Blinken have both said Biden regretted.\n After that initial bonding experience over the most fundamental foreign policy question of war and peace, Blinken was involved in almost every foreign policy declaration or policy that Biden put forth during his time in the Senate and as vice president.\n Even when Biden went against the grain -- for example, in advocating for a smaller troop presence in Afghanistan when other national security officials advocated for a troop surge in the early days of the Obama administration -- Blinken advocated for his views at the interagency level and fine-tuned the policy Biden was driving it forth.\n \"Blinken channels Biden's passion and energy into a constructive outcome,\" said the source on the Afghanistan trip.\n \"It was Biden's style to absorb information and give feedback extemporaneously, in the moment, which does not lead to a crisp foreign policy paper,\" said the source who worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with them. \"But Blinken is skilled in communications and writing. He could do it.\"\n Blinken's tight-knit relationship with Biden is what career diplomats and those close to Blinken's inner circle expect to fuel his efficacy as America's top diplomat.\n \"The challenge always with the secretary of state and the president is does the secretary of state really speak for the president? And when he says something, does the foreign government that he's talking to believe that that is what the president actually thinks?,\" former career US diplomat Lew Lukens told CNN. \"When Tony Blinken travels the world, people will know what he says is what Joe Biden believes and thinks. He speaks for the President, and that is incredibly important for a secretary of state. And we didn't always have that.\"\n Blinken has not solely been a foreign policy adviser to Biden, he has also been intimately involved in aspects of Biden's political career.\n In 2008, the night Biden got home from being announced in Springfield as Barack Obama's running mate, he had a couple staffers up from Washington to his home to plan. Blinken was one of just four, explained a source who worked with them on the campaign. After that, he went on the road with Biden as he traveled the country campaigning.\n \"Truthfully, almost all of the messaging and speeches day in and day out were about domestic issues, not foreign policy. But Sen. Biden wanted Tony there by his side because he knew the presidency was always shaped by foreign policy decisions, and he wanted uninterrupted time with Tony to plan. But he also wanted something else: a friend and trusted confidante,\" said the source who worked with them on the 2008 campaign. \"As many of us on the plane were falling asleep, you could usually see a light on up in the front two seats, and it was Sen. Biden and Tony talking late into the night.\"\n And there is another layer that deepens the connection: Blinken's wife, Evan Ryan, was Biden's deputy campaign manager when he ran for the nomination in 2008. After working on the Biden transition, Ryan is now serving in the Biden White House as the executive secretary.\n The two couples have been loyal friends throughout times of hardship when they have experienced family loss, according to sources familiar with their relationship. Biden's father died in September of 2002 when he first met Blinken, and then in 2015, Blinken's stepfather and Biden's son, Beau Biden, both passed away.\n \"President Biden is personally close to both Tony Blinken and Evan Ryan and Tony has been an incredibly loyal, capable and effective adviser, staffer and personal friend of the sort that is rare in Washington,\" said Coons.\n CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Goya board silences its CEO after he tells Fox News the election was rigged",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business)Goya's board of directors had enough of CEO Robert Unanue's public comments in support of former President Donald Trump and his unfounded claims of voter fraud. On Friday, it voted to muzzle him.\n The board of the privately held Latino food company voted to censure Unanue, following his most recent controversial remarks that questioned the legitimacy of the November election, according to a person familiar with the board's actions, who spoke to CNN on the condition that their name not be used.\n Unanue will no longer be allowed to speak to the media without the board's permission, the source said. The decision was first reported by the New York Post Monday evening.\n The source said this is a \"full stop\" on Unanue speaking to the press, not only about politics, but also about the company itself.\n A majority of Goya shareholders favor removing Unanue altogether but have been prevented from doing so by the dynamics of the family-controlled company, according to the source.\n \"The company has never been political or politicized,\" said the source. \"He's gone from bad CEO to CEO that has imperiled the future of the company and endangered the lives of some of the shareholders,\" the source said in reference to some Unanue family members having allegedly received threats because of the CEO's comments.\n \"His statements are insulting and dangerous,\" said the source.\n Unanue spoke to the New York Post after the board's action but did not directly discuss his censure or the ban on speaking to the media. He confirmed he would no longer be speaking publicly about politics or religion.\n \"Independently, I've made the decision to lower the temperature and walk away from speaking about politics and religion,\" he told the Post. \"I realize it's important because of the diverse views of the company and our market.\"\n On inauguration day, shortly after President Trump made his farewell remarks, Unanue appeared on Fox Business' morning show and told anchor Maria Bartiromo that there was a \"war coming\" and that President Joe Biden's election was \"unverified.\"\n \"They accomplished what they set out to do, which was get President Trump out of the way,\" he said. \"I think this is mission accomplished, by the unions, the partnership, the conglomerate of social media, big tech, big media and big government. ... There is a war coming, now that the president is leaving today, they're still coming after the United States, the working class.\"\n Those comments did not get as much attention as his July remarks praising President Trump, likely because of all the other news surrounding the inauguration. But it was apparently enough for the Goya board to take action. Many board members were already upset with Unanue's previous public comments on politics, and about the company's performance under his leadership, according to the source who spoke with CNN.\n Unanue set off the controversy in July when, appearing at a White House event, he said, \"We are all truly blessed ... to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. We have an incredible builder, and we pray. We pray for our leadership, our president.\"\n Unanue and Goya said at the time that he was at the White House to announce the donation of millions of cans of Goya products to food banks.\n But his praise of Trump sparked a backlash from a number of leading Hispanic politicians, including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Obama cabinet member Julian Castro. Some other people on social media called for a boycott.\n That in turn prompted a so-called \"buy-cott\" by Trump supporters, including Ivanka Trump, who urged the president's backers to buy Goya products.\n In December, Unanue told a conservative radio show host that Ocasio-Cortez was the company's \"employee of the month,\" claiming that the congresswoman's July tweets had in fact boosted sales. But the CNN source disputed that the controversy has been good for the company, and Goya's sales figures are not publicly disclosed.\n \"It's hard to really say [the controversy hurt sales] but sales growth is less than it was pre-him speaking at the Rose Garden,\" said the source.\n Goya did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.  The company, founded in 1936 by Don Prudencio Unanue and his wife, Carolina, now has more than 4,000 employees in 26 facilities throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Spain, according to the company's web site.",

Sign up here.)\n President Biden says he hopes the US will soon be able to administer 1.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine a day, and the Defense Department is considering deploying thousands of troops to help reach that goal. One official said up to 10,000 troops could be involved. While Americans wait for vaccinations, health officials say they're extremely worried about new Covid-19 variants detected in the US. One expert says everyday activities are now much more dangerous because of them. In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the country's borders may stay shut for most of the year to ward off outbreaks. At the core of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, the city of Manaus offers a cautionary tale for health care systems on the brink of collapse: tens of thousands of new graves, no beds or oxygen tanks and a second wave promising even more misery.\n Biden has taken 33 executive actions in his first six days in office, and there are more to come. Some of these are aimed at bolstering economic stimulus initiatives, which could affect Americans who haven't gotten stimulus money yet or are waiting on unemployment or housing assistance. Other developments: Janet Yellen has officially been confirmed as the first woman to be treasury secretary, and the administration says it will have an American Sign Language interpreter at all White House news briefings. Meanwhile, the Senate is finally moving forward on a power-sharing agreement after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell demanded that Democrats not dismantle the filibuster, the classic legislative stalling technique. Now, the 50-50 Senate can officially organize so Democrats can take control of key committees.\n Former President Trump is assembling a full legal team for his Senate impeachment trial, which starts in early February. Biden says that while he doubts enough Senate Republicans will vote to convict Trump and disqualify him from holding office in the future, the proceedings must happen. Further, nine prominent Republican lawyers, including two former officials in the Trump administration, have signed a letter urging GOP senators to \"consider the evidence\" before deciding how to vote, strongly implying that if the evidence leads them there, they should not choose partisanship over conviction. Elsewhere in Trump's circle, Dominion Voting Systems is suing Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani for defamation, seeking $1.3 billion in damages. The election technology company has been at the center of baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud, which Giuliani has promoted.\n Hundreds of thousands of farmers drove their tractors into the Indian capital of New Delhi today as part of ongoing, nationwide protests against controversial agricultural laws farmers say put their livelihoods at risk. Some farmers have been camping out outside the city in protest for up to two months. The massive displays of discontent have been a significant challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Months of demonstrations across the country have so far only resulted in deadlocked talks between farmers and his administration. Today's planned protests coincide with India's Republic Day, a national holiday that marks the first time India's constitution went into effect in 1950 following independence from British colonial rule.\n Puerto Rico is declaring a state of emergency over gender-based violence after a wave of killings targeting women and transgender people. Newly minted Gov. Pedro Pierluisi announced an executive order aimed at preventing and protecting against gender-based violence through a number of programs, including a committee tasked with providing education, support and rescue around gender violence. The order is the culmination of years of efforts by activists and advocacy organizations to demand action in the US territory against the rise of gender-based violence, which has worsened in the face of the pandemic and natural disasters like 2017's Hurricane Maria. Pierluisi says the state of emergency will last until the end of June 2022.\n The invisible hand moves out of spite.\n A+ dog names.\n He says it could help tourism, but Bigfoot probably doesn't agree.\n For when you want to be so awake you can TASTE SOUND.\n What's Detroit-style?

        "title": "Schumer navigates landmines from the left and the right as he assumes top Senate job",
        "body_text": "(CNN)It hasn't even been a week since Chuck Schumer assumed his long-sought goal of becoming Senate majority leader.\n But he's already been in a staring contest with Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, over the future of the institution.\n He faces outright opposition from Republicans over President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, including a $1.9 trillion plan to take on the coronavirus pandemic.\n And he must keep his party unified despite a divisive debate over whether it's worthwhile to try to even work with Republicans.\n Schumer has to overcome bad blood from years of fierce battles with the very Republicans he's sought to defeat but whose support he now needs.\n \"What this campaign taught me about Chuck Schumer is that he will say or do anything in order to win,\" Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins told CNN after winning a hard-fought campaign against Schumer-backed groups in 2020. \"It was a deceitful, despicable campaign that he ran.\"\n After serving four decades in Congress, the 70-year-old Brooklynite has now met his moment. He is in charge of muscling through legislation in a chamber split 50-50, confirming Biden's appointments, overseeing the first impeachment trial of a former president, and shaping the debate over the Senate's filibuster, which now grants Republicans significant power over major legislation.\n His fortune reversed in early January, when Schumer witnessed Democrats win two seats in Georgia to take back the Senate. Then within three weeks, a mob assaulted the US Capitol, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting it and Biden was inaugurated. Minutes after he was declared Senate majority leader, Schumer exhaled on the floor, smiled, and said, \"I need to catch my breath, so much is happening.\"\n Since becoming Democratic leader in 2017, Schumer has served only as a minority leader, keeping his caucus together against the proposals of Trump and McConnell.\n But serving in the minority is far different than the majority. Schumer will have to piece together a coalition from a diverse caucus to push legislation through the slow-moving chamber.\n Schumer, who has cut bipartisan deals in the past, will have to showcase those deal-cutting bonafides while keeping at bay restless liberals. The Democratic leader himself may face a challenge from the left in 2022 from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 31-year-old democratic socialist phenom.\n \"He's a very ideological guy in many ways but he's also a creature of the Senate in his own way,\" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who once cut a major 2013 immigration deal with Schumer but was on the receiving end of a barrage of attacks from Schumer-backed groups during his 2020 reelection race. \"He's going to have to somehow deal with the energy of the left and create space for Biden to put some points on the board.\"\n It took Democrats a decade to take back Washington, and Schumer knows that the next two years could be his first and last in his powerful position. In 2014, he bemoaned the health care focused push of the early Obama years as a blown opportunity, arguing Democrats should've first boosted the economy.\n In 2021, the economic and health crises are so great that Democrats want to address both at the same time. Schumer has called the country's twin threats the worst in 75 and 100 years, respectively.\n Schumer has to keep his entire Democratic caucus in line, while trying to appeal to about a dozen Republican senators, to pass massive legislation responding to both crises.\n But crucial rank-and-file Republicans have already dismissed Biden's plan. Collins has questioned why such a huge response is necessary, after Congress just passed a $900 billion bill in December.\n Collins, a crucial vote on most legislation, has broader concerns about working with the Senate Democratic leader.\n Last week, Collins told CNN it's \"absolutely true\" that she would struggle to personally trust Schumer as she works to pass bills in the Senate over the next two years. She said at the time that the New York Democrat had not reached out to her or talked to her on the floor since the campaign. She said there were other Democrats, including Biden, whom she could trust.\n Collins is particularly frustrated with Schumer over the attack ads from the Senate Majority PAC, a Schumer-aligned Super PAC, including a TV ad that said she \"pocketed\" $1.4 million from the drug and insurance industry while showing her reaching into her purse.\n \"What bothered me the most about the type of campaign Chuck ran against me is that he attacked my integrity,\" Collins told CNN. \"He actually ran an ad that called me corrupt and made it look like I was pocketing campaign contributions.\"\n \"I remember the old Senate, where that just never would have been done,\" she added.\n Schumer's office declined to comment for this article.\n In 2004, Schumer had a choice: run for governor or stay in the Senate. The future Democratic leader, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, offered him a seat on the powerful Finance Committee and to chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in the 2006 elections. He took the deal, giving him a national fundraising platform, the power to recruit new members and oversight over taxes, trade deals, health programs and Wall Street.\n Phil Singer, a former spokesman for Schumer, told CNN that the New York senator was attracted to the legislative scope of the Senate.\n \"If you want to get something done meaningfully, that's going to affect people's lives in the long term, the Senate is the best place to do it,\" said Singer, paraphrasing Schumer from a conversation they had at the time.\n Schumer's hard-charging campaign tactics at the DSCC in 2006 and 2008, and round-the-clock efforts to put his party in power since then, has hurt his relationship with Republicans. McConnell has not forgotten that Schumer's Senate Democrats' campaign-arm bashed him for supporting lax regulations and then bailing out Wall Street a dozen years ago.\n The Trump era has not brought Schumer and Republicans, who he has long viewed as anti-government, any closer, as old allies from across the aisle retired and Schumer's relationship with McConnell soured. The Schumer-McConnell relationship hit a new low in 2017, after Schumer voted against the nomination of McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, to be Secretary of Transportation.\n The two talked sparingly during the Trump years and bashed each other publicly on the floor. Many senators hope the frosty relationship will thaw.\n \"I think he's talking to Mitch, which we hope that will continue,\" said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I'm optimistic. He's a consensus builder, not a dictator.\"\n But Schumer's tireless campaigning has endeared himself to the Democratic caucus, and kept it united.\n \"He has held us together the last four years despite having senators that go from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin,\" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, referring to the most liberal and conservative senators who caucus with Democrats. \"It is harder in the majority.\"\n After Democrats failed to take the House and White House in 2016, Schumer expanded his leadership group to include both Sanders and Manchin. He held a Senate Democratic retreat in Manchin's West Virginia to figure out Trump's appeal, and pledged that Democrats and the Republican President could work on an infrastructure project together.\n But by the end of Trump's term, after daily denunciations of Trump's conduct and the attack on the Capitol, Schumer said the President \"should not hold office one day longer,\" calling for his removal either by trial or invoking the 25th Amendment, neither of which have ever been done before.\n Still, some on the left warily view Schumer as too close to Wall Street. Republicans from Trump to Graham have needled the Senate Democratic Leader as Ocasio-Cortez continues to weigh a potential run against him in 2022. Schumer, while dealing with his fragile majority, is trying to maintain his appearances with groups back home, holding regular Zoom calls even while fielding phone calls from Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n \"I think he's very capable, smart, hard-working, tenacious. I've found him to be honest,\" Graham told CNN. \"He's got a problem. He's majority leader with a primary challenge looming over his shoulder.\"\n Schumer's more immediate problem is managing his own caucus, which is divided over whether to eliminate the filibuster, the minority party's main tool to block or slow down bills. Most Democrats want to get rid of it in order to pass much bolder legislation without requiring Republican support.\n Manchin, who is leading a group to find the \"moderate middle,\" wants to keep the 60-vote threshold.\n \"Chuck's a realist, he understands the numbers,\" said Manchin. \"Anybody pushing from the left, the numbers aren't there. We'll go center-left sometime, we'll go center sometime, maybe even center-right some time.\"\n But others, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, want to eliminate it, pointing out that Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama's agenda and Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland with the filibuster. The Republicans erased the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations, after the Democrats had previously eliminated it for other judicial nominees, but that high bar is still in place for legislation.\n McConnell tried to get Schumer to agree to protect the filibuster in exchange for agreeing to rules that will give Democrats their committee gavels.\n \"He wants a veto over every action that the majority will take,\" said Warren. \"Mitch McConnell is fine with getting rid of the filibuster for a United States Supreme Court nominee for a lifetime appointment but he's not OK getting rid of the filibuster for unemployment relief for families that are out of work because of Covid-19?\"\n After Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema both publicly defended the filibuster, ensuring it would be preserved at least for now, McConnell agreed to a power-sharing deal with Schumer. McConnell said that \"no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation.\"\n But it still could. On Monday, Schumer told reporters, \"All I can tell you is we are not letting McConnell dictate how the Senate operates. He is minority leader.\"",

The gorillas were suspected to have been infected by an asymptomatic staff member.\n Due to concerns over Winston's age and underlying medical conditions, veterinarians performed a diagnostic examination and were able to confirm he had pneumonia and heart disease, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a news release.\n From a supply not permitted for human use, Winston received monoclonal antibody therapy, heart medications and antibiotics.\n \"Treatment with these synthetic versions of the body's natural defenses is thought to be effective in diminishing effects from the virus,\" the zoo said in its news release. \"The veterinary team who treated Winston believe the antibodies may have contributed to his ability to overcome the virus.\"\n Monoclonal antibody treatments that are used to treat humans have been shown to reduce viral load and lower a person's risk of hospitalization and even death. Unlike a vaccine that takes a few weeks to work, antibody treatments work right away.\n With the help of veterinarians, wildlife care professionals and specialists, the entire troop is on track to make a full recovery.\n \"San Diego Zoo Global is relieved to announce that the eight-member troop is eating, drinking, interacting and on their way to a full recovery,\" the release read.\n San Diego Zoo veterinarians have been working with specialists from around the world to secure a limited supply of vaccinations that are intended only for use on animals. Zoo officials have already begun to identify candidates for the spike protein vaccine at the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park.\n San Diego Zoo Global said it \"will continue to share what it has learned about curbing zoonotic disease transmission, biosecurity protocols in managed care and field settings, and the implications to ensuring optimal health outcomes for humans and wildlife globally.\"",

        "body_text": "Washington (CNN)North Carolina state Sen. Jeff Jackson announced his 2022 bid for Senate on Tuesday, setting up a divisive Democratic primary for the open seat that will be pivotal to the party's future control of the Senate.\n Jackson launched his \"100-county campaign\" in a video with his wife Marisa and his young sons, who are seen packing their bags in preparation for the months-long contest.\n He talked about a \"North Carolina agenda\" that addresses the pandemic, the unemployed, the opioid crisis, a lack of rural broadband and housing, health care and criminal justice racial disparities. Jackson also nodded to the state's 2020 election, in which Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and military veteran, lost his race against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis by less than two points after his sex scandal.\n \"We cannot go through another election like the one we just had,\" Marisa said.\n \"That was miserable,\" added Jackson, as one of his kids piles toys into a suitcase. \"You deserve better.\"\n Jackson is a 38-year-old former prosecutor, and a captain in the Army National Guard who served in Afghanistan. Republicans and a Democratic opponent, former state senator Erica Smith, have already tried to label him an echo of Cunningham.\n Smith, a Black woman who lost to Cunningham in the last Senate Democratic primary, tweeted on Tuesday, \"We cannot continue to go back to the SAME playbook & expect different results.\"\n \"It is time for a new kind of politics & a new kind of leadership. Together, we can bring about the change we need,\" she said, adding the hashtags \"WinWithBlackWomen\" and \"EmbraceTheBase.\"\n In 2019, Jackson flew to meet with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and pitched a grassroots campaign for Senate, including \"100 town halls in 100 days,\" according to a recording of a talk Jackson gave at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte obtained by National Review. Jackson said he was told he would instead have to spend months in a \"windowless basement raising money\" to buy attack ads against Tillis.\n Jackson's announcement video showed he still plans on an in-person campaign strategy. But GOP Senate candidate Mark Walker, a former congressman, referred to that article on Tuesday, sarcastically congratulating Jackson for \"deciding the 'windowless basement' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted him in for 2020 is now appealing for 2022.\"\n Many candidates are expected to run for the seat left open by Republican Sen. Richard Burr's coming retirement. Among others, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native and the President's daughter-in-law, is reportedly considering a Senate campaign.",

        "body_text": "(CNN)More than 9% of people in West Virginia have received at least their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationally, that number stands at less than 6%.\n \"We continue to lead the nation,\" Gov. Jim Justice said in a news conference Monday.\n The governor's announcement comes amid continued struggles with vaccine rollouts across the US. States are still working to ramp up their administrations with the help of mass vaccination sites and volunteer vaccinators, while others say they're running out of supply and have appealed to the federal government for more doses.\n West Virginia is second in the nation in terms of vaccines administered per capita and share of distributed doses that have been administered, according to CDC data, and has often led the nation in these metrics. The state has so far administered about 106% of the doses it has officially received, Justice said.\n \"This is a hard number to believe,\" the governor said. \"We're getting more doses out of the vials than what they really anticipated.\"\n The state has added a sixth syringe to ancillary kit packs, said Jim Hoyer, director of the state's interagency coronavirus task force.\n \"It is not every single vial that you get the extra dose, but we are getting enough, as the governor pointed out, that this is making a significant impact,\" he said.\n The latest CDC data shows West Virginia has administered about 84% of the doses it's received -- but the agency has previously said its data may be a few days behind. Nationally, the rate of administration is at about 55%.\n Addressing senior residents during his news conference, the governor added that the state may have saved \"a thousand, 10 thousand, twenty thousand\" lives because of its decision to move older residents higher in its priority list.\n Many seniors \"had lost hope because they knew they couldn't get a vaccine shot really and truly until probably April,\" Justice said. \"Well, it's January.\"\n And so far, West Virginia has vaccinated nearly 74,000 people 65 and older, he said.\n \"We were told, and we were given models by the federal government that, really, basically said we can't get to you probably until April. But we didn't follow that model,\" he said.\n Earlier this month, the state announced a program prioritizing the vaccinations of older residents against the virus, in an operation dubbed \"Save our Wisdom.\"\n That plan came about a week before federal leaders asked states to move people 65 and older to the front of the line, along with people with high-risk conditions. The state also opted out of a federal partnership to administer vaccines to long-term care residents and staff, working instead with local pharmacies.\n And Justice is hopeful West Virginia can keep its vaccination momentum up.\n Starting next week, he said vaccination clinics will be available in all 55 counties.\n \"They will receive a number of vaccine doses based on population,\" the governor said. \"This will make sure that our limited supply of Covid vaccines are reaching every corner of our state.\"\n CNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.",

        "title": "CNN survey shows some of America's biggest companies still grappling with response to deadly US Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Despite the vocal pledges from some companies to take bold action following the deadly January 6 siege on the US Capitol, many of America's corporate giants are instead taking a wait-and-see approach about their future political giving, a new CNN analysis shows.\n And even when the companies vowed to suspend campaign contributions, most declined to say how long their donation boycotts would last.\n CNN surveyed the roughly 280 companies in the Fortune 500 that supported the 147 GOP lawmakers who objected to certifying President Joe Biden's win. About 150 responded. Among the findings: Many of the firms that have chosen to suspend campaign donations have taken a broad-brush approach -- freezing contributions across the board, rather than targeting the Republican objectors.\n This month's corporate pushback sent shock waves through Washington as powerful trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce rebuked Trump's conduct in the hours before the Capitol attack. Brand-name companies, such as Coca-Cola and Marriott, swiftly went public with plans to halt giving by their affiliated political action committees.\n Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said that how long the corporate revolt from politicians will last is an open question, particularly since campaign fundraising usually slows in the months after an election.\n \"Right now, it's quite easy for them to sit back,\" Krumholz said. \"It's hard to imagine this would last through the primaries and general election in 2022.\"\n The analysis found that PACs associated with more than half of the companies -- roughly 280 firms in total -- had contributed $21 million to the 147 objectors.\n A total of 153 of those companies responded to CNN's questions about their political giving, representing firms whose PACs have donated $14 million to the 147 lawmakers during the 2020 election cycle.\n Among the findings:\n 120 of the companies said they had decided to pause or end political giving in some form. Twelve said they would not, and 21 said they were reviewing their practices but had not yet decided whether to make any changes. 33 companies said they would single out the 147 objectors, including AT&T and telecom giant Comcast, the two largest PAC contributors to this group of lawmakers. (CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia, is owned by AT&T.)\n 73 companies said they would halt donations to all federal candidates. That included the third largest PAC donor to the objectors, defense contractor Raytheon Technologies. Raytheon's PAC donated more than $560,000 to federal candidates during the 2020 cycle. In a statement to CNN, Raytheon spokesman Chris Johnson said the pause would allow it to \"reflect on the current environment and determine appropriate next steps.\"\n None of the companies that responded to CNN said they had requested refunds from lawmakers. That stands in sharp contrast to the greeting card maker Hallmark, which is not a Fortune 500 firm but made headlines with its request that two of the objectors, Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and  Roger Marshall of Kansas, return its PAC contributions.\n 31 companies had specific timetables for how long they would suspend political activity. Four -- General Electric, Texas Instruments, Public Service Enterprise Group and NGR Energy -- told CNN they planned to halt donations to the 147 objectors for the entire 2022 election cycle.\n \"This is not a decision we made lightly, but is one we believe is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company's values and commitment to democracy,\" General Electric spokeswoman Meghan Thurlow said in a statement to CNN.\n Texas Instruments spokeswoman Nicole Bernard told CNN the two-year suspension reflects the company's practice of evaluating candidates on a two-year budget cycle.\n At least one firm, Charles Schwab, has opted to shut down its PAC entirely. The Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump conservative strategists, had targeted the brokerage firm in a campaign that highlighted corporate donors to Trump or his allies on Capitol Hill.\n \"In light of a divided political climate and an increase in attacks on those participating in the political process, we believe a clear and apolitical position is in the best interest of our clients, employees, stockholders and the communities in which we operate,\" Schwab said in a statement.\n The swift and public reactions from some big-name corporate interests to the violent insurrection \"is significant in the moment,\" said Bruce Freed, who runs the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit that advocates for transparency in corporate political giving.\n \"Does the pause lead to a fundamental change or do they go back to business as usual?\" Freed asked. \"That remains to be seen.\"\n Some liberal watchdog groups are determined to keep the pressure on. End Citizens United recently published a list of firms that had donated at least $10,000 to the eight senators who objected to the election results, and it urged those companies to demand refunds.\n \"PR statements mean nothing if they're not followed by action,\" the group's president, Tiffany Muller, said in a statement. \"We're watching.\"\n Collectively, business PACs accounted for more than $360 million in federal contributions during the 2020 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. About 57% of the money flowed to GOP candidates. Corporations cannot donate directly to federal candidates, but their employees and executives fund company-aligned PACs.\n PAC donations represent just a fraction of the billions of dollars that companies and other powerful interests spend to influence policy in Washington each year. A political action committee can donate up to $5,000 directly to a federal candidate's campaign per election and an additional $10,000 to that candidate's leadership PAC over a two-year election cycle.\n Even so, how companies choose to direct their PAC money sends a powerful message about their values to their customers and workers, said David Rehr, who ran trade groups in Washington and now teaches lobbying and leadership as a professor at George Mason University.\n In the aftermath of the riot, companies \"want to signal they are on the right side of history,\" Rehr said. But they also are trying to navigate the fast-moving developments of a new Congress and new administration.\n \"The waiting buys them a lot of valuable time to assess how this torrent of change may affect their business,\" Rehr said.",

When asked about the rumored incident during a news conference Monday, Wheeler said, \"I can tell you there was an incident, I filed a police report, and that's all I can tell you right now.\"\n The mayor's office told CNN Monday evening that Wheeler does not have any further comment to make.\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises restaurant-goers to sit outdoors, at least 6 feet apart from other groups and wear masks whenever patrons are not eating or drinking, according to guidance last updated January 6.\n In the statement to police, Wheeler said he was approached on Sunday outside the Hillsdale McMenamin's pub by a man he did not recognize. The man said he had been photographing the mayor while he was in the restaurant's tent and accused the mayor of being in the restaurant without a mask against Covid-19 policies, Wheeler said in the statement.\n The man appeared to be recording him with a cell phone, Wheeler said, adding that he told the man people are allowed to temporarily remove a mask for eating and drinking at a restaurant, the statement said.\n Wheeler said the man followed him to his car.\n \"I became imminently concerned for my personal safety, as I had recently been physically accosted in a similar situation,\" Wheeler said. The mayor says he first gave a verbal warning that he was prepared to use the pepper spray, and then sprayed the man in the eyes.\n Wheeler was confronted earlier this month at a restaurant by a group of people shouting obscenities, and \"one member of the group started swatting at the Mayor and made physical contact with him.\"\n The police report said Wheeler was with former Portland Mayor Sam Adams at the time, who confirmed the incident to an officer. Adams did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\n Adams attempted to video record the encounter, but only was able to capture the audio, which is consistent with both Wheeler and Adam's story, the police report said.\n Wheeler and Adams both say Wheeler tossed a water bottle toward the man so he could wash out his eyes but did not remain at the scene. Shortly afterward, a staffer to the mayor called police to initiate the report.",

        "title": "Parts of California will need yardsticks to measure snow this week thanks to atmospheric river",
        "body_text": "Check the forecast >>>\n \"This is a blockbuster winter storm event for us\" said Mark Deutschendorf, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada. \"Travel is not recommended from late Tuesday night to Friday across the Sierra and Lake Tahoe area, including western Nevada. If you do venture outdoors, be prepared to spend time an extended period of time in your car.\"\n This is just another example of California stuck in a \"weather whiplash\" -- moving from one weather extreme to the opposite extreme.\n A dramatic shift in scenery will occur as winter kicks into high gear.\n \"Parts of the Sierra will need a yardstick to measure the forecast snow in the forecast,\" tweeted the NWS in Sacramento Monday.\n The foothills could see 6 inches to a foot of snow while the mountains could see anywhere from 3 to 5 feet. In some areas, up to 7 feet is forecast across the Sierra Nevada's favored terrain through Friday.\n \"This storm remains projected to be a major headache for the region and will bring heavy snowfall to the Sierra as well as portions of western Nevada,\" said NWS Reno.\n A backcountry avalanche watch is in effect for much of the region, including the Tahoe Basin, through Friday. The combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds will lead to extreme avalanche danger, says the NWS.\n Ridgetops in the Sierra could see gusts exceeding 125 mph.\n This heavy snow is all thanks to a category 3 -- out of 5 -- atmospheric river.\n Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere -- like rivers in the sky -- that transport water vapor, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n The moisture laden air from this atmospheric river (AR) event will be forced to rise over the mountains' crest and loft upwards, cooling as it rises. As the air cools, it condenses, forming heavy precipitation, which will flirt with snowfall duration records.\n \"The Owens Valley (Great Basin Desert) could receive near-record amounts of snow over a two-day period. Their previous 48-hour snowfall record was 23 inches set back in 1969,\" NWS Meteorologist Jenn Varian told CNN.\n As the atmospheric river points its firehose along the central coast, excessive rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches will threaten flash flooding in the region.\n San Francisco averages 4.19 inches of rain during January. Suppose the atmospheric river concentrates the heaviest rain across the Bay Area: In that case, it's possible the city could receive a month's worth of precipitation in just a few days.\n Depending on the precise placement of the atmospheric river, coastal locations south of San Francisco to Santa Barbara could get between 5 to 10 inches of rain with locally higher amounts. Lesser but still significant rain totals of 1 to 2 inches are likely from Los Angeles to San Diego.\n This heavy rainfall combined with the burn scars of the record wildfire season of 2020 brings a dangerous risk of mudslides and debris flows.\n Forecasters are especially concerned about Monterey County and Santa Cruz County where evacuations are underway, according to a statement released by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n Intense wildfires can compromise soil structure, making sloped terrain more vulnerable to debris flows and mudslides during heavy rain events.\n If enough rain falls upon a recent burn scar, a torrent of mud, rock and debris can cascade downhill and put communities in danger. Properties directly affected by recent fires or those located directly downstream from burn areas are at the most risk.\n Although atmospheric rivers can be hazardous, residents rely upon them to bring beneficial precipitation to the region.\n \"Thirty to 50 percent of annual precipitation on the west coast occurs in just a few AR events,\" according to NOAA.\n California's winter snowpack, fueled in part by atmospheric rivers, is crucial to the state's water supply. Warmer spring temperatures melt the snow and fill reservoirs, so freshwater is available during the dryer summer months.\n This AR event can be viewed as much needed relief because the current statewide snowpack is just 40% of average to date.\n This storm, along with an active weather pattern forecast into early February, will help alleviate drought conditions across California and the Great Basin.\n Severe drought conditions cover nearly 80% of California.\n However, just like anything in moderation, it's possible to have too much of a good thing.\n Research shows that the US West Coast, specifically California, can expect more climate extremes in the future.\n Precipitation extremes -- such as the current atmospheric river -- will intensify while dry spells are likely to become longer and more frequent, according to climate scientists.\n \"In a place like California, we really need to be thinking about both risks [drought and flood] simultaneously,\" said Daniel Swain, a University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist and lead author of a study on the subject.\n Dramatic swings are becoming more common and will continue to do so in the coming decades thanks to man-made climate change, according to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n Drastic swings from extremely wet to extremely dry and vice versa will be nearly twice as likely, occurring on average once every 25 years, by 2100.\n Climate variability is due, in part, to human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels.",

        "title": "On immigration, Biden seeks a new approach to an old deadlock",
        "body_text": "(CNN)President Joe Biden's early moves on immigration signal his determination to learn from past efforts to reform the system, but that doesn't mean he won't repeat their legacy of frustration.\n In several key respects, Biden already is approaching the herculean task of immigration reform with a strikingly different strategy than the past two presidents who tried to restructure the system, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama.\n While both men introduced proposals to comprehensively rethink almost every aspect of immigration law, Biden's plan stresses legalization of the undocumented, the top Democratic priority, while offering little on the key asks of business groups and Republicans: guaranteeing future flows of temporary workers and toughening border and interior enforcement.\n That choice reflects another big change from the past: While Bush and Obama both engaged in extended bipartisan negotiations that ultimately failed to produce a law, congressional Democrats and immigration advocates appear unlikely to enlist in such an elongated effort again.\n Congressional Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups seem content deferring initially as Biden seeks Republican support for change. But it's clear that both groups have only limited patience for that approach if Republicans don't quickly show signs of interest.\n \"My goal is to see if there are some legitimate players on the Republican side who want to invest a little capital and are serious,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who's the legislation's chief Senate sponsor, told me. \"If the answer to that is yes, I would take weeks with them. I am not going to take months with them.\"\n The Democratic skepticism about pursuing lengthy negotiations with Republicans underscores the challenge Biden will face squaring his immigration goals with his promise to promote \"unity\" and find more common ground across party lines. On immigration, as on most of his other priorities, his promise to work with Republicans collides with the liberal tilt of his own proposals, a Republican Party that has moved to the right even since his tenure as Obama's vice president, and a Democratic base highly dubious that meaningful cooperation is possible with that modern GOP -- and thus eager to use special legislative tools to move forward without it whenever possible.\n \"In the past, George W. Bush and Barack Obama sought bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform: The problem is it allowed Republicans to demand way too much in the sausage-making and, in the end, still kill off immigration reform,\" says longtime immigration lobbyist Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of the advocacy group America's Voice. \"Biden is presenting a bill that unifies and inspires the entire Democratic coalition. In effect, he's saying, 'Work with me in good faith, Republicans, to get to 60 votes, and if you don't' -- and most of us assume they will not -- 'we'll find a way to get something done with our 51 votes.' \"\n But Biden and the immigration advocates face a challenge that will shadow almost all aspects of his legislative agenda: The threat to freeze out Republicans and pass immigration legislation solely with Democratic votes works only if every Senate Democrat is willing to vote to end the filibuster -- or to legalize millions of the undocumented through the special budget \"reconciliation\" process that allows bills to clear the upper chamber with 51 votes (including a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris).\n And it won't be easy to convince every Democrat that allowing millions of undocumented immigrants to legally enter the workforce is a defensible idea while millions of other Americans are out of work amid the disruption created by the coronavirus pandemic. Assuming that all Democrats will unite around a reconciliation strategy, says one top business lobbyist who asked to remain anonymous while discussing the group's internal calculations, is a combination of \"wishful thinking and bluster.\"\n Or, as Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, puts it: On immigration reform, \"there's a big difference between hope and experience.\"\n Biden's early moves on immigration mark a clear reversal of the policies under Trump, who moved in almost every way possible to restrict both undocumented and legal immigration. But Biden's posture also constitutes a departure from the tactics employed by Bush and Obama, who engaged in exhaustive bipartisan negotiations seeking a comprehensive overhaul.\n That process was led by the late Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and John McCain, an Arizona Republican, under Bush in 2006 and the bipartisan Senate \"Gang of Eight\" under Obama in 2013. Each time the negotiations produced a broad immigration bill that cleared the Senate with bipartisan support (though with notably fewer Republican senators supporting the package the second time). But while advocates believed they also had majority support in the House, the GOP leadership that controlled the chamber in both 2006 and 2013 refused to bring the bill to a vote, killing it.\n While Bush and Obama largely employed similar strategies, Biden has quickly indicated he intends to pursue a very different approach.\n Bush and Obama, for different reasons, did not seriously pursue immigration reform until their second terms; Biden revealed the outline of his immigration bill on his first day in office. That signals a very different level of commitment.\n \"I am hopeful that we can do more than less, because I never had a president who put his back into it,\" says Menendez, who arrived in the Senate just as the 2006 effort unfolded.\n Also different: While Bush and Obama pursued the \"three-legged stool\" of legalization for the undocumented (a Democratic priority), guaranteeing future flows of temporary workers (key for business) and tougher enforcement (a Republican emphasis), the plan Biden released offers relatively little on the latter two.\n As Sharry notes, that partly reflects a big shift in strategy: Democrats in effect are telling Republicans and their allies in the business community that any bill will reflect their concerns only if they produce GOP votes for the overall package, including a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. But it also reflects a conviction among immigration experts in both parties that Trump already implemented almost every element of the right's hardline enforcement wish list without stabilizing the system.\n \"Over the last four years the world has skewed dramatically to the right on the question of enforcement -- the wall, we have enough Border Patrol [agents] to put hands across the border almost, and [more] ICE agents, and the 'stay in Mexico' policy, the list is endless,\" says Menendez. \"On the enforcement side, that's all we've had for the last four years. It's a recognition that there has been a lot of enforcement out there; and second, a recognition there are better ways to do enforcement.\"\n Even some Republican immigration experts second that conclusion.\n Biden underscored the message from his legislative proposal by releasing on his first day new enforcement guidance for the federal immigration agencies to pause most deportations (except for people considered the greatest threats) for his first 100 days, while repealing Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations and freezing construction of his predecessor's border wall.\n That marks another sharp departure from Obama's approach. During his first two years, Obama ratcheted up immigration enforcement and deportations. His goal was to make congressional Republicans more comfortable voting to legalize the undocumented by proving he would ensure border security -- or at least to deny them the excuse that they could not vote for legalization until the border was secured. After two years of tough enforcement, Obama went to El Paso, Texas, in 2011 and declared, \"We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we've done.\"\n And yet, even after Obama's enforcement offensive, legalization still failed because not enough Republicans -- especially in the House -- supported it, while immigrant advocates bitterly labeled him the \"deporter in chief.\"\n After the bruising President Donald Trump years, Democrats and immigrant advocates are even more dubious that more than a handful of congressional Republicans will support legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, no matter the concessions offered to them on temporary workers and/or border security.\n As Trump has increased the GOP's reliance on the non-college-educated, non-urban and evangelical Christian White voters most uneasy about the way the nation is changing demographically and culturally, hostility to immigration in all forms has become one of the strongest threads binding the party.\n At the grassroots, polling by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute has found overwhelming support among Republicans for Trump's travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, his border wall and reducing legal immigration; nearly half of Republican voters even supported his policy of separating parents and children on the border (which did prove a bridge too far for some GOP elected officials). Almost three-fifths of Republicans in a recent Public Religion Research Institute poll endorsed the harshly worded sentiment that \"immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background\"; agreement was even greater among Republicans who rely primarily on Fox News for information.\n In Congress, most Republicans endorsed Trump's aggressive measures to restrict immigration -- such as declaring a national emergency to redirect money toward his border wall after Congress refused to appropriate it or slashing refugee admission levels -- and almost three-fourths of Senate Republicans supported legislation to cut legal immigration in half, though that Trump-backed bill ultimately failed.\n All of this reflects the party's retreat under Trump to the parts of the country least touched by demographic change: After November's Democratic gains in Arizona, Colorado and Georgia, Republicans, rather remarkably, hold just four of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states with the highest share of foreign-born residents.\n Already in Biden's first week, prominent Republicans -- including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Florida's Sen. Marco Rubio, who has shifted sharply to the right after helping to negotiate the 2013 Senate deal -- have denounced the new President's plan as a \"blanket amnesty\" and a threat to American workers forced from their jobs during the pandemic.\n Fox and other conservative media outlets are already touting the alleged threat of new \"caravans\" of migrants making their way toward the Southern border. Ken Paxton, the Republican Texas attorney general, a frequent antagonist on immigration issues during Obama's presidency, is suing to block Biden's deportation freeze and won an early round Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the pause. And, of course, the risk of denunciation from Trump looms over any congressional Republican considering cooperation with Democrats on legislation that legalizes any population of undocumented immigrants.\n Against that daunting backdrop, immigration advocates are already gaming out how they will proceed if, as they expect, the attempts by Biden and Democratic senators such as Menendez fail to win the 10 Republican votes they would need to break a filibuster against legislation to legalize all or some of the undocumented.\n One option is to seek legislation addressing only a portion of that population, starting with the roughly 2.1 million \"Dreamers,\" young people brought to the US as children by their parents. The House passed legislation in 2019 (with every Democrat voting yes) legalizing those undocumented young people, along with another roughly 300,000 immigrants here on so-called Temporary Protected Status, which covers migrants whose homelands are considered unsafe because of armed conflict or natural disasters.\n Even with a much narrower Democratic majority, advocates consider it highly likely the House would pass such legislation again. But while the Dreamers enjoy generally broad public support, finding 10 Republican votes for such standalone legislation in the Senate still would be difficult, since less than half of GOP voters back legalization for them. The same would be true for another undocumented population advocates might hope to legalize through standalone legislation: long-term farmworkers, who were also granted a pathway to citizenship in a separate bill the House approved in 2019.\n Democrats wouldn't need 10 Republican votes for immigration legislation (or any of their other priorities) if the Senate majority voted to end the filibuster -- but it does not appear they have the votes (or the inclination) to do that yet.\n That's why immigration advocates are scouring the legislative rules to determine whether they can include a pathway to citizenship within the special \"reconciliation\" process. Established by the 1974 Budget Act, reconciliation allows legislation with an impact on the federal budget to clear both chambers with just a majority vote, thus bypassing the filibuster.\n The assumption among immigrant advocates is that Biden, despite his outreach, won't win support from enough Senate Republicans to break a filibuster on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus \"rescue\" blueprint -- much less the larger economic \"recovery\" package he says is coming in February -- and will be forced to utilize reconciliation to pass those plans. They hope to convince congressional Democrats to include legalization for at least some of the undocumented in any reconciliation bill.\n Menendez, at least, appears open to that possibility. \"I am certainly spending a lot of my staff's time thinking about what is eligible for reconciliation,\" he told me.\n Ideally, immigrant advocates would hope to legalize as many as about 7 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented through a reconciliation bill: the Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status populations, as well as farmworkers and perhaps 5 million undocumented immigrants working in occupations deemed \"essential\" during the pandemic. (Those categories overlap somewhat.)\n But such an ambitious plan might struggle to win even majority support in Congress because too many centrist Democrats, especially in the Senate, could balk at legalizing such a huge swath of people through that expedited process. If Democrats do use reconciliation as their vehicle, Chishti predicts, they are likely to define the population of \"essential\" workers eligible for legalization much more narrowly than advocates prefer -- probably about 1 million people truly at the \"front lines\" of the pandemic, such as nurses and those in meatpacking plants.\n \"If Covid is the dominant backdrop for the next year, then you have to get reconciliation for things that are reasonably close to Covid -- so essential workers has a certain resonance in [that] context,\" he says. \"There is a reasonable argument that you can't be essential and not protected from deportation.\"\n Using the reconciliation tool likely would not only prevent Democrats from legalizing most of the undocumented, but both the rules and politics of the process would also almost certainly exclude major changes in the legal immigration system. And that could also represent another major opportunity cost.\n The efforts by Trump and congressional Republicans over the past four years to slash legal immigration collided with a clear economic imperative facing the US: the need for more working-age people to grow the nation's labor market and consumer base. As William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, recently calculated, the US from 2010 to 2020 appeared on track to record the slowest population growth in percentage terms for any decade in American history. That's occurring even as the number of seniors -- who will require federal spending on Social Security and Medicare -- is still rapidly increasing with the retirement of the baby boom.\n While unemployment is very high now, once the economy recovers from the pandemic, Frey notes, America will need more working-age adults to help pay the taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare for the growing number of seniors. And with fertility rates low, more immigration is the only realistic path to rejuvenating America's working-age population. The irony is that means an increasingly non-White and foreign-born workforce will pay the taxes to support the retirement of the preponderantly White older population that has responded most ardently to Trump's xenophobic messaging.\n \"The projections show we are going to be dealing with lower population growth and an aging population, and the only way we are going to be able to keep our labor force growing and vital is through immigration,\" Frey told me. \"Immigrants and their kids are younger than the general population and we're going to have to have a steady stream of that to counter the aging of the rest of the population.\"\n The unlikelihood of progress on legal immigration is another reason why reconciliation represents an imperfect option for immigrant advocates and their Democratic allies. But after the disappointments of the Bush and Obama breakdowns, and the searing immigration wars of the Trump years, they appear more than ready to take what they can get in the legislative process. And they look less likely than in the past to slog through lengthy negotiations if the GOP balks -- and the business groups that support reform can't move enough of those congressional Republicans to \"yes.\"\n \"My focus is to get a deal of some sort: I am not looking to bypass [bipartisan negotiations] and go to reconciliation,\" Menendez says. \"But I don't intend to go home with nothing in my hand.\"\n This story has been updated to reflect that a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration's pause on deportations.",

Some companies have changed their practices, PETA said, but others simply hide the monkeys when auditors come to check on the animals.\n Target (TGT) told CNN Business that it takes \"seriously the claims made against Chaokoh, and given they were unable to sufficiently address the concerns raised, we made the decision to remove their product from our assortment in November 2020.\"\n Chaokoh, one of the world leaders in producing coconut milk and other coconut products, and Theppadungporn Coconut Co., did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. But the company told USA Today that it has audited coconut plantations using a third party and \"did not find the use of monkeys for coconut harvesting.\"\n PETA said that Target joins 26,000 stores, including Wegmans, Food Lion, and Stop & Shop, that have stopped selling the milk. It's now turning its focus to Publix, Kroger (KR) and Albertsons that continue to sell Chaokoh products.\n Publix told CNN Business that it has reviewed third-party audits of the company and that Thailand's ambassador to the United States confirmed that monkeys are \"not used in the commercial harvesting of coconuts.\"\n Kroger and Albertsons did not immediately return requests for comment.\n --CNN's Lauren Padgett contributed to this report.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n (CNN)The scramble for vaccines is getting ugly. The European Union, facing a shortfall in supply,  is threatening to impose tighter export rules on vaccines.\n The EU said drugmaker AstraZeneca had \"surprisingly\" cut down the number of doses it intends to supply to the bloc. Top EU officials did not mince words criticizing the company.\n \"The European Union has pre-financed the development of the vaccine and its production and wants to see the return,\" the European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, said yesterday. The EU said AstraZeneca didn't provide sufficient explanations for the delays and is now demanding to know how many doses the company has produced, and who they've been sold to.\n The company said that production had been hampered by a manufacturing issue. \"While there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,\" AstraZeneca said in a statement.\n The delays are having a real impact in countries across the bloc. The Italian government was forced to revise its Covid-19 vaccination plan because of reduced vaccine supplies from both Pfizer and AstraZeneca.\n Yet European countries and other rich nations are still on the winning side of the world's struggle to secure enough vaccines for everyone.\n While US President Joe Biden said yesterday that he expects America to soon be vaccinating 1.5 million people a day, there are countries that haven't yet been able to secure any doses at all.\n The vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities, and the Middle East is a microcosm of that problem. While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus.\n Delayed access to vaccines will likely make this inequality worse, because countries that manage to get most of their populations immunized will be able to reopen their economies, while those at the back of the line will be stuck in perpetual lockdowns.\n But there are some positive signs. New data from Israel show that only about 0.01% of 128,600 people who received two doses of Pfizer's vaccine tested positive for the coronavirus after their second shot -- and those patients had only a mild illness, according to preliminary data from an Israeli health care system.\n Send your questions here.

Deaths continue to rise and public health experts are starting to warn people that the country will be in this battle for the long run. The government is now considering further restrictions on travel to and from the UK, and is set to make an announcement later today regarding the use of hotel quarantine on travelers, according to vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi\n China has been praised for its \"vaccine diplomacy,\" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots, James Griffiths reports.\n Manaus, an isolated city at the core of the Brazilian rainforest, is witnessing its second coronavirus wave, a shock to the many who thought its first wave was so widespread that herd immunity must be the result. The healthcare system in the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Amazonas has now collapsed under pressure. This means waiting hours in line to buy an oxygen tank -- only to find there's none left.

        "title": "Dogs likely migrated to the Americas with humans over 15,000 years ago, study says",
        "body_text": "(CNN)Dogs have been following humans for thousands of years.\n Archaeological and genetic data has revealed that dogs accompanied humans when they were migrating to the Americas from East Asia, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n Dogs were likely domesticated over 23,000 years ago in Siberia, said lead study author and archaeologist Angela Perri, a research fellow at Durham University's department of archaeology in the United Kingdom. Her team analyzed the genetic makeup of ancient dog remains to estimate when the domestication from wolves to dogs happened.\n Archaeological evidence showed that the humans migrated over 15,000 years ago from Northeast Asia across the Bering Land Bridge, a piece of land that connected modern-day Russia to Alaska. The land crossing no longer exists due to rising sea levels.\n Perri studied the lineage of American dogs outside the Arctic, which come from a different genetic ancestor than Arctic dogs, and traced it back to ancient Siberian dogs. This lineage has shown that humans brought their dogs with them when they migrated to the Americas, according to the study.\n Many people have dogs as pets today and some wonder, \"What is this animal and how did it go from a wild predator to curled up next to my bed?\" Perri noted.\n While there is no definitive answer on why dogs became domesticated, the freezing climactic conditions during this time likely brought wolves and humans closer together for survival, she said.\n \"Wolves likely learned that scavenging from humans regularly was an easy free meal, while humans allowed this to happen so long as wolves were not aggressive or threatening,\" Perri said.\n The dogs could have also helped humans transport items faster, she said. There is also evidence in the Pacific Northwest of humans using furry creatures as emergency sources of food and fur.\n The study is a fascinating example of how canine and human DNA and archaeology can be used to find out more about our past, said Jeffrey Kidd, associate professor of human genetics at the University of Michigan Medical School, who was not involved in the study.\n Modern dogs are similar to domesticated dogs from 15,000 years ago, he said, but today there are different furs and colors as a result of breeding.\n Kidd is not surprised that humans brought their dogs with them when they migrated to the Americas because of how intertwined dogs are in our society.\n \"If you and your entire community was going on a journey across the land, wouldn't you bring along your dog?\" Kidd said.\n The earliest confirmed dog bones were found in Germany over 100 years ago and are about 15,000 years old, Perri said, so her next project is to search for older dog bones in Siberia to aid in her research. She's hoping to gather more evidence to discover how dogs became man's best friend.",
