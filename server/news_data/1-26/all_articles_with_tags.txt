        "body_text": "A Texas man facing federal charges linked to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is apologizing for taking part in the storming of the Capitol and for\u00a0threatening Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0and a Capitol Police officer.\n Garret Miller released a statement on Monday through his attorney claiming that he stormed the Capitol after becoming convinced by Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s election fraud lies.\u00a0The 34-year-old Miller had previously tweeted\u00a0\u201cAssassinate AOC\u201d\u00a0and threatened a Capitol Police officer who fatally shot a fellow rioter.\n \u201cI am ashamed of my comments,\u201d Miller\u2019s statement read.\u00a0\u201cI was in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, because I believed I was following the instructions of former President Trump and he was my president and the commander-in-chief. His statements also had me believing the election was stolen from him.\u201d\n \u201cNevertheless, I fully recognize Joe Biden is now the President of the United States and that the election is over. Donald Trump is no longer president and I would not have any reason to continue to follow his lead.\u201d\n As for his threats against the officer and the New York lawmaker, Miller said: \u201cWhile I never intended to harm Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez nor harm any members of the Capitol police force, I recognize that my social media posts were completely inappropriate.\u201d\n \u201cI want to publicly apologize to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and the Capitol police officers. I have always supported law enforcement and I am ashamed by my comments,\u201d he added.\n During an Instagram Live last week, Ocasio-Cortez said that a \u201cclose encounter\u201d led her to fear she was \u201cgoing to die\u201d during the insurrection. It is not clear if the person she was referring to was Miller. As of Monday evening, she hadn\u2019t commented on Miller\u2019s apology.\n Miller was arrested last Wednesday and charged with four counts including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n In his statement, he said he was not armed when he entered the Capitol and that he stayed in the rotunda. He claimed he went back to Texas after \u201cPresident Trump asked us to go home.\u201d\n Miller said he had never been very interested in politics until recently, but that Trump\u2019s election fraud accusations \u201creally got to me and I felt I had to support him.\u201d\n However, he also said he is \u201csolely responsible\u201d for his actions and that \u201cthere are no excuses for what I did\u201d before offering to testify at any trial or congressional proceeding.",

        "title": "Antony Blinken sworn in as Biden's secretary of state",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) Antony Blinken said it is the honor of his life to serve as the top US diplomat after being sworn in as the newest secretary of state Tuesday.\n Blinken, a longtime Biden associate, was approved by the Senate with a vote of 78-22 earlier in the day.\n \"My career has come full circle,\" Blinken wrote in a tweet Tuesday. \"I started at the @StateDept in 1993, and, today, it's the honor of my life to lead the Department's women and men as the 71st Secretary of State.\"\n \"I want to thank my colleagues for welcoming me home,\" he added.\n Blinken was sworn in at the State Department by Carol Perez, a career diplomat who is serving as acting under secretary for management. Photos from the event show him taking the oath of office on a copy of the US Constitution.\n With Blinken's confirmation, President Joe Biden now has a number of key members of his national security team in place. In addition to national security adviser Jake Sullivan -- who does not require Senate confirmation -- Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was confirmed on Inauguration Day and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed last Friday.\n Blinken's confirmation was welcomed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as the professional association for the US Foreign Service.\n \"Leadership of the Department of State, our nation's oldest cabinet agency, represents a great responsibility,\" the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) said in a statement.  \"As we have done for his predecessors, AFSA extends our congratulations and welcome to Secretary Blinken. We wish the Secretary and his team the best of luck in the years ahead. AFSA and its members pledge to work alongside them to strengthen the career Foreign Service and protect and enhance the institution that is American diplomacy.\"\n The 71st secretary of state faces the challenges of restoring America's standing in the world and reinvigorating a department where many felt demoralized under the past administration.\n He will also be on the forefront of directing a sharp turn from \"America First\"  foreign policy to one that focuses on multilateralism and coalitions.\n During his confirmation hearing last week, Blinken pledged to reengage with Congress on key foreign policy concerns.\n He was pressed on Iran and efforts to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. While Blinken made clear the Biden administration feels the world was safer with the Iran nuclear deal in place, he did not offer specifics on plans to rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018.\n \"The President-elect believes that if Iran comes back into compliance, we would too,\" Blinken said at his hearing a day before the inauguration last week. \"But, we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners who would once again be on the same side with us, to seek a longer and stronger agreement. And also, as you and the chairman have rightly pointed out, to capture these other issues, particularly with regard to missiles and Iran's destabilizing activities. That would be the objective.\"\n \"Having said that, I think we're a long way from there, we would have to see once the President-elect is in office what steps Iran actually takes and is prepared to take,\" Blinken said.\n On China, he conceded that President Donald Trump \"was right in taking a tougher approach to China.\"\n \"I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, and I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy,\" Blinken said.\n He pledged to restore the agency he now leads, saying he is \"committed to advancing our security and prosperity by building a diplomatic corps that fully represents America in all its talent and diversity.\"\n And where his predecessor Mike Pompeo pledged to bring \"swagger,\" Blinken called for \"humility and confidence.\"\n \"Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. And humility because most of the world's problems are not about us, even as they affect us. Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone -- even one as powerful as the US,\" he said. \"But we'll also act with confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good.\"\n CNN's Nicole Gaouette and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) on Monday for wearing makeup.\n \u201cIn Wyoming, men don\u2019t wear makeup,\u201d an unnamed Cheney spokesperson told The Washington Examiner on Sunday. Gaetz should \u201cleave his beauty bag at home,\u201d the aide added.\n The aide was apparently referencing\u00a0Gaetz\u2019s comment in the recent HBO documentary \u201cThe Swamp\u201d that he does his own makeup when he appears on television for interviews. (People who do studio interviews typically wear makeup.)\n Gaetz \u2014 who is perhaps better known for trying to overturn the election results and\u00a0baselessly claiming the Capitol insurrection was the work of antifa \u2014 has pushed to expel Cheney from the House after she and a handful of other Republicans voted to impeach President\u00a0Donald Trump.\n The Florida Republican is\u00a0traveling to Wyoming on Thursday to rev up Trump supporters against his colleague.\n Of all the issues Gaetz could be slammed for, his use of makeup was a surprising choice. The dig from Cheney\u2019s aide triggered complaints on Twitter that it was remarkably insensitive to the LGBTQ community \u2014 and clueless about many Wyoming voters.\u00a0As one Twitter critic cracked: \u201cHave you been to Jackson Hole?\u201d\n Others pointed out that there were better reasons to take issue with Gaetz.\n Cheney hasn\u2019t commented on her aide\u2019s controversial attack on Gaetz.",

        "title": "12 Houston police officers have been charged in connection with a botched 2019 raid",
        "body_text": "(CNN) A total of 12 officers have now been indicted in connection with a 2019 botched raid that left two people dead in Houston.\n Six officers were indicted last year, including Gerald Goines, who is accused of lying to obtain a warrant, and Steven Bryant, who is accused of tampering with government records.\n Six other officers were indicted Monday, according to a statement from Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg. Those officers face a variety of charges including murder, tampering with government records and engaging in organized criminal activity.\n The raid took place January 28, 2019, when a tactical team raided the home of Rhogena Nicholas and Dennis Tuttle, who were both killed along with their dog. Several Houston officers on the team were injured in the raid, including Goines.\n \"The consequences of corruption are that two innocent people and their dog were shot to death in their home by police; four officers were shot, one paralyzed, and now all of them will face jurors who will determine their fate,\" Ogg's statement read.\n The Harris County District Attorney's Office Civil Rights Division investigated the raid and determined that Goines lied to obtain a warrant for a \"no-knock\" raid from a municipal judge, and misrepresented the victims' drug activity, threat level and other factors. He claimed a criminal informant bought heroin from a man at the address the day before and that the man selling drugs was known to have a gun.\n Last year, prosecutors said Bryant misrepresented facts surrounding the scene and the purchase of the drugs. Bryant gave a supplement to the original report that contained falsehoods, the prosecutor said.\n The investigation also found that officers were \"involved in a long-term scheme to steal overtime from the city,\" Ogg's statement read.\n Former Houston police officer Felipe Gallegos was indicted for the death of Tuttle, according to court documents. His attorney, Rusty Hardin, said Tuesday Gallegos didn't start shooting during the raid until two other officers had already been shot.\n \"A Harris County grand jury at the request of the District Attorney's Office indicted a hero,\" Hardin said. \"It appears they (Tuttle and Nicholas) were innocent of drug activity at that scene as alleged. But once they started shooting, or once Mr. Tuttle started shooting, he was not innocent. And there is no question, and nobody will contradict that Mr. Tuttle started shooting at the officers.\"\n Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tweeted a statement Monday saying he's \"disheartened\" the process to indict these officers took so long. An officer who was willing to testify was not given the opportunity, Acevedo said.\n \"I have said many times that the other officers involved in the incident, including the officer indicted today, had no involvement in obtaining the warrant and responded appropriately to the deadly threat posed to them during its service,\" Acevedo said, adding that all current active officers who were indicted were relieved of duty.\n CNN's Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) It's been a year since Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash, and teammates and loved ones are still coming to terms with the loss.\n (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n President Biden says he hopes the US will soon be able to administer 1.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine a day, and the Defense Department is considering deploying thousands of troops to help reach that goal. One official said up to 10,000 troops could be involved. While Americans wait for vaccinations, health officials say they're extremely worried about new Covid-19 variants detected in the US. One expert says everyday activities are now much more dangerous because of them. In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the country's borders may stay shut for most of the year to ward off outbreaks. At the core of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, the city of Manaus offers a cautionary tale for health care systems on the brink of collapse: tens of thousands of new graves, no beds or oxygen tanks and a second wave promising even more misery.\n Biden has taken 33 executive actions in his first six days in office, and there are more to come. Some of these are aimed at bolstering economic stimulus initiatives, which could affect Americans who haven't gotten stimulus money yet or are waiting on unemployment or housing assistance. Other developments: Janet Yellen has officially been confirmed as the first woman to be treasury secretary, and the administration says it will have an American Sign Language interpreter at all White House news briefings. Meanwhile, the Senate is finally moving forward on a power-sharing agreement after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell demanded that Democrats not dismantle the filibuster, the classic legislative stalling technique. Now, the 50-50 Senate can officially organize so Democrats can take control of key committees.\n Former President Trump is assembling a full legal team for his Senate impeachment trial, which starts in early February. Biden says that while he doubts enough Senate Republicans will vote to convict Trump and disqualify him from holding office in the future, the proceedings must happen. Further, nine prominent Republican lawyers, including two former officials in the Trump administration, have signed a letter urging GOP senators to \"consider the evidence\" before deciding how to vote, strongly implying that if the evidence leads them there, they should not choose partisanship over conviction. Elsewhere in Trump's circle, Dominion Voting Systems is suing Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani for defamation, seeking $1.3 billion in damages. The election technology company has been at the center of baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud, which Giuliani has promoted.\n Hundreds of thousands of farmers drove their tractors into the Indian capital of New Delhi today as part of ongoing, nationwide protests against controversial agricultural laws farmers say put their livelihoods at risk. Some farmers have been camping out outside the city in protest for up to two months. The massive displays of discontent have been a significant challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Months of demonstrations across the country have so far only resulted in deadlocked talks between farmers and his administration. Today's planned protests coincide with India's Republic Day, a national holiday that marks the first time India's constitution went into effect in 1950 following independence from British colonial rule.\n Puerto Rico is declaring a state of emergency over gender-based violence after a wave of killings targeting women and transgender people. Newly minted Gov. Pedro Pierluisi announced an executive order aimed at preventing and protecting against gender-based violence through a number of programs, including a committee tasked with providing education, support and rescue around gender violence. The order is the culmination of years of efforts by activists and advocacy organizations to demand action in the US territory against the rise of gender-based violence, which has worsened in the face of the pandemic and natural disasters like 2017's Hurricane Maria. Pierluisi says the state of emergency will last until the end of June 2022.\n The invisible hand moves out of spite.\n A+ dog names.\n He says it could help tourism, but Bigfoot probably doesn't agree.\n For when you want to be so awake you can TASTE SOUND.\n What's Detroit-style?

        "body_text": "London (CNN Business) The pandemic could slam the brakes on a global economic turnaround this year despite mass vaccination programs and unprecedented levels of stimulus, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n The IMF expects the global economy to grow by 5.5% this year, it said on Tuesday, or 0.3 percentage points faster than its previous forecast in October. The upgrade reflects \"expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity later in the year and additional policy support in a few large economies,\" the group said. (The IMF estimates that the world economy shrank by 3.5% in 2020, its biggest peacetime contraction since the Great Depression.)\n But it also warned that surging infections in late 2020, renewed lockdowns and logistical problems with vaccine distribution could hamstring growth. If new variants of the coronavirus also prove difficult to contain, global output this year would be 0.75% less than the IMF expects.\n Looking further ahead, the IMF expects global growth to slow to 4.2% in 2022.\n \"Much now depends on the outcome of this race between a mutating virus and vaccines to end the pandemic, and on the ability of policies to provide effective support until that happens,\" Gita Gopinath, chief economist of the IMF, said in a blog post.\n Some countries will recover more quickly than others. China, which was the only major economy to grow in 2020, is forecast to achieve growth of 8.1% this year. The United States should emerge from its deep slump to expand by 5.1%, a pace that's 2 percentage points faster than the IMF predicted in October.\n The 19 countries that use the euro are expected to see growth of 4.2% in 2021. The United Kingdom, which endured a 10% contraction last year as it left the European Union and is now battling a new coronavirus variant, would rebound with relatively modest growth of 4.5%.\n \"The wide divergence reflects to an important extent differences across countries in behavioral and public health responses to infections, flexibility and adaptability of economic activity to low mobility, preexisting trends, and structural rigidities entering the crisis,\" the IMF said.\n The pandemic is causing \"exceptional uncertainty,\" according to the IMF.\n \"Although new restrictions following the surge in infections (particularly in Europe) suggest growth could be weaker than projected in early 2021, other factors pull the distribution of risks in the opposite direction,\" the IMF said.\n If the vaccine distribution and efficacy go smoothly, for example, output could exceed expectations by as much as 1% globally, with companies hiring and expanding capacity in anticipation of rising demand.",

        "title": "Blinken becomes Biden's top diplomat after a friendship forged over decades",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) It was February 2008 when a snowstorm suddenly overwhelmed the flight path of two American helicopters, forcing them to make an unexpected landing on a mountaintop in Afghanistan.\n On board the aircrafts overlooking Taliban territory were Joe Biden and Antony Blinken, his then-top adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with a few other members of the committee, according to two sources on the trip.\n When the helicopters landed, soldiers accompanying them established a perimeter around the narrow mountain peak while they decided what to do next. Blinken hopped out of his helicopter to check on Biden.\n The source on the trip told CNN that they \"remember Tony being unbelievably calm throughout the entire thing and occasionally quite funny. He did not blame anyone for what had happened.\"\n \"Tony just knew how to keep everything under control. He mirrors Biden in that way. They are both calm under pressure,\" they said.\n Blinken, the newly confirmed secretary of state, has worked with Biden for almost 20 years, and many describe him as having the closest personal relationship with the President of anybody in the Cabinet. They forged that bond in the field, on a tremendous number of foreign trips they took together when Biden was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but also through a US presidential campaign, the shared experience of personal loss and ties between their families.\n Over the years, Biden has relied on Blinken to deal with crisis scenarios in an even-keeled manner, to morph his foreign policy ideas into reality, to support his political endeavors, and to be a loyal friend.\n \"Tony has been a part of Joe's evolution, learning, and changes as he has confronted challenge after challenge over decades,\" said Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on the foreign relations committee and called Blinken \"an irreplaceable part of Joe Biden's inner core team.\"\n Blinken is expected to be privy to every major decision Biden makes as President, according to multiple sources who spoke with CNN. That deep level of involvement will be driven by Biden administration's belief that foreign policy is intrinsically tied to domestic policy and the need to strengthen democracy at home, but it is also a reflection of their sturdy comfortable relationship, the sources explained.\n \"They will continue to nurture their relationship, and it will be wide ranging,\" said an official who is planning to join Blinken's State Department. \"They will see each other a lot. And some of it may be over casual dinners at the White House.\"\n When Blinken began working with Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2002, the Iraq War debate was ongoing, accelerating their relationship, which may have otherwise matured at a slower pace.\n \"The war drums were beating,\" said a source who was working on the committee at the time. \"The relationship forged pretty quickly.\"\n Blinken worked alongside Biden when he voted in favor the Iraq War -- a vote that has been repeatedly scrutinized, and one that Biden and Blinken have both said Biden regretted.\n After that initial bonding experience over the most fundamental foreign policy question of war and peace, Blinken was involved in almost every foreign policy declaration or policy that Biden put forth during his time in the Senate and as vice president.\n Even when Biden went against the grain -- for example, in advocating for a smaller troop presence in Afghanistan when other national security officials advocated for a troop surge in the early days of the Obama administration -- Blinken advocated for his views at the interagency level and fine-tuned the policy Biden was driving it forth.\n \"Blinken channels Biden's passion and energy into a constructive outcome,\" said the source on the Afghanistan trip.\n \"It was Biden's style to absorb information and give feedback extemporaneously, in the moment, which does not lead to a crisp foreign policy paper,\" said the source who worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with them. \"But Blinken is skilled in communications and writing. He could do it.\"\n Blinken's tight-knit relationship with Biden is what career diplomats and those close to Blinken's inner circle expect to fuel his efficacy as America's top diplomat.\n \"The challenge always with the secretary of state and the president is does the secretary of state really speak for the president? And when he says something, does the foreign government that he's talking to believe that that is what the president actually thinks?,\" former career US diplomat Lew Lukens told CNN. \"When Tony Blinken travels the world, people will know what he says is what Joe Biden believes and thinks. He speaks for the President, and that is incredibly important for a secretary of state. And we didn't always have that.\"\n Blinken has not solely been a foreign policy adviser to Biden, he has also been intimately involved in aspects of Biden's political career.\n In 2008, the night Biden got home from being announced in Springfield as Barack Obama's running mate, he had a couple staffers up from Washington to his home to plan. Blinken was one of just four, explained a source who worked with them on the campaign. After that, he went on the road with Biden as he traveled the country campaigning.\n \"Truthfully, almost all of the messaging and speeches day in and day out were about domestic issues, not foreign policy. But Sen. Biden wanted Tony there by his side because he knew the presidency was always shaped by foreign policy decisions, and he wanted uninterrupted time with Tony to plan. But he also wanted something else: a friend and trusted confidante,\" said the source who worked with them on the 2008 campaign. \"As many of us on the plane were falling asleep, you could usually see a light on up in the front two seats, and it was Sen. Biden and Tony talking late into the night.\"\n And there is another layer that deepens the connection: Blinken's wife, Evan Ryan, was Biden's deputy campaign manager when he ran for the nomination in 2008. After working on the Biden transition, Ryan is now serving in the Biden White House as the executive secretary.\n The two couples have been loyal friends throughout times of hardship when they have experienced family loss, according to sources familiar with their relationship. Biden's father died in September of 2002 when he first met Blinken, and then in 2015, Blinken's stepfather and Biden's son, Beau Biden, both passed away.\n \"President Biden is personally close to both Tony Blinken and Evan Ryan and Tony has been an incredibly loyal, capable and effective adviser, staffer and personal friend of the sort that is rare in Washington,\" said Coons.\n CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Supreme Court Ends Emoluments Suits Against Trump",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday put an end to two lawsuits that had accused President Donald J. Trump of violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses by profiting from his hotels and restaurants in New York and Washington.\n In brief orders, the court wiped out rulings against Mr. Trump in the two cases and dismissed them as moot. There were no dissents noted.\n The move means that there will be no definitive Supreme Court ruling on the meaning of the two provisions of the Constitution concerning emoluments, a term that means compensation for labor or services. One provision, the domestic emoluments clause, bars the president from receiving \u201cany other emolument\u201d from the federal government or the states beyond his official compensation.\n The other provision, the foreign emoluments clause, bars anyone holding a federal \u201coffice of profit or trust\u201d from accepting \u201cany present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state\u201d without the consent of Congress.\n Federal appeals courts in New York and Virginia ruled against Mr. Trump on the preliminary issue of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to sue the president.\n The New York case was brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which represented competitors of Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses that said they had been disadvantaged by the payments he received.\n Noah Bookbinder, the group\u2019s executive director, said the lawsuit had served a valuable purpose.\n \u201cThis important litigation made the American people aware for four years of the pervasive corruption that came from a president maintaining a global business and taking benefits and payments from foreign and domestic governments,\u201d Mr. Bookbinder said in a statement. \u201cOnly Trump losing the presidency and leaving office ended these corrupt constitutional violations\u201d and stopped the lawsuits.\n The other case was brought by Maryland and the District of Columbia, which accused Mr. Trump of violating the Constitution by profiting from his Washington hotel.\n In a joint statement, Brian E. Frosh, Maryland\u2019s attorney general, and Karl A. Racine, the District of Columbia\u2019s attorney general, said they had sought to prove that \u201cPresident Trump illegally profited from his office by receiving improper emoluments in the form of money from foreign governments, federal agencies and state governments that conducted business at his hotel to curry favor with him and his administration.\u201d\n \u201cHistory will note that at every step of this case, President Trump and political appointees at the Department of Justice went to extreme lengths to prevent us from uncovering the true extent of his corruption,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe attempted to short-circuit the rules of legal procedure to have our case dismissed and avoid discovery into his finances, arguing that the law did not apply to him.\u201d\n A third emoluments lawsuit, brought by Democratic members of Congress, was dismissed in February by a federal appeals court in Washington. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.",

        "body_text": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n Maybe you\u2019ve read about the blockchain and don\u2019t get the fuss. (I am sheepishly raising my hand.) Maybe you\u2019ve never heard of it.\n My colleague Nathaniel Popper will explain what you need to know and separate the blockchain hope from the hype.\n Nathaniel spoke to me about why some technologists can\u2019t shut up about the blockchain and, in researching his latest article, what he found about how it might \u2014 or might not! \u2014 help people remodel the internet with less control by giants like Google and Facebook.\n Shira: I need this explained to me repeatedly. What is the blockchain? And how is it different from Bitcoin?\n Nathaniel: The blockchain in the simplest terms is a ledger \u2014 a method of record keeping \u2014 that was invented for Bitcoin, which is a cryptocurrency. Unlike conventional records kept by one bank or accountant, the blockchain ledger uses a bunch of computers that each add new entries visible to everyone.\n The blockchain design that Bitcoin inspired has been adapted for other kinds of records. The underlying principle is there is no central authority controlling a single ledger. Everyone who is part of the system controls a decentralized and shared record.\n What\u2019s an example of how this might work?\n A normal currency exchange might take your money, hold it and also hold the currency you buy. If it gets hacked, you could lose your money. With decentralized financial exchange based on the blockchain design, like what Bitcoin uses, you don\u2019t have to trust an authority with your money. Two people are automatically matched up through software, and they make the exchange directly with one another.\n Blockchains sound pie-in-the-sky.\n That\u2019s what I believed for a long time. But these blockchain ideas are shifting from concepts to living \u2014 though still clunky \u2014 experiments.\n On social networks like LBRY and Minds, people can see for themselves how it\u2019s different from YouTube or Facebook. The concept is that no company is in control or can delete your account. Each user can see that a posted video or other material wasn\u2019t altered by anyone else.\n Whether you agree or disagree with Twitter for kicking out Donald Trump\u2019s account after the attack on the Capitol, it\u2019s an interesting idea that under a blockchain-based design, he might have been able to take his more than 80 million Twitter followers to another social network instead of losing them all.\n It\u2019s going to be awhile before people can assess whether these blockchain applications really do what they propose and are an improvement over the status quo. Bitcoin has been around for a while and smart people still disagree about whether it\u2019s useful.\n There are always downsides. What are they for the blockchain?\n One big downside is that central authorities are efficient at building reliable software and fixing it when things break. With a decentralized network of computers and programmers, there\u2019s no boss to say that this flaw must be fixed in 20 minutes.\n And when there\u2019s a centralized system in finance or social networks, a government or another authority can stop terrorists or other criminals from using it. With blockchain-based designs, it\u2019s harder to exercise control.\n Why is there such fanatic devotion to Bitcoin and blockchains?\n Bitcoin is like a social movement. The people using the system feel like they\u2019re in charge because in essence they\u2019re making the system run. That\u2019s true for blockchain designs, too. They make people feel empowered in a way they aren\u2019t with conventional software.\n Bitcoin started with a lofty idea to democratize money. But now it\u2019s like Beanie Babies \u2014 a thing people buy to make money. Will the blockchain concept also degrade into something less pure?\n It\u2019s true, many people using Bitcoin are just betting it will go up in value. But Bitcoin also gives people an incentive to get used to the weird concept of big systems that aren\u2019t controlled by a single authority. It\u2019s likely that the excitement and even some of the greed around Bitcoin helped fuel these blockchain experiments.\n I\u2019ve been transfixed for days by the saga of a Reddit message board and its crusade involving the video game retailer GameStop.\n The short version: Several Wall Street professionals are betting that the price of GameStop stock will fall and are smugly confident they\u2019re right. A Reddit group called Wall Street Bets has been trying to prove them wrong or just mess with them by organizing to drive up GameStop\u2019s share price. The company\u2019s shares are going haywire. It\u2019s all weird and there are no heroes in this tale. (Check out Matt Levine\u2019s column in Bloomberg Opinion about this.)\n When I see the Redditors versus the Wall Street dudes, I\u2019m reminded of how being online has changed the way we relate to one another. There is no bright line between internet life and real life.\n Wall Street Bets exhibits the same kind of engaged, hyper-online social momentum that helped drive the presidential candidacies of Mr. Trump and Andrew Yang and is behind the Korean pop fans who make sure their favorite bands trend online and who engage in political activism.\n The GameStop campaign\u2019s swarming behavior, unity around a common cause and inside jokes \u2014 like the one about chicken tenders \u2014 have similar mechanics as the gaggles who harass gay and transgender video creators on TikTok and got a research ship named \u201cBoaty McBoatface\u201d a few years ago. (To be clear, stock trading campaigns aren\u2019t the same as harassing teenagers.)\n Ryan Broderick, an internet culture writer, wrote in his Garbage Day newsletter that the GameStop saga showed the similarities between social media and the stock market. \u201cIf you can create enough hype around something, through memes, conspiracy theories, and harassment campaigns, you can manifest it into reality,\u201d he wrote.\n My colleague Nellie Bowles wrote this week about the ways that working through screens has started to infuse office culture with the worst elements of aggressive internet conversations. That\u2019s not dissimilar to what\u2019s happening with this dark corner of stock market speculation. Humans are adapting to online life in ways that sometimes feel thrilling \u2014 and other times nihilistic and horrifying.\n May we all experience the joy that Nia Dennis, a U.C.L.A. gymnast, is having in this routine.

        "title": "Wealthy couple chartered a plane to the Yukon, took vaccines doses meant for Indigenous elders, authorities said",
        "body_text": "Located deep in Canada\u2019s Yukon, the remote community of Beaver Creek is home to only about 100 people, most of them members of the White River First Nation.\n So when an unfamiliar couple who claimed to work at a local motel showed up at a mobile clinic to receive coronavirus vaccines, it didn\u2019t take long for locals to become suspicious. Authorities soon found that the couple were actually wealthy Vancouver residents who had chartered a private plane to the isolated outpost so that they could get shots intended to protect vulnerable Indigenous elders.\n \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen or heard of such a despicable, disgusting sense of entitlement and lack of a moral compass,\u201d Mike Farnworth, the British Columbia solicitor general, said Monday, according to the Vancouver Sun.\n Canadian media outlets have identified the couple as casino executive Rodney Baker, 55, and his wife, Ekaterina Baker, a 32-year-old actress whose recent credits include the 2020 films \u201cFatman\u201d and \u201cChick Fight.\u201d Each faces fines totaling the equivalent of about $900 for violating quarantine guidelines. Neither could immediately be reached for comment late Monday, and it was not clear whether they have attorneys.\n Investor disclosures show that Baker earned more than $10.6 million in 2019 as CEO and president of the Great Canadian Gaming Corp., which owns more than 20 casinos across Canada and is the subject of a separate money laundering probe. He resigned Sunday after charges were filed. A spokesman said that Great Canadian \u201chas no tolerance for actions that run counter to the company\u2019s objectives and values.\u201d\n The White River First Nation, which wants to see stiffer penalties for the couple, said in a statement to The Washington Post that the relatively small fines would be \u201cessentially meaningless\u201d for such wealthy individuals.\n \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that because we are a predominantly Indigenous community, that they assumed we were naive,\u201d Chief Angela Demit said.\n In recent weeks, Yukon health workers have been traveling to rural areas and trying to vaccinate as many people as possible, and Demit noted that Beaver Creek and the White River First Nation were considered a priority \u201cgiven our remoteness, elderly and high-risk population, as well as limited access to health care.\u201d The nearest health clinic is more than three hours away, and the closest major hospital is in the city of Whitehorse, close to a five-hour drive.\n Authorities say the Bakers flew to Whitehorse early last week, and promised to spend two weeks in mandatory quarantine in a local hotel. Instead, they chartered a private plane to take them to Beaver Creek on Thursday. There, they were easily able to get their first shots of the Moderna vaccine. Many people who work in rural Yukon come from other parts of Canada, so proof of residency hasn\u2019t been required at traveling vaccination clinics, Yukon Community Services Minister John Streicker told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\n The couple claimed to be new hires at a nearby motel, but raised suspicions when they asked for a ride to the airport shortly after getting their shots, Streicker said. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018Well, why would you be going to the airport?\u2019\u201d he told the CBC.\n Workers from the vaccination clinic checked with the motel, and alerted law enforcement when they learned that the Bakers didn\u2019t work there.\n After finding that the Bakers had already checked out of the Whitehorse hotel where they were supposed to be quarantined, officers headed to the city\u2019s airport, arriving not long after the couple\u2019s charter flight returned from Beaver Creek. They intercepted the pair just as they were preparing to fly back to their luxury condo in downtown Vancouver.\n Though the Bakers were charged with violating quarantine protocols, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear they could face additional consequences for getting vaccines that were intended for rural Yukon residents. After Baker\u2019s resignation was announced, Farnworth told News1130 that \u201cthe fact the individual lost a $10 million a year job\u201d was probably a bigger penalty than anything his office could impose.\n But Janet Vander Meer, the head of the White River First Nation\u2019s coronavirus response team, argues that the couple should be held accountable in a way that will deter other Canadians from trying to take advantage of the same loophole. In a Monday statement, she called the incident \u201canother example of ongoing acts of oppression against Indigenous communities by wealthy individuals that thought they would get away with it,\u201d and pointed out that the breach of quarantine guidelines could have put vulnerable elders at risk.\n \u201cOur oldest resident of Beaver Creek, who is 88 years old, was in the same room as this couple. My mom, who\u2019s palliative, was in the same room as this couple,\u201d she told Globalnews.ca on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be jail time. I can\u2019t see anything less. For what our community has been through the last few days. The exhaustion. It\u2019s just mind-boggling.\u201d",

        "title": "Pentagon restricted commander of D.C. Guard ahead of Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "The commander of the D.C. National Guard said the Pentagon restricted his authority ahead of the riot at the U.S. Capitol, requiring higher-level sign-off to respond that cost time as the events that day spiraled out of control.\n Local commanders typically have the power to take military action on their own to save lives or prevent significant property damage in an urgent situation when there isn\u2019t enough time to obtain approval from headquarters.\n But Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, said the Pentagon essentially took that power and other authorities away from him ahead of the short-lived insurrection on Jan. 6. That meant he couldn\u2019t immediately roll out troops when he received a panicked phone call from the Capitol Police chief warning that rioters were about to enter the U.S. Capitol.\n \u201cAll military commanders normally have immediate response authority to protect property, life, and in my case, federal functions \u2014 federal property and life,\u201d Walker said in an interview. \u201cBut in this instance I did not have that authority.\u201d\n Walker and former Army secretary Ryan D. McCarthy, along with other top officials, briefed the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday behind closed doors about the events, the beginning of what is likely to become a robust congressional inquiry into the preparations for a rally that devolved into a riot at the Capitol, resulting in  five people dead and representing a significant security failure.\n The military, which isn\u2019t structured to be a first responder like law enforcement, took hours to arrive at the scene primarily because the Capitol Police and the District government hadn\u2019t asked the D.C. Guard to prepare a contingency force for a riot. The Capitol Police chief also didn\u2019t call Walker to tell him a request for Guard backup was imminent until about 25 minutes before rioters breached the Capitol.\n But the restrictions the Pentagon placed on Walker also contributed to the delay. He needed to wait for approval from McCarthy and acting defense secretary Christopher C. Miller before dispatching troops, even though some 40 soldiers were on standby as a quick reaction force. That standby force had been assembled in case the few hundred Guard members deployed that day on the District\u2019s streets to assist police with traffic control and crowd management needed help, Walker said.\n The Pentagon required the highest-level approval for any moves beyond that narrow mission, in part because its leaders had been lambasted for actions the D.C. Guard took during last June\u2019s racial justice protests, including helicopters that flew low over demonstrators in D.C. Top officials concluded those maneuvers resulted from \u201cfragmentary orders\u201d that hadn\u2019t received high-level approval and were looking to prevent a repeat of that situation.\n \u201cAfter June, the authorities were pulled back up to the secretary of defense\u2019s office,\u201d McCarthy said in comments to The Washington Post. \u201cAny time we would employ troops and guardsmen in the city, you had to go through a rigorous process. As you recall, there were events in the summer that got a lot of attention, and that was part of this.\u201d\n McCarthy said he worked hard to ensure authority was pushed back down the chain of command to Walker ahead of the inauguration, during which Walker oversaw the 25,600 troops that came to the District. As for the preparations ahead of Jan. 6, McCarthy said, \u201cIt was everyone just being very careful. When you go back to times when we\u2019ve done this, like June, we wanted to make sure we were very careful about the employment \u2014 careful about fragmentary orders.\u201d\n Had he not been restricted, Walker said he could have dispatched members of the D.C. Guard sooner. Asked how quickly troops could have reached the Capitol, which is two miles from the D.C. Guard headquarters at the Armory, Walker said, \u201cWith all deliberate speed \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re right down the street.\u201d\n Still, even if Walker had been able to send the troops on standby to the Capitol immediately, and round up others in the District, it\u2019s unclear how much that would have affected the situation, given the large size of the mob and the last-minute nature of the call for help.\n Walker recalled how Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who has since resigned, asked him on a call in the run-up to Jan. 6 to have National Guard troops at the ready.\n \u201cAll he said was, \u2018If I call you, will you be able to help?\u2019\u2009\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Yes, but I need permission. So send a formal request,\u2019 and I never got it, until after the fact.\u201d\n The request came, but only at 1:49 p.m. the day of the attempted insurrection. Sund called Walker to say rioters were about to breach the building and the Capitol Police would soon request urgent backup.\n \u201cI told him I had to get permission from the secretary of the Army and I would send him all available guardsmen but as soon as I got permission to do so,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI sent a message to the leadership of the Army, letting them know the request that I had received from Chief Sund.\u201d\n Permission from the Pentagon to activate the full D.C. Guard wouldn\u2019t come for another hour and fifteen minutes, according to a Defense Department timeline of events, as members of Congress barricaded themselves in their offices and hid from a marauding horde trying to undo the results of the Nov. 3 election. It would take nearly three hours before Miller authorized the D.C. Guard to \u201cre-mission\u201d and help the Capitol Police establish a perimeter around the Capitol.\n In the meantime, Sund dialed into a phone call with the Pentagon.\n In an interview with The Post, Sund recalled Army staff director, Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background.\u201d\n Piatt, in a statement, initially said he didn\u2019t make those remarks or any comments similar to them. Later, he backtracked, saying he didn\u2019t recall citing such concerns but note-takers in the room told him he may have said that. Piatt, who wasn\u2019t in the chain of command, was leading the call while waiting for the Army secretary to receive approval for the full activation of the D.C. Guard from Miller.\n Walker said a lot of people were on the chaotic call.\n \u201cThere was some talk about optics, but I can\u2019t assign that to one person,\u201d Walker said. \u201cFrom the Army leadership, there were quite a few people on the call. .\u2009.\u2009. It\u2019s clear that somebody talked about the optics. Who said that? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n Asked if the D.C. Guard leadership kept a record of the call, Walker said it wasn\u2019t recorded but Guard officials memorialized the conversation in notes known as a memorandum for record.\n In the days before the protest, all the living former defense secretaries warned the Pentagon not to get involved in the peaceful transition of power, after reports that former national security adviser Michael Flynn had raised the possibility with President Donald Trump of declaring martial law to \u201crerun\u201d the election.\n The day before the Jan. 6 event, a senior U.S. official told The Post the military had \u201clearned its lesson\u201d after being rebuked over Trump\u2019s heavy-handed response to racial justice protests last year. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the preparations, said the military would be \u201cabsolutely nowhere near the Capitol building\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to send the wrong message.\u201d\n Pentagon officials were also concerned that sending Guard troops who answered to the president into the Capitol during the riot could give the impression that the military was aiding Trump\u2019s supporters in a coup. Senior defense officials said federal law enforcement should always be in the lead clearing buildings, rather than soldiers, who shouldn\u2019t be the tip of the spear on U.S. soil.\n Members of the D.C. Guard ultimately arrived at the Capitol around 5:30 p.m. and helped establish a perimeter around the grounds. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) first called McCarthy, the Army secretary, to request an unspecified number of  troops at the scene four hours earlier.\n \u201cDo I wish I could have got there sooner?\u201d Walker said. \u201cOf course. I mean, I think everybody does. I absolutely wish I could have got there sooner. But, you know, I follow orders, and those making the decision went through a decision-making process.\u201d\n Whether the Guard could have arrived sooner at this point is \u201cprobably axiomatic,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to know: We got there and we made a difference upon arrival.\u201d\n Because the District is not a state, the president technically controls the D.C. Guard but defers his power to the defense secretary and Army secretary.\n Memos obtained by The Post show how tightly the Pentagon restricted Walker ahead of the events.\n In a Jan. 5 memo, the Army secretary, who is Walker\u2019s direct superior in the chain of command, prohibited him from deploying the quick reaction force composed of 40  soldiers on his own and said any rollout of that standby group would first require a \u201cconcept of operation,\u201d an exceptional requirement given that the force is supposed to respond to emergencies.\n McCarthy was also restricted by his superior, Miller. In a Jan. 4 memo, McCarthy was prohibited from deploying D.C. Guard members with weapons, helmets, body armor or riot control agents without defense secretary approval. McCarthy retained the power to deploy the quick reaction force \u201conly as a last resort.\u201d\n Miller, in a recent interview with Vanity Fair, dismissed accusations that the Defense Department dragged its feet in rolling out the Guard. \u201cOh, that is complete horse----,\u201d Miller said, contending the Pentagon leadership \u201chad their game together.\u201d\n Top Pentagon officials said they didn\u2019t deploy the quick reaction force during the riot because they hadn\u2019t approved a \u201cconcept of operations\u201d ahead of time with the Capitol Police.\n Walker said one takeaway from the Jan. 6 riot should be that when in doubt, city and federal authorities should always err on the side of requesting a contingency of National Guard troops to be at the ready in advance, even if they don\u2019t end up being used.\n Ahead of the event, Bowser made a narrow request for a D.C. Guard presence, resulting in about 340 personnel to help with traffic and crowd management and another 40 in the quick reaction force. In a letter, she cited the administration\u2019s problematic deployment of federal agents without insignia on the streets last year and said the District wasn\u2019t requesting any additional support.\n Days after the violence, Walker was tasked with overseeing the Guard members who filtered into the capital from across the nation to secure the inauguration. Walker said the Capitol Police have requested a contingent of about 7,000 of the 25,600 troops to stay until at least March 12.\n Walker expressed gratitude to the soldiers who showed up, and thanked their families and employers for contributing to a successful and secure event.\n \u201cPeople have jobs that they walked away from at a moment\u2019s notice. They have families that they walked away from at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThis is what the Guard has done since 1636.\u201d",

        "title": "Cabinet Picks: Comparing Biden and Trump\u2019s First Teams",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Among the most urgent tasks a new president faces is assembling a core group of advisers to serve in the cabinet.\n Donald J. Trump valued deal makers and personal wealth and demanded loyalty. In doing so, he created a cabinet of mostly wealthy, white men with limited experience in government, mirroring himself. His administration was the wealthiest of any American president\u2019s: His secretaries of education, commerce and the Treasury, as well as his first secretary of state were worth a total of at least $1.3 billion and as much as $2.9 billion, based on financial disclosures.\n President Biden has taken a different approach, turning to policymakers with government experience for most of his cabinet nominees, many of whom he has worked with for decades.\n The new president has also prioritized diversity in filling out his circle of top advisers. He is on track to assemble the most diverse cabinet in American history. Mr. Biden has nominated far more women and more nonwhite cabinet members than Mr. Trump, and has chosen the first openly gay person to be a cabinet-level secretary.\n Here is a look at some of their A-team lineups.\n Mr. Trump picked Steven Mnuchin, a wealthy financier with ties to Wall Street and Hollywood, to run the department that oversees tax, economic and debt policies. Mr. Mnuchin, who bankrolled movies including \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cAvatar,\u201d stepped into the position with no government experience after serving as the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. He had spent nearly 20 years at Goldman Sachs and later became involved in hedge funds. In 2009, Mr. Mnuchin was part of a group of investors that purchased a bank that had been seized during the financial crisis of 2008.\n Mr. Biden turned to Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair with a long career in economics whose work is well known, including about two decades at the Fed. She was a chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration. She was confirmed as Treasury secretary by a bipartisan vote of 84 to 15 and is the first woman to hold the post. Ms. Yellen is now responsible for helping Mr. Biden prepare the $1.9 trillion stimulus package he has proposed, steer it through Congress and \u2014 if it is approved \u2014 oversee the deployment of the relief money.\n Mr. Trump turned to Rex W. Tillerson, a globe-trotting chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who drew concerns from both Democrats and Republicans at the time over what appeared to be a cozy relationship with Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia. Mr. Trump at the time called Mr. Tillerson \u201ca world-class player and dealmaker\u201d and saw Mr. Tillerson\u2019s command of the oil business as an asset. \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cHe does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company.\u201d\n Mr. Biden chose Antony J. Blinken, his closest foreign policy adviser and a longtime aide who started working at the State Department during the Clinton administration. Mr. Blinken was Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser while he was vice president and helped to develop the country\u2019s response to the Arab Spring. He was also a key player in the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic efforts to assemble more than 60 countries to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n Mr. Trump picked Wilbur Ross, a wealthy investor and Trump campaign donor, to run the department, which comes with a portfolio of overseeing technology regulation, climate change policy and weather monitoring, gathering economic data, and promoting American industry. Mr. Ross made his fortune through private equity investments. At one point he was known as the \u201cking of bankruptcy\u201d for purchasing, restructuring and selling off steel makers and other industrial companies. He took on the role at 79 without any government experience.\n Gina M. Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island since 2015, has experience in both government and finance. Before she was governor, she was the state treasurer and founded a joint venture firm that helped finance a number of start-ups. She has been a rising star in the Democratic Party and has been praised for her push to reopen Rhode Island\u2019s schools during the coronavirus pandemic. She put public and private schools on the same calendar to streamline the plans and opened rapid virus testing sites just for students and teaching staff. She also set up a statewide contact tracing system for the schools.\n Mr. Trump picked Tom Price, a doctor who had been a Republican House member since 2005, to lead the department with a focus on dismantling the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of former President Barack Obama. When Mr. Price was chairman of the House Budget Committee, he backed plans to shift Medicare away from its open-ended commitment to pay for medical services, a move that could have increased costs for some people. Republicans said Mr. Price would bring a physician\u2019s eye to the department, which they said was filled with heavy-handed regulation.\n Mr. Biden has nominated Xavier Becerra, a former congressman and the attorney general in California, who with a profile on the issues of criminal justice and immigration had been thought to be a more likely candidate for attorney general. But he has for years fought the Trump administration on health care, among other issues, including the environment, immigration, education and civil rights. A day before Mr. Biden was sworn into office, Mr. Becerra announced that he would join a group of 18 attorneys general to fight the Trump administration\u2019s final Environmental Protection Agency rule, which scientists have said is designed to block new public health protections by limiting research the agency is allowed to consider. If confirmed, he would be the first Latino to serve in the position and a leader in Mr. Biden\u2019s battle against the pandemic.\n For the sprawling housing agency that oversees housing voucher and rental assistance programs for low-income families, neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Biden turned to someone with a background in housing policy.\n Mr. Trump chose Ben Carson, a retired renowned neurosurgeon with no government experience who briefly ran against Mr. Trump in the 2016 primaries. He became an early supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s. As a child, Mr. Carson at times relied on public assistance, growing up in an impoverished part of Detroit. But instead of championing that assistance, Mr. Carson sided with Republicans who believe welfare fosters dependency.\n Mr. Biden\u2019s choice, Marcia L. Fudge, has represented Ohio in the House since 2008, and she is a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Before that, she was the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. Though she had hoped to be Mr. Biden\u2019s agriculture secretary, she said she would be honored to lead the housing agency. She does not have experience working in housing policy, but she has focused on food security issues as the chairwoman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on nutrition.\n For the agency with a portfolio that includes oversight of the United States nuclear weapons arsenal, 17 national laboratories and a swath of energy research and development initiatives, including climate change programs, Mr. Trump turned to Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas. While Mr. Perry brought government experience to the job, he lacked a basic understanding of what the department he was tapped to lead did. During a failed presidential bid in 2011, he even called for its elimination. In his 2010 book, \u201cFed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington,\u201d Mr. Perry rejected the established science of human-caused climate change, calling it a \u201ccontrived, phony mess.\u201d\n Four years later, Mr. Biden picked Jennifer Granholm, a champion of renewable energy development and two-term governor of Michigan credited by some for pulling the state out of the 2008 recession. She does not have experience in the department\u2019s nuclear programs, but since she left office, she has advocated renewable energy as a way to help expand state economies, which Mr. Biden has focused on in his virus recovery plan. If confirmed, she will be a key member of Mr. Biden\u2019s team of climate change experts who are charged with confronting global warming.\n Mr. Trump chose Betsy DeVos, a wealthy philanthropist, Republican fund-raiser and major supporter of charter schools and vouchers, which allow students to use taxpayer money to pay tuition at private, religious and for-profit schools. During her confirmation process in 2017, the Senate was so divided about whether she should assume the post that Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie vote. Many educators felt that Ms. DeVos had a deep disconnect from public schools and questioned how she could manage such a large bureaucracy charged with overseeing education policy. Neither she nor her children attended public schools.\n Mr. Biden chose Miguel Cardona, the commissioner of Connecticut\u2019s Education Department, who both attended public schools as a child and taught in them during his teaching careers. He rose to become principal of one of the state\u2019s schools, and then as state education commissioner oversaw more than 1,800 employees. If confirmed, he would be the first Latino to lead the department and oversee plans for children disrupted by the pandemic to return to school.\n Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, came to the post with experience in challenging agency regulations on oil and gas policies and an agenda of undoing the Obama administration\u2019s climate change efforts. Before he took the job, he was the attorney general of Oklahoma, closely aligned with the fossil fuel industry. As attorney general, he was part of an effort behind a coordinated legal fight against the Obama administration\u2019s climate rules.\n Michael Regan, Mr. Biden\u2019s choice to run the agency, is North Carolina\u2019s top environmental regulator and credited for the largest coal-ash cleanup settlement in the country. He worked as an air quality specialist at the E.P.A. during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. If confirmed, Mr. Regan will help oversee the reconstruction of the agency after four years of Mr. Trump\u2019s unraveling of a half-century of pollution and climate regulations, and diminishing the science that underpinned them.",

        "title": "\u2018It\u2019s a shot at my reputation\u2019: Lauren Wolfe reacts to NYT\u2019s statement about her dismissal",
        "body_text": "Lauren Wolfe made no ripples last May when she started as a freelance editor at the New York Times. She worked three to six days a week as part of the paper\u2019s \u201clive updates\u201d team, covering coronavirus briefings, racial justice protests and the November elections. In addition, she bylined stories on Kellyanne Conway\u2019s positive coronavirus test, Minnesota\u2019s elections and the worldwide covid-19 death toll.\n None of that work, however, drew the sort of attention that Wolfe aroused with a Jan. 19 tweet: \u201cBiden landing at Joint Base Andrews now. I have chills,\u201d she wrote the day before the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris. Writer Glenn Greenwald, formerly of the Intercept, ripped the tweet:\n Brit Hume of Fox News chimed in:\n Wolfe deleted the tweet. Shortly thereafter, the Times severed its relationship with her, as journalist Yashar Ali reported:\n That development prompted a fresh round of commentary on Twitter, this one aimed at the Times. What was the basis for this move? What prompted it? Don\u2019t other Times journalists veer into opinion on social media? As reported by The Post\u2019s Jeremy Barr, the Times subsequently issued this statement:\n What a dreadful statement: On the one hand, the Times wishes to limit \u201cthe details of personnel matters.\u201d On the other hand, it clearly insinuates that there were unspecified instances of substandard performance by Wolfe. When the Erik Wemple Blog asked the Times to provide some specifics, spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha declined to comment further.\n During an interview with this blog, Wolfe said that an editor at the paper contacted her after she published the \u201cchills\u201d tweet. The Times couldn\u2019t be associated with such a tweet, said the manager, and that her gig with the paper would be ending. Months ago, recalls Wolfe, she received a warning from the same manager about her Twitter activity; as an example, he cited a tweet in which, Wolfe says, she\u2019d connected the resistance of conservative men to wearing masks to \u201ctoxic masculinity.\u201d She deleted the tweet. But, according to Wolfe, the manager said her posts in general were \u201cborderline\u201d and that other Times staffers had done \u201cworse.\u201d Last week\u2019s tweet was \u201cthe only reason they fired me,\u201d Wolfe says.\n The controversy has upended Wolfe. The freelance arrangement was going well, she told this blog. She received a lot of praise from her colleagues, she says, and was awaiting a chat with her supervisors about joining the live team at the paper on a full-time basis. On her Twitter feed, Wolfe has tried to calm the outrage to the Times\u2019s handling of the controversy:\n Such sentiment is consistent with Wolfe\u2019s comments to the Erik Wemple Blog. \u201cThe people I\u2019m mad at are the people who put out the statement,\u201d says Wolfe. \u201cI respected tremendously the people I worked with. I respected them to the end of the earth and still do. They were the end-all, the be-all.\u201d\n The stint on the \u201clive\u201d team was a \u201cdream job\u201d for Wolfe, a former columnist at Foreign Policy and author of a years-long investigation of violent rapes against children in a village in eastern Congo. That it ended with the Times issuing a statement promoting speculation about her job performance has been painful. \u201cEvery day, I was scared I was going to do something wrong,\u201d says Wolfe, noting that her edits and her reporting were clean. \u201cSo whatever they\u2019re implying, it\u2019s a shot at my reputation, which I worked very carefully to build.\u201d\n As for the reputation of Wolfe\u2019s former employer, the Times\u2019s social media policy includes this guidance: \u201cIf our journalists are perceived as biased or if they engage in editorializing on social media, that can undercut the credibility of the entire newsroom. We\u2019ve always made clear that newsroom employees should avoid posting anything on social media that damages our reputation for neutrality and fairness.\u201d\n Those guidelines are in steady need of reinforcement. In the early days of the Trump era, the Times issued repeated memos to its newsroom concerning social-media hygiene. \u201cAs I\u2019ve noted before, people following Times newsroom staffers online expect them to be well-informed and thoughtful. But we should leave the editorializing to our colleagues on the Opinion side,\u201d noted Times standards editor Phil Corbett in a September 2016 memo. The Post\u2019s Paul Farhi, weeks later, flagged derisive tweets about Trump from reporters at the Times, among other outlets. In October 2017, the newspaper issued the current guidance. In another notable Times-Twitter episode, the newspaper in 2019 demoted Jonathan Weisman, a deputy Washington editor, for arguing that \u201csaying @RashidaTlaib (D-Detroit) and @IlhanMN (D-Minneapolis) are from the Midwest is like saying @RepLloydDoggett (D-Austin) is from Texas or @repjohnlewis (D-Atlanta) is from the Deep South. C\u2019mon.\u201d\n All of which is to say that the Times will never achieve a uniformly enforced standard for the social media behavior of its journalists. Each tweet is different from the next; each tweeter occupies a different rung on the paper\u2019s hierarchy; and each controversy comes at a different moment in the national political mood.\n In light of that reality, the Times should consider junking its language about journalists being \u201cperceived as biased.\u201d Thanks to the work of unprincipled folks in American politics, the mere expression of an opinion, or an emotion, is now viewed as evidence of ingrained bias. Opinion and bias are not the same.\n News organizations\u2019 perpetual quests to stifle their journalists\u2019 opinions \u2014 whether uttered on Twitter, at a conference, or in a recorded chat published by Project Veritas \u2014 is an Sisyphean struggle. And while the Times deals with that reality, it needs to issue a new statement about its actions regarding Wolfe \u2014 one that, in accordance with Times standards, shows more \u201crespect for the individuals involved.\u201d\n Read more from Erik Wemple:\n Why did the Washington Post alter its profile of Maya Harris?\n Maybe Joe Biden can rescue Saturdays\n Speak up, Bret Baier. Speak up, Chris Wallace.\n Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s cowardly exit\n Politico\u2019s revolt over Ben Shapiro guest-hosting Playbook went too far",

        "title": "McConnell Relents in First Filibuster Skirmish, but the War Rages On",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell on Monday dropped his demand that the new Democratic Senate majority promise to preserve the filibuster \u2014 which Republicans could use to obstruct President Biden\u2019s agenda \u2014 ending an impasse that had prevented Democrats from assuming full power even after their election wins.\n In his negotiations with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new majority leader, Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had refused to agree to a plan for organizing the chamber without a pledge from Democrats to protect the filibuster, a condition that Mr. Schumer had rejected.\n But late Monday, as the stalemate persisted, Mr. McConnell found a way out by pointing to statements by two centrist Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, that said they opposed getting rid of the procedural tool \u2014 a position they had held for months \u2014 as enough of a guarantee to move forward without a formal promise from Mr. Schumer.\n \u201cWith these assurances, I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement.\n Democrats had been anticipating a capitulation by Mr. McConnell and said they believed he had overreached in the negotiation.\n \u201cWe\u2019re glad Senator McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand,\u201d said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. \u201cWe look forward to organizing the Senate under Democratic control and start getting big, bold things done for the American people.\u201d\n But as in past fights over the filibuster, the outcome is likely to be only a temporary solution. As they press forward on Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda, Democrats will come under mounting pressure from activists to jettison the rule, which effectively requires 60 votes to advance any measure, should Republicans use it regularly to stall or stop the administration\u2019s priorities.\n Even some lawmakers who have backed the filibuster strongly said they could change their minds if Republicans engaged in constant obstruction.\n \u201cI feel pretty damn strongly, but I will also tell you this: I am here to get things done,\u201d said Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana. \u201cIf all that happens is filibuster after filibuster, roadblock after roadblock, then my opinion may change.\u201d\n Mr. Tester is among those key to the rapidly developing showdown over the fate of the filibuster, the signature feature of the Senate \u2014 a once rarely employed weapon now used routinely to stall action in the gridlocked institution \u2014 that holds heavy consequences for Mr. Biden\u2019s presidency.\n Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand for a pre-emptive surrender on the filibuster had infuriated Democrats who regarded it as evidence that the Republican leader intends to obstruct Mr. Biden\u2019s proposals on pandemic relief, immigration, climate change, health care and more.\n \u201cMitch McConnell will not dictate to the Senate what we should do and how we should proceed,\u201d Mr. Schumer said Sunday. \u201cMcConnell is no longer the majority leader.\u201d\n The stalemate created a bizarre situation in which most Senate committees were frozen under Republican control and new senators could not be seated on the panels even though Democrats now command the Senate majority.\n Beyond the immediate logistical effects, the feud reflected a challenging dynamic in the 50-50 Senate for Mr. Biden. By holding out against Democrats eager to take charge, Mr. McConnell was exercising what leverage he had. But he also foreshadowed an eventual clash in the chamber that might otherwise have taken months to unfold over how aggressive Democrats should be in seeking to accomplish Mr. Biden\u2019s top priorities.\n Democrats say they must retain at least the threat that they could one day end the filibuster, arguing that bowing to Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand now would only have emboldened Republicans to deploy it constantly, without fear of retaliation.\n \u201cWell that\u2019s a nonstarter because if we gave him that, then the filibuster would be on everything, every day,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\"\n At issue is a rule that is at the heart of the consensus-driven Senate, which effectively mandates that any legislation draw 60 votes to advance. But like everything else in the chamber, the rule itself is subject to change if senators agree. As the majority party, Democrats could move to eliminate the filibuster and force through a change to the rules on a simple majority vote \u2014 a move known as detonating the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 if all 50 of their members held together and Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote.\n As chances rose over the past year that Democrats could win control of the White House and Congress, speculation mounted over whether they would take such action should Republicans dig in against Mr. Biden. But no one anticipated that Mr. McConnell would bring the fight to a boil right from the start by entangling the filibuster in the basic work of setting up the Senate for the next two years through what is known as an organizing resolution, which requires Senate approval.\n In calling for the Democratic commitment, Mr. McConnell noted that Democrats relied on the filibuster themselves when Donald J. Trump was president and Republicans held the Senate.\n \u201cDemocrats used it constantly, as they had every right to,\u201d he said last week on the floor. \u201cThey were happy to insist on a 60-vote threshold for practically every measure or bill I took up.\u201d\n Mr. Schumer said little of his strategy for rebuffing Mr. McConnell, other than calling his demand unacceptable. The new majority leader seemed to let Democrats and Mr. Biden, a former longtime senator who has been reluctant to overturn the filibuster, simmer over Republican tactics.\n Yet Mr. Tester made it clear that Mr. McConnell\u2019s tactics could rapidly change his view of the issue.\n \u201cBut if, in fact, Mitch is going put up roadblocks and filibuster the organizing resolution, then I think Schumer has to take it to the floor,\u201d Mr. Tester said.\n Mr. Manchin had not changed his position even though Mr. McConnell\u2019s demand was preventing Mr. Manchin from taking the helm of a committee of his own. In a 50-50 Senate, his defection alone would prevent the elimination of the rule.\n \u201cI\u2019m in the minority of the caucus on this, I\u2019m sure of that,\u201d Mr. Manchin told reporters last week. \u201cI think basically Chuck has the right to do what\u2019s he\u2019s doing. He has the right to use that leverage in whatever he wants to do. I\u2019m not worried about that at all. They will work it out. I just haven\u2019t changed where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n Still, Mr. McConnell appeared to have the backing of other Republicans, including moderates who are empowered by the 60-vote requirement, who said they too wanted assurances that Democrats would not upend the filibuster.\n \u201cIncluding some kind of d\u00e9tente on the filibuster is important,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who said it was not an issue in 2001 because no one at the time would have contemplated eliminating it. \u201cIt was not even a subject that was even thought about, and so it\u2019s a different environment.\u201d\n As for Mr. Biden, the White House says his position in support of the filibuster has not changed, though he gave some mixed signals during the campaign. Mr. Schumer and Senate Democrats would be very unlikely to proceed with scrapping the practice without the endorsement of Mr. Biden, particularly because they would need Ms. Harris\u2019s vote to do so.\n Mr. Tester said the filibuster had a role to play because it can lead to legislation that can \u201cstand the test of time,\u201d rather than lock Congress in a cycle where one party is always trying to undo partisan legislation passed by the other. But his patience is not infinite.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to sit at my desk and wait for no votes to happen,\u201d he said.",

On his nature, on yours, on what his and your histories are, on what he was thinking, if at all, etc.\n So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got:\n You\u2019re right, of course, that he should have told you right away.\n And it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re framing it in terms of what his silence says about you. As in, \u201cDoes my husband think I don\u2019t care?\u201d Reasonable position.\n But I suspect his reasons are about him, not you. He\u2019s in denial, or out of sorts, or thinking he\u2019ll get around to it eventually, or whatever.\n You know your husband well, presumably? So there\u2019s a lot of context here for sure. Look to that context to figure out what his motivation is most likely to be.\n Readers\u2019 thoughts:\n \u25cfI\u2019m your husband. I didn\u2019t tell people I was moving or that I was pregnant or getting married or getting a new job. That\u2019s just not who I am. I don\u2019t like talking about feelings. If I\u2019d gotten this news, I wouldn\u2019t have shared it with my husband either.\n In fact, I have gotten news like that and haven\u2019t shared it. It\u2019s partially because I think my husband doesn\u2019t really like my family \u2014 and partially because I don\u2019t want to talk about it. It is what it is, and talking won\u2019t change that. (A not very typically feminine approach, I know.) There\u2019s not anything anyone else can do, and I don\u2019t need my husband to do anything for me anyway.\n I deal with things the way I need to deal with them, and so does your husband. If you make a big deal out of this, he\u2019s just going to feel bad because of what he\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d to do/feel.\n \u25cfPerhaps he didn\u2019t share because he knew you would freak out. He could deal with his dad\u2019s illness but not your anxiety about it?",

        "title": "NFL teams with CDC on a paper explaining what it learned about containing the coronavirus",
        "body_text": "Medical leaders of the NFL and the NFL Players Association teamed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to release a jointly written scientific paper detailing the lessons from the league\u2019s coronavirus protocols and operations during its nearly completed season that could be applied beyond football.\n \u201cWe hope that our experience will have benefits for public health generally, and we\u2019re pleased that the CDC was willing to engage with us on that topic,\u201d Jeff Miller, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy, said Monday.\n The release of the paper comes after the league completed its 256-game regular season in the standard 17 weeks while operating with daily coronavirus testing of players, coaches and team staff members and strict and ever-tightening protocols. The NFL has played 12 of the 13 games in its postseason, with only the Super Bowl, scheduled for Feb. 7 in Tampa, remaining.\n \u201cI think \u2026 we were able to show that you can play a team sport while minimizing risk to the participants,\u201d said Allen Sills, the NFL\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cIt does require everyone to do their part every day. It also requires some modification of certain activities \u2014 for example, the virtual meetings that we describe in the paper and how that was an important part of risk mitigation.\u201d\n The NFL\u2019s methodology for classifying high-risk close contacts to an individual who tests positive \u2014 with consideration given to factors such as setting, ventilation and mask usage in addition to the proximity of duration of an interaction \u2014 and its management of its quarantines are among the lessons cited.\n \u201cI think we learned and reported \u2026 that all close contacts are not created equal,\u201d Sills said. \u201cThere are some contacts that convey a much higher risk, and circumstances really matter. And so we\u2019ve been able to evolve our understanding away from simple basics of six feet and 15 minutes, which is maybe where we all started back in the early days of the pandemic. I think another important takeaway is that we learned that high-risk close contacts are avoidable.\u201d\n The NFL and NFLPA have conducted daily testing since training camps opened last summer and have used electronic tracking devices to conduct contact tracing following positive tests. But Sills said the league\u2019s methods and findings can be applied in settings with fewer resources available.\n \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that what our work shows is that the most impactful interventions were not those that were high-resource such as daily testing or the proximity tracking devices,\u201d Sills said. \u201cThe most impactful interventions are things that can be applied anywhere no matter the resources, things such as universal use of face masks, moving meetings outside or minimizing the amount of in-person meetings, closing dining rooms, offering only to-go food options, strictly enforcing quarantines after exposure. Those things all have broad applicability beyond football.\u201d\n Even with caseloads at elevated levels nationally, the NFL held its conference championship games Sunday after a week in which there were no new positive tests for any members of the participating teams. But the league also dealt with major outbreaks on the Tennessee Titans and Baltimore Ravens during the regular season, along with numerous positive tests, disruptions to operations and game postponements affecting many teams.\n \u201cWe essentially have a real-world look at 32 different communities that have been followed over a six- to seven-month period of time,\u201d Sills said, \u201cand that data simply doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else.\u201d",

The woman told police that one of the times Shiflett choked her to the point that she couldn't breathe, and she felt like she was going to die.\n The woman told police she slapped Shiflett in self-defense and he slapped her back and admitted to choking her, the affidavit said.\n A background check run by Northern York County Regional Police conducted for Shiflett produced an active warrant for his arrest for theft. He was immediately taken into custody, according to the affidavit.\n Shiflett was arrested on January 10, charged with simple assault, along with making terroristic threats, harassment and one count of strangulation. His initial court appearance occurred January 19 and he is being held on $20,000 bail, according to court documents filed in York County Magisterial District Court.\n CNN has reached out to Shiflett and Walt Disney World for comment, but at the time of publishing, it has not heard back from either party.",

        "title": "Biden to reopen ACA insurance marketplaces as pandemic has cost millions of Americans their coverage",
        "body_text": "President Biden is scheduled to take executive actions as early as Thursday to reopen federal marketplaces selling Affordable Care Act health plans and to lower recent barriers to joining Medicaid.\n The orders will be Biden\u2019s first steps since taking office to help Americans gain health insurance, a prominent campaign goal that has assumed escalating significance as the pandemic has dramatized the need for affordable health care \u2014 and deprived millions of Americans coverage as they have lost jobs in the economic fallout.\n Under one order, HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace for Americans who cannot get affordable coverage through their jobs, will swiftly reopen for at least a few months, according to several individuals inside and outside the administration familiar with the plans. Ordinarily, signing up for such coverage is tightly restricted outside a six-week period late each year.\n Another part of Biden\u2019s scheduled actions, the individuals said, is intended to reverse Trump-era changes to Medicaid that critics say damaged Americans\u2019 access to the safety-net insurance. It is unclear whether Biden\u2019s order will undo a Trump-era rule allowing states to impose work requirements, or simply direct federal health officials to review rules to make sure they expand coverage to the program that insures about 70\u00a0million low-income people in the United States.\n The actions are part of a series of rapid executive orders the president is issuing in his initial days in office to demonstrate he intends to steer the machinery of government in a direction far different from that of his predecessor.\n Biden has been saying for many months that helping people get insurance is a crucial federal responsibility. Yet until the actions planned for this week, he has not yet focused on this broader objective, shining a spotlight instead on trying to expand vaccinations and other federal responses to the pandemic.\n The most ambitious parts of Biden\u2019s campaign health-care platform would require Congress to provide consent and money. Those include creating a government insurance option alongside the ACA health plans sold by private insurers, and helping poor residents afford ACA coverage if they live in about a dozen states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs under the decade-old health law.\n A White House spokesman declined to discuss the plans. Two HHS officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity about an event the White House has not announced, said Monday they were anticipating that the event would be held on Thursday.\n According to a document obtained by The Washington Post, the president also intends to sign an order rescinding the so-called Mexico City rule, which compels nonprofits in other countries that receive federal family planning aid to promise not to perform or encourage abortions. Biden advisers last week previewed an end to this rule, which for decades has reappeared when Republicans occupied the White House and vanished under Democratic presidents.\n The document also says Biden will disavow a multinational antiabortion declaration that the Trump administration signed three months ago.\n The actions to expand insurance through the ACA and Medicaid come as the Supreme Court is considering two cases that could shape the outcome. One case is an effort to overturn rulings by lower federal courts, which have held that state rules, requiring some residents to work or prepare for jobs to qualify for Medicaid, are illegal. The other case involves an attempt to overturn the entire ACA.\n According to the individuals inside and outside the administration, the order to reopen the federal insurance marketplaces will be framed in the context of the pandemic, essentially saying that anyone eligible for ACA coverage who has been harmed by the coronavirus will be allowed to sign up.\n \u201cThis is absolutely in the covid age and the recession caused by covid,\u201d said a health-care policy leader who has been in discussions with the administration. \u201cThere is financial displacement we need to address,\u201d said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe plans the White House has not announced.\n The reopening of HealthCare.gov will be accompanied by an infusion of federal support to draw attention to the opportunity through advertising and other outreach efforts. This, too, reverses the Trump administration\u2019s stance that supporting such outreach was wasteful. During its first two years, it slashed money for advertising and for community groups known as navigators that helped people enroll.\n It is not clear whether restoring outreach will be part of Biden\u2019s order or will be done more quietly within federal health-care agencies.\n Federal rules already allow people to qualify for a special enrollment period to buy ACA health plans if their circumstances change in important ways, including losing a job. But such exceptions require people to seek permission individually, and many are unaware they can do so. Trump health officials also tightened the rules for qualifying for special enrollment.\n In contrast, Biden is expected to open enrollment without anyone needing to seek permission, said Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy for Families USA, a consumer health-advocacy group.\n In the early days of the pandemic, the health insurance industry and congressional Democrats urged the Trump administration to reopen HealthCare.gov, the online federal ACA enrollment system on which three dozen states rely, to give more people the opportunity to sign up. At the end of March, Trump health officials decided against that.\n During the most recent enrollment period, ending the middle of last month, nearly 8.3\u00a0million people signed up for health plans in the states using HealthCare.gov. The figure is about the same as the previous year, even though it includes two fewer states, which began operating their own marketplaces.\n Leaders of groups helping with enrollment around the country said they were approached for help this last time by many people who had lost jobs or income because of the pandemic.\n The order involving Medicaid is designed to alter course on experiments \u2014 known as \u201cwaivers\u201d \u2014 that allow states to get federal permission to run their Medicaid programs in nontraditional ways. The work requirements, blocked so far by federal courts, are one of those experiments. Another was an announcement a year ago by Seema Verma, the Trump administration\u2019s administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, that states could apply for a fundamental change to the program, favored by conservatives, that would cap its funding, rather than operating as an entitlement program with federal money rising and falling with the number of people covered.\n \u201cYou could think about it as announcing a war against the war on Medicaid,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, a consulting firm, said Biden\u2019s initial steps to broaden insurance match his campaign position that the United States does not need to switch to a system of single-payer insurance favored by more liberal Democrats.\n The orders the president will sign \u201care going to do it through the existing programs,\u201d Mendelson said.",

        "body_text": "As he outlined how \u201cpervasive voter fraud\u201d had turned the United States into \u201cVenezuela or China or the old Soviet Union,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, paused his video podcast to offer his audience an incredible deal.\n For just $596, an online fraud-protection company that Giuliani called \u201cthe only folks to trust that I know of\u201d was selling four years of online defense from home-stealing \u201ccyber thieves.\u201d\n \u201cUse code \u2018Rudy\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s me \u2014 and sign up for 30 free days of protection,\u201d Giuliani said, before resuming a diatribe about an international communist vote-stealing plot \u2014 and, later, another advertisement, in which he hawked dietary supplements. The episode of his YouTube series, \u201cRudy Giuliani\u2019s Common Sense,\u201d has been viewed more than 500,000 times.\n Giuliani\u2019s conspiracy-theory infomercials stand at the center of an extraordinary defamation lawsuit filed Monday by Dominion Voting Systems, which is seeking more than $1.3 billion in damages from him for what its attorneys said were \u201cdemonstrably false allegations\u201d that led company employees to endure months of harassment and death threats.\n Giuliani, the lawsuit alleges, knowingly spread falsehoods about the company to bolster Trump\u2019s failing attempts to overturn the reality of his election loss. But Giuliani had another incentive for doing so, the lawyers wrote: He \u201ccashed in by hosting a podcast where he exploited election falsehoods to market gold coins, supplements, cigars, and protection from \u2018cyber thieves.\u2019 \u201d\n The lawsuit helps cast a spotlight on why so much viral disinformation rockets across the Web: Purveyors of falsehoods are often financially rewarded as the audiences for their claims grow. Premium subscriptions, merchandise sales and advertisement revenue form the backbone of the online-influencer economy \u2014 and if the audience is buying it, the creators make money, regardless of the facts.\n The lawsuit frames Giuliani not as an ideological crusader but as a shrewd marketer eager to monetize his growing fan base, using the kinds of social-media-influencer techniques popular across YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, including infomercial-style endorsements and promotional discount codes.\n The 107-page complaint, filed in D.C. federal court, features several screenshots of Giuliani\u2019s wide-ranging and sometimes theatrical advertisements, launched even as he portrayed himself as defending democracy from a dastardly global scheme.\n As he pitched fraud detection packages on YouTube, Giuliani was said to throw \u201chis arms in the air as if to emphasize the obvious danger of entrusting important matters to technology.\u201d\n Giuliani and other high-profile Trump supporters, including attorneys Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood, echoed the claims of a stolen election for weeks in online videos, social media posts, real-world rallies and TV appearances that reached millions around the world.\n Dominion attorney Tom Clare said Monday that the company would probably pursue other lawsuits beyond Giuliani to set the record straight, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at everybody.\u201d\n Giuliani said in a statement that the suit was \u201canother act of intimidation by the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech.\u201d He also argued that Dominion\u2019s suit would allow him to \u201cinvestigate their history, finances, and practices fully and completely.\u201d\n Giuliani captured public attention by baselessly alleging that Dominion had used shadowy Venezuelan software to rig elections around the world, including by notifying political officials when their candidate was losing so they could quickly submit fake ballots. The claims were never submitted in court \u2014 which Dominion argues is proof Giuliani knew they were preposterous \u2014 but were repeated for weeks by Giuliani in Fox News interviews, Twitter posts, live-streamed news conferences, radio shows and YouTube monologues.\n The suit outlines how Giuliani often aligned his \u201cdirect-to-camera advertisements\u201d with the falsehoods of the day. Lawyers wrote how, in one video, \u201cafter decrying how an American election had been fixed by a Venezuelan-owned company, Giuliani marketed cigars from an \u2018American-owned\u2019 company, offering \u2018$20 off orders over $100\u2019 if his viewers used the code \u2018Rudy20\u2019 when ordering.\u201d Giuliani tweeted the video to his more than 1 million followers, receiving more than 9,000 retweets and more than 25,000 likes.\n In another December video about Dominion, Giuliani warned that a \u201csocialist storm is brewing\u201d and pitched his audience on paid memberships to a \u201cconservative alternative to the AARP.\u201d In yet another, he warned that in these \u201cuncertain times,\u201d the \u201cone thing you can count on to protect what you have worked so hard for is physical gold and silver,\u201d before advertising a gold dealer and counseling viewers, \u201cTell them Rudy sent you.\u201d\n Former congressman Denver Riggleman (R-Va.), who was endorsed by Trump but lost his reelection bid last year during a contentious GOP convention, said the case shows how Giuliani and other peddlers of vote-fraud falsehoods have taken \u201cadvantage of otherwise good people by pushing out mass amounts of disinformation to preselected echo chambers.\u201d\n Riggleman noted that channels devoted to conspiracy theories and extremist movements, such as QAnon, routinely sell apocalypse-preparation supplies and seek political donations while riling up viewers about the imminent dangers of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d Democrats or other perceived enemies.\n \u201cThis is the largest conspiratorial grift in United States history,\u201d Riggleman said. \u201cThe grift they monetized eventually became weaponized.\u201d\n Dominion\u2019s lawsuit, which follows a similar complaint it filed against Powell earlier this month, joins a growing legal wave of defamation cases targeting the purveyors of online falsehoods. In the most notable case, parents of children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 sued Alex Jones, the host of the conspiracy theory show \u201cInfowars,\u201d after he alleged that the family members were fraudulent \u201ccrisis actors\u201d pushing a fake shooting in hopes of enacting more gun-control laws.\n The Texas Supreme Court last week rejected Jones\u2019s attempt to block the suits, which are seeking millions of dollars in damages.\n Jones\u2019s attorneys have said that his \u201cpursuit of so-called \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 concerning controversial government activities\u201d is protected by the First Amendment. But Jones, like Giuliani, had also regularly advertised nutritional supplements during his videos, which attracted massive audiences.\n Giuliani has promoted OmegaXL, a non-FDA-approved supplement he pledged could help manage \u201cpainful, achy joints,\u201d saying on YouTube, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d The Infowars store hawks \u201ctestosterone boosters\u201d and other supplements designed to \u201ccreate superior vitality in males,\u201d including one that Jones was said to have used to \u201cmaximize vitality when working up to 12 hours a day or more in the fight for freedom.\u201d\n Mark Bankston, a lawyer who represents parents in the Jones lawsuits, said he finds it troubling how the kinds of conspiracy theory misinformation popularized by Jones and other fringe voices several years ago has increasingly become mainstream.\n \u201cJones was able to hype up his supplement sales with this fantastical misinformation, these fantasies he would spin,\u201d Bankston said. Now, with Giuliani, \u201cwe have someone of national prominence, who has their hands on the lever of powers, using the same exact tactics that were used by Alex Jones and ended up causing torment to my clients for years.\u201d\n Bankston said he hopes the legal action will show \u201cthis new breed of misinformation peddler online\u201d that \u201cit's not a profitable way to make money anymore,\u201d but he acknowledged that the tactic has clear limits.\n The Jones and Giuliani cases focus on specific harms from misinformation, \u201cbut what do we do when someone shares misinformation about the coronavirus that hurts us all?\u201d he said. \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys can\u2019t help us there.\u201d\n Riggleman said he nevertheless expected that Dominion\u2019s legal action would strike fear in the other high-profile figures who targeted private companies and other individuals with falsehoods alleging massive voter fraud and other crimes. He expects that other companies targeted by conspiracy theorists will file their own lawsuits.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t legislate away stupid,\u201d Riggleman said, \u201cbut you can certainly sue people for it.\u201d",

        "title": "McConnell relents on Senate rules, signals power-sharing deal with Democrats",
        "body_text": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday night signaled he would step back from an ultimatum over Senate rules that sparked a partisan showdown and threatened to obstruct President Biden\u2019s early legislative agenda.\n McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement that he was ready to move forward with a power-sharing accord with Democrats on how to operate the evenly divided Senate, defusing a potentially explosive clash over the minority\u2019s rights to block partisan legislation.\n At issue for McConnell was the fate of the filibuster, the Senate rule that acts as a 60-vote supermajority requirement for most legislation. With many Democrats calling for its elimination as their party takes control of the House, Senate and White House, McConnell had sought \u00adassurances from the new Senate majority leader, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), that the filibuster would be preserved.\n Democrats bristled at the request, demanding that McConnell agree to a power-sharing arrangement that followed the model used during the last 50-to-50 Senate, in 2001 \u2014 which would give the party with the vice presidency and its tie-breaking powers control of the floor agenda \u2014 without any additional provisions.\n Without the deal in place, Senate committees remained frozen from the previous Congress, where Republicans held a majority. That has created the unusual circumstance where Democrats have control of the floor while GOP chairs remain in charge of most committees.\n McConnell on Monday said he was prepared to move forward on a deal \u201cmodeled on that [2001] precedent\u201d after two Democratic senators \u2014 Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) \u2014 publicly reiterated their previously stated opposition to eliminating the filibuster.\n \u201cThey agree with President Biden\u2019s and my view that no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation,\u201d he said.\n Biden said in July that he\u2019d \u201ctake a look\u201d at eliminating the filibuster if Republicans became overly \u201cobstreperous\u201d but has otherwise been respectful of the traditions of the Senate, where he spent six terms before becoming vice president in 2009.\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated Friday that Biden intends to keep seeking to work with Republicans and has no plans to change his views on Senate rules.\n Both Manchin and Sinema had previously spoken out in favor of retaining the filibuster, so Democrats do not view their recent statements as a significant concession. But McConnell made his point: The retention of the filibuster is a divisive issue for Democrats \u2014 one that is likely to suffuse their efforts to advance Biden\u2019s agenda through a narrowly divided Congress.\n Manchin told reporters Monday that killing the filibuster would run against Biden\u2019s goal of uniting the country: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come together, so I do not support doing away with the filibuster under any condition. It\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n A spokeswoman for Sinema said Monday that she is \u201cagainst eliminating the filibuster, and she is not open to changing her mind about eliminating the filibuster.\u201d\n It could be months before the issue again comes to a head. Biden\u2019s first legislative priority is passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill, and he is seeking Republican support to pass it without sidestepping the normal legislative process. Should the GOP balk, however, Democrats are preparing to employ special budgetary procedures known as reconciliation that can skirt the 60-vote requirement.\n Other major Democratic agenda items, however, cannot be passed using reconciliation \u2014 including civil rights expansions, climate legislation, policing reforms and other issues that are not directly related to the federal budget. To advance those priorities, liberal activists are preparing to target the Democratic senators who have been reluctant to consider undoing the filibuster.\n \u201cWe cannot let all our hard work go to waste because of this racist, outdated, and undemocratic procedure,\u201d said activist Liz Haskell of Yuma County Indivisible, a group that helped elect Sinema in 2018. \u201cIf Senator Sinema wants to deliver for the people who pulled her across the finish line, she\u2019s got to be a strong advocate for getting rid of the filibuster in the Senate.\u201d\n While many Democrats have long anticipated an internal showdown should they win the majority, most were shocked that McConnell would raise the issue so quickly after moving from majority to minority leader. The structure of Senate operations is laid out in a resolution that is subject to the filibuster itself, which gave McConnell leverage to make his demands.\n McConnell\u2019s statement Monday came as Schumer reiterated his own determination not to bow to the longtime Republican leader\u2019s demands.\n \u201cHe is not majority leader. He is the minority leader, and he is not going to get his way,\u201d Schumer said in an MSNBC interview Monday. \u201cWe are not going to do what he wants. .\u2009.\u2009. We hope in the next day or two he will come to his senses and take our offer.\u201d\n Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, said Democrats were \u201cglad Senator McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand.\u201d\n \u201cWe look forward to organizing the Senate under Democratic control and start getting big, bold things done for the American people,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "Palm Beach Conducting \u2018Legal Review\u2019 Of Trump\u2019s Use Of Mar-A-Lago As A Residence",
        "body_text": "The town of Palm Beach, Florida, is reviewing Donald Trump\u2019s use of his Mar-a-Lago Club as a residence, even as the former president is set to once again violate a length-of-stay provision he himself agreed to three decades ago.\n At 11:32 a.m. Wednesday, Trump will have been at his property for more than seven consecutive days in 2021, having arrived a week earlier, half an hour before his successor, Joe Biden, was sworn in at the U.S. Capitol.\n A 1993 \u201cspecial exception use\u201d permit that Trump signed, allowing him to convert the mansion into a for-profit social club, stipulated that only 10 guest accommodations were allowed, and that no one would stay there longer than seven days, and not more than three times a year.\n Palm Beach Mayor Kirk Blouin told HuffPost that Trump\u2019s apparent decision to live there permanently is being examined by the town\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThis matter is under legal review by our Town Attorney, John \u2018Skip\u2019 Randolph,\u201d Blouin said, adding that the matter may come before the town council at its Feb. 8 meeting.\n Randolph confirmed that he is reviewing the issue, but said he has not made any preliminary findings.\n The Trump Organization \u2015 Trump\u2019s family business that operates Mar-a-Lago, his golf courses, his hotels and his various other properties \u2015 said in a statement: \u201cThere is absolutely no document or agreement in place that prohibits President Trump from using Mar-a-Lago as his residence.\u201d\n The twice-impeached former president bought the winter estate in 1985. By 1993, facing financial problems after driving his casinos into bankruptcy, he was having trouble affording the upkeep on the 118-room mansion. The town agreed to let him convert it into a social club so long as Trump agreed to a host of restrictions, one of which was not to let it become a hotel or subdivided residences.\n \u201cThe use of guest suites shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) non-consecutive seven (7) day periods by any one member during the year,\u201d the Aug. 10, 1993, agreement reads.\n Yet even before he became president, Trump was routinely violating that promise, according to his former lawyer Michael Cohen \u2015 who served federal prison time for, among other things, arranging secret hush money payments just ahead of the 2016 election to women who\u2019d had affairs with Trump.\n \u201cHe cannot reside in Mar-a-Lago as a full-time permanent resident,\u201d Cohen said Tuesday. \u201cNow, he can go there every day. It\u2019s his club.\u201d\n Nevertheless, Trump violated the seven-day limit three times during his four years in office, according to a HuffPost review of his travel schedule. In 2020, Trump had an eight-day stay there. In 2019, he had a 16-day stay, and in 2017, a 10-day stay.\n It is unclear how the three-visit limit was meant to be interpreted, but Trump visited 10 times in 2017 for a total of 31 nights, eight times in 2018 for 24 nights, eight times in 2019 for 31 nights, and five times in 2020, staying 20 nights.\n Precisely why Trump insists on living at Mar-a-Lago in violation of his agreement is also unclear. He owns three houses in the immediate proximity of the resort: a 10,000-square-foot oceanfront home at 1125 South Ocean Blvd., just north of Mar-a-Lago\u2019s beach club, which he bought from his sister Maryanne Trump Barry in 2018 for $18.5 million; a 6,000-square-foot house across the street at 1094 South Ocean Blvd., worth $10.4 million; and a 3,000-square-foot house just to its west at 124 Woodbridge Road, worth $3.3 million.\n According to his 2020 financial disclosure, Trump was earning rental income from all three properties.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) The National Baseball Hall of Fame class of 2021 is empty.\n None of the 25 eligible candidates received the minimum of 75% of ballots cast to be elected, according to a news release from the Hall of Fame Tuesday. Of the 25, there were 11 new candidates and 14 returnees.\n The last time the Baseball Writers' Association of America didn't vote in any players was in 2013, and this is also the first time since 1960 that there were no new hall of fame members in a single year, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame's website.\n Three of those names back on the ballot included Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling. All three have one year left of eligibility.\n Schilling fell short 16 votes, leaving him with only 71.1% of the electorate. Bonds' vote total was at 61.8%, and Clemens was at 61.6%.\n In a long Facebook post Tuesday, Schilling said he would not participate in the final year of voting. Included in his post was a letter to the Hall of Fame.\n \"I am requesting to be removed from the ballot,\" his statement read.\n While the career statistics of Bonds and Clemens rank among the best in baseball history, they were amassed during MLB's so-called \"Steroid Era.\" During the late 1990s and early 2000s, accusations and innuendo of performance enhancing drug use swirled around many of the game's brightest stars, including Bonds and Clemens.\n Bonds is Major League Baseball's all-time leader in home runs with 762 career homers for the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants during his 22-year career. He was a 14-time All-Star and was named National League MVP seven times.\n Roger Clemens racked up 354 wins and 4,672 strikeouts over his 24-year career with the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, and Houston Astros. Clemens ranks third on MLB's all-time strikeouts list and is ninth on the all-time wins list.\n There will be no new electees to join the class of 2020's Derek Jeter, Larry Walker and Modern Era Committee selections Ted Simmons and the late Marvin Miller during the Hall's Induction Ceremony on July 25 in Cooperstown, New York.\n Their inductions scheduled for last summer were postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Accio, backlash! \u201cHarry Potter and The Inevitable Streaming Service Cash-In\u201d is reportedly a go.\n A live-action TV series based on J.K. Rowling\u2019s seven fantasy novels is in \u201cextremely early stages\u201d at HBO Max, according to multiple outlets.\n Executives at the\u00a0recently reinvigorated streamer\u00a0have \u201cengaged in multiple conversations with potential writers exploring various ideas that would bring the beloved property to television,\u201d according to The Hollywood Reporter, which was first to break the news.\n It\u2019s currently unclear exactly how the project will go about adapting the series, which has, of course, spawned a multi-billion-dollar film franchise. Only \u201cbroad ideas have been discussed as part of the early-stage exploratory meetings,\u201d THR reports.\n But when contacted for comment, both HBO Max and Warner Bros. flat-out denied talks of an adaptation. \u201cThere are no Harry Potter series in development at the studio or on the streaming platform,\u201d they said in a statement to THR.\n Spin-off series of beloved franchise properties have recently proved to be successful, with \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d bringing in \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans old and new to Disney+, while a \u201cLord of The Rings\u201d series set before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s trilogy is arriving on Amazon in 2021.\n Despite the public disavowal by Warner Bros., news of a potential \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series stirred up some strong reactions on social media.\n While some Potterheads welcomed the idea of seeing the epic story play out on their TV screens, others balked at the idea of further lining Rowling\u2019s pockets with more galleons following her string of anti-trans statements.\n Rowling has\u00a0repeatedly made headlines over the past year for her transphobic rhetoric on social media and in a lengthy essay in which she\u00a0doubled down on her belief that trans women do not actually qualify as women and should be barred from single-sex spaces.\n Her unwavering stance sparked an immediate backlash from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan community, with former franchise stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint publicly condemning her comments.\n But plans for expanding the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d universe have seemingly remained unchanged, as the third film in the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise, which has faced its own fair share of controversy, is currently scheduled to open in theaters on July 15, 2022.\n \u201cHogwarts Legacy,\u201d an upcoming open-world, action RPG video game set in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d universe during the late 1800s, is also coming to a slew of gaming platforms in 2022.",

        "title": "These 7 Earth-size exoplanets named after beer may be incredibly similar",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Just 40 light-years from Earth is a planetary system that has intrigued scientists since its discovery in 2016.\n While some of the planets in this system will be observed by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in October, researchers continue to uncover new details that make TRAPPIST-1 even more distinct.\n The planets, which are too small and faint to be seen by any current ground or space-based telescopes, have such similar densities that they may have equally similar compositions, new research has suggested.\n Given that these planets are about 8% less dense than Earth, researchers have taken a stab at trying to understand how much iron, oxygen, magnesium and silicon these planets contain.\n The study published last week in The Planetary Science Journal.\n The TRAPPIST-1 system includes seven planets, all rocky and similar in size to Earth -- and the most planets like this found orbiting one star. In contrast, the planets in our solar system vary both in size and composition, including smaller rocky planets like Venus, Mercury and Earth and giant gaseous ones such as Jupiter and Saturn.\n The TRAPPIST-1 system is a reminder that no two planetary systems are alike.\n Astronomers announced in February 2017 their discovery of the seven Earth-size planets orbiting a star 40 light-years from Earth. Initially, the researchers only identified three planets around the star in 2016, but they used multiple telescopes and discovered the other four planets using the transit method -- measuring dips in starlight as planets passed in front of the star.\n The seven exoplanets were all found in tight formation around an ultracool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1, and the planets bear the TRAPPIST name -- which the researchers borrowed from their favorite beer.\n These planets are so close to their star that they would all fit within the orbit of Mercury around the sun, which is the closest planet in our solar system to our host star. This proximity means that if you were to stand on the surface of one of these planets, the other planets in the system would appear like large moons in the sky.\n Astronomers were able to obtain precise measurements of the masses and diameters of the TRAPPIST planets using the transit method, which also enabled them to determine the planets' densities.\n Their densities are so close that there is no more than a 3% difference between them, the researchers concluded.\n Even though these exoplanets are only 8% different in density from Earth and Venus, this difference suggests that the TRAPPIST planets are made differently. The researchers determined that they could be similar to Earth in every element with the exception that the composition of the seven planets could be 21% iron while Earth is 32% iron.\n The iron in the TRAPPIST planets could contain more oxygen, which would actually form iron oxide -- otherwise known as rust.\n In our solar system, Mars gets its telltale red hue from iron oxide on the surface. Despite this, Mars has an iron planetary core, much like the other rocky planets in our solar system of Venus, Mercury and Earth.\n If the TRAPPIST planets contain more of this oxidized iron, they would not include solid iron cores, which could account for the density difference.\n Researchers believe that a combination of lower iron content, as well as some iron oxide, accounts for the difference between the TRAPPIST planets and Earth.\n The TRAPPIST system has intrigued scientists for many reasons, and this suggestion about their composition is one of the latest findings.\n Astronomers previously have suggested that some of the planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star are in the star's habitable zone, meaning some of the middle planets could be at the right surface temperature to support liquid water, and perhaps life, on their surfaces.\n The closest planets would be too hot and the furthest planet from the star may be covered in ice.\n Astronomers have estimated that TRAPPIST-1 is between 5.4 billion and 9.8 billion years old, meaning it could be nearly twice as old as our own solar system, which formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n When some of the TRAPPIST planets are observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the future, astronomers could learn if these planets have atmospheres and if so, what those atmospheres contain.\n \"The night sky is full of planets, and it's only been within the last 30 years that we've been able to start unraveling their mysteries,\" said study coauthor Caroline Dorn, an astrophysicist at the University of Zurich, in a statement.\n \"The TRAPPIST-1 system is fascinating because around this one star we can learn about the diversity of rocky planets within a single system. And we can actually learn more about a planet by studying its neighbors as well, so this system is perfect for that.\"",

        "title": "Why swearing is a sign of intelligence, helps manage pain and more",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Polite society considers swearing to be a vulgar sign of low intelligence and education, for why would one rely on rude language when blessed with a rich vocabulary?\n That perception, as it turns out, is full of, uh ... baloney. In fact, swearing may be a sign of verbal superiority, studies have shown, and may provide other possible rewards as well.\n \"The advantages of swearing are many,\" said Timothy Jay, professor emeritus of psychology at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, who has studied swearing for more than 40 years.\n \"The benefits of swearing have just emerged in the last two decades, as a result of a lot of research on brain and emotion, along with much better technology to study brain anatomy,\" Jay said.\n Well-educated people with plenty of words at their disposal, a 2015 study found, were better at coming up with curse words than those who were less verbally fluent.\n Participants were asked to list as many words that start with F, A or S in one minute. Another minute was devoted to coming up with curse words that start with those three letters. The study found those who came up with the most F, A and S words also produced the most swear words.\n That's a sign of intelligence \"to the degree that language is correlated with intelligence,\" said Jay, who authored the study. \"People that are good at language are good at generating a swearing vocabulary.\"\n Swearing can also be associated with social intelligence, Jay added.\n \"Having the strategies to know where and when it's appropriate to swear, and when it's not,\" Jay said, \"is a social cognitive skill like picking the right clothes for the right occasion. That's a pretty sophisticated social tool.\"\n Science has also found a positive link between profanity and honesty. People who cursed lied less on an interpersonal level, and had higher levels of integrity overall, a series of three studies published in 2017 found.\n \"When you're honestly expressing your emotions with powerful words, then you're going to come across as more honest,\" said Jay, who was not involved in the studies.\n While a higher rate of profanity use was associated with more honesty, the study authors cautioned that \"the findings should not be interpreted to mean that the more a person uses profanity, the less likely he or she would  engage in more serious unethical or immoral behaviors.\"\n Want to push through that workout? Go ahead and drop an F-bomb.\n People on bikes who swore while pedaling against resistance had more power and strength than people who used \"neutral\" words, studies have shown.\n Research also found that people who cursed while squeezing a hand vice were able to squeeze harder and longer.\n Spouting obscenities doesn't just help your endurance: If you pinch your finger in the car door, you may well feel less pain if you say \"sh*t\" instead of \"shoot.\"\n People who cursed as they plunged their hand into icy water, another study found, felt less pain and were able to keep their hands in the water longer than those who said a neutral word.\n \"The headline message is that swearing helps you cope with pain,\" said lead author and psychologist Richard Stephens, in a prior CNN interview. Stephens is a senior lecturer at Keele University in Staffordshire, England, where he leads the Psychobiology Research Laboratory.\n Stephens said it works like this: Cussing produces a stress response that initiates the body's ancient defensive reflex. A flush of adrenaline increases heart rate and breathing, prepping muscles for fight or flight.\n \"That would make evolutionary sense because you're going to be a better fighter and better runner if you're not being slowed down by concerns about pain,\" Stephens said.\n \"So it seems like by swearing you're triggering an emotional response in yourself, which triggers a mild stress response, which carries with it a stress-induced reduction in pain,\" he added.\n Careful, however, the next time you decide to extend your workout by swearing. Curse words lose their power over pain when they are used too much, research has also discovered.\n Some of us get more out of swearing than others. Take people who are more afraid of pain, called \"catastrophizers.\" A catastrophizer, Stephens explained, is someone who might have a tiny wound and think, \"Oh, this is life threatening. I'm going to get gangrene, I'm going to die.\"\n \"The research found men who were lower catastrophizers seemed to get a benefit from swearing, whereas men who are higher catastrophizers didn't,\" Stephens said. \"Whereas with women there wasn't any difference.\"\n Swearing appears to be centered in the right side of the brain, the part people often call the \"creative brain.\"\n \"We do know patients who have strokes on the right side tend to become less emotional, less able to understand and tell jokes, and they tend to just stop swearing even if they swore quite a lot before,\" Emma Byrne, the author of \"Swearing Is Good for You,\" said.\n Research on swearing dates back to Victorian times, when physicians discovered that patients who lost their ability to speak could still curse.\n \"They swore incredibly fluently,\" Byrne said. \"Childhood reprimands, swear words and terms of endearment -- words with strong emotional content learned early on tend to be preserved in the brain even when all the rest of our language is lost.\"\n Why do we choose to swear? Perhaps because profanity provides an evolutionary advantage that can protect us from physical harm, Jay said.\n \"A dog or a cat will scratch you, bite you when they're scared or angry,\" he said. \"Swearing allows us to express our emotions symbolically without doing it tooth and nail.\n \"In other words, I can give somebody the finger or say f**k you across the street. I don't have to get up into their face.\"\n Cursing then becomes a remote form of aggression, Jay explained, offering the chance to quickly express feelings while hopefully avoiding repercussions.\n \"The purpose of swearing is to vent my emotion, and there's an advantage in that it allows me to cope,\" he said. \"And then it communicates very readily to bystanders what my emotional state is. It has that advantage of emotional efficiency -- it's very quick and clear.\"\n What makes the use of naughty words so powerful? The power of the taboo, of course. That reality is universally recognized: Just about every language in the world contains curse words.\n \"It seems that as soon as you have a taboo word, and the emotional insight that the word is going to cause discomfort for other people, the rest seems to follow naturally,\" Byrne said.\n It's not just people who swear. Even primates curse when given the chance.\n \"Chimpanzees in the wild tend to use their excrement as a social signal, one that's designed to keep people away,\" Byrne said.\n Hand-raised chimps who were potty-trained learned sign language for \"poo\" so they could tell their handlers when they needed the toilet.\n Does that mean that we should curse whenever we feel like it, regardless of our environment or the feelings of others? Of course not. But at least you can cut yourself some slack the next time you inadvertently let an F-bomb slip.\n After all, you're just being human.",

He faced the possibility of being ousted in a no-confidence motion supported by thousands of club members furious at the team\u2019s poor performances and the club\u2019s financial situation.\n Barcelona lost to Bayern Munich 8-2 in the quarterfinals of the Champions League in August, and its soaring debt forced the club to practically give away veterans like Luis Su\u00e1rez to slash its salary burden. Lionel Messi later asked to leave the club but had his request denied.\n Barcelona plays against second-division club Rayo Vallecano in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. It trails Spanish league leader Atl\u00e9tico Madrid by 10 points and is three points behind second-place Real Madrid entering the second half of the season.\n ___\n More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

        "body_text": "For the 14th time in NFL history and the first since the 2011 season, the Super Bowl will feature a rematch of teams that met in the regular season. The Chiefs and Buccaneers first squared off Nov. 29, with Kansas City holding off Tampa Bay for a 27-24 win.\n It\u2019s a little surprising that even more points weren\u2019t scored, considering both defenses that day were sieves. The Chiefs averaged 7.54 yards per play while the Bucs averaged 7.58. (NFL teams averaged more than 7.5 yards per play in a game only 20 times this season.) There were three turnovers in the red zone, with Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes fumbling at the Tampa Bay 8-yard line and Bucs quarterback Tom Brady throwing interceptions at the Kansas City 11 and 13.\n Mahomes finished with 462 passing yards, 269 of them to Tyreek Hill, who scored three touchdowns and had 203 of those yards in the first quarter alone. He became just the third NFL wide receiver with more than 200 receiving yards in one quarter.\n Brady passed for 345 yards and threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes to Mike Evans to cut into a 17-point deficit, but the Bucs never got the ball back after their final score with 4:10 remaining.\n \u201cWe battled back, but we left ourselves a big deficit,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWhen you play a good offense, we\u2019ve got to do our job offensively and keep them off the field.\u201d\n As the teams were shaking hands after the game, CBS\u2019s Tony Romo delivered another one of his spot-on predictions, saying he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the Chiefs and Bucs on the same field in Super Bowl LV.\n The last Super Bowl to feature teams that met in the regular season was Super Bowl XLVII in February 2012. The Giants defeated the Patriots after also beating New England in the regular season. In fact, all four of New York\u2019s Super Bowl wins came against teams it already had played in the regular season.\n The team that won the regular season meeting is 6-7 in the Super Bowl rematch.\n Brady was the Patriots\u2019 quarterback for three such Super Bowl rematches, going 1-2.",

        "title": "Biden Administration Says It Will Buy 200 Million More COVID-19 Shots",
        "body_text": "The Biden administration on Tuesday announced that the federal government intends to purchase 200 million additional doses of two federally approved COVID-19 vaccines, potentially creating a stock large enough to reach nearly the entire U.S. population.\n The U.S. has already purchased 400 million shots from manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna, both of which use a novel mRNA vaccine that has proven highly effective in trials but that also requires two doses, spaced weeks apart. With the extra shots that the Biden administration intends to purchase, there would, in theory, be enough to vaccinate 300 million people fully against the coronavirus \u2015 more than enough, according to most experts, to achieve \u201cherd immunity.\u201d\n Just how far along discussions with the two manufacturers have gone is not clear. A background briefing paper for reporters said that the administration is \u201cworking to purchase\u201d more vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. It did not indicate whether the two companies have the capacity to deliver the extra quantities by the end of the summer, as the administration hopes.\n Pfizer, in a statement late Tuesday afternoon, said the company \u201cwill do its part to help the Biden Administration make more shots-in-arms a reality.\u201d Moderna declined to comment.\n But Biden, speaking from the White House on Tuesday afternoon, said that \u201cwe believe we will soon be able to confirm\u201d the new purchases. One reason for that confidence may be the discovery that the vials of vaccine contain enough extra liquid for extra doses. If every vial the companies produce actually provides more shots than they initially anticipated, then the pace of production has effectively increased.\n Pfizer\u2019s chief executive officer had said earlier on Tuesday that the company would be able to deliver its initial shipment of 200 million doses by the end of May \u2015 two months ahead of schedule.\n Pfizer and Moderna are currently the only companies manufacturing vaccines that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized for use. But other companies are developing their own and one, Johnson & Johnson, has a single-dose vaccine that has shown promising results in early trials.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could get emergency authorization within as little as two weeks. If so, that could increase the nation\u2019s supply further.\n The Biden administration\u2019s announcement comes at a pivotal moment \u2015 with people across the country frustrated at the pace of vaccination and the appearance of new, more communicable variants of the coronavirus making the need to protect Americans even more urgent.\n The pace of vaccination has been picking up and that trend is likely to continue, as local and state authorities get past initial glitches and work out new distribution channels \u2015 and as the federal government under Biden offers more logistical support and stands up its own mass vaccination centers.\n But already there are pockets of the country where the limiting factor in vaccine distribution isn\u2019t too few vaccinators. It\u2019s too few vaccines. That\u2019s why increasing the supply is so critical.\n The planned purchase from Pfizer and Moderna is one of several major policy directives announced Tuesday, as part of Biden\u2019s ongoing strategy to increase the federal role in managing the nation\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n Another was a decision to increase the supply of vaccines distributed to the states, so that they will be getting a total of 10 million doses a week instead of 8.6 million, at least for the next three weeks. The administration informed state officials of the increase on a conference call earlier in the day, as The Wall Street Journal first reported.\n The ability to forecast supplies for three weeks, rather than one, is significant because state and local authorities have said that distribution efforts have been hindered by their inability to make advance plans about where to run clinics and how many appointments to offer.\n Of course, an equally big problem has been the inconsistency of previous forecasts. A test for Biden will be whether the latest forecasts turn out to be accurate or whether, as under the Trump administration, they change frequently.",

        "title": "Meet the book club that\u2019s helping to quickly vaccinate its town",
        "body_text": "The Fabulous Ladies Book Club likes to meet at a restaurant named Ranchers, a chophouse beside a hardware store in Ruidoso, N.M. Its 10 members, mostly 40-something working mothers, prefer to sit at what they call the \u201cqueen\u2019s table,\u201d order appetizers and drinks, and chat \u2014 sometimes even about what they\u2019ve read. You know, book club.\n That all changed when the pandemic hit. Like most book clubs, the Fabulous Ladies now meet online; the last time they gathered in person was Feb. 20, 2020, to discuss Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming.\u201d But in recent weeks, the Ladies found a new project that gives them good reason to see one another beyond their screens: They are helping to vaccinate their town.\n It all started on Dec. 28, when their phones lit up with a message from Keri Rath, one of the club\u2019s founding members and one of the few OB/GYNs in this mountain town of roughly 7,900.\n Keri\u2019s husband, Stephen, chief of aerospace medicine of the New Mexico Air National Guard, had gotten a call from the state\u2019s department of health. The department had free vaccine doses but needed help getting them out of vials and into arms. Could the Raths help?\n Keri immediately thought of her book club. \u201cThey are highly educated, highly motivated, very capable women,\u201d she said in a Zoom call last week. She knew they could get the job done. Also, she told her friends, \u201cMimosas will be provided.\u201d\n No alcohol was necessary to get this band of women \u2014 among them a yoga instructor, a lawyer, a teacher, a hotel owner and a veterinarian \u2014 to act. In five days, the group had turned Stephen\u2019s private practice, Fusion Wellness, into a pop-up vaccination clinic.\n At a time when so many people are struggling to navigate labyrinthine websites and backed-up phone lines to track down a coronavirus vaccine, the Fabulous Ladies Book Club has demonstrated a remarkable efficiency. The clinic opened Jan. 3 and by Jan. 23 had administered more than 2,417 vaccine doses, about 31\u00a0percent of the town, according to club members.\n [The story behind \u2018And the People Stayed Home,\u2019 the little poem that became so much more]\n How did they do it? It took a lot of time and a lot of texting \u2014 one book club member maxed out her phone\u2019s data plan \u2014 to delegate, coordinate and administer. Never mind that they had other jobs and kids at home virtual-schooling.\n First, they needed to let the public know. They launched a social media campaign and contacted churches and community groups. They set up a hotline for questions and appointments. They coordinated sign-ups with the state\u2019s health department, offering appointments in accordance with the state\u2019s tiered system. Then they had to help people master the registration process  \u2014 or as book club member Marin Goza put it, serve as \u201cgeriatric iPhone assistance liaisons.\u201d\n Ruidoso, located about 180 miles southeast of Albuquerque, is known for its racetrack, golf courses, ski resort and casinos (and as the hometown of actor Neil Patrick Harris) \u2014 and is a big draw for retirees. The large elderly population in a county that has been particularly hard hit by covid-19 made the vaccination project that much more pressing. The pop-up clinic at Fusion is the only site in its county offering vaccinations beyond the hospital for its health-care workers.\n Once the registrations began rolling in, the book-clubbers themselves got vaccinated and trained and then got busy running the clinic. The actual shots were administered by medical personnel. But members of the club had to manage the stock of vaccines. They served as greeters at the front door, handling waivers, temperature checks and ensuring people wore masks, kept their distance and everything was sanitized. Anyone too debilitated to get to the door got curbside service. The women shoveled snow and spread salt on the sidewalks and parking lot. No one fell. But at least one person danced and several cried (with joy).\n The Fabulous Ladies each volunteered as many as 50 hours a week on the vaccination effort. They are exhausted but exhilarated.\n \u201cAfter months of hunkering down and feeling helpless, we welcomed a chance to actively help end this nightmare. It has been so rewarding to see the relief on people\u2019s faces,\u201d Goza said. \u201cAnd as an English teacher, I can say, we read literature to feel connected to others and to build our empathy and envision what the world can be, so it\u2019s a natural extension for us to enact that when opportunities present themselves. And honestly, we missed each other. This was a way for us to reconnect.\u201d\n Gillian Epstein Baudo, a yoga instructor and small-business owner, concurred: \u201cOur current book is \u2018Untamed,\u2019 by Glennon Doyle, which has been a fortuitous read. Just like Glennon calls in her support network to start a nonprofit to help families separated at the border, Keri sent the SOS and we all responded. That\u2019s what you do for your girls.\u201d\n Keri Rath hopes others \u2014 in book clubs or not \u2014 will see that the pandemic relief effort is not just about putting needles into arms. \u201cYes, there are those of us who are very skilled at that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are a lot of steps that a lot of people can do, so maybe don\u2019t be scared away from helping because you can\u2019t do that final piece.\u201d\n Liz Smith, a sales operations manager who came to Ruidoso from Silicon Valley, noted how the effort reflected the benefits of small-town life. \u201cOne of the endearing things about this community is that you can work to effect change pretty immediately.\u201d The experience reminded her of one of her favorite book club books, \u201cThe Day the World Came to Town,\u201d a true story about how the town of Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed airline passengers diverted there on 9/11 that was the basis for the Broadway musical \u201cCome From Away.\u201d \u201cWhat that town did, it kind of reminds me of what our town would do if the same thing happened.\u201d\n Some might say that it already has.",

        "title": "Cheech Marin\u2019s Chicano Art Museum Is to Open This Fall",
        "body_text": "It was a stifling Sunday in 1950s South Central Los Angeles, when Cheech Marin, stuck at church, let his eyes drift to the ceiling.\n What he saw there would spark a lifelong love of art.\n \u201cThere were painted guys in long sheets walking in the clouds\u201d on a mural above his head, said Marin, 74, who is best known as half of the comedy team Cheech & Chong. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d look in the corner and be like, \u2018Why are these guys barbecuing that other guy?\u2019 Those two things informed my aesthetic from that point on: It had to be glorious and gory at the same time.\u201d\n In the mid-1980s, Marin, buoyed by a burgeoning film career, made the leap from merely admiring Rembrandts and Vermeers in museums to acquiring work. A third-generation Mexican-American, he focuses on Chicano artists, and has amassed one of the largest such collections in the world.\n Now, his more than 700 paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures will have a permanent home in the former Riverside, Calif., public library. Plans and funding were approved last week by the City Council there for the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture and Industry, which will feature works by artists including Gilbert \u201cMag\u00fa\u201d Luj\u00e1n, Frank Romero and Carlos Almaraz.\n The art museum and academic center, which is slated to open this fall, is intended to be the country\u2019s first permanent space exclusively dedicated to showcasing Mexican-American art and culture \u2014 a standard-bearing role Marin doesn\u2019t take lightly.\n \u201cPeople hear \u2018Chicano art\u2019 and think it\u2019s a guy sleeping under a cactus or something,\u201d Marin said. But for him, it\u2019s about seeking out the \u201csabor\u201d \u2014 Spanish for flavor \u2014 of Mexican-American culture, in works by artists born in the United States and influenced by both their Mexican cultural heritage and their upbringing with Cheerios and Uncle Sam.\n Plans for the center, which will be managed by the Riverside Art Museum, have been in the works for nearly four years. The city will contribute about $1 million per year under a 25-year agreement to cover operating costs, and the Riverside Art Museum is funding the $13.3 million renovation costs for the former library building through a $9.7 million state grant and private donations.\n Riverside\u2019s mayor, Patricia Lock Dawson, said in a statement that she looked forward to the days after the pandemic, when the institution, which will hold both traditional and contemporary art, could draw thousands of visitors to the city\u2019s historic Mission Inn District. She also foresees the institution\u2019s benefiting the local business community.\n But though the measure to create the center passed the City Council on a 4-0 vote, three of the seven members abstained, among them Chuck Conder, who said he feared the 25-year agreement could cripple the city\u2019s finances in the long run. He called it a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of taxpayers at a time that the city is struggling financially and is facing potential costs of $19 million to $32 million per year as a result of a court decision on the use of public utility fees, according to the Press-Enterprise, a local news outlet.\n \u201cNo matter how you slice it,\u201d Conder said, $10 million is \u201ca lot of money to spend on a museum that wasn\u2019t supposed to cost us anything.\u201d\n The center is expected to generate $3 million annually for the city in its first decade of operation, based on an expected annual attendance of 100,000 visitors, according to a city report. The Riverside Art Museum currently has about 50,000 visitors a year.\n Marin is particularly gratified that the institution, nicknamed \u201cThe Cheech,\u201d will be located in Riverside, a city 55 miles east of Los Angeles with a large Latino population. The center also sits in proximity to five universities, including the University of California, Riverside, and California State University, San Bernardino, which Marin hopes will make Chicano art and culture accessible for students.\n Marin has already donated 11 works from his collection and plans to donate 500 more once storage facilities are built to house them, as well as offer his other pieces on loan. His holdings, which have been showcased at more than 50 museums here and in Europe, including the Smithsonian, range from pre-Columbian art to modern lenticular pieces (\u201cYou know those images of Christ where his eyes follow you around the room?\u201d Marin said. \u201cThat\u2019s lenticular art.\u201d).\n Renovations to the building are expected to start in the next few months, after the library finishes moving to a new home being constructed a few blocks away. The City Council awarded a $10.7 million contract for the work, which will include a new roof and HVAC system and elevator upgrades.\n Marin said the building, a sprawling space about the size of a football field, provides ample opportunity for expansion \u2014 and he plans to use it. \u201cI want to put as much art in there as we can acquire,\u201d he said.\n He\u2019s long said his goal was \u201cto bring Chicano art to the forefront of the art world\u201d \u2014 and this brings him one step closer.\n \u201cMy motto has always been that you can\u2019t love or hate Chicano art unless you see it in person,\u201d Marin said. \u201cAnd now people will have a place to always see it.\u201d",

        "body_text": "In August 2014, the Washington Nationals made a minor, only-in-the-tiniest-type move to try to strengthen a team that was already leading the National League East: They claimed left-hander Matt Thornton off waivers from the New York Yankees.\n That Nationals team went on to win the division, and that move established an annual summer tradition for General Manager Mike Rizzo and his deputies: In pursuing the postseason, find a reliever midstream. In the five years after picking up Thornton \u2014 each a season in which the Nats intended to contend \u2014 Rizzo added no fewer than a dozen relievers by midseason trade, waiver claim or free agent signing.\n Maybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 that trend is put on pause in 2021.\n The Nationals\u2019 addition of lefty Brad Hand over the weekend just might give them their best bullpen heading into the season since \u2014 well, let\u2019s think about it. Since 2012, maybe, when they blitzed to their first division title with the \u201cClip-and-save\u201d bullpen led by Tyler Clippard during the season and buoyed by Drew Storen\u2019s return from injury late in the year, with stellar performances from everyone from Tom Gorzelanny to Sean Burnett to Ryan Mattheus to Craig Stammen in between.\n Man, those are some blasts from the past, right? Even that crew got a boost from lefty Mike Gonzalez, a veteran signed off the scrap heap in May in a subtle midseason addition that strengthened a strength. The Nats finished third in the NL in bullpen ERA and walks plus hits per inning pitched.\n The addition of Hand on a one-year, $10.5 million deal doesn\u2019t guarantee there won\u2019t be moves this June or July. But it sure lowers the probability that Manager Dave Martinez will need Rolaids in his back pocket 162 times a year. Whether Hand gets every save opportunity is immaterial \u2014 though he was a perfect 16 for 16 with Cleveland last year.\n Rather, what Hand does is what the best relievers do when they arrive in a new \u2019pen: move everyone else into a more comfortable role. Daniel Hudson will forever have his place in Washington baseball history, because his strikeout of Michael Brantley ended with his glove tossed in the air and the 2019 World Series secured. It\u2019s indelible and deserved.\n But as important as Hudson\u2019s addition was in the middle of that summer \u2014 when, it\u2019s easy to forget, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen was historically bad, and I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 he is coming off an uneven, abbreviated 2020 in which he posted a 6.10 ERA over 21 appearances. Sending him to spring training \u2014 whenever that begins \u2014 as the primary closer option would have been somewhere between unforgivable and unwise, though not unprecedented.\n Remember the nightmare start to 2017? As much as the ownership of the Lerner family spends on payroll, they tightened the purse strings that spring and wouldn\u2019t allow for, say, free agent Greg Holland. So the Nats tried Blake Treinen as the closer. They tried Shawn Kelley as the closer. They tried Koda Glover, Enny Romero and Matt Albers at the end of games. On July 16, they led the NL East by 9\u00bd games \u2014 but the bullpen had a 5.31 ERA, the worst in baseball. Every night was an ulcer-inducing adventure.\n That day, Rizzo sent Treinen and top pitching prospect Jes\u00fas Luzardo to Oakland for lefty Sean Doolittle and right-hander Ryan Madson. Two nights later, Madson got three outs in the eighth inning of a two-run game at the Los Angeles Angels, and Doolittle closed it out despite allowing a run in the ninth. The energy in the dugout and the clubhouse changed from there going forward. From that night through the end of the season, Washington\u2019s bullpen ERA dropped to 3.36, best in the NL \u2014 buoyed, too, by a trade for Brandon Kintzler on deadline day of July 31.\n That deal injected confidence in an area the Nats needed it. Belief replaced doubt. They don\u2019t all work out that way, of course, and people will always point to the 2015 trade for Jonathan Papelbon as unsettling for a team with the highest aspirations. What if, though, that confidence was already there in spring training?\n Since 2016, when he led the majors with 82 appearances for San Diego, only 11 relievers (with at least 150 innings pitched) have posted an ERA better than Hand\u2019s 2.70, and only 15 have a better WHIP. Among those better in both categories: right-hander Will Harris, who now inhabits the same bullpen as Hand. Those two alone give Martinez options to get key outs from either side \u2014 whether Hudson returns to his 2019 form or not.\n Then comes what might have been the most pleasant development of an otherwise difficult, pandemic-shortened 2020: the rise of Tanner Rainey and Kyle Finnegan. Rainey, acquired for pitcher Tanner Roark in an offseason trade with Cincinnati two years ago, struck out nearly 43 percent of the batters he faced in his 20 appearances. He is a weapon with a 97-mph fastball and a power slider. Finnegan was a cunning signing as a minor league free agent out of the Oakland system and didn\u2019t allow a run in 21 of his 25 outings. They enter 2021 not trying to establish themselves but rather trying to further themselves.\n That\u2019s not a bad place to start, a road map for Martinez from the sixth through the ninth, with plenty of mix-and-match options. Throw in Wander Suero, and there\u2019s a decent choice for those games when the Nats already trail. It feels solid, which can\u2019t be said for every January around here.\n To be sure, bullpens are the most volatile of baseball commodities, and it\u2019s unlikely that Hand, Hudson, Harris, Rainey and Finnegan will make it through a six-month season completely healthy and in fine form. There\u2019s a certain vagabond nature to the job, and for all the familiarity Storen, Clippard and Stammen brought to those early contending Nats teams, the club has been on the lookout for new arms ever since.\n Witness: The playoff roster in 2016 included zero relievers from the playoff roster in 2014. The playoff roster that won it all in 2019 included none of the relievers from the division winner just three years prior.\n Hand is here on a one-year deal, so there\u2019s a chance he fits into the year-to-year transience out beyond the right field wall at Nationals Park. But before spring begins, his arrival does more than just strengthen the current group of Nats relievers. It might put an end to the annual July ritual in which Washington, with the season in the balance, desperately hunts for bullpen help. Spring isn\u2019t here yet, but the help is.",

        "body_text": "The Biden administration has selected nurse Susan Orsega to serve as the nation\u2019s acting surgeon general, said two people with knowledge of her selection who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the announcement.\n Orsega, a career-commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service corps and a longtime infectious-disease specialist, would be among the first nurses to serve in the role of surgeon general, which is often referred to as \u201cthe nation\u2019s doctor.\u201d The announcement of Orsega\u2019s selection could come as soon as Tuesday, one of the people said.\n Surgeon General Jerome Adams, a Trump appointee, resigned last week at Biden\u2019s request, and Deputy Surgeon General Erica Schwartz, a career official, chose to retire after being passed over as acting surgeon general.\n Frequently viewed as the nation\u2019s spokesperson on public health matters, the surgeon general oversees the U.S. Public Health Service, more than 6,000 uniformed public health personnel who work in various parts of the federal government, but has limited ability to make policy. In her current role, Orsega oversees the corps\u2019s personnel, operations and readiness.\n Orsega did not immediately respond to request for comment. A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department declined to confirm that Orsega had been selected as acting surgeon general but said the department is expecting an announcement as soon as Tuesday.\n Biden has nominated Vivek H. Murthy, a close adviser who served as surgeon general in the Obama administration, to return to his previous role as the nation\u2019s top doctor. However, Murthy\u2019s confirmation hearings have yet to be scheduled, said an aide with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.\n \u201cThe committee is ready to go with an aggressive scheduling of hearings once we organize, with nominations being a top priority,\u201d committee spokesperson Madeleine Russak said.\n Orsega is not the first nurse to serve as surgeon general. Former president Donald Trump in 2017 tapped nurse Sylvia Trent-Adams to serve as acting surgeon general after abruptly firing Murthy. Richard Carmona, who served in the Bush administration, was a physician as well as a nurse.",

        "title": "BlackRock Chief Pushes a Big New Climate Goal for the Corporate World",
        "body_text": "A year ago this month, the BlackRock chief Laurence D. Fink wrote a letter to the world\u2019s C.E.O.s with an urgent message: Climate change will be \u201ca defining factor in companies\u2019 long-term prospects.\u201d Underscoring his point, he added, \u201cWe are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.\u201d\n Coming from arguably the world\u2019s most powerful investor \u2014 BlackRock controls nearly $9 trillion, making it far and away the largest such firm \u2014 this letter landed with seismic force in boardrooms across the globe. In the weeks that followed, Microsoft announced a plan to be carbon-negative by 2030, Salesforce pledged to conserve or restore 100 million trees over the next decade and even Delta Air Lines announced a $1 billion effort to be carbon-neutral in 10 years.\n Still, skeptics argued that Mr. Fink\u2019s support for the reform-minded E.S.G. movement \u2014 which stands for environmental, social and governance \u2014 was a marketing gimmick that companies would back in an economic boom but shun in a crisis. If corporate America had to pick between cutting sustainability programs or dividends for investors, the thinking went, sustainability programs would be the first to go.\n Then the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, and something unusual happened: E.S.G. didn\u2019t collapse \u2014 it accelerated. In particular, the emphasis on climate change became an even greater focus within companies and among investors, who piled into the stocks of sustainable companies en masse, driving up the values of companies like Tesla and doubling the money invested in sustainability-oriented mutual funds. This gave fuel to Mr. Fink\u2019s thesis: Green investing is profitable.\n That\u2019s why Mr. Fink\u2019s latest annual letter to corporate leaders \u2014 which he sent out Tuesday morning, and which was obtained earlier by The New York Times \u2014 will again grab attention. And this year, with an even more ambitious blueprint for businesses that BlackRock invests in, it may have an even bigger impact.\n Mr. Fink is now calling on all companies \u201cto disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net-zero economy,\u201d which he defines as limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages and eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \u201cWe expect you to disclose how this plan is incorporated into your long-term strategy and reviewed by your board of directors,\u201d he wrote.\n When Mr. Fink makes what sounds like a request, in truth it is much more than that. BlackRock\u2019s size gives it enormous influence: Mr. Fink can seek to oust directors of companies that he doesn\u2019t believe are heeding his call, and he can dump the shares of companies owned by the firm\u2019s actively managed funds. Last year, the firm voted against 69 companies and against 64 directors for climate-related reasons, while putting 191 companies \u201con watch.\u201d\n Of course, the firm is unable to sell the shares of companies in passive indexes like those that track the S&P 500 (which remain a huge portion of its assets under management). But increasingly, BlackRock is creating sustainability-oriented index funds that have discretion in selecting which companies to include or exclude.\n To that point, Mr. Fink said in his letter that his firm planned to adjust its investment process for its actively managed funds, adopting what he is calling a \u201cheightened-scrutiny model\u201d for climate risk that included \u201cflagging holdings for potential exit.\u201d\n He also said that the firm planned to publish \u201ca temperature alignment metric for our public equity and bond funds, where sufficient data is available,\u201d and that it would start new products \u201cwith explicit temperature alignment goals, including products aligned to a net-zero pathway.\u201d\n This could have the same effect for investors as a calorie count on a menu for diners, a nudge toward making more informed choices. In the future, big public pension funds and other investors could have firms like BlackRock create custom indexes for them based on such data. On Monday, New York City\u2019s pension fund said it would divest $4 billion in fossil fuel-linked assets in its portfolios.\n These sorts of actions won\u2019t sacrifice investment performance, Mr. Fink said. Sustainable funds outperformed the market last year, he noted, especially during the worst moments of the pandemic downturn. \u201cThe more your firms are seen to embrace the climate transition and the opportunities it brings, the more the market will reward your firms with higher valuations,\u201d he wrote in the letter to C.E.O.s.\n Mr. Fink\u2019s call for greater transparency on climate risks isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. In the past year, as his letter points out, the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea all made commitments toward a net-zero future. And after President Biden\u2019s inauguration, his executive order to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and his plan to unveil a climate initiative on Wednesday that includes banning new oil and gas drilling on federal land, it appears that governments could soon force the issue of corporate climate risk disclosures.\n \u201cI urge companies to move quickly to issue them rather than waiting for regulators to impose them,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote about companies disclosing their net-zero plans. And his disclosure push isn\u2019t just for public companies.\n \u201cIf we want these disclosures to be truly effective \u2014 if we want to see true societal change \u2014 they should be embraced by large private companies as well,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe that issuers of public debt also should be disclosing how they are addressing climate-related risks.\u201d\n Already, several organizations are trying to create a uniform standard for climate disclosure. A group called the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures is jockeying with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board to become the global standard, while a group within the World Economic Forum led by the Bank of America chief, Brian Moynihan, announced its own disclosure standard for E.S.G. on Tuesday. Mr. Fink, rightly, says there should be only one standard, and he has put his support behind the Task Force.\n In truth, despite the best intention of companies to reduce their carbon footprints, many rely on buying what are known as carbon offsets. This might entail, for example, a company\u2019s paying to protect a forest that is about to be chopped down as a way to offset its own emissions. The problem is that the carbon-offset market remains sketchy, with few legitimate auditing programs that track whether that forest was really in jeopardy. Mr. Fink acknowledged that there was still work to be done on developing and auditing the right measures to use in gauging climate commitments.\n Mr. Fink is hardly without critics. Environmentalists say that he is isn\u2019t doing enough and that BlackRock should divest from all fossil-fuel companies. The activist groups Reclaim Finance and Urgewald published a report this month showing that the firm still held $85 billion in assets connected to coal.\n \u201cBlackRock has a major problem with its passively managed investments, which make it widely exposed to coal assets likely to become stranded,\u201d the report said. BlackRock has said that it can\u2019t sell stocks that are part of indexes and that it has tried to work behind the scenes with coal companies to encourage them to adopt cleaner technologies.\n In his latest letter, Mr. Fink said he was encouraging companies to think about the climate in the context of other initiatives serving a broader set of stakeholders.\n \u201cQuestions of racial justice, economic inequality or community engagement are often classed as an S issue in E.S.G. conversations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it is misguided to draw such stark lines between these categories. For example, climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on low-income communities around the world \u2014 is that an E or an S issue?\u201d\n Many of BlackRock\u2019s rivals suggest that Mr. Fink\u2019s letters are simply good marketing, meant to insulate the firm from greater scrutiny. They may have that effect. But far more profoundly, Mr. Fink\u2019s letters have consistently helped change the topic of conversation in corporate boardrooms.",

        "body_text": "When Mount Sinai Hospital opened its Center for Post-Covid Care in May, it was the first such facility in the United States. The doctors there expected to treat patients who had been severely ill or hospitalized. By that point, three months into the pandemic, they knew that the coronavirus could cause harm to many parts of the body beyond the airways where infections most commonly begin. And they knew that medical treatments meant to save patients\u2019 lives could also take a toll. Recovery from having been put on a ventilator, in particular, could be a lengthy process.\n Mount Sinai sought to support patients recovering from severe Covid-19 by giving them access to a multidisciplinary medical team that included lung, heart and kidney doctors, rehabilitation specialists and psychiatrists for those whose mental health might have been affected by their ordeals.\n Hundreds of patients, most of them women, showed up soon after the center\u2019s doors opened. To the doctors\u2019 surprise, however, many of them had experienced only mild cases of Covid-19. They hadn\u2019t been hospitalized. They were relatively young and otherwise in good health, without the underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes that are known to make Covid-19 worse.\n And yet, months after their bodies had seemingly fought off the coronavirus, they still felt quite ill. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of illnesses, viral illnesses, that have a prolonged postviral phase,\u201d said Dr. Zijian Chen, the head of Mount Sinai\u2019s recovery center. \u201cBut these usually don\u2019t last for the months and months that we see here. And because of that, we\u2019re a little surprised that this is happening. It tells us how much we don\u2019t know about this illness.\u201d The center has now seen more than 1,600 patients.\n These patients have labeled themselves \u201cCovid long-haulers.\u201d As a group, they report a strange hodgepodge of symptoms, including fatigue, pain, shortness of breath, light sensitivity, exercise intolerance, insomnia, hearts that race inexplicably, diarrhea and cramping, memory problems and a debilitating \u201cbrain fog\u201d that can at times make it hard to put a cogent sentence together.",

        "title": "For Frank Lampard and Chelsea, an Encore Without the Cheers",
        "body_text": "LONDON \u2014 Frank Lampard had known about the banner for a couple of weeks. As Chelsea\u2019s winter had turned bleak, as whispers that Lampard, its inexperienced coach, might be drifting toward the edge grew louder, word reached him that a group of fans \u2014 known as We Are the Shed, after Stamford Bridge\u2019s most famous stand \u2014 had decided to offer a token of its faith.\n The fans had designed a flag in his honor, and intended to hang it from the stadium for the first time during Sunday\u2019s F.A. Cup game against Luton Town. \u201cIn Frank We Trust,\u201d it read, white letters on a blue field. There were stylized images of him celebrating in the club\u2019s colors, both as a player and a manager. And underneath, three simple words: \u201cThen. Now. Forever.\u201d\n Lampard was, he said, touched by the gesture. \u201cI don\u2019t know if emotional is the right word,\u201d he said, but he was certainly \u201cappreciative\u201d to see such proof of the two-way bond he had shared with the club\u2019s fans for the better part of two decades. That was Sunday afternoon. He was fired on Monday morning.\n Lampard was not the first manager at Roman Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea to come under what seemed, on the surface, to be an undue, premature sort of pressure. He is not the first to be unceremoniously dispatched as soon as the club sensed the first curling tendril of looming disappointment in the air. Nor, almost certainly, will he \u2014 or his probable replacement, Thomas Tuchel \u2014 be the last.\n Some of those who have gone before Lampard have done so with sympathy, perceived as victims of Abramovich\u2019s ruthless impatience: Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the first time around. Others have found their farewells a little colder, their departures interpreted as inevitable and self-inflicted: Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the second time around.\n But none \u2014 not even Mourinho, the greatest manager in the club\u2019s history \u2014 have retained the support of the fans quite so unanimously as Lampard, the rookie coach who took a young team to fourth in the Premier League in his first, and only, full season at the club, but then, after the largest transfer expenditure of the Abramovich era, steered a lavishly gifted, well-tooled squad into ninth place.\n The banner provides the most eloquent explanation of that loyalty. Not just through the image of Lampard the player, the most productive goal-scorer in Chelsea history, a multiple winner of the Premier League and the F.A. Cup, a cornerstone of the team that turned the club into London\u2019s first-ever European champion, or the reference to man and team\u2019s shared past, but the fact that he knew the fans were planning it, too.\n He had been told the banner was coming by, as he put it, \u201cthe people directly involved\u201d in making it. Lampard\u2019s association with Chelsea runs long and deep enough that he has deep-seated, well-established connections with Chelsea\u2019s fans.\n That would be an advantage anywhere, but it is particularly precious at Chelsea. Not for the manager \u2014 that Lampard was fired so soon after he was given such public backing illustrates, quite neatly, how little power fans have \u2014 but for the public itself.\n Chelsea\u2019s fans have grown sufficiently accustomed to seeing managers come and go that, at times, they can harness Abramovich\u2019s susceptibility to the slightest pressure to their own ends.\n Maurizio Sarri, who preceded Lampard, was hardly an unmitigated success, but his only season at Stamford Bridge was no overwhelming failure: His team finished third in the Premier League and won the Europa League. And yet, months earlier, some fans had been agitating for his dismissal. They had never taken to him, never bought into his style of play, and they knew that, at Chelsea, it does not take much to tip the balance.\n In that context, the fans\u2019 desperation for Lampard can be read not just as hopeless sentimentality, but as a desire for some sort of constancy. For 18 years, Chelsea has staged an endless parade of managers: some young, some old, some exotic, some familiar. Each one has hinted at some new direction for the club. And yet none have stuck around for long.\n The riposte to any criticism of that approach has always been to point at Chelsea\u2019s bulging trophy cabinet, but that is no longer as convincing as it once was. The cycle of boom and bust, crest and fall, has left the fans with a feeling of seasickness, rootlessness, one to which both the club\u2019s supporters and its hierarchy hoped Lampard would be the balm.\n Lampard was, perhaps, the clearest example yet of soccer\u2019s brief but ongoing belief that every club has within the ranks of its alumni some visionary who can do for them what Pep Guardiola did for Barcelona.\n Lampard had coached for only a season at Derby County, doing a fair but unspectacular job, when he was approached by Abramovich and pinpointed as the man to oversee a great reset, one that would rest on the Terracotta Army of players waiting in the club\u2019s academy and would, at last, give rise to a style of play that was distinctively Chelsea.\n The problem with the Guardiola paradigm is that soccer uses it to draw the wrong conclusion. The lesson from the story of how the Barcelona academy graduate forged the greatest club team in history is not that any articulate former player, steeped in the values of a listing but willing superclub and given access to formidably talented teenagers, can conquer the world.\n It is, instead, the opposite. As his playing career wound down, Guardiola sought out all those coaches who had inspired him the most. He traveled to meet Marcelo Bielsa. He went to play in Mexico for six months to study under Juanma Lillo, now his assistant. He realized that who he had been as a player was not directly related to who he wanted to be as a coach.\n Lampard had not undergone that same process when Abramovich came calling. In his defense, it is possible that he simply had not had time. He had not, like Guardiola, set out to separate who he had been as a player from who he would be as a manager. He had not devoted the final few years of his former career to fine-tuning his beliefs and his style and his approach. He did not even see it as a career change, but rather an organic continuation.\n Lampard assumed \u2014 and Chelsea assumed \u2014 that the player celebrating on the left of the banner would naturally bleed into the manager celebrating on the right. Then would lead to now, and now would lead to forever. This season, both club and manager have learned it does not quite work that way.\n Chelsea might, in truth, have fired Lampard earlier. His colleagues, certainly, have been fearing it for weeks. At least one was convinced that he would not see out the season as early as October. Some, inside the club, advocated replacing him with Mauricio Pochettino, before the former Tottenham manager was snapped up by Paris St.-Germain.\n It is a measure of the affection Chelsea has for Lampard that it hesitated to toss him overboard. So, too, was the fact that Abramovich himself felt moved to explain the reasons behind his dismissal, the first public utterances he has made on any subject for some time. They desperately wanted him to succeed, for all that he had done for the club as a player. Ultimately, though, that did not matter, because ultimately, the memory of what he used to be was not in charge.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden is set to order a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with his plans.\n The move is expected to be the most prominent in a series of climate actions the President will take on Wednesday, including elevating the climate crisis as a national security issue.\n The halt on new leases, which would fulfill a campaign promise by Biden, would apply to federal land and water areas, but wouldn't affect existing leases. It would allow the administration to conduct a comprehensive review of the federal leasing program.\n Biden is also expected to take action on protecting 30% of the country's land and water by 2030, known as \"30 by 30.\" \u00a0A 2018 study by the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy organization based in Washington, found that only 12% of the country's land has been conserved, including as national parks and national wildlife refuges.\n The moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands expands the 60-day moratorium Biden signed on his first day in office.\n The New York Times first reported on several of Biden's Wednesday climate plans, and The Washington Post first reported about the Wednesday halt on new oil and gas leases on federal lands.\n The President has moved swiftly to take action on climate since taking office last week, including rejoining the Paris climate accord, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and directing agencies to review and reverse more than 100 actions taken by the Trump administration on the environment.\n The actions underscore the Biden administration's prioritization of combating the climate crisis. The President has appointed former secretary of state\u00a0John Kerry\u00a0as his special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry will be a\u00a0Cabinet-level official\u00a0in Biden's administration and will sit on the National Security Council. Biden has also named Gina McCarthy, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as his White House climate czar.\n Biden said on the campaign trail he wanted to halt new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. He said at a September CNN town hall that he supports the continued the use of hydraulic fracturing\u00a0to open underground natural gas formations, a practice known as fracking, as a way to \"transition\" to cleaner kinds of energy.\n The President, who has said he will not ban fracking, was pressed during the presidential campaign by several 2020 Democratic primary rivals and climate activists to call for a nationwide ban on fracking.\n Fracking is a controversial method of drilling that involves shooting high pressure water, sand and other compounds underground to make small fractures in rock to release oil and gas.\u00a0There have been questions about the effect fracking has on drinking water, methane emissions, and it has been tied to a rise in earthquakes.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) What used to be homes are now mangled piles of debris, with personal belongings strewn across lawns and streets.\n That's the new reality near Birmingham, Alabama, after a \"large and extremely dangerous\" tornado late Monday night annihilated parts of Jefferson County.\n The storm killed at least one person and injured dozens more, officials said. The twister also ripped a hotel apart and tore off part of a church's roof.\n About 30 people in Fultondale were injured, the city's fire chief said Tuesday.\n \"Seventeen patients were tak(en) to the ER, with various injuries and some critical,\" Fire Chief Justin McKenzie said. At least 11 people were treated on the scene.\n A young man, possibly a teen, was killed when he was trapped in the basement of his home, Fultondale Police Chief D.P. Smith said, according to AL.com.\n Several of his family members were critically injured, Smith said.\n The family had taken shelter in the basement, but apparently a tree fell on the house and caused the home to collapse.\n \"They were doing what they were supposed to be doing,\" the police chief said, according to AL.com.\n Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Walter Gonsoulin said a ninth-grade student at Fultondale High School was killed in the tornado. He was 14.\n \"Out of respect for the family, we don't want to release too much information at this particular time,\" Gonsoulin said.\n The superintendent said the storm caused significant damage to Fultondale High School, forcing it to close for the rest of the school year.\n The tornado that struck Fultondale was an EF-3 with peak winds estimated at 150 mph, according to the National Weather Service. It was 500 yards across and traveled 9.5 miles.\n Six people trapped in their homes were rescued Tuesday morning, McKenzie said.\n Rescue teams are still sifting through a hotel that collapsed overnight after most primary structures were cleared out, the fire chief said.\n The tornado spawned from a line of storms among two large systems that have put more than 100 million people under winter weather alerts.\n Tornado warnings and watches have expired in parts of Alabama and Georgia. But the same storm system is now expected to dump snow in states farther north.\n Parts of the Hampton Inn in Fultondale were obliterated, video from CNN affiliate WVTM shows.\n Hotel guest Richard Ring was watching TV when rumblings from the storm drowned out the program's sound, he told WVTM.\n He went to the bathroom and crawled under the sink.\n \"All of a sudden, the windows blew out in my room,\" Ring said. \"The lights went out. And the sirens shrieked. And it was just surreal.\"\n Guests staying at the hotel escaped and sought shelter in a nearby restaurant when another line of storms came through, WVTM reported.\n About 9,000 people live in Fultondale, just north of Birmingham.\n At 10:54 p.m. local time Monday, the National Weather Service Birmingham \"confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado was located over Chalkville, or near Trussville, moving east at 50 mph.\"\n Early Tuesday morning, the NWS Birmingham tweeted it \"will inspect the damage to determine the strength of the tornado\" that impacted the Fultondale area.\n The city of Center Point, about 13 miles northeast of Birmingham, also saw \"quite a bit of damage\" from the storm, Mayor Bobby Scott told CNN affiliate WBRC. About 16,000 people live there.\n The back half of Hilldale Baptist Church's roof is missing, and the city's recreation center also suffered damage, Scott said.\n \"Looks like we will have a long day ahead,\" Scott said. \"Hopefully we can get everything covered up.\"\n There was a bit of good news, the mayor said: \"We don't have any injuries to report right now, so we're definitely grateful for that.\"\n The Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency urged people to stay out of the area as first responders try to reach the most damaged sites.\n \"On top of road dangers such as power lines and debris ... traffic is clogging the roads,\" the agency tweeted.\n Eleven schools in the area will be closed for in-person and virtual learning Tuesday following the storm, the Jefferson County EMA tweeted.\n A tornado warning was issued Monday night for Jefferson County, Alabama, NWS Birmingham tweeted. The agency later issued tornado warnings and watches for several counties as the line of storms moved northeast through the state.\n The storm system is now expected to dump significant snow from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic Coast through Tuesday night.\n The deepest snow will pile up across Iowa. Some snow will be very heavy, with rates of up to 2 inches an hour, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n CNN's Michael Guy, Hollie Silverman, Kate Conerly, Christine Sever and Dave Hennen contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Here's a little secret for why Congress gets nothing done",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Consider these two data points:\n 1) The 116th Congress was one of the five least productive Congresses in the last five decades, according to an analysis by Pew. The 116th passed a total of 344 bills that became law, 44% of which were done in the lame-duck session held after the 2020 election.\n 2) The 116th Congress produced more than 2.2 million tweets and Facebook posts combined, eclipsing the totals of the 114th Congress by more than 738,000 posts, again according to Pew.\n These two facts are, as you might guess, related. And what they reflect is how the incentive structure has changed for elected officials in Washington.\n In the time before social media -- and even cable news -- the goal of every single member of the House or Senate was simple: Build relationships with your colleagues, demonstrate your knowledge of the intricacies of policy, pass bills and, most of all, accrue seniority. The acme of serving in Congress in those days was (through political savvy and years of service) to chair one of the big committees: Appropriations, Ways and Means, Judiciary or, for the foreign-policy focused, Foreign Relations.\n Those committee chairs were treated like demigods; they ruled their fiefdoms with total and complete authority and could not only make or break a specific policy proposal, but also a more junior colleague's career. That was the path to power -- with apologies to Robert Caro -- in Washington. The only one.\n The arrival of 24-hour cable news began to change that dynamic. And the surge of social media over the last decade has now fundamentally altered it.\n What those two new(ish) platforms have provided is a way to power and influence -- inside and outside of Washington -- that has nothing to do with how long you've served in Congress or what committees you're on.\n Consider this from Pew:\n \"The 10 members of the million-follower club in the 114th Congress contained no first-term lawmakers. But the members of the 116th Congress who had more than 1 million followers included five first-term lawmakers, as well as nine lawmakers who passed the million-follower mark over the course of the most recent Congress.\"\n Five members of Congress who were in their first terms -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Dan Crenshaw (R-Florida) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) as well as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) -- all have more than 1 million followers. (Romney, obviously, benefits from his previous high profile as the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.)\n And while some members of congressional leadership have been quick to dismiss those with massive social media followings -- \"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in July 2019. \"But they didn't have any following\" -- there's absolutely no question that the likes of AOC and Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz (1.1 million followers)have been able to parlay their social media following into real prominence and power.\n AOC is, without question, the face of young liberals in the country. Gaetz has leveraged his willingness to say (and tweet) controversial things into a major national platform -- as he is regularly featured on conservative talk shows and has become such a hot commodity among pro-Trump people within the party that he is traveling to Wyoming this week to campaign against Rep. Liz Cheney.\n Members of Congress see social media then as a way to cut past the traditional path to power. Why spend years making nice with older members and serving as the 14th ranking member of the minority party on the House Appropriations Committee when you could be a weekly guest on Sean Hannity's primetime show on Fox News and gets thousands of retweets for anything you put on Twitter?\n What the focus on Twitter and Facebook incentivizes is a willingness to take the most extreme stances. It gives priority to the loudest voices in the room, which are not always the smartest voices in the room. And it disincentivizes those not willing to throw rhetorical bombs in the constant hunt for retweets and likes.\n Of course, what the social media shortcut, uh, shortchanges, is the actual work that members of Congress are elected to do. Like legislate. And pass bills. And find ways to deliver for their constituents.\n You can absolutely argue -- and be right! -- that the old way of doings things in Congress tended to reward longevity over effectiveness. And tilted heavily to keeping older white men in positions of power while offering few avenues of opportunity for women and people of color.\n But what has replaced that old system is also deeply flawed. Congress was envisioned as a deliberative body -- where members of both parties engaged in lively debate and, while not always agreeing, found ways to work together. None of that can be done with a tweet -- no matter how fire it is.",

        "title": "Republicans and Democrats see promise and uncertainty in Ohio's open Senate race",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The unexpected retirement of Republican Sen. Rob Portman has set off a frantic scramble in Ohio, leading numerous Republicans and a handful of Democratic lawmakers to consider making a run at the now open seat.\n The race, beyond being key to control of the Senate, will have significant implications for a state that has been steadily moving to the right for a decade and will speak volumes about the state of each party.\n For Republicans, the race represents a chance to further assert their dominance in the onetime battleground, signaling yet again that a state former President Barack Obama won twice is no longer a welcome place for Democrats. But the party is also in a precarious position after the tumultuous departure of former President Donald Trump. A contentious primary for a coveted Senate seat could further exacerbate these deep fissures.\n For Democrats, the seat offers a chance to prove that a member of their party not named Sherrod Brown can win a statewide election in the Buckeye State. But the race, alongside one for the governor's mansion in 2022, also threatens to expose the damage that years of Republican victories have done to the Democratic bench in Ohio, a reality that could allow younger talent to test their statewide ability.\n \"It changes the landscape,\" Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat seen as a top contender for the Senate seat, said of the Portman decision. \"I don't think people are very happy [in Ohio], in terms of their families, their communities and how they feel about their future. And in Ohio, the only people who have been in charge are Republicans. So I think that gives us a great opportunity.\"\n Republicans have dominated Ohio ever since Obama won the state during his reelection bid in 2012. The party swept statewide office races in 2014. Two years later, Trump carried the state by 8 points while Portman easily beat former Gov. Ted Strickland in his bid for reelection. The party again showed its strength in 2018, electing Mike DeWine to his first term as governor. And last year, Trump once more carried Ohio.\n This dominance on both the congressional and statewide level has created a deep bench of Republican office holders, many of whom quickly sprang into action at the chance to run for an open Senate seat.\n \"These seats don't open up very often,\" said Mike Hartley, a longtime Republican strategiest in Ohio. \"So if you are in any position and have ever wanted to do it, you do it.\"\n Hartley later joked that when national Republicans called him on Monday to talk about who is thinking about filling the seat, he simply said, \"Every name you could possibly think of.\"\n The most significant divide in Republicans seeking the job will be between the state's congressional delegation and the statewide elected officials.\n At least four members of Ohio's congressional delegation are considering running, but the person seen as the best positioned is Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch conservative with deep ties to Trump. Reps. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup and Mike Turner are also considering bids, people close to the process said.\n Because these lawmakers come from reliably Republican districts aided by gerrymandering in the state, they are more conservative than others considering running for the seat, and none more so than Jordan. But the congressional candidates won't clear the field. Multiple statewide elected Republicans in Ohio are considering a run, including Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n Unlike Jordan and the other congressional lawmakers, Ohio's statewide elected officials, while conservative, have not been as deeply devoted to Trump and, at times, have been seen as out of step with the Trump base of the party.\n Both Husted, who has been an elected official in Ohio since 2001, and LaRose, who served as a Green Beret in Iraq and is a former member of the state Senate, would be seen as more establishment choices, in line with DeWine, who has, at times, been a Trump critic. The two have been critical of Trump in the past, including when Husted was heckled at a Trump rally for urging attendees to put on masks to combat the coronavirus.\n \"In my humble opinion, it starts with Congressman Jim Jordan,\" said Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life. \"He has an opportunity to be either a king or a king maker.\"\n The Trump factor will loom large over the race. The former president is so close to Jordan he gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a president can bestow on a civilian, shortly before he left office. And Trump has been critical of DeWine, especially after the Ohio governor broke with other Republicans to say Biden won the election.\n And there is no indication that Trump's grip on the party -- especially on the right -- will weaken over the next two years.\n \"I live in rural Ohio, 25 miles from the Capitol. There are five Trump signs or flags that remain on my street,\" said Colton Henson, a Republican operative in the state. \"If a candidate thinks there won't be a Trump litmus test for many Republican voters, they may want to rethink strategy.\"\n Democrats face a markedly different issue. While the party is largely unified in Ohio, significant losses in the last eight years have diminished the bench of talent in the state and left the party searching for big names who could mount campaigns for statewide office.\n \"It is a good opportunity to show Democrats can be viable in the state,\" said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio House Democratic Caucus.\n In order to succeed, however, some Democrats believe the infighting inside the Republican Party needs to continue, hoping it further splits the party ahead of the general election.\n \"The Republican Party is having such a massive civil war,\" said former Ohio Democratic Party Chair David Pepper. \"They have more of a bench, but the way they have won through gerrymandering has also shaped the politics of their office holders and [the possible candidates] from Congress are much further to the right because they have been living in these gerrymandered districts.\"\n The two Democrats seen as top candidates for the Senate seat are Whaley and US Rep. Tim Ryan, both of whom said they were considering their options in the wake of the Portman news. But the list of candidates does not stop there.\n Danny O'Connor, the county recorder in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, told CNN he is considering mounting a campaign. Some Democrats are looking to recruit Dr. Amy Acton, who rose to prominence as DeWine's public health director as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Other Democrats have looked at Emilia Sykes, the young, Black minority leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, as someone who could mount a historic campaign and motivate Democrats.\n For Ohio Democrats, the model for someone who can win statewide is Brown, the populist senator who, despite being an avowed liberal, has found success in the state by relating to both independents and Republicans. While that legacy has led some in the state to believe nominating candidates like Brown is the surest way to win, the last decade has demonstrated that his appeal is not only unique, but also difficult to replicate.\n \"I'm considering this because Ohioans have been left behind time and time again,\" said O'Connor. \"I'm from a small town that gets smaller every year. I know the decency of our people but also that our niceness isn't going to put food on the table. We need someone who will fight, scrap and claw for every worker who hasn't had a pay raise or is looking for work.\"\n Other possible candidates argued that trying to be Brown is what Ohio Democrats have done for the past decade -- and it hasn't worked.\n \"One thing that we have an opportunity to do is show that with diverse candidates, with women and people of color, there is a pathway to win,\" said Sykes, who told CNN she is considering a bid. \"What we are learning is that when you put women on the ballot, women win. When you put people of color on the ballot, we win.\"\n Sykes pointed to Melody Stewart, a Black Democrat who won a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court in 2018.\n Whaley made a similar case, too, noting that many of the Democratic losses over the last decade have come when Democrats put up White male candidates.\n \"We don't need to be insane as a party,\" she said. \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Certainly, trying something new would be good after decades of trying things the other way.\"\n And while almost all Democrats argued that the path to victory comes through organizing the base and creating excitement, people like Shannon Hardin, the president of the Columbus City Council, backed up Sykes and Whaley.\n \"We have to get real organizing and real voter registration efforts in urban communities and in some of our rural areas,\" said Hardin. \"A Black man, middle named Hussein, last name Obama, won this state in 2012. It is still right, we have a lot of work to do, we have some cultural hills to climb here, but I think with the right candidate and that message on the working class, I think we have a real shot at this thing.\"",

        "body_text": "Announcement from Director of Engineering Jeremy Bowers:\n The Washington Post\u2019s newsroom engineering team is excited to introduce you to our 2021 summer interns! This year\u2019s class will be working with our team on projects like an internal documents pipeline, supporting our graphics and visual investigations work, and of course, election modeling and data visualization.\n Sophie Andrews is a rising junior at Stanford University studying Math and Computational Sciences. She's written data journalism articles for The Stanford Daily and built the online National Vote Trackers for The Cook Political Report. She's also interned with the FCC and the National Renewable Energy Lab. Sophie loves to travel and has spent much of quarantine daydreaming about her next adventure once the pandemic is over. In her free time you can find her going down a Youtube rabbit hole to figure out the inner workings of the world, watching a medical drama, or playing the violin.\n Aaron Brezel graduated from Columbia University with Master's degrees in journalism and computer science. He has enjoyed internship stops at the Los Angeles Times as an R&D developer, the Miami Herald as an investigative journalist and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as a culture reporter. His Columbia thesis project on tracking emergent far-right memes won the Brown/Tow Award for Excellence in Computational Journalism. Aaron will be joining us following a stint at his kitchen table in Brooklyn. He spent the last several months researching crowdsourced journalism for Consumer Reports. Aaron has hiked just about every mile of trail in the Hudson Valley and plans to one day walk the entire 2,190 miles of the Appalachian Trail. Hit him up if you want to go camping.\n Mohar Chatterjee joins us from Columbia University, New York, where she is currently working on getting two M.S. degrees by May 2022 \u2014 one in Computer Science and one in Journalism. Lately, Mohar is quite interested in problems surrounding real-time information distribution and access. Prior to her time at the Washington Post, Mohar completed a residency at CERN in Geneva, where she helped document ground-breaking scientific experiments in high energy physics while working for filmmaker Leslie Thornton. Mohar holds a B.S. degree from Caltech, where she helped build four robots, worked in four engineering research labs and a small SoCal Venture Capital firm. Along the way, she earned a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Business, Economics, and Management. Before coming to the United States in 2015, Mohar was raised in the Middle Eastern country of Bahrain. She celebrates her Indian-Bengali heritage through an abiding love for music and fish.\n Hong Sen Du is a sophomore at Columbia University studying computer science and economics. On campus, he is the head of Newsroom Development at Columbia Spectator where he explores how engineering can be used to elevate the storytelling aspect of digital articles. In the past, Hong has worked at several nonprofits and startups in projects ranging from immigrant voter activism to Instagram bot detection. Outside of academics and clubs, Hong loves exploring NYC\u2019s food scene and finding recipes to incorporate into his own personal cookbook. He also loves spending his time in nature, so more often than not, you can find him hiking a mountain or taking walks through the streets of New York.\n Alanna Flores is pursuing an M.S. in Management Science and Engineering as well as a B.S. in Computer Science at Stanford University. She previously worked for the Stanford Social Innovation Review and ran The Stanford Daily\u2019s lifestyle section. More recently, Alanna has interned for the nonprofit law practice Accountability Counsel and researched for the Stanford Computational Policy Lab.\n Deblina Mukherjee is a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Chicago, where she majors in Sociology and minors in Computer Science and Statistics. She does research on the science of science with the Knowledge Lab, and is the Editor-in-Chief of the Chicago Shady Dealer, the University of Chicago's only intentional humor publication. She also contributed to Reductress once! Deblina is super excited to be working on the Post's Newsroom Engineering team this summer. She is originally from New Jersey.\n We\u2019re excited for this cohort of interns to join The Post\u2019s engineering team for the summer. Make sure to give them a follow on social media!",

        "title": "Democrats signal they could take next steps on Covid relief package as soon as next week",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Democrats are swiftly moving to unlock an arcane Senate budget process to pass a Covid-19 relief bill with just Democratic votes even as the Biden administration continues their outreach to Republican senators to make the bill bipartisan.\n Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday that the Senate could move as soon as next week to pass a budget resolution. That would be a first step in beginning the process to write a bill that would include Democratic priorities and could pass the Senate with just 51 votes.\n \"In keeping our options open, on our caucus call today, I informed senators to be prepared that a vote on a budget resolution could come as early as next week,\" Schumer said.\n Still, passing a budget resolution is just the first step in what is known as reconciliation, a specific and technical Senate budget process that allows passage of some legislation with just a simple majority. A vote on the resolution, which could bypass committee, according to multiple aides, would then allow the Senate to give a committee specific instructions to craft the language of the relief proposal. After that, the legislation would have to undergo a rigorous review process by the Senate parliamentarian who would decide if each provision in the bill met the rules required under reconciliation.\n Democrats have argued that moving ahead with the budget resolution is hardly a sign that they are giving up on bipartisan talks, but they argue they need to kickstart that process now in case those bipartisan talks falter.\n \"Time is of the essence to address this crisis,\" Schumer said. \"We are keeping all options open.\"\n House Democrats are working on a parallel track also preparing to vote as soon as next week on their own budget resolution.\n \"We are prepared to go to the floor as early as next week,\" Rep. John Yarmuth, the Democratic House Budget chairman told CNN Monday. \"We will be ready to go.\"\n Looming over the legislative effort is the reality for Senate Democrats that an impeachment trial set to begin in two weeks will bring all other Senate business to a halt. Acting now, Democrats argue, is essential in ensuring they don't waste time later.\n The incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Bernie Sanders said that his panel is already writing its budget resolution.\n \"I think that there is a consensus that Republicans are not prepared to come on board. That's fine,\" Sanders said.\n It is still unclear which committees will ultimately have a role in writing the relief bill. It's expected House Ways and Means as well as Senate Finance will play a pivotal role, although other committees may be given instructions as well.\n Republicans, however, say they aren't done talking. While many have signaled they can't support a Covid relief package that costs nearly $2 trillion just a month after they passed a $900 billion bill, senators are still having conversations with their Democratic colleagues. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas who has been part of the bipartisan talks, told reporters on Tuesday that White House officials had just reached out to him again to follow up. Other Republicans such as Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, said it would be \"irresponsible\" for Democrats to move ahead with reconciliation so soon.\n \"If the House decides to go ahead with the reconciliation approach, which is a way to get around working with Republicans, I think that would be not just a big mistake at this stage at the start of this administration, but irresponsible given what's happened with the Covid-19 package,\" Portman said on Tuesday. \"We're willing to work with them, and we said that on Sunday. We're willing to sit down and work out again, a proposal that is bipartisan that can be passed by both chambers that helps to expand on what we just passed.\"\n Republicans used the reconciliation tool to pass their own tax bill in 2017. They also attempted to repeal and replace Obamacare using reconciliation, an effort that ultimately failed.\n Republicans have been largely critical of President Joe Biden's maiden legislative push, arguing its inclusion of raising the minimum wage to $15 and expanding the child tax credit have little to do with battling the outbreak or the resulting economic downturn.\n Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said there is consensus in recognizing the need for more money for vaccine production, distribution and people to administer the vaccine, but that there is larger disagreement about other provisions.\n She told reporters she had \"a good discussion\" with a high ranking White House official Monday but said, \"This package should focus solely on the persistent pandemic and should not be used as a vehicle for a wish list that certain Democrats have.\"\n Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also on the call, agreed.\n \"I think there's bipartisan support for a number of measures, particularly related to vaccine development, distribution, testing, PPE and perhaps PPP,\" he said, adding that he wanted to wait to hear what other senators thought before he would be able to tell if there's support for additional measures.\n Biden said Monday he does not want to \"cherry pick\" his Covid relief bill, instead saying he wants it to pass as one encompassing bill, as opposed to pulling out specific issues.\n \"Time is of the essence, and I must tell you I'm reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here and then have to go through it again because they all go sort of hand in glove,\" he said.\n The President has said he sees about two weeks as the window for bipartisan negotiations over the bill. And there's the question of how much patience Democrats will have for Republicans during the negotiating process.\n \"Quick is relative,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. \"But if we can get the money out to people and businesses and institutions expeditiously, that's the singular goal. This fixation on bipartisanship is just that \u2014 it's a fixation. I love to work on a bipartisan basis. But if they're gonna block coronavirus relief, then we're gonna move without them.\"",

        "body_text": "WEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 The last time we saw the constructor Mike Knobler, he was communicating with us via a secret code, and in this puzzle he is hiding things in his grid, waiting for us to discover them. It\u2019s almost as if Mr. Knobler wants us to really think to find the answers, and I am here for that.\n 5A. So much to choose from when it comes to \u201cFrequent sights in Road Runner cartoons.\u201d The clues specified a plural, but my first thought was \u201canvil.\u201d The answer happened to be CACTI.\n 16A. I am sure that David HUME was a wonderful philosopher. He could probably out-philosoph most of the other philosophers around him. But this is what I think of when I hear his name (well, this and \u201cThe Good Place\u201d):\n 38A. \u201cWhat\u2019s what, in Italy?\u201d sounds as if it is asking you to get the 411 (Hi, Mom! \u201cWhat\u2019s the 411?\u201d is a slang expression for \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d) on something happening in Italy. Read as \u201cWhat is \u2018what,\u2019 in Italy?,\u201d this clue is really asking you for the Italian word for \u201cwhat,\u201d and the answer is CHE.\n 52A. A NOOGIE is administered by using the knuckles on a person\u2019s head.\n 61A. I love this quote. James Brown once said, \u201cI only got a seventh-grade education, but I have a doctorate in FUNK.\u201d Let\u2019s listen to the professor:\n 70A. If you make a 180-degree turn in crossword-land, you have pulled a UEY. You have about a 50 percent chance of spelling it correctly, because it can be spelled UIE as well.\n 34D. Yes, one of a pair of towel markings may be HERS. It may not. A \u201cmaybe\u201d might have been useful here.\n 40D. You\u2019re not a geography buff, you say. How are you supposed to know which city is across the Rio Grande from Ju\u00e1rez, you say. And this is why you don\u2019t solve past Monday or Tuesday, you say.\n Bushwa, I say. The answer is to work the crossings. Once you have a few of those, it\u2019s not that much of a leap to make an educated guess at EL PASO.\n The key here is to read the theme clues carefully, paying special attention to the part after the ellipsis. All three of the theme clues take the form of \u201cWord \u2026 or where this answer goes?\u201d So we have been given a hint to look beyond the theme entry in some direction to find out why that entry has been placed there.\n Mr. Knobler offers us three well-known phrases that start with a synonym for \u201cUNDER\u201d (in fact, one of the theme entries is UNDER THE WEATHER). In turn, each of these entries is BENEATH a word that is a synonym for the last word.\n For example, at 15A, the answer to \u201c\u2018Silence is the most perfect expression of ___\u2019 (line in a Shaw play)\u201d is SCORN. And right BELOW that is the theme entry, BENEATH CONTEMPT. Which it is; SCORN is a synonym for CONTEMPT.\n Similarly, at 36A, the answer to \u201cWhat to expect between June and September in India\u201d is MONSOON, and right BENEATH that, at 39A, is the theme entry UNDER THE WEATHER.\n I thought that this was a very cool find on Mr. Knobler\u2019s part. Grid placement themes can occasionally seem clunky if too many places or directions are used, but this one was consistent yet fun to discover, just perfect for a Wednesday.\n Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.\n Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.\n Your thoughts?",

        "title": "The Republican Party is at war with itself as it charts its post-Trump future",
        "body_text": "(CNN) A cold war is underway within the Republican Party as its members begin to navigate how former President Donald Trump and his legacy fit into the GOP's future.\n Some in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach.\n The result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward -- and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party's grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump's presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him.\n \"Republicans are entering the wilderness and looking desperately to point blame,\" said Erick Erickson, the conservative commentator and radio host. \"They're going to have to make room for each other or let the Democrats run over them in the midterms.\"\n Disunity could present a more existential threat to Republicans. In his final days in the White House, Trump raised the idea of starting a new political party, a senior Trump adviser told CNN. While others around him dismissed this scheme to launch a \"patriot party\" as unserious, the potential of a split among right-of-center voters looms for Republicans.\n Erickson says the divide in the party isn't just philosophical but literal, with both sides having their own redoubts within the GOP infrastructure.\n \"The pre-Trump establishment right now largely runs the policy-making arm of the party, and the Trump wing controls the state party arms,\" he said. \"That can't last and have the party winning.\"\n For Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a six-term Illinois congressman and one of just 10 Republicans in the House to vote for impeachment, the party is in the midst of a difficult fight about its own identity.\n \"I do think we are in a battle,\" Kinzinger told CNN's Jim Sciutto Monday. \"And it may be a battle that really needs to happen for our party to say, what does it we stand for? Not when it comes to policy, but as much as anything, are we aspirational or are we a party that feeds on fear and division?\"\n Two announcements on Monday reflected how much the Trump wing of the party remains in the GOP's driver's seat -- and that members of the pre-Trump establishment are fading.\n The first was from former Trump White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who declared her candidacy for governor of Arkansas with a press release touting her allegiance to the former president.\n \"A trusted confidant of the President, Sarah advised him on everything from press and communications strategy to personnel and policy,\" read the release. \"For two and a half years, Sarah worked closely with the president, battling with the media, working with lawmakers and CEOs, and accompanying the president on every foreign trip, including dozens of meetings with foreign leaders.\" Trump endorsed Sanders later on Monday, saying in a statement that she \"is a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct.\"\n The second came from Sen. Rob Portman, the moderate Ohio Republican and veteran of the George W. Bush administration who announced he would not seek reelection in 2022 -- prompting a free-for-all for the GOP primary in a state that has taken an increasingly Republican turn in the Trump era.\n Portman's decision to leave a \"safe seat tells you that he doesn't think much is going to get better in Washington, and we are unlikely to take the majority in '22,\" one strategist close to Republican fundraisers told CNN.\n \"We need all the moderates we can get,\" said a second GOP strategist familiar with Ohio Republican politics. \"He's exactly the type we want, and now he will be replaced by someone more 'conservative' by ideology or by positioning.\"\n But \"more conservative\" -- or at least more dedicated to Trump -- is exactly what those most loyal to the former President want.\n For the party's current problems, they blame Republicans too willing to toss Trump overboard following the election. That includes Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. Liz Cheney, two GOP leaders in Congress who publicly condemned Trump for his actions surrounding the January 6 insurrection.\n Cheney, the chair of the House Republican conference, was among the House Republicans who voted for impeachment earlier this month. For that vote, some of the most strident Trump allies in the GOP conference are threatening to strip her of her leadership role. And one of them, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, is going to Cheney's home state of Wyoming this week to speak out against her vote.\n McConnell, meanwhile, has only gestured at his openness to voting to convict, but that has been enough to turn up the pressure from some Republican colleagues. And in two recent speeches on the Senate floor, the Republican leader harshly criticized Trump's actions surrounding the attack and denounced the lie propagated by the President that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n All of that's made McConnell a target of pro-Trump voices in the conservative media.\n \"Mitch McConnell, if you're not going to fight, we deserve better,\" said Fox News host Sean Hannity last week. \"You can go back to representing the people of Kentucky and let somebody that knows how to lead, lead.\"\n Many Republicans with potential White House ambitions are therefore treading lightly.\n Sens. Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, for example, did not object to counting electoral votes like their other ambitious colleagues Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley did. But Trump remains popular among Republican voters, and most polls show little appetite among them to impeach Trump.\n So both Rubio and Cotton, along with other senators who may be looking at running for President, have already indicated they won't support convicting Trump -- a potential hedge against primary voters who may be counting fealty to Trump as an asset in a presidential nominee.\n In some states, party committees and local activists have been lashing out at those who have not sufficiently defended Trump. Backed by Trump himself, Republicans in Georgia have gone after their own elected officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, for not trying to overturn the election.\n In a statement following the January 13 House vote on impeachment, the Texas Republican Party blasted the vote as \"frivolous and cruel.\" And last week, the Oregon Republican Party released a lengthy, fiction-filled statement calling the 10 GOP votes to impeach Trump a \"betrayal.\"\n Over the weekend, the Arizona Republican Party, which had just narrowly reelected its pro-Trump chairwoman Kelli Ward, passed resolutions censuring three of the state's most prominent Republicans: Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake, and Gov. Doug Ducey.\n What happened in Arizona -- a longtime Republican state that Trump lost and where Democrats are ascendant -- worries longtime GOP operatives like Michael Steel, a former top aide to House Speaker John Boehner.\n \"If you say to the people of Arizona that your successful, conservative, two-term governor is somehow a problem, you are dooming yourself to minority status,\" Steel told CNN.\n Erickson agrees.\n \"A party that isn't big enough for Dick Cheney's daughter, Trump's secretary of transportation's husband, John McCain's wife, and the sitting governors of Arizona and Georgia is a party not big enough to win,\" he said.\n CNN's Fredreka Schouten, Jim Acosta, and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Metro safety culture still needs work, board says",
        "body_text": "Metro\u2019s safety culture came under scrutiny Tuesday as investigators disclosed that track workers were left vulnerable to train traffic or electric shock and other employees feared reprisal for raising concerns about safety.\n The Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, an independent panel Congress created three years ago to monitor safety at the transit agency, issued findings at its meeting from three investigations conducted last fall. The probes emphasized Metro\u2019s need to create, update and reinforce safety standards \u2014 something the agency has pledged after the release of a September audit that included 21 safety failures or concerns within its Rail Operations Control Center.\n The commission\u2019s audit included several safety concerns that have gone unresolved for years, but also noted cultural issues that investigators say created an atmosphere of racial and sexual harassment, willful ignorance of safety protocols, and low morale that has contributed to an understaffed control center.\n Metro has restructured supervision of its ROCC and hired a new director for the center to combat problems. Safety Commission Chief Operating Officer Sharmila Samarasinghe said Tuesday the commission has approved 20 of 21 corrective action plans Metro was required to submit after the audit.\n But she said implementing many of the fixes could take years.\n \u201c[Metro] had not made substantial progress in many of these areas over several years, so recovering from these would not be a quick task, either,\u201d she said.\n While Metro is working on transforming its ROCC, the cases the commission detailed Tuesday demonstrate problems that also include track safety and coordination between workers on the ground and in the control center.\n Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said Tuesday that as part of a culture change in the ROCC, \u201cwe are working to modify and enhance our safety protocols for accessing track,\u201d which includes better communications training and updated technology.\n On Aug.\u00a011, a train rolled backward and inadvertently attached to another train while workers were performing tests, safety commission inspector Manuel Lopez said. Rather than leaving the scene untouched for safety investigators, a traffic controller at the rail yard told a train operator to move the trains off the track.\n \u201cThe train operator correctly refused to manipulate the scene of a safety event and the event was eventually properly reported,\u201d Lopez said.\n But the incident further demonstrated why Metro must strengthen its commitment to preserve evidence, safety officials said, an issue that has been cited at least twice before by the commission.\n In the audit of its Rail Operations Control Center, the commission found a lack of adequate chain-of-custody procedures for evidence recovered after incidents occur. Meanwhile, workers in October performed tests on equipment from a train separation that safety inspectors didn\u2019t want touched.\n In another incident, a track inspection team was working on the Red Line on Aug.\u00a027 near the Takoma Park station while rail traffic hadn\u2019t been stopped.\n The team had requested a stoppage, but the ROCC told it to stand by. The team began working in the area and was surprised by an oncoming train, inspectors said.\n Members of the team told safety investigators they weren\u2019t watching for train traffic because they assumed the ROCC was watching out for them.\n \u201cCommunication breakdowns, efficiency pressures and an apparent acceptance for not adhering to written procedures contributed to this event,\u201d commission investigator Bruce Walker said Tuesday. \u201cThe investigation suggests that Metrorail has allowed procedures to be ignored. .\u2009.\u2009. This is dangerous and suggests that [Metro] must place a renewed focus on safety, promotion and safety insurance efforts to ensure that workers understand safety rules and that they properly implement those rules.\u201d\n On Sept.\u00a03, a system maintenance and low-voltage power crew working at the Tysons station \u201cimproperly downgraded\u201d its safety plan with the ROCC\u2019s approval and worked while the track was energized.\n \u201cThis put the crew at risk,\u201d Walker said.\n Asked why the plan was changed, Walker said an official in charge told investigators \u201cthere was not much work to do and there was no potential for the workers to contact the third rail so the reduced protection was acceptable.\u201d\n Walker countered that argument Tuesday.\n \u201cThis is not accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roadway worker protection rules exist because there are risks any time the workers access the roadway.\u201d\n Metro policy allows its workers to challenge and question safety matters without fear of retribution or punishment any time they feel they are at risk.\n At least one electrician told investigators \u201cthey were scared to raise a good-faith challenge due to fear of retaliation,\u201d Walker said.\n \u201cThe electricians stated that they just accept the risk and do not put their jobs on the line by making a good-faith challenge,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe entire point of the good-faith challenge is to save lives through a non-punitive reporting culture.\u201d\n Walker said workers are afraid of retaliation that could be as subtle as not being given as much overtime. He said in addition to employees knowing how to report safety concerns, they also must feel comfortable informing investigators about incidents of retaliation.\n Jannetta said Metro \u201cexpressly prohibits retaliation,\u201d adding that employees have multiple ways to report such issues, and it can be done confidentially.\n Safety Commission Chairman Chris Hart said Metro\u2019s safety culture needs continuous monitoring.\n \u201cHas it been remedied or is it still a problem out there? Because when people are afraid to talk, then that indicates a much deeper issue,\u201d he said.\n Commission officials also discussed findings of a recent audit on elevated structures thatdid not have weight load ratings \u201cto confirm the number or type of trains or size of equipment that can safely travel the bridges or the elevated stations,\u201d Samarasinghe said. She said the lack of such information can create hazards if structures become overloaded.\n The audit said that while Metro has developed and published a structural inspection manual, it hasn\u2019t trained staff on policies and procedures in the manual. The audit also said Metro officials don\u2019t have proper structural steel inspection tools, and that structural inspection supervisors are too overloaded with other work to spend enough time in the field studying structures.\n Jannetta said bridges and structures are inspected at least every two years. He said elevated structure replacement and rehabilitation is a priority in Metro\u2019s capital construction program.\n The audit cited Metro for not reviewing credentials, qualifications or training of contractors hired to do elevated structure inspections. The commission gave Metro 45\u00a0days to develop corrective action plans to address issues in the audit.",

        "title": "Kim Jones Wants to Rule the Fashion World",
        "body_text": "Kim Jones, the British designer, is many things.\n He is among the most celebrated men\u2019s wear talents of his generation. He is a five-time winner of various British fashion awards, for men\u2019s wear designer of the year, Trailblazer and Creativity, and he has received the Order of the British Empire. He is the former head of his own label, as well as Dunhill and Louis Vuitton men\u2019s wear, and is the current head of Dior men\u2019s wear. (He is the guy who got Vuitton to collaborate with Supreme, and Dior with Air Jordan.)\n He is BFF with Kate Moss. He is a collector of rare books (about 20,000), rare vintage clubbing wear (early pieces from Vivienne Westwood and Leigh Bowery) and rare vinyl (around 6,000 records). He is a peripatetic child of Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. He is all that.\n What he has not been, however, is a women\u2019s wear designer. He did not study women\u2019s wear at Central Saint Martins, and, at 41, has never made a full women\u2019s collection.\n Yet last September, the executives at LVMH named Mr. Jones the artistic director of women\u2019s wear for Fendi, the position held for 54 years by Karl Lagerfeld, the most prolific, provocative and omnivorously cultured designer of the 20th and early 21st century, one of the few who transcended fashion to become practically a piece of pop art unto himself.\n What were they thinking? This week, as Mr. Jones introduces his debut couture show for Fendi, everyone will find out.\n \u201cIt\u2019s quite a challenge,\u201d said Antoine Arnault, the LVMH group head of communications and chief executive of Berluti, another LVMH men\u2019s brand, who has known Mr. Jones since they worked together at Vuitton. But, he said, Mr. Jones is \u201cone of our superstars.\u201d Then he used words like \u201cmysterious\u201d and \u201cunexplained drive\u201d before finally settling on a soccer metaphor.\n \u201cWhen you have a top footballer on your team,\u201d Mr. Arnault said, \u201cyou want to let him play to to his full potential.\u201d\n Mr. Jones is not the first designer to make the jump from men\u2019s to women\u2019s wear \u2014 Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Raf Simons and Hedi Slimane did it before him \u2014 but given that Fendi surpassed a billion euros in revenue in 2017 (about $1.2 billion) to become one of the more important brands in the LVMH stable, a lot is riding on his success.\n In addition, Mr. Jones remains the artistic director of Dior men\u2019s wear, which means he is not only stepping into Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s shoes at Fendi, but also, like Mr. Lagerfeld, he will be the only designer at the top of two global luxury heritage brands, responsible for at least 12 collections a year, a balancing act that has long been seen as a handicap to creativity.\n Still, said Marios Schwab, who designed a women\u2019s collection in 2003 for Mr. Jones\u2019s namesake label, he has long been \u201cmajorly ambitious.\u201d He did, after all, close his own label with very little tsuris after he landed the bigger jobs, swapping independence for the corporate superstructure of power, budgets and reach. As he told British Vogue when he joined Vuitton: \u201cWhy would I want to do my own label when I can do fantastic things here and put my spin on things?\u201d Then he added, \u201cYou can\u2019t be that na\u00efve about the world, you have to get on with stuff.\u201d\n Besides, said Jefferson Hack, a founder of Dazed Media, who has known and chronicled Mr. Jones since college: \u201cKim\u2019s vision has always been very gender nonspecific. Though he has a strong point of view on the new masculinity, he has also been good at making pieces from his collections appeal to female desire.\u201d\n Not that Mr. Jones himself seems particularly worried. Like Mr. Lagerfeld, he has both a healthy sense of his own talent and an equally healthy lack of neuroses about the size of his job.\n \u201cI think I\u2019ve achieved quite a few good things in my career, and this is the next step,\u201d he said, speaking from the study of his house in West London a few weeks before the Fendi show, which will not exactly be a humble, finding-his-feet debut. Rather, it will be a go-big-or-go-splat bid with a cast that is to include (still to be confirmed) Demi Moore, Kate and Lila Moss, Bella Hadid, Adwoa Aboah, and Christy and James Turlington posed in different vignettes amid a maze of glass boxes in the Palais Brongniart, the former French stock exchange.\n Though Mr. Jones used to have an apartment in Paris, he had given up the lease when he got the Fendi job, to reduce distractions. Instead, he stays in the same room in the same hotel every time he goes to Paris or Rome, kind of the way Mark Zuckerberg wears the same thing every day so he doesn\u2019t have to think about it.\n \u201cThe biggest honor you can get is to be offered the job Karl Lagerfeld did,\u201d Mr. Jones said. Even if it is also the most dangerous because of the comparisons invited.\n As he talked, Mr. Jones was wearing a black Loro Piana vicu\u00f1a knit he said had been a Christmas present. (The brand is also owned by LVMH.) Over Christmas, his normally brown hair had been dyed platinum blond, and he had lost about 33 pounds during lockdown, thanks to having an indoor pool and being home enough to actually have a routine.\n He was sitting in front of a wall of shelves that housed his collection of rare books, including an uncorrected proof of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d a first edition of \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d original lyrics by the Velvet Underground and nine versions of \u201cOrlando\u201d by Virginia Woolf. Among them was one that Woolf had inscribed to Vita Sackville-West, her lover; one owned by No\u00ebl Coward; and another owned by John Maynard Keynes. The positioning was not a coincidence.\n Mr. Jones\u2019s couture show was inspired by \u201cOrlando\u201d and the whole Bloomsbury set, who may have hung out in the English countryside but also had a love affair with Rome (which is, of course, where Fendi was founded). He is fully aware that this may seem a hackneyed choice for a debut, given that Bloomsbury is one of the most overused references in fashion, having inspired such designers as John Galliano, Christopher Bailey and Rei Kawakubo, but in stationing himself in front of his books, he was making an implicit argument about his right to the subject. As well as his understanding of his new job.\n \u201cCouture,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cis very personal.\u201d It is, after all, about garments made to order, for a single person. \u201cOrlando\u201d was demonstrably very personal to him. Hence couture equals \u201cOrlando.\u201d\n And, Bloomsbury was all about strong, intellectual women, and Mr. Jones thought that Fendi, which became famous as a matriarchy, was also all about strong, intellectual women. And, gender fluidity is now part of the cultural conversation, as is the whole concept of time, and both are core to \u201cOrlando.\u201d\n It was a classic Jones move and is one of the reasons LVMH has so much faith in him: He sees all the pieces on his board. Also, he is unabashed in his delight in creating \u201chits\u201d \u2014 products that go viral \u2014 and in his almost scientific interest in plumbing archives and brand iconography for ideas, an approach that has been termed \u201ccommercial biology.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a Virgo Virgo,\u201d Mr. Jones said. As it happens, Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s birthday was the day before Mr. Jones\u2019s birthday. A superstitious person may think this was a telling detail. Mr. Jones prefers to keep it more granular.\n \u201cI\u2019ll read about him and think: \u2018I did that, I do that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jones said of Mr. Lagerfeld. \u201cExcept I arrive at 9 and leave at 7, and he would come very late and keep everyone waiting all night.\u201d\n Though his appointment at Fendi is relatively new \u2014 he has officially been there only just over 14 weeks \u2014 the move was first mooted a couple of years ago when he started to get antsy at Vuitton, and in men\u2019s wear. Men\u2019s clothing may be a growing sector, but women\u2019s wear remains the glamour side of the business: The shows are bigger, as are the collections, celebrities and budgets.\n Rumors had reached a fever pitch that Mr. Jones was going to join Donatella Versace at Versace, to become her heir. Instead, he played his chess pieces like a grandmaster and ended up moving to Dior, with the suggestion, it was rumored, of more to come. Indeed, it was during those earlier negotiations, Mr. Jones said, that Silvia Venturini Fendi (the Fendi family member still involved in the business, and the head of men\u2019s and accessories) broached the idea of him coming to Fendi to work on the women\u2019s line.\n \u201cIt was on the mind of everyone who decides here as soon as we saw how much work power he had and how much his collections touched the right audience,\u201d Mr. Arnault said. Mr. Jones put an Easter egg of sorts in his final Vuitton men\u2019s collection with guest appearances by Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell in shiny LV trench coats (his female friends had always worn pieces from his men\u2019s collections). And at Dior, he delved into the couture archives to add a touch of feminine opulence to his men\u2019s wear.\n As far as Mr. Jones is concerned, it is navigating the multitude of choices in women\u2019s wear that is the biggest learning curve. \u201cAll the embroideries and techniques are a little overwhelming,\u201d he said, noting that when he arrived at the Fendi atelier, he had to ask the staff to leave for 10 minutes so he could go through them by himself.\n For a reality check he has a group of women around him, including Ms. Moss, who consulted on accessories; the stylist Melanie Ward; the art director Ronnie Cooke Newhouse; and, most of all, Ms. Fendi and her daughter, Delfina.\n \u201cWe both surround ourselves with people and objects that inspire us, and draw upon our own lives and passions to fuel our creative process,\u201d Ms. Fendi said of Mr. Jones in an email. She added that as with Mr. Lagerfeld: \u201cKim and I exchange ideas spontaneously via text or chat, as there are no boundaries to our jobs. We see something that might inspire us and share it with the other.\u201d\n Though Mr. Jones made his name at Vuitton and Dior in part by his ability to meld the tropes of street wear and the runway and his embrace of collaborations, those who expect him to reprise those skills, but in women\u2019s wear, will be disappointed. There are no haute sneakers or hoodies in the couture, no work from guest artists. Rather, there are Bernini marble prints and elaborate brocade, pearl-speckled chiffon and rose-festooned silks.\n The collection is a consciously eclectic m\u00e9lange of androgyny and reference, including a nod to Mr. Lagerfeld, with a half-suit, half-evening-gown look inspired by a sketch of his from 1993. Also, there are a lot of capes.\n You can understand why Mr. Jones might have mantles on the mind. And they do look good on everyone.",

        "title": "Blinken Takes Over at State Dept. With a Review of Trump\u2019s Policies",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Antony J. Blinken as the nation\u2019s 71st secretary of state, installing President Biden\u2019s longtime adviser with a mission to rejoin alliances that were fractured after four years of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.\n A centrist with an interventionist streak, Mr. Blinken was approved by a vote of 78 to 22, a signal that senators were eager to move past the Trump administration\u2019s confrontational approach to diplomacy.\n \u201cBlinken is the right person to reassure America\u2019s prerogatives on the global stage,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said before the vote.\n \u201cThis is the person for the job,\u201d said Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n Mr. Blinken, 58, inherits a State Department that he said had suffered from low morale and a work force of about 1,000 fewer employees than when he left as its deputy secretary in early 2017. In his nomination hearing last week, Mr. Blinken said his plans to ensure multiculturalism in the diplomatic corps would be \u201ca significant measure of whether I succeeded or failed, however long I\u2019m in the job.\u201d\n Beyond the nation\u2019s borders, it will be his ability to coalesce skeptical allies and manage a range of adversaries that will be the true test of his influence. His past roles at the center of President Barack Obama\u2019s blunders in Syria, Iraq and Libya also remain a sticking point for his critics.\n Minutes before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, made a lone speech to oppose Mr. Blinken, blaming him for helping draw the United States into conflicts in Libya in 2011 and Syria in 2014 that have fueled regional chaos and instability.\n \u201cWhen we had the Obama administration, with Blinken and other military interventionists, we got more war,\u201d Mr. Paul said. He said Mr. Blinken had failed in his confirmation hearing to assure senators \u201cthat regime change is wrong.\u201d\n In one of the most divisive policy decisions on his horizon, Mr. Blinken has already described a measured willingness to rejoin other world powers in a 2015 agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program, from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2018.\n He has promised a harder line against Russia than President Donald J. Trump was willing to take, and will review American policy toward North Korea, which he described at the Senate hearing as \u201ca problem that has not gotten better; in fact, it\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d\n Mr. Blinken intends to keep the tougher tone that Mr. Trump struck against China \u2014 an overarching strategy the Biden administration will wield either to confront Beijing on human rights abuses and military aggressions, or to compete against it in Africa, Europe and the Indo-Pacific.\n \u201cI disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one,\u201d Mr. Blinken told senators last week, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s approach toward China. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s actually helpful to our foreign policy.\u201d\n He also called the Abraham Accords \u2014 agreements that the Trump administration helped broker for Israel to warm relations with Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 a \u201cgood thing.\u201d\n However, he said, some of the incentives that were offered to the four states to improve ties with Israel merited \u201ca hard look.\u201d Among them are benefits that defy international norms, such as recognizing Morocco\u2019s sovereignty over the Western Sahara.\n Some of the policies Mr. Blinken is now reviewing are decisions that were issued in the final days of the Trump administration and were \u201cclearly designed to box in\u201d Mr. Biden, said Anne W. Patterson, a former career diplomat.\n Mr. Blinken \u201chas to reverse some of these,\u201d said Ms. Patterson, an ambassador during the Obama and George W. Bush administrations and the assistant secretary of state for Middle East policy from 2013 to 2017.\n Here are five Trump administration policies that Mr. Blinken told senators were on his list to review or overturn.\n As secretary of state, Mike Pompeo had debated designating the Houthi rebels in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization for more than a year before finally doing so on Jan. 10, with just over a week left in office. Allies, aid workers and even State Department diplomats had pleaded with him to resist the designation, arguing that it would gravely exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which is already on the brink of famine. Under the designation, food importers could face criminal penalties if their shipments fall into the Houthis\u2019 hands.\n Mr. Blinken said it was not clear that the designation would hinder the Houthis in any practical way, or encourage them to negotiate a peace deal with neighboring Saudi Arabia to end Yemen\u2019s war. Saudi Arabia backs the former Yemeni government that the Houthis ousted in 2015, and Mr. Blinken pledged to withdraw U.S. support for Riyadh\u2019s role in the war.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very specific and concrete problem that we need to address very quickly, if we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to alleviate the suffering of people in Yemen,\u201d he said.\n In Mr. Blinken\u2019s last year as the Obama administration\u2019s deputy secretary of state, 110,000 refugees fleeing violence and oppression in their home countries were authorized to enter the United States.\n He has now inherited a new low that caps refugee admissions at 15,000 for the 2021 fiscal year.\n \u201cPeople who need protection should get it,\u201d Mr. Blinken said.\n One of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s top priorities was to push religious liberties as the crux of American human rights policy, a principle enshrined in the findings of a State Department panel he created in 2019. That Commission on Unalienable Rights was made up mostly of conservatives who critics said opposed abortion and marriage equality, and bypassed the department\u2019s own bureau for democracy, human rights and labor.\n In a discussion about protecting L.G.B.T.Q. people around the world from violence, Mr. Blinken said he would repudiate the report from Mr. Pompeo\u2019s panel, and allow American diplomats to fly the gay pride flag at U.S. embassies abroad.\n Mr. Blinken was careful to underscore support for Taiwan, including helping it defend against Chinese aggression. \u201cI\u2019d also like to see Taiwan playing a greater role around the world, including in international organizations,\u201d he said.\n He said he would review a decision by Mr. Pompeo, announced on Jan. 9, that relaxed restrictions on interactions between American officials and their counterparts in Taiwan. Some of the restrictions have been in place for years, as part of the \u201cOne China\u201d policy that in 1979 ended American recognition of a nationalist government in Taiwan. Their lifting was widely viewed as an effort to lock in a tougher line on Beijing before the end of the Trump administration.\n Mr. Blinken, however, raised the possibility that the step went beyond a law to assess diplomatic relations between Washington and Taipei that Mr. Trump approved just last month. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a hard look\u201d to make sure it has not, Mr. Blinken said.\n Mr. Blinken said he would oversee an interagency assessment to determine whether atrocities against Myanmar\u2019s minority Rohingya, by the country\u2019s security forces, amounted to genocide. The State Department has steered clear of doing so, with officials instead referring to \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in documenting mass killings and widespread evidence of torture and rape.\n The United Nations and prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have described the atrocities as genocide. But, in 2018, an unnamed State Department official told NPR that \u201cwe rarely make atrocity determinations\u201d and would do so only after a thorough review and \u201cbecause we assess that to do so at a particular time will help advance our policy objectives.\u201d\n Mr. Pompeo declared China\u2019s repression of Uighur Muslims as genocide in one of his last acts in office.",

        "title": "SpaceX, Amazon spat pits world's richest men against each other over space real estate",
        "body_text": "Austin, Texas (CNN Business) SpaceX and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 companies run by the two richest men in the world \u2014 are sparring over their competing satellite-based internet businesses, with SpaceX accusing Amazon of \"stifling competition\" and Amazon accusing SpaceX of looking to \"smother competition in the cradle.\"\n Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has an estimated net worth of $209 billion. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, has an estimated net worth of $192 billion. (By comparison, even the lower figure was higher than the annual gross domestic product of more than half the countries in the world in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.)\n At the center of the back-and-forth is a recent attempt by SpaceX to modify its license for Starlink, a massive constellation of internet satellites, of which SpaceX has already launched more than 900. SpaceX already has permission from the US federal government to launch thousands of satellites to bulk up the Starlink constellation, and in recent filings with the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX said it wants to put a few thousand of those satellites in a lower altitude than previously planned or authorized.\n That proposed change could put Starlink satellites in the way of another constellation, called Project Kuiper, that's been proposed by Amazon. The company has not yet launched any satellites, but it has secured an FCC license for the project.\n Amazon's current plans include putting some of its satellites into orbit roughly 590 km (or about 366 miles) above the Earth's surface. The changes to its license that SpaceX is advocating for would allow the company to orbit nearly 3,000 of its satellites at an altitude of between 540 and 570 km (336 to 354 miles), which Amazon argues is too close for comfort. The company argued in its objection that Starlink satellites at that altitude could cause more signal interferences with Project Kuiper satellites and other nearby satellite networks.\n But SpaceX has brushed off those concerns. SpaceX's director of satellite policy, David Goldman, said in a January 22 letter to the FCC that its competitor only came to those conclusions by \"cherrypicking data\" and \"ignoring the majority of the modification\" SpaceX has proposed.\n Musk himself piled on in a tweet Tuesday, saying \"It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation.\"\n Amazon fired back in a statement, saying, \"The facts are simple. We designed the Kuiper System to avoid interference with Starlink, and now SpaceX wants to change the design of its system.\"\n \"Those changes not only create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space, but they also increase radio interference for customers,\" the statement reads. \"Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems. It is clearly in SpaceX's interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public's interest.\"\n SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment nor has it responded to questions from CNN in more than eight months.\n For its part, SpaceX has positioned its proposed change to the Starlink system as one that is better for managing traffic and potential collisions in space, which the industry has widely recognized as a growing threat. Cheaper satellites and rockets have spurred an unprecedented spike in the number of objects being deployed into space. Much of that increase and projected increase has been driven by companies like Amazon and SpaceX that want to deploy thousands of satellites into orbits below 2,000 km, which is already the most crowded area of space.\n Putting satellites into lower orbits is generally considered a best practice because, if a satellite were to malfunction, the Earth's gravity could drag it out of orbit -\u2014 and away from other satellites \u2014 more quickly. Satellites that die at higher altitudes can become uncontrolled projectiles that linger in orbit for years or even decades. For example, a defunct Russian communications satellite and a satellite belonging to US-based telecom firm iridium collided about 789 km above Earth in 2009, creating an enormous debris field that is still in orbit and poses a constant risk to nearby satellites.\n Amazon argued in documents filed with the FCC, however, that SpaceX's proposed changes could actually put Starlink satellites at risk of colliding with Kuiper satellites. SpaceX told the FCC that Starlink satellites could wind up in orbits up to 30 km above or below the orbit they're licensed to use, and that means SpaceX satellites stationed at 560 or 570 km could end up in the path of Project Kuiper satellites licensed at nearby altitudes, an Amazon spokesperson told CNN Business.\n SpaceX did agree, according to FCC documents, that it would restrict Starlink satellites to \"altitudes of 580 km or below.\" But crucially, that restriction would only begin once Amazon began launching its own satellites, and it's not at all clear if SpaceX would abide by it before Amazon begins building its own constellation. Amazon has not said when it will begin launches, but the company's FCC license gives it through July of 2026 to build at least half of its planned constellation.",

President Joe Biden\u2019s White House also offered an interpreter during at least one of last week\u2019s briefings.\n \u201cThe president is committed to building an America that is more inclusive, more just and is more accessible for every American, including Americans with disabilities and their families,\u201d Psaki said Monday.\n Viewers can watch the briefings with ASL interpretation live on the White House\u2019s YouTube channel.\n Deaf advocates around the world praised Biden\u2019s inauguration last week for providing real-time interpreters for the day\u2019s festivities. Andrea Hall, a career firefighter from Georgia, recited the Pledge of Allegiance out loud and in ASL that day.\n \u201cThank you, Captain Hall, for showing us that sign languages belong everywhere, even in the highest ceremonies of state,\u201d tweeted Joseph Murray, president of the World Federation of the Deaf. \u201cHer Pledge on #InaugurationDay shows #ASL is a part of American life and culture.\u201d\n More than 3.4 million Americans identify as deaf, and about 17 million report having \u201cserious difficulty hearing,\u201d according to a 2014 census survey of Americans with disabilities.\n The National Association of the Deaf sued President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in August for failing to provide real-time ASL interpretation during COVID-19 news briefings, stating that the omission violated the First Amendment and laws to protect Americans with disabilities.\n A federal judge ruled in favor of the advocacy group for deaf Americans in September, ordering the Trump White House to provide an ASL interpreter during the public briefings about the pandemic.\n Trump and members of his coronavirus task force provided frequent news briefings in the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. But the public rundowns tapered off after Trump drew backlash for making unsubstantiated claims about the virus and potential treatments for it.\n Watch Monday\u2019s full White House press briefing below.",

        "title": "Israel\u2019s Early Vaccine Data Offers Hope",
        "body_text": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel, which leads the world in vaccinating its population against the coronavirus, has produced some encouraging news: Early results show a significant drop in infection after just one shot of a two-dose vaccine, and better than expected results after both doses.\n Public health experts caution that the data, based on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, is preliminary and has not been subjected to clinical trials. Even so, Dr. Anat Ekka Zohar, vice president of Maccabi Health Services, one of the Israeli health maintenance organizations that released the data, called it \u201cvery encouraging.\u201d\n In the first early report, Clalit, Israel\u2019s largest health fund, compared 200,000 people aged 60 or over who received a first dose of the vaccine to a matched group of 200,000 who had not been vaccinated yet. It said that 14 to 18 days after their shots, the partially vaccinated patients were 33 percent less likely to be infected.\n At about the same time, Maccabi\u2019s research arm said it had found an even larger drop in infections after just one dose: a decrease of about 60 percent, 13 to 21 days after the first shot, in the first 430,000 people to receive it.\n Maccabi did not specify an age group or whether it had compared the data with a matched, non-vaccinated cohort.\n On Monday, the Israeli Health Ministry and Maccabi released new data on people who had received both doses of the vaccine, showing extremely high rates of effectiveness.\n The ministry found that out of 428,000 Israelis who had received their second doses, a week later only 63, or 0.014 percent, had contracted the virus. Similarly, the Maccabi data showed that more than a week after having received the second dose, only 20 out of roughly 128,600 people, about 0.01 percent, had contracted the virus.\n In clinical trials the Pfizer vaccine proved 95 percent effective after two doses in preventing coronavirus infection in people without evidence of previous infection. The Israeli results, if they hold up, suggest the efficacy could be even higher, though rigorous comparisons to unvaccinated people have not yet been published.\n \u201cThis is very encouraging data,\u201d Dr. Zohar said. \u201cWe will monitor these patients closely in order to examine if they continue to suffer from mild symptoms only and do not develop complications as a result of the virus.\u201d\n Both Clalit and Maccabi warned that their findings were preliminary and said they would soon be followed by more in-depth statistical analysis in peer-reviewed scientific publications.\n Israel, where more than 40 percent of the population has already received a first dose of the vaccine, has become something of an international test case for vaccination efficacy.\n With its small population, highly digitized universal health system, and rapid, military-assisted vaccine rollout, Israel\u2019s real-world data provides a useful supplement to clinical trials for researchers, pharmaceutical companies and policymakers.\n Israel made a deal with Pfizer in which the drug company ensured the country an early and steady supply of vaccines in exchange for data. The Health Ministry has made public a redacted version of the agreement.\n Despite its race to vaccinate, Israel is suffering a devastating third wave of the coronavirus. The government reimposed a strict national lockdown this month after weeks of soaring infections and deaths.\n Israel was set to halt most air travel in and out of the country starting at midnight on Monday in an effort to block the arrival of emerging virus variants that could threaten the country\u2019s vaccination campaign. Two vaccine makers said Monday that their vaccines were slightly less effective against one of the new variants.\n While real-world data like that from Israel is useful, it is subject to variables that can skew the results and which clinical trials try to account for.\n The early Israeli numbers are based on the first people to get the vaccine. Such people, experts say, are likely to be more concerned or informed about the virus and therefore more careful about social distancing and mask wearing. They could also differ from those who did not rush to get the shot by location and socio-economic status.\n Also, experts say, the disease changes over time. Prof. Ran Balicer, the chief innovation officer at Clalit and a leading Israeli epidemiologist, said that two-week-old data can be like evidence from a different era or \u201cabout a million vaccines ago in Israeli terms.\u201d\n Maccabi said that it would release more data weekly. \u201cThe main message,\u201d Maccabi said in a statement, is that even the first dose of the vaccine \u201cis effective and reduces morbidity and lowers hospitalizations by many tens of percent.\u201d\n A hazard of releasing raw data, experts cautioned, is that it can be misinterpreted.\n After Clalit first publicized its early numbers two weeks ago, many people heard about a 33 percent drop in cases, not the expected 95 percent, and jumped to the erroneous conclusion that the Pfizer shot didn\u2019t work.\n There was an uproar in Britain, where the authorities have delayed giving the second dose by up to 12 weeks, as opposed to the 21-day gap on which Pfizer based its trials.\n Professor Balicer thought of the results as good news and was dismayed at how they were interpreted.\n \u201cWe were reassured enough to tell everyone that we were seeing what we were supposed to be seeing right after Day 14,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it turned into a message of \u2018Oh my God, it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d\n Professor Balicer, who is also the chairman of the team of experts advising the Israeli government on its Covid-19 response, hoped the positive results might have a bearing on an imminent government decision regarding a third lockdown.\n \u201cCovid has turned us all into amateur scientists,\u201d said Talya Miron-Shatz, an associate professor and expert in medical decision-making at Ono Academic College in central Israel. \u201cWe are all looking at data, but most people are not scientists.\u201d\n Israel, which began vaccinating people on Dec. 20, has given a first shot to more than 2.6 million Israelis and both shots to more than a million people.\n After starting with people aged 60 and above, health care workers and others at high risk, Israel is now offering vaccines to people over 40 and to high school students aged 16 to 18 to allow them to get back to school. The military is assisting the effort and 700 army reserve medics are helping at vaccination centers.\n Prof. Jonathan Halevy, the president of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, had not studied the findings of the H.M.O.s but said that two weeks after the first dose was rolled out he began seeing a drop in severe cases.\n \u201cI know several people who became infected close to the time they got the vaccine, but they got it lightly,\u201d he said.\n Still, Israel remains under a national lockdown and officials are concerned about the emergence of new, highly contagious variants. It remains to be seen how effective the vaccines are against the new variants.\n Despite what appears to be the early success of the vaccine, the virus continues to wreak havoc in Israel. Professor Halevy said his hospital\u2019s Covid wards were still packed to capacity and he expected that it would take another two or three weeks to see a decline.\n The virus has killed more than 1,000 Israelis so far this month alone, nearly a quarter of those who have died from the pandemic virus overall.\n Health officials and experts have attributed much of the recent increase in infection to the fast-spreading variant first detected in Britain.",

        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday spoke in personal terms about a \"full circle\" moment after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at the same National Institutes of Health building her late mother had frequented for work.\n \"I have the luxury of being here at this moment on just the fifth day of our administration -- coming full circle because, you see, NIH was such a huge part of my youth as this place that my mother went all the time and was very excited to work,\" Harris recalled moments after receiving her shot.\n Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast cancer researcher who had \"two goals in her life,\" the vice president said: \"To raise her two daughters and end breast cancer. In fact, little-known fact, my first job was cleaning pipettes in my mother's lab.\"\n Gopalan, who raised her daughters as a single mother, died in 2009. Harris has frequently recalled her mother's profound influence on her life both in and out of politics. After she became the first Black and South Asian woman nominated to a major party's presidential ticket this summer, Harris said, \"I know she's looking down on me from above.\"\n Turning to NIH employees Tuesday as she reflected on her mother's passion for science, Harris added: \"The importance of NIH is that this is about an essential function of government, which is to provide for the public health.\"\n \"The work that happens here has one goal: to improve public health. And the importance of the pursuit of the work that happens at NIH is it's not about profit. It's about the people. And so I want to say to everyone who works here, I know who you are. I know what you do,\" she continued.\n \"I know that you work around the clock with those experiments that have to be checked on every few hours, and they don't care about what time it is on the clock. I know the work you do and the collaboration that is required.\"\n Harris had also received her first vaccine dose on camera last month. She reiterated Tuesday that the shot is \"really pretty painless\" and urged everyone \"to take the vaccine when it is your turn.\"\n \"It will save your life. So thanks to all who are doing this great and important work. Let's make sure everyone gets the vaccine. On behalf of President Biden and myself, I thank you for everything you do every day.\"",

        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) One of the few US senators who led the effort to object to the electoral college results on January 6, Josh Hawley is now claiming that he was never trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n After being asked Friday by CNN's Manu Raju about the rioters who believed the electoral vote could be changed -- pointing to the objections from Hawley and other Republicans -- Hawley said \"I was very clear from the beginning that I was never attempting to overturn the election.\"\n One of the clearest instances of Hawley saying the election could be overturned comes from a Fox News interview in early January.\n On January 4, two days before Congress would certify the electoral college results, Fox News anchor Bret Baier pressed Hawley on what his goal was by planning to object to the certification.\n \"I just want to pin you down on what you're trying to do,\" Baier said. \"Are you trying to say that as of January 20th that President Trump will be president?\"\n \"Well Bret that depends on what happens on Wednesday,\" Hawley said. \"I mean this is why we have the debate. This is why we have the votes.\"\n Hawley's office did not return CNN's request for comment.\n During interviews in December, Hawley repeatedly couched his analysis by saying \"if\" Biden becomes president, implying the election results could possibly be changed.\n \"[I]f Joe Biden ends up being sworn in as president,\" Hawley said on Fox News December 1, \"he should prepare for hard vetting of every single nominee.\"\n Hawley did not denounce the falsehood that the election was stolen but instead supported a Republican-led lawsuit filled with false assertions of mass voter fraud.",

        "title": "Newark and New Jersey officials reach settlement in yearslong lawsuit over lead contamination of city drinking water",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The city of Newark, New Jersey, resolved yearslong litigation Tuesday in connection to its water crisis, in which city drinking water was contaminated with illegally high levels of lead.\n Officials from the city and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) reached an agreement with the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Newark Education Workers Caucus, which sued city and state officials in June 2018 for ongoing violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, including their failure to address the lead crisis on a timely basis.\n A New Jersey federal judge signed an order Tuesday approving the settlement.\n Around the time the lawsuit was filed, quality reports published by the city found drinking water in parts of Newark to be unsafe for 18 months. In 2018, according to the city's water quality report, lead levels at several sites were above 47 parts per billion; federal EPA guidelines say lead levels should fall below 15 parts per billion.\n The report said \"corrosion of household plumbing\" was one source for lead.\n The settlement requires the city to replace all lead service lines free of charge to residents, a process the city estimates it will finish early this spring, Mayor Ras Baraka says.\n More than 17,000 of Newark's lead service lines have been replaced already, closing in on the total, just shy of 19,000, according to an NJDEP news release.\n City workers continued installing the new service lines during the several months when Newark was under a novel coronavirus stay-at-home order, replacing 40 to 50 lines per day while taking additional safety precautions, Water and Sewer Director Kareem Adeem told reporters in July.\n Until the job is complete, the city must continue to provide free drinking water lead testing kits and water filters to residents, according to the agreement.\n The NJDEP will also launch a dedicated web page for Newark water system updates such as ongoing tap water and water quality sampling and corrosion control testing in February that will be maintained through at least the end of the year, per the agreement.\n \"By the grace of God we are near completion of our lead service line replacement program and I am thankful that we were able to identify the issue, do the work, and are able to help make our residents safer,\" Baraka said in a statement Tuesday.\n The lawsuit against the NJDEP and the city of Newark has been dismissed and as part of the settlement, the advocacy groups cannot bring further actions related to the past city water situation.\n The parties did not seek monetary damages in the suit.\n Officials with the Natural Resources Defense Council credited the settlement agreement to Newark officials' \"significant progress\" in removing the lead pipes.\n \"Newark's aggressive lead service line replacement program, at no direct cost to residents, could serve as a model for the nation once it is completed,\" the group's senior strategic director for health, Erik D. Olson, said in a statement.\n In October, the federal Environmental Protection Agency awarded the Newark Board of Education a $7.5 million grant to help fund its effort to deal with remaining lead pipes and fixtures in city schools, according to an EPA news release.\n The Newark Board of Education detected lead levels in school drinking fountains for years beginning in 2010.\n \"Modernizing the nation's aging water infrastructure is vital in ensuring access to clean, safe drinking water and protecting our communities from the dangers of lead exposure. Our administration is committed to confronting this challenge head on and having New Jersey lead the nation in updating critical water infrastructure to benefit all residents and future generations to come,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n CNN's Susan Scutti contributed to this report.",

        "title": "MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has been banned from Twitter",
        "body_text": "(CNN Business) Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow, was banned from Twitter Monday night, according to a Twitter spokesperson.\n Twitter made its decision based on a new policy it enacted after the Capitol insurrection whereby people who repeatedly share election misinformation can be permanently banned.\n \"The account you referenced has been permanently suspended due to repeated violations of our Civic Integrity Policy,\" the spokesperson told CNN.\n It is not immediately clear which tweets led to Lindell's ban.\n Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling MyPillow products after Lindell voiced continued support for former President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and voicing false statements publicly about the validity of the election. Lindell, a major Republican donor, called the attack \"very peaceful\" and blamed \"undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people\" for the chaos, according to The New York Times. \"Donald Trump will be our president for the next four years,\" he said earlier this month.\n According to that policy, the more violations a person commits, the more severe the ban. Two strikes result in a 12-hour lock, for example, while five or more strikes can result in what the company calls a \"permanent suspension.\"\n \"You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes,\" Twitter said of its civic integrity policy in January. Civic processes include: political elections, censuses and major referenda and ballot initiatives.\n Twitter also banned Donald Trump's the @realDonaldTrump account earlier this month, citing the insurrection.\n \"After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter said.\n \"In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action.\"\n Twitter's decision followed two tweets by Trump that violated the company's policy against glorification of violence, Twitter said, and \"these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President's statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks.\"",

        "title": "Covid Dented Lobbying by Business Groups Ravaged by Pandemic",
        "body_text": "Chalk up another victim of the 2020 pandemic: big business groups that fuel Washington\u2019s influence industry.\n As the coronavirus forced lockdowns and slammed the economy, some trade groups took a hit to their annual dues and canceled plans for revenue-generating conferences. As a result, some of Washington\u2019s biggest and most powerful trade associations spent less on lobbying in 2020 than in 2019, year-end disclosures show.\n The list of groups that posted declines includes many whose members were hardest hit by the pandemic: the Business Roundtable, American Hotel & Lodging Association, Cruise Lines International Association, National Retail Federation, National Restaurant Association and the National Federation of Independent Business.\n The Business Roundtable spent nearly $17 million, down from almost $20 million in 2019. The National Association of Manufacturers spent about $9 million, less than two-thirds of what it laid out in 2019 to influence Washington, the figures show.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve all been wrapped up in this pandemic and that really has changed the nature of lobbying,\u201d said Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group, Public Citizen. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to when we get rid of this pandemic so we can go back to the old style of lobbying.\u201d\n The virus has forced government affairs professionals to replace in-person meetings with cheaper forms of lobbying, such as Zoom sessions with congressional staffers and letter-writing campaigns.\n Advocacy organizations continue to ask constituents to make phone calls and send emails. But asking them to show up at lawmakers\u2019 town hall meetings and flying them into Washington for strategy sessions or in-person visits are off limits. \u201cWe can\u2019t do any of the big, expensive ticket stuff,\u201d said Holman.\n Several of the groups that reduced their lobbying activities still spent 2020 scrambling to win virus relief measures for their members. They had to do more with less money as they advocated for multiple rounds of stimulus from Congress.\n The National Retail Federation spent $6.2 million, down from $7.7 million in 2019. The restaurant association spent about $2.6 million, down from $2.9 million, while the NFIB, which represents small businesses, spent $3.3 million, down from $4.7 million.\n There were some outliers to the downward trend. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of Washington\u2019s most powerful business groups, spent more than $70 million last year, up from $58 million in 2019. One reason for the jump, a spokesman said, is that midway through 2020 the chamber absorbed the Institute for Legal Reform, a unit that had previously lobbied and reported separately.\n Airlines for America, which represents another hard-hit industry, increased its lobbying expenditures nearly 25%, to $6.3 million.\n Some prominent law firms with lobbying arms and boutique lobbying shops also saw their receipts climb. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, the top firm by lobbying revenue, took in almost $50 million in lobbying fees in 2020, $7 million more than the year before. Lyft Inc., Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE Corp. and the National Association of Theatre Owners are among its clients.\n Technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc., which became even more crucial to everyday life in the pandemic, continued to dominate lobbying spending by single firms.\n The online retailer, which benefited as customers avoided in-person shopping, spent $4.7 million, a company record, on lobbying in the fourth quarter after setting a record in the third quarter. The company laid out almost $17.9 million for lobbying in 2020.\n Still, Facebook Inc. outspent Amazon for the year, laying out nearly $19.7 million, up from $16.7 million in 2019. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which has been trimming spending under new Washington leadership, spent $7.5 million last year, down from $11.8 million in 2019. Apple Inc. spent nearly $6.7 million in the same period, down more than 10% from a year earlier.\n Tech companies, especially Facebook and Google, faced an onslaught of Washington threats in 2020. Federal antitrust enforcers sued both companies. A House committee called for changes in antitrust law that could make it harder for the tech giants to grow and make acquisitions. The panel issued a stinging report following a 16-month investigation, which included testimony from the heads of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook.\n Oracle Corp., which spent years pushing a case against Google, disclosed spending about $8.1 million for lobbying in 2020, up from about $6.8 million in 2019.\n ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese owner of TikTok, the popular video app, also saw a big jump in its influence spending. It reported $2.6 million for 2020 lobbying, compared with $270,000 in 2019. Trump had sought to force the sale of TikTok, but that didn\u2019t happen before his term ended.\n In the first quarter of 2021, the pandemic again will compete for lawmakers\u2019 attention, along with impeachment proceedings of former President Trump. This could once again reduce the chances that lobbyists can entice lawmakers to focus on their clients\u2019 issues.\n \u201cI\u2019ve had a very difficult time trying to get some of my ethics issues considered by Congress,\u201d said Public Citizen\u2019s Holman, who said his efforts included a measure to make it easier to track lawmakers\u2019 stock market trades. \u201cI suspect that trade associations and business groups are also having a very difficult time trying to get Congress to address some of their cherished issues,\u201d Holman said.\n The lobbying business is also undergoing a shift now that President Joe Biden has taken over the Executive Branch and Senate control has switched to the Democrats.\n On K Street, planning for the change in power began as early as last summer and accelerated as Biden\u2019s polling lead remained strong through October. Lobby firms began tracking new priorities such as corporate tax increases, building databases on potential appointees and seeking new staff and clients.\n Ballard Partners, which set up a flourishing lobbying business in Washington thanks to its founder\u2019s fundraising for Trump, ended relationships with 14 clients in the fourth quarter, including Uber Technologies Inc., the filings showed. The group, however, registered many new clients and discloses more than 100 overall.\n Ricchetti Inc., the firm founded by incoming Biden counselor Steve Ricchetti with his brother Jeff, has brought on five new clients in the fourth quarter, including Amazon.com Inc., according to the records.\n Biden has already put into place limits on lobbying by his top administration officials when they leave. In the final hours of his presidency, Trump revoked his administration\u2019s own lobbying pledges, which banned political appointees from lobbying their old agencies for five years after leaving the government.\n The reports, which registered lobbyists must file quarterly with Congress, reveal what issues they focused on and how much money they received, but they don\u2019t include which specific officials they reached out to and which issues were their top priorities. Lobbyists representing foreign governments or political parties file separate disclosures.\n For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Rand Paul calls impeachment 'dead on arrival' after most Republicans signal that trial is unconstitutional",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) The Senate tabled an effort by Sen. Rand Paul Tuesday to force a vote on the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, but the vote offered an indicator for how Republican senators -- who overwhelmingly voted for Paul's measure -- feel about the trial.\n Paul's motion was killed on a 55-45 vote, with five Republicans joining all Democrats, meaning 45 Republicans voted for Paul's effort. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n In order to convict Trump at his trial, at least 17 Republicans will need to vote with all Democrats when the trial begins next month. Significantly, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sided with Paul in the vote -- a potential indicator that he agrees the constitutionality of impeaching a former President is in question.\n Paul argued after the vote that the fact that 45 Republicans sided with him \"shows that impeachment is dead on arrival.\"\n \"If you voted that it was unconstitutional then how in the world would you ever hope to convict somebody for this?\" Paul asked, adding ,\"45 of us, almost the entire caucus, 95% of the caucus, voted that the whole proceeding was unconstitutional. This is a big victory for us. Democrats can beat this partisan horse as long as they want -- this vote indicates it's over, the trial is all over.\"\n Even those Republicans who voted against Paul's measure -- including Collins -- said Tuesday's vote was a sign of the eventual outcome of the trial.\n \"Do the math,\" she said. \"I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that the President will be convicted.\"\n Still, the trial will offer both sides a chance to make their case, and some lawmakers who voted with Paul left open the idea that they still could vote differently next month.\n John Thune, the Senate minority whip, argued that the vote won't bind lawmakers after the trial gets into full swing.\n \"It was a question on the constitutionality of it. I don't think it binds anybody once the trial starts,\" he said, adding, \"But I think most of us thought that the threshold issue of whether or not you can remove as the Constitution suggests somebody who is no longer in office -- I think most of our members concluded that from a constitutional standpoint is on really shaky ground.\"\n Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who recently announced he won't seek reelection in 2022, said he voted with Paul because he thinks there should be a debate on the constitutionality of an impeachment trial for a former president.\n \"I want to hear it debated,\" Portman told reporters. \"The vote to table is inconsistent with that, you know, but I've not made my mind up. I'm a juror. And I mean I've the same position Mitch McConnell has. He didn't do that to be tabled either, even though he wants to have, you know, a fulsome discussion.\"\n The Democratic-led House has already voted to impeach Trump, charging him with incitement of insurrection for the attack on the Capitol that left multiple people dead. But two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to convict Trump after a trial, an extremely high bar to clear.\n The Senate vote on Tuesday effectively put senators on record as to whether they believe a trial of a former President is constitutional. Given the limited language in the Constitution on impeachment, legal experts disagree about whether the Senate can convict a former president. But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional.\n Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said earlier on Tuesday of the possibility Paul could force the vote, \"he has a wealth of very unusual ideas.\"\n Paul said in a floor speech ahead of the vote, \"I want this body on record, every last person here: Is this how you think politics should be?\"\n \"Democrats insist on applying a test of incitement to a Republican that they refuse to apply to themselves,\" he said. \"I want Democrats to raise their hands if they have ever given a speech that says 'take back,' 'fight for your country,' who hasn't used the words fight figuratively?\"\n He went on to say, \"Are we going to put every politician in jail -- are we going to impeach every politician who has used the words fight figuratively in a speech? Shame!\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Ali Zaslav and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.",

The orphanage told the abductors it does not have the money and is asking for people to pray for the safe return of the children.\n \"They told me they knew that the kids were orphans,\" he said. \"I feel so sad that because these are just little innocent kids; the oldest among them is just 16 years old and most of the others are between the ages of 5 and 6,'' said Odewu.\n The culprits have not yet been identified, but the police are on their trail, he said, adding that kidnappings like this one are \"not new in the community.\"\n Hundreds of students were abducted in December by gunmen in Katsina State in northwestern Nigeria. They were missing for nearly a week before the Nigerian military rescued them from bandits masquerading as the Islamist terrorist group, Boko Haram.\n While kidnapping for ransom by criminal elements in Katsina State have seen a disturbing increase, an abduction on this scale has not been reported previously. It recalls the kidnapping of 276 girls from Chibok in 2014. More than 100 of those girls never returned home.",

        "source": "washpost",
        "title": "What McConnell got \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 on the filibuster",
        "body_text": "The new 50-50 Senate is set to proceed under a power-sharing agreement after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday night dropped his demand that the agreement require that the filibuster be maintained for the next two years.\n To hear some people tell it, he\u2019s backing down without having gotten much in return. To hear McConnell\u2019s team tell it, he won by gaining other assurances about the longevity of the filibuster and its 60-vote threshold for most legislation.\n The truth is decidedly somewhere in between, though, and it\u2019s unlikely all of this changed too much.\n One thing we knew: The votes weren\u2019t there to get rid of the filibuster right now. Democrats would need to vote in lockstep to abolish it, and several members have either said they wouldn\u2019t support doing so or have reservations.\n The real question, then, was whether they would reserve the ability to do so at a later date, if their members decided that Republicans weren\u2019t operating in good faith. So McConnell gave an ultimatum saying that the rules must require that the filibuster remain intact.\n He didn\u2019t get that, but in dropping his demand, he cited two Democratic senators who said they wouldn\u2019t vote to nix the filibuster \u2014 apparently rendering the proposal dead for the foreseeable future.\n Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said: \u201cI do not support doing away with the filibuster under any condition. It\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n He added: \u201cIf I haven\u2019t said it very plain, maybe Senator McConnell hasn\u2019t understood, I want to basically say it for you: That I will not vote in this Congress \u2014 that\u2019s two years, right? \u2014 I will not vote\u201d to change the filibuster. Of any possibility that he would change his mind, he said: \u201cNone whatsoever that I will vote to get rid of the filibuster.\u201d\n Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) took a similar position, with her office saying that she is \u201cagainst eliminating the filibuster, and she is not open to changing her mind about eliminating the filibuster.\u201d\n Both, notably, had previously said that they firmly opposed such a change. Manchin reiterated his position after the 2020 election \u2014 though before Democrats retook the Senate by winning both Georgia runoffs \u2014 by saying, \u201cI will not vote to do that.\u201d Sinema, too, said last summer, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken about this many times before, and I do not believe we should take away the filibuster.\u201d\n To the extent McConnell got something out of this, it was that both made their verbal commitments not to do away with the filibuster in the near future more ironclad and, especially in Manchin\u2019s case, a commitment that nothing will change his mind for the next two years. McConnell spokesman Doug Andres also said Sinema has provided an arguably even more ironclad assurance to McConnell personally that she would reverse course under no circumstances.\n Both Manchin\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s comments would, at the very least, make a reversal in the next two years into a demonstrable and clear-cut flip-flop \u2014 the kind of thing that could prove a real political liability, especially for Manchin in a very red state. Imagine him opening the door to a more left-leaning agenda after promising not to do so.\n But flip-flops do happen in politics \u2014 quite a lot, in fact. Politicians are good at finding justifications for doing things they said they wouldn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean it will be the case here, and I\u2019m pretty doubtful it will, for the reasons articulated above. But it\u2019s still technically an option that\u2019s on the table if Manchin, Sinema and their Democratic colleagues decide in unison that the times have become drastic enough for such a drastic measure \u2014 a situation such as, say, a pandemic or economic strife.\n Many of their Democratic colleagues have already evolved on this issue. For instance, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), another red-state Democrat, reiterated his opposition to the change this summer but said he might be open to it if the GOP decides to \u201cstonewall, stonewall, stonewall.\u201d\n And there\u2019s precedent for such agreements going by the wayside. As The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane noted, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) in 2013 reached an accord with McConnell on modest filibuster reforms while leaving it intact, but nixed it later that year for Barack Obama\u2019s non-Supreme Court judicial nominees, citing GOP obstruction. (Reid now supports getting rid of the filibuster altogether.) Reid\u2019s pledges might not have been as ironclad as the ones we see today from Manchin and Sinema, but things can change.\n And even after Monday\u2019s developments, the malleability of the agreement became evident Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) effectively argued that McConnell had caved without getting what he wanted, saying what resulted was \u201cexactly what Democrats proposed from the start.\u201d McConnell responded by pledging \u201cscored-earth\u201d and \u201cimmediate chaos\u201d if Democrats reversed course.\n In the end, the biggest obstacle to this change is the lack of a true Democratic majority. It was unlikely that the filibuster would be scrapped any time in the next two years anyway, and perhaps McConnell helped move it from unlikely to slightly more unlikely \u2014 without technically getting what he asked for.\n And Schumer can still wield it as at least a theoretical-if-unlikely possibility if all Democrats decide McConnell isn\u2019t playing fair \u2014 as McConnell\u2019s comments Tuesday acknowledged \u2014 which is, again, probably where this was headed anyway.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) Around the world, the vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities. Rich countries take the lion's share of inoculations, and poorer states scramble to have even the prospect of life after coronavirus.\n The Middle East is a microcosm of that global problem.\n While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus.\n The first Arab countries to begin vaccinating their citizens and residents were also the richest: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.\n The UAE stands out. The country of almost 10 million, which has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, also has one of the highest vaccination rates globally. More than 2 million residents and citizens have already been vaccinated using the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and China's Sinopharm vaccine.\n The Gulf state has already vaccinated more people than middle-income Jordan plans to inoculate in the first phase of its roll out. Lebanon, currently in the throes of a financial meltdown, has not yet had any vaccines delivered.\n Regional states battered by war do not have concrete plans for procuring and distributing the vaccines even as international organizations step in to help.\n Arnaud Bernaert, the head of global health and healthcare industries at the World Economic Forum (WEF), said the world shouldn't be \"naive\" about these inequities.\n \"High-income countries have political and legal reliability, which allows them to organize the fastest possible plans to protect their populations,\" he said. \"It will always be that way.\"\n \"[Gulf Arab] countries have smaller populations, larger amounts of funds and strong health systems, so they're in a better position to start their rollout earlier, and that is a fact,\" Dr. Yvan Hutin, director of communicable diseases at the World Health Organization's (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, said.\n \"The Middle East is simply categorized by substantial inequity.\"\n For the non-Gulf Arab states, ridden with poverty, endemic corruption or conflict, the vaccination plans are complicated not just by poor administration, but by a deep distrust for the political leadership.\n \"You need to have a clear vision for the plan [to vaccinate a population], which requires strong governance as well as the capacity to pay,\" Hutin told CNN. \"Most countries in the region don't have either.\"\n In Lebanon, a ruling elite widely accused of corruption has for decades bled the country's resources dry, culminating in a financial downward spiral last year. The medical system has not been spared, and buckled under medicinal shortages and an exodus of health care workers. Last August's Beirut port explosion, which damaged some major hospitals, exacerbated what the country's president has called a full-fledged \"health state of emergency.\"\n Despite having some of the lowest case numbers in the region in the early months of the pandemic, Lebanon now leads the Arab world in cases per million population.\n Two million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are expected to arrive in early February, but they are expected to only cover around 20% of the country's population. On Lebanon's streets, few people believe that the rollout is imminent, or that it will be conducted safely.\n It's a similar story in Iraq and Jordan, countries suffering from economic turmoil and where people have regularly protested to demand political reform.\n Jordan's free Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination program is already underway, but only a very small percentage of the population has signed up to receive it, citing an absence of trust, according to health officials. In Iraq, only 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be available for its 40 million-strong population, despite the country having grappled with repeated surges in Covid cases over the last year.\n But where governments falter, the international community says it's trying to fill in the gaps. WHO is organizing the distribution plans for middle to low-income countries through programs like the COVAX alliance, a global initiative with 190 participating nations aimed at working with manufacturers to provide countries worldwide with equitable access to vaccines.\n Bernaert says he expects a fast rollout despite the myriad challenges. \"Although there will be a lag in vaccinating lower-income countries against Covid-19, it will be far shorter than what we've seen in the past,\" he said.\n Iran and Egypt are the two most populous countries in the region, with Iran at close to 85 million people and Egypt at over 100 million -- complicating distribution for two states that have struggled economically in recent years.\n Egypt started vaccinating its people, starting with medical workers, with the Sinopharm shot on January 24. GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX, will also supply inoculations for 20% of the population, while the Egyptian government said it has signed a deal for 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, covering an additional 10% of the North African state's inhabitants.\n Buckling under sanctions imposed by former US President Donald Trump, Iran is the hardest-hit country by the virus in the region. It has had over 1 million cases and more than 50,000 deaths.\n But Iran is the only regional state that says it plans to produce its own vaccine. Officials say the country also intends to import almost 2 million doses from India, Russia and China by the end of the first quarter of 2021. The imported vaccines will barely cover 2% of the population.\n In the region's conflict zones, governments are incapable of buying their own vaccines, or even distributing them in territories crisscrossed with armed factions and competing spheres of political control. They must almost completely rely on international organizations to do so.\n COVAX has secured nearly 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to be distributed across all its participating 190 countries. But Hutin says that's not enough.\n \"We really wish we had more to give,\" he said. \"We're working on securing more doses, but it's just not going to happen tomorrow.\"\n Syria, already on its knees after almost a decade of civil war, is facing an economic crisis. The country's president, Bashar al-Assad, does not control all of its territory -- much of it was wrested from his regime by opposition groups during the conflict. The government in Damascus -- repeatedly accused of war crimes and human rights abuses -- will rely on GAVI, the vaccine alliance that co-leads COVAX. Opposition groups in Syria's largely Kurdish northeast, and rebel-controlled northwest will do the same.\n In war-torn Yemen, suffering a devastating humanitarian crisis, rival governments in the country's south and north appear to have only a vague notion of what the vaccine rollout will look like.\n In Aden, the seat of the Saudi-backed government, Deputy Health Minister Dr. Ishraq Al-Subei said that Yemen may receive its first batch of the vaccine in March, but that shipment will cover only 20% of the country. It is unclear if this will include territories controlled by Houthi rebels, recently designated terrorists by the former Trump administration.\n In Israel and the Palestinian territories, region-wide vaccine disparities also come into sharp focus. Israel's world-leading vaccination campaign, which is on course to meet the government's target of inoculating the entire country by the end of March, leaves at least 4.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza behind.\n So far none have had the injections, and most are unlikely to get them any time soon -- because there is no Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the Palestinian territories.\n According to United Nations experts, a policy of immunization that differentiates between those with Israeli IDs, and those without, is \"unacceptable.\"\n A UN expert report, published by the UN's Office High Commissioner for Human Rights in January, says that Israel is the occupying power in and over Gaza and the West Bank, and has been since 1967, and is thereby ultimately responsible for the health care of those living under occupation.\n Israel disagrees, pointing to the Oslo accords, signed in the mid-1990s with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Included in the first of those agreements is a clause that hands responsibility to the PA for the health of all Palestinians under its civil administration.\n Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told CNN: \"If we'll get to the situation where everyone in the country who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated, we will be more than ready to share the vaccines with our neighbors.\"\n The Palestinian Authority health minister, Dr. Mai Al-Kaileh, says they expect to get hold of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of March, but that there is no specific date set yet for their arrival. The ministry says it has contracts with four companies producing the vaccine. These vaccines will cover 70% of the Palestinian population and the WHO will provide doses for a further 20%, the PA said in a January 9 statement.\n According to Hutin, the WHO has approached rich countries, including the Gulf nations, to share their doses, and that they have complied but that it's still a work in progress.\n Abu Dhabi's Department of Health launched a local collaboration called the Hope Consortium, which is set to deliver 18 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021.\n The undersecretary at the department, Jamal Mohamed Al Kabbi told CNN's Becky Anderson that the plan represents a complete supply chain solution to address and facilitate vaccine availability across the world.\n Bernaert told CNN despite the delay in vaccinations in lower-income countries, he is more optimistic than he was a few months ago.\n \"Are we going to be able to vaccinate everyone in 2021? No, I don't think so. Is the vaccination tale going to continue in 2022, or even 2023? Yes, I think so. But what we've managed to do so far is a sign that we may be at the beginning of a new era.\"\n CNN's Mostafa Salem in Abu Dhabi, Aqeel Najm in Baghdad, Eyad Kourdi in Gaziantep, Gul Tuysuz in Istanbul, and Andrew Carey, Sam Kiley and Abeer Salman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Supreme Court Won\u2019t Hear Appeal from Sheldon Silver, Former N.Y. Lawmaker",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday let stand the conviction of Sheldon Silver, the once-powerful State Assembly speaker in New York who went to prison last summer on federal corruption charges.\n As is the court\u2019s custom, its brief order gave no reasons for turning down the case. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, saying the court should have heard the case to clarify its rulings on bribery and extortion.\n The court has in recent years been skeptical of broad interpretations of public corruption laws, saying they are not all-purpose devices to ensure good government.\n Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyers told the justices that prosecutors had overreached in his case by securing his conviction of accepting bribes in a real estate scheme without proving that those who made the payments had intended to influence particular official actions.\n The federal appeals court in New York, in affirming Mr. Silver\u2019s conviction for his role in the scheme, said it was enough that he understood that he would take official actions in exchange for the payments.\n Mr. Silver, a Democrat, was convicted in 2015 of accepting nearly $4 million in illicit payments and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. But that conviction was overturned on appeal following a 2016 United States Supreme Court decision that unanimously overturned the broadly similar conviction of Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia.\n Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court in the McDonnell case, said that only formal and concrete government actions may be the subject of prosecutions under federal public-corruption laws.\n Mr. Silver was retried and convicted in 2018. According to prosecutors, Mr. Silver had arranged for real estate developers to hire the law firm Goldberg & Iryami, which sent Mr. Silver a portion of its fees. Mr. Silver then supported legislation that benefited the developers.\n Judge Richard C. Wesley, writing for the Second Circuit panel, said there was ample evidence that Mr. Silver understood that the payments in the real estate scheme were made in return for commitments to take official actions. But there was no requirement, Judge Wesley wrote, of a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d between those making and receiving the payments about what those actions should be.\n In urging the Supreme Court to hear Mr. Silver\u2019s case, his lawyers said that legal standard gave prosecutors too much power.\n \u201cThe Second Circuit approved jury instructions that allowed a state official to be convicted of federal bribery on a jury\u2019s after-the-fact finding that the official had an unexpressed, unilateral understanding (or misunderstanding) that he was being bribed,\u201d the lawyers wrote in their petition seeking Supreme Court review. The ruling, they wrote, \u201cplaces every official at the mercy of federal prosecutors, dismantling this court\u2019s work at reining in federal prosecutors.\u201d\n The brief cited the McDonnell case, in which Mr. McDonnell had been accused of accepting luxury products, loans and vacations from a business executive in return for arranging meetings and urging underlings to consider the executive\u2019s requests.\n It also cited last year\u2019s ruling in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d case, in which the court unanimously overturned the convictions of two defendants in a case from New Jersey. The defendants, former associates of Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey at the time, were accused of taking part in a 2013 scheme meant to punish one of the governor\u2019s political opponents that ended up creating four days of enormous traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge.\n That was an abuse of power, the Supreme Court ruled, but not a federal crime.\n Prosecutors in Mr. Silver\u2019s case responded that earlier Supreme Court decisions \u201cconfirm that the government must prove that the public official understood that he was accepting the bribe in return for an official act\u201d but do not require proof \u201cthat the bribe giver reached an agreement with the official or shared the official\u2019s corrupt purpose.\u201d\n Mr. Silver, 76, served as speaker for more than two decades and played a leading role in almost every major aspect of state politics. In the final days of his administration, President Donald J. Trump considered granting clemency to Mr. Silver, who was sentenced to a 78-month prison term, but decided not to after criticism from Republicans in New York.",

The news release said the inspector general\u2019s office would follow its normal process in releasing the results of its work publicly.\n Horowitz\u2019s announcement comes just days after reporting that Trump entertained a plan to replace the acting attorney general for his final weeks in office, Jeffrey Rosen, with a different department lawyer, Jeffrey Bossert Clark, who was more amenable to wielding the department\u2019s power to help keep Trump in office. Trump aborted the plan only after Justice Department officials threatened a mass resignation, according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s political sensitivity.\n The plan sparked outrage among lawmakers and former Justice Department officials, who saw in it another attempt by Trump to inappropriately leverage the powers of federal law enforcement to benefit his political interests. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) had publicly called for the inspector general to investigate, and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the department to preserve records because they, too, would be looking into the matter. The Senate could subpoena records and seek to compel testimony, although the politics of legislative inquiries often make them less revelatory than other inquiries.\n Horowitz said he announced the investigation \u201cto reassure the public that an appropriate agency is investigating the allegations,\u201d but he declined to comment further. Although Horowitz probably will  have broad access to Justice Department files and emails, he cannot compel the cooperation of former officials \u2014 which could limit his probe. The investigation probably will  reveal conversations that officials had with Trump, but Horowitz\u2019s office does not have the jurisdiction to specifically explore actions taken by the president or other White House officials.\n Trump and his political allies had long sought to press the Justice Department to help boost his unfounded claims of election fraud. The department inquired into allegations across the country but ultimately found the evidence lacking, and then-Attorney General William P. Barr said as much publicly in early December.\n In addition to resisting the installation of Clark as attorney general, top Justice Department officials refused Trump\u2019s demands that they get involved in contesting the election\u2019s outcome at the Supreme Court, efforts first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n Trump had pinned his hopes on a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas seeking to throw out the election results in four battleground states that had gone for Joe Biden \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia \u2014 and wanted the Justice Department to support it, as Republican state attorneys general had. But department officials agreed with most legal observers that the case was a lost cause, and that the Supreme Court would not agree that Texas had the legal standing to bring such a claim.\n Barr consulted with then-acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall and told the White House why the approach was not viable, accurately predicting what the Supreme Court decided on Dec.\u00a011, according to a former administration official. None of Trump\u2019s three choices for the Supreme Court separated themselves from that finding.\n After that, Trump pressed for the department to file its own petition at the Supreme Court, and the White House supplied a draft written by a private lawyer of what it might say. The former administration official said it was similar to the case the court rejected, but substituted the United States as the challenger instead of Texas. The department officials told the White House there was even less chance the Supreme Court would agree to that, and the department refused to file it.\n \u201cIt was dead on arrival,\u201d the official said.\n Barr\u2019s relationship with Trump already had grown fraught because Barr would not take other steps that Trump saw as helpful to him politically in the months leading up to the election, and his publicly breaking with the president on fraud was something of a last straw. Trump erupted, and Barr contemplated whether he might have to resign or be fired, according to people familiar with the matter. Although tensions later eased somewhat, Barr later submitted his resignation, indicating he planned to step down Dec. 23.\n That left in charge Rosen, who had been Barr\u2019s top deputy and who shared his views on the lack of evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims of fraud, according to people familiar with the matter. But, the people said, Trump soon came to meet a different Justice Department official who seemed to share his worldview: Clark, whom Trump had appointed to lead the Justice Department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division and who later would come to lead the Civil Division.\n Clark, according to people familiar with the matter, pushed in the final month of the administration to have the department hold a news conference to announce that investigators were examining serious fraud allegations, and to take particular steps in Georgia, such as sending a letter asserting that there was an investigation ongoing and Biden\u2019s win could be voided there. Trump, the people said, then contemplated putting Clark in charge of the department, and Rosen was soon informed of the plan. The acting attorney general pushed for a meeting with Trump himself.\n All of those involved have since left the Justice Department, as they were Trump appointees. Even if the plan had been carried out, it seems unlikely it would have affected  the election results \u2014 which already had been certified by the states \u2014 although it would have significantly eroded the Justice Department\u2019s credibility.\n Clark, in a written statement, has denied that he \u201cdevised a plan .\u2009.\u2009. to oust Jeff Rosen,\u201d and he also has denied that he made recommendations \u201cbased on factual inaccuracies gleaned from the Internet.\u201d He seemed to quote language from the New York Times, which first reported the event.\n \u201cMy practice is to rely on sworn testimony to assess disputed factual claims,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere were no \u2018maneuver[s].\u2019 There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the President. It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions .\u2009.\u2009. Observing legal privileges, which I will adhere to even if others will not, prevent me from divulging specifics regarding the conversation.\u201d\n Rosen has declined to comment.\n Horowitz already had been examining another incident of possible Justice Department malfeasance over the election: the abrupt departure of the U.S. attorney in Atlanta after Trump complained officials in Georgia were not doing enough to find election fraud.\n Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak unexpectedly announced Jan. 4 that he was stepping down that day as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Trump then bypassed his top deputy in selecting a temporary replacement. According to people familiar with the matter, Pak had received a call from a senior Justice Department official in Washington that led him to believe he should resign shortly before he did so.\n Pak\u2019s resignation came just a day after The Washington Post reported on a call in which Trump urged Republican Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn his election defeat in that state.",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Pizza Hut's newest pizza doesn't look like its other pizzas.\n The chain is launching a new Detroit-style pizza, which ditches the traditional round shape for a rectangular crust with cheese to the edges that's popular in the Michigan city. It's Pizza Hut's second major product launch this month as the pandemic-era pizza wars show few signs of slowing down.\n Pizza Hut said it tested more than 500 iterations of the new menu item, with several of those tests in the Midwest, ahead of the nationwide launch Tuesday. The chain used its own special \"vine-ripened tomato sauce\" because it found that it keeps the thick crust light and airy.\n The new offering comes in four options, including the \"Detroit Double Pepperoni\" which Pizza Hut describes as a \"work of pizza art\" because it includes 80 pepperoni slices. The other options are the \"Double Cheesy,\" \"Meaty Deluxe\" and the \"Supremo,\" which has Italian sausage, red onions and green bell peppers. Prices start at $10.99.\n Competition among big chains has been fierce during the pandemic, which has fueled a surge in pizza demand from Americans who are spending more time at home and avoiding dine-in restaurants. Sales and revenue rose last year at Pizza Hut, Domino's (DMPZF) and Papa John's (PZZA) as consumers relentlessly shoveled pizzas down their throats.\n Peter Saleh, a restaurant analyst with research firm BTIG, expects last year's rising sales to continue this year. \"What we saw in 2020 was that many of these pizza delivery guys had a big boom in their sales because there was no where else to go,\" he told CNN Business. Several US states limit in-restaurant dining and have enacted capacity controls because of the virus.\n Saleh predicts that pizza sales will remain healthy in 2021 as the \"environment for dining continues to be challenged.\"",

        "title": "Martin Baron, executive editor who oversaw dramatic Washington Post expansion, announces retirement",
        "body_text": "Martin Baron, one of the most highly regarded editors in American journalism and an outspoken advocate of the value of a free press, announced Tuesday he would step down as executive editor of The Washington Post on Feb.\u00a028.\n Over a 45-year career, Baron led reporters at some of the nation\u2019s finest newspapers through groundbreaking investigations of challenging targets \u2014 including the Catholic Church, the National Security Agency and the charities of Donald Trump. During his last eight years at The Post, the paper has won 10 Pulitzer Prizes.\n \u201cFrom the moment I arrived at The Post, I have sought to make an enduring contribution while giving back to a profession that has meant so much to me and that serves to safeguard democracy,\u201d Baron, 66, wrote in a memo to The Post\u2019s staff Tuesday morning announcing his retirement.\n Baron, who was formerly the editor of the Boston Globe and the Miami Herald, joined The Post on Jan. 1, 2013, at a time when many newspapers, including The Post, were in financial decline. It was also just months before the paper embarked on one of its most consequential stories, centered on the leak of material describing the NSA\u2019s extensive surveillance operations.\n Later that same year, the Graham family, longtime owners of The Post, sold it to Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos \u2014 marking the beginning of the newspaper\u2019s sustained revival under Baron\u2019s leadership, both financially and in its journalistic ambitions.\n Baron oversaw a dramatic expansion of the newsroom, which had undergone several buyouts before his arrival; its numbers grew from 580 journalists at his arrival to more than 1,000 this year. In a memo to the staff Tuesday, Publisher Fred Ryan said Baron had \u201cinspired great reporting, managed an awesome digital transformation and grown the number of readers and subscribers to unprecedented levels.\u201d\n Within a couple of years, the understated editor became something of a journalism icon. The 2015 movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d which won the Oscar for best picture, dramatized the Globe\u2019s investigation of the Catholic Church\u2019s child sexual-abuse scandal, with Baron a key heroic figure portrayed by actor Liev Schreiber.\n \u201cHis depiction has me as a stoic, humorless, somewhat dour character that many professional colleagues instantly recognize,\u201d Baron later wrote, \u201cand that my closest friends find not entirely familiar.\u201d\n And at the dawn of the Trump administration, it was Baron who clarified the mission of the mainstream press as it was blasted with political attacks of \u201cfake news\u201d from the right.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not at war with the administration,\u201d Baron said, asserting his paper\u2019s dedication to aggressive, fair and nonpartisan reporting. \u201cWe\u2019re at work.\u201d\n In an interview, Baron said he decided to step down now after several years of intense work. \u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting job,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Internet being so big a part of it, it\u2019s 24-7-365. You\u2019re pretty much on duty and on alert all the time. It means you never really get to disconnect.\u201d\n He has no immediate plans after he leaves The Post, he said: \u201cI think I\u2019m owed a breather.\u201d The Post has not yet named Baron\u2019s successor.\n He credited Bezos with transforming The Post from a primarily regional publication to one that was national and international in scope and more focused on digital presentation, rather than print. \u201cHad we stayed largely regional, we would be facing severe financial problems today, as most newspapers are,\u201d Baron said. \u201cHe knew we could leverage The Post\u2019s name and tradition of great journalism to national scale.\u201d\n Under Baron\u2019s stewardship, Bezos introduced a new motto for the paper: \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness.\u201d\n \u201cYou leave behind a newsroom that is bigger and stronger and more thoughtful than ever,\u201d Bezos wrote in an Instagram tribute to Baron. \u201cYou will be missed so much. Not just your intellect but also \u2014 and most hard to replace \u2014 your heart.\u201d\n New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet, who worked with Baron when Baron was a Times editor, said Tuesday, \u201cHe made three newspapers [The Post, Globe and Miami Herald] better. He led The Post brilliantly. And he has been an important spokesman for the industry, a champion of investigative work and holding power to account.\u201d\n Baron\u2019s retirement is part of a generational change at some of the nation\u2019s largest news organizations. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s top editor, Norman Pearlstine, recently announced his retirement, as has Stephen Adler, the editor of the Reuters news service. Baquet has been widely expected to retire from the New York Times soon.\n Baron has worked in the upper echelons of newsrooms throughout his career. He spent his longest professional stretch, from 1979 to 1996, with the Los Angeles Times, rising to editor of its Orange County edition. After four years at the New York Times, he was named editor of the Herald in 2000 and led its coverage of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s return to Cuba and the disputed 2000 presidential election.\n As the editor of the Globe, starting in 2001, Baron emphasized regional investigative reporting, culminating with the newspaper\u2019s reporting on the Catholic Church\u2019s coverup of allegations against abusive priests.\n In 2012, Katharine Weymouth, then The Post\u2019s publisher, hired Baron to succeed Marcus Brauchli as the newsroom\u2019s leader. \u201cI was looking for an editor with a proven track record, who could lead the newsroom as we became truly multiplatform and who would push us to do better work than ever,\u201d Weymouth said Tuesday. \u201cHe has far exceeded my greatest expectations.\u201d\n Barton Gellman, a former national security reporter for The Post, recalled Tuesday how he met Baron for the first time in 2013 to discuss what Gellman would do with the voluminous trove of leaked material shared with him by whistleblower Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.\n \u201cI remember thinking he might throw me out of his office when I laid out my outlandish conditions \u2014 a windowless room, a heavy safe, encrypted email and so on \u2014 for bringing the Snowden documents to The Post,\u201d Gellman said. \u201cHe did not hesitate.\u201d\n At one \u201cdelicate moment,\u201d Gellman said, Baron overruled a Post lawyer who had advised greater caution in the reporting.\n \u201cThis was an uncommonly risky story,\u201d he said. \u201cMarty never put a foot wrong. Every choice he made came from a place of courage and common sense and journalistic integrity.\u201d\n In 2016, it was Baron who suggested the direction that Post staffer David Fahrenthold should take in covering then-candidate Trump as the two waited for an elevator at the office one night.\n Fahrenthold had been reporting on Trump\u2019s broken promises to contribute to veterans\u2019 charities; Baron said he should go wider and look at all of Trump\u2019s charitable claims over the years.\n \u201cThe logic was that Trump had just tried to wiggle out of a charitable promise he\u2019d made on national TV,\u201d Fahrenthold later wrote. \u201cWhat, Marty wondered, had he been doing before the campaign, when nobody was looking?\u201d\n The answer was a pattern of deceptive, even fraudulent activities, all of which led officials in New York to shut down Trump\u2019s charitable foundation. Fahrenthold later broke the news that Trump had been recorded bragging about assaulting women during an appearance on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d TV show in 2005. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage in 2017.\n In his note to the Post staff, Baron said he had told department heads two years ago that he was committed to staying as editor until after the 2020 election. He said he has worked in journalism \u201cwithout stop\u201d for nearly 45\u00a0years.\n Baron wrote that his journalism experiences have \u201cbeen deeply meaningful, enriched by colleagues who made me a better professional and a better person. At age 66, I feel ready to move on.\u201d\n He added, \u201cWorking at The Washington Post allows each of us to serve a purpose bigger than ourselves. Such is the honor of being a journalist, perhaps nowhere more so than in a newsroom like ours. I came here eight years ago with a reverence for The Post\u2019s heritage of courage and independence and feeling an inviolable obligation to uphold its values. With all the energy I possess, I have tried to ensure that we remain faithful to all this institution has long stood for, with an emphasis on our duty to seek the truth and tell it.\u201d\n This story, originally published at 11:24 a.m., has been updated.",

        "title": "Biden confronts Putin over several issues in first call, White House says",
        "body_text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden held his first call Tuesday with his Russian counterpart, according to the White House, confronting President Vladimir Putin over a range of issues from a recent massive cyberattack to the suspected poisoning of the country's leading opposition figure.\n The call, which occurred midday, amounted to Biden's opening bid at diplomacy with one of his chief adversaries, whom he has met previously but not dealt with as an equal.\n Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki said he entered the phone call with the intention of discussing the New START nuclear treaty, which the Biden administration hopes to extend; Russian aggression in Ukraine; the Solarwinds cyber hack, the extent of which is still being determined; reports Russia placed bounties on American troops serving in Afghanistan; Moscow's interference in US presidential elections; and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.\n \"His intention was also to make clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actions by Russia,\" Psaki said, noting the call had taken place during her briefing and that a more fulsome summary would come later.\n The lengthy list of topics for Biden's first conversation with Putin illustrates the troubled state of affairs between Washington and Moscow that he inherited from the previous administration. Biden has accused his predecessor, President Donald Trump, of being too weak on Russia, accusing him of being \"Putin's puppy\" during one of their general election debates.\n Biden hopes to take a firmer line with Putin, officials have said. He's ordered a review from administration agencies on issues related to Russia and could impose new sanctions on the country.\n But he's also made an opening bid for diplomacy on the nuclear treaty, suggesting he is open to fostering a working relationship with Putin.\n \"I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries, as a new START agreement, and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny, whether it's the Solar Winds or whether it's reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan,\" he told reporters on Monday.\n \"I have asked the agencies in question to do a thorough read for me on every one of those issues, to update me precisely where they are, and I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians,\" he said.\n Tuesday's call came at Moscow's request, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said Biden wanted to confer with leaders in Europe and his advisers before getting on the phone with Putin. The Kremlin requested the call shortly after Biden took office last week, which is standard for foreign leaders who are hoping to speak with the new president.\n Biden received a series of briefings ahead of the call from senior administration officials going over administration positions and Putin's likely responses when Biden raised issues like the Solarwinds hack and the Navalny poisoning, the person said.\n Biden's predecessor often entered his calls with Putin having not prepared and on at least one occasion disregarded the advice of his advisers not to congratulate Putin on winning his election.\n Biden also spoke Tuesday with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, a symbolic conversation given the defense bloc's role in defending against Russian aggression in Europe.\n Biden has also spoken with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, including on issues related to Russia.\n Putin was one of the last world leaders to congratulate Biden upon winning the presidency, waiting until it was clear Trump had lost the Electoral College count to offer formal regards.\n The two men met when Biden was vice president and he visited Moscow. During a tour of Putin's office, Biden later claimed he told the Russian leader, inches from his face, that he did not believe he had a soul.",

        "title": "Taboola, Purveyor of Clickbait Ads, Will Go Public",
        "body_text": "Taboola, which serves up catchy clickbait links on websites, bet until four months ago that its future lay in merging with its chief rival.\n Now the company is opting for a different route: going public via Wall Street\u2019s hottest trend.\n Taboola announced on Monday that it would merge with a so-called special-purpose acquisition company, a kind of publicly traded deal vehicle that has exploded in popularity.\n The deal, which values Taboola at about $2.6 billion and is backed by investors like the mutual fund giants Fidelity and BlackRock, sets up a new act for a company that occupies one of the most-mocked \u2014 and yet highly persistent \u2014 niches in online advertising. And it will help Taboola in what its chief executive, Adam Singolda, says is its mission: become a counterweight to digital ad giants like Google and Facebook.\n \u201cWe will have currency and access to cash to expand into new areas,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that the current online ads landscape is \u201ca huge market that\u2019s fragmented.\u201d\n Taboola runs what is known as a content recommendation platform, helping companies place \u201cchumbox\u201d ads on websites. Named for the angler\u2019s practice of using chunks of dead fish to attract other fish, they often appear at the bottom of web pages as eye-catching thumbnail images promising links to listicles about cute puppies and testimonials such as \u201cTop Doc: This Fruit Stops Weight Gain in Its Tracks.\u201d\n The companies advertising through Taboola pay once viewers click on a link, and Taboola sends a portion of that revenue to the publishers that hosted the link, which include news organizations like CBS and CNBC. Mr. Singolda said that, in addition to driving tens of billions of clicks a year, Taboola helped publishers by attracting new audiences to their sites and offering insights into viewers\u2019 behavior.\n But Taboola, like the rest of the ad industry, has faced concerns about inadvertently funding misinformation through ad spending. A recent report from Vice linked Taboola to unproven health remedies and sites known for advancing conspiracy theories.\n Mr. Singolda said Taboola did not allow political ads or links offering unsupported claims, but acknowledged that there were \u201ca lot of issues\u201d with coronavirus-related misinformation. He said the company employed more than 50 full-time content moderators manually reviewing half a million pages a week.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not perfect \u2014 we make mistakes, and then we fix it,\u201d he said.\n Taboola, which was started in Israel and is now based in New York, is profitable, according to Mr. Singolda, who said it collected a projected $1.2 billion in gross revenue last year \u2014 $379 million in net revenue, excluding payouts to publishers.\n In late 2019, Taboola saw a path to even greater growth in a merger with Outbrain, its chumbox archrival. That October, in a long-expected deal, the two announced plans to combine under the Taboola name.\n But within a year, both companies\u2019 financial situations had changed. Antitrust regulators in Britain and Israel were still investigating the deal. The pandemic drew more viewers online but also forced websites to re-evaluate their spending and become \u201cway more lean and mean,\u201d Mr. Singolda said.\n The merger fell apart in September.\n But shortly afterward, Gilad Shany, an Israeli financier, raised nearly $259 million for ION Acquisition Corp 1, a SPAC that aimed to buy another Israeli business \u201cto build a global player.\u201d\n He and Mr. Singolda discussed a combination, which would take Taboola public by essentially giving it ION\u2019s stock ticker. It is a quicker and surer way to bring companies to the public markets, which has helped make SPACs one of the finance industry\u2019s biggest obsessions.\n Mr. Singolda said going public would give Taboola greater financial resources, notably the ability to sell publicly traded shares \u2014 which could help it make more acquisitions. (In addition to the ION fund\u2019s money, Taboola has raised $285 million from Fidelity, BlackRock and others.)\n \u201cWe think this can be five times the size it is today,\u201d said Mr. Shany, who will join Taboola\u2019s board. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to think that far to think that big.\u201d",

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene indicated support for executing prominent Democrats in 2018 and 2019 before running for Congress",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress, a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene's Facebook page shows.\n Greene, who represents Georgia's 14th Congressional District, frequently posted far-right extremist and debunked conspiracy theories on her page, including the baseless QAnon conspiracy which casts former President Donald Trump in an imagined battle against a sinister cabal of Democrats and celebrities who abuse children.\n In one post, from January 2019, Greene liked a comment that said \"a bullet to the head would be quicker\" to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In other posts, Greene liked comments about executing FBI agents who, in her eyes, were part of the \"deep state\" working against Trump.\n In one Facebook post from April 2018, Greene wrote conspiratorially about the Iran Deal, one of former President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievements. A commenter asked Greene, \"Now do we get to hang them ?? Meaning H & O ???,\" referring to Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n Greene replied, \"Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.\"\n After CNN reached out to Greene, her personal Twitter account posted a statement in which she did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page.\n \"Over the years, I've had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet,\" she wrote.\n Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN's KFile.\n CNN reached out to Pelosi's office for comment multiple times but did not receive a response.\n Though her tenure in Congress has only lasted a few weeks, Greene is already facing calls to leave the House for her role in fanning the flames of the Capitol insurrection earlier this month after she objected to the election certification process and falsely insisted that Trump would remain president.\n After Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez called on Greene to be expelled from the House for her role in the insurrection, Greene condemned the violence at the Capitol and falsely accused \"Antifa/BLM terrorism\" and Democratic politicians of stoking the insurrection.\n \"I fully condemn ALL violence. The Antifa/BLM terrorism funded on ActBlue rests with Democrat accomplices like @CoriBush @Ilhan @KamalaHarris @AOC @timkaine & many more... Those who stoke insurrection & spread conspiracies have blood on their hands. They must be expelled,\" she tweeted.\n Last week Greene faced calls to resign from the survivors of the Parkland shooting survivors after Media Matters reported she agreed with comments calling the 2018 shooting a \"false flag\" operation, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.\n CNN's KFile found additional comments from Greene where she called David Hogg, a survivor and activist, \"#littleHitler\" and spread a conspiracy that he was a \"bought and paid little pawn\" and actor.\n Before she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene created a White House petition in January 2019 to impeach the House speaker for \"crimes of treason,\" citing Pelosi's support of so-called sanctuary policies that \"are serving illegals and not United States citizens\" and because Pelosi did not support Trump's border wall.\n In one speech, promoting the petition, Greene suggested Pelosi could be executed for treason.\n \"She's a traitor to our country, she's guilty of treason,\" Greene says in the video, which she posted on Facebook at the time. \"She took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold our laws. And she gives aid and comfort to our enemies who illegally invade our land. That's what treason is. And by our law representatives and senators can be kicked out and no longer serve in our government. And it's, uh, it's a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.\"\n In another Facebook Live broadcast from inside Pelosi's office on February 22, 2019, Greene suggested the House speaker will \"suffer death or she'll be in prison\" for her \"treason.\" Notably, Greene never mentions a trial. In another broadcast from later that day, she suggested California Rep. Maxine Waters was \"just as guilty of treason as Nancy Pelosi.\"\n In the comments of her Facebook posts, often promoting the petition, Greene liked a comment that said \"through removal or death, doesn't matter, as long as she goes,\" referring to Pelosi, and another that encouraged Greene to \"beat Pelosi's ass.\"\n The petition for Pelosi's impeachment and removal for treason amassed over 420,000 signatures as of January 2021.\n On social media, Greene portrays herself as an opponent to political violence and casts Democrats as the real instigators of political violence, either real or imaginary, who get away with threatening calls for violence.\n \"Do any of you remember a day when talking about assassinating the President resulted in getting arrested? As in arrested in real life, not FB [Facebook] jail. When was that? Pre-2016 I think, right??? But if you are a conservative that's a different story!\" wrote Greene in 2019.\n While Greene notes in Facebook posts that she disavows and denounces violence, within the comment sections of Greene's Facebook page, commenters frequently cheer for politicians to be executed by hanging or firing squad.\n Elsewhere on her Facebook page, Greene liked comments that advocated to \"arrest\" Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry and one comment that said, \"HANG that bitch,\" referring to either Obama or Kerry or possibly both of them. She also liked a comment that urged for \"civil war 2.0\" to begin.\n Greene, who has embraced and spread the baseless conspiracy theory about a \"deep state\" working to usurp Trump's agenda, suggested in Facebook posts that FBI agents disloyal to Trump were traitors.\n She liked a comment that said, \"Trump already said there were some great ones working with FBI but some have fallen and quite frankly need to be hung for TREASON!\" Another she liked said, \"These Traitors need to be put to death as an example of what will no longer be tolerated in our country!!!\"",

The vaccine must be kept cold to remain effective.\n \"Tampering with vaccine doses in the midst of a global health crisis calls for a strong response, as reflected by the serious charges the United States has brought today,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Department of Justice's Civil Division.\n CNN has reached out to an attorney for Brandenburg for comment.\n According to police, he allegedly provided public safety officials at Aurora Medical Center with a written statement saying he intentionally removed the vials, knowing that if they were not properly stored, the doses would be ineffective.\n Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, according to the release.\n Authorities say Brandenburg admitted to investigators he believed in conspiracy theories and believed \"the COVID-19 vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their DNA,\" according to a probable cause statement obtained by CNN affiliate WTMJ.\n Brandenburg \"believed in various 'conspiracy theories'; subscribed to notions of 'alternative history'; and was skeptical of vaccines in general and the Moderna vaccine specifically,\" according to the plea agreement, the release said.\n \"Brandenburg had communicated his beliefs about vaccines to his co-workers for at least the past two years,\" the release said.\n Aurora Medical Center has said Brandenburg is no longer employed there.",

        "title": "Trump adds another South Carolina lawyer to impeachment defense team amid questions of whether he will pay them",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Former President Donald Trump has expanded his impeachment legal team by tapping a former prosecutor-turned-criminal defense lawyer, an addition that comes as Trump and his allies scramble to prepare a defense with less than two weeks until the Senate trial.\n The addition of Deborah Barbier, a lawyer with a reputation for tackling high-profile, controversial clients, is the second attorney to join from South Carolina. Last week, Trump announced that Butch Bowers, an experienced political attorney who has represented numerous Republican elected officials, including former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, would lead his legal team.\n The all-South Carolina legal team has surprised some attorneys, even those in the Palmetto State, but it underscores the outsized influence of one of Trump's most loyal allies, Lindsey Graham, the state's senior Republican senator, who recommended Bowers to Trump. It also highlights the challenges Trump was experiencing in building a legal team as his previous lawyers have largely stepped away from him.\n Barbier joined Trump's impeachment team Monday, according to an email sent by the chair of the South Carolina State Committee of the American College of Trial Lawyers, where Barbier is a member. The email, which was first reported by The Post and Courier, was confirmed by three lawyers. Barbier did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n \"He certainly could not do better than Debbie. She is an astoundingly capable, skilled, experienced criminal lawyer who is used of handling very high-profile cases with controversial clients. He could never do better than Debbie,\" said E. Paul Gibson, vice chair of the state committee, who confirmed the email.\n Barbier spent 15 years as a federal prosecutor in South Carolina before eventually opening her own boutique criminal defense firm. Barbier has represented several high-profile clients, including a Republican consultant embroiled in a lobbying case and a friend of Dylann Roof, who was convicted in the 2015 shooting of nine people at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n The appointment comes as Trump is struggling to build out his legal defense. In particular, loyalist Rudy Giuliani is not able to represent Trump since he spoke on January 6, whipping up the pro-Trump crowd before they stormed the US Capitol. Others who worked on Trump's previous impeachment team have declined to work on the second team.\n Major law firms have also turned down the former president because of the stigma of the insurrection and out of concern they would lose clients, several lawyers told CNN.\n \"The big firms have too many clients who would say, 'We're going to take our business away from you.' I don't think Butch Bowers or Debbie Barbier have that concern,\" said Robert Foster, a partner with Nelson Mullins in Columbia, where Bowers was a former partner.\n Trump's allies have recently approached Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris, two prominent criminal defense lawyers in Columbia, people familiar with the discussions said. Gasser, a former interim US attorney for South Carolina, and Harris, a former federal prosecutor, have worked closely with Barbier on the defense side.\n Gasser and Harris declined to comment to CNN.\n Their possible additions would give a significant boost to the courtroom trial aspect of the impeachment proceeding, but Trump allies say they still need an attorney who's strong on constitutional issues.\n Trump aides declined to comment Tuesday on the ongoing formation of the legal team.\n Another looming question is whether Trump will pay the lawyers. Three attorneys who spoke with CNN said it was unclear if Trump was seeking to retain lawyers on a pro-bono basis and not pay them retainers or hourly fees. All three of those lawyers said they declined to join the defense team, at least in part because of that issue.\n Graham on Tuesday referred questions about payment to Trump.\n \"You'll need to ask them that. I'm sure they're getting paid.\"\n Foster said the legal community is buzzing about who else may join the impeachment defense. When news broke late afternoon on Monday about Barbier's appointment, he said, \"Our first thought was, 'What is it about South Carolina?' \"\n Foster said the response to the email announcing Barbier's hiring was unsurprisingly mixed.\n \"They were overwhelmingly congratulating her because of her stellar reputation. They were overwhelming in that regard, they were split as to a lot of other issues,\" said Foster. \"Just as with anything else with Trump you're going to have 51% of the people on one side and 49% on the other side.\"\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of convicted killer Dylann Roof.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Rupert Murdoch, Accepting Award, Condemns \u2018Awful Woke Orthodoxy\u2019",
        "body_text": "The media mogul Rupert Murdoch denounced an \u201cawful woke orthodoxy\u201d and declared, \u201cI\u2019m far from done,\u201d while accepting a lifetime achievement award this weekend.\n Mr. Murdoch, 89, made the remarks in a prerecorded video shown on Saturday during a virtual event for the United Kingdom nonprofit that honored him, the Australia Day Foundation. The video was shared on the website of The Herald Sun, a newspaper in Melbourne owned by Mr. Murdoch.\n The video is noteworthy because Mr. Murdoch, despite exerting enormous influence over the global media landscape as the executive chairman of News Corp, has been relatively quiet publicly in recent years. He has been weathering the pandemic in his home in the Cotswolds in England, and received a Covid-19 vaccination in December.\n In the video, Mr. Murdoch, standing next to a bottle of Australian red wine and wearing a medal, thanked the foundation for the award in the video but said his career \u201cthat began in a smoke-filled Adelaide newsroom is still in motion.\u201d\n He also took the opportunity to condemn \u201ccancel culture.\u201d\n \u201cFor those of us in media,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a real challenge to confront: a wave of censorship that seeks to silence conversation, to stifle debate, to ultimately stop individuals and societies from realizing their potential.\u201d\n He continued: \u201cThis rigidly enforced conformity, aided and abetted by so-called social media, is a straitjacket on sensibility. Too many people have fought too hard in too many places for freedom of speech to be suppressed by this awful woke orthodoxy.\u201d\n It seems Mr. Murdoch\u2019s beliefs have been noted by the editors of his publications. On Monday, The New York Post published an op-ed by Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, on the front page of the paper with the headline \u201cTime to take a stand against the muzzling of America.\u201d\n Mr. Hawley, who has been widely condemned for his role in trying to overturn the result of the presidential election even after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, echoed Mr. Murdoch in denouncing \u201cwoke orthodoxy.\u201d\n Mr. Hawley also used his front-page column in one of the most widely circulated newspapers in the country to bemoan the revoking of his book deal and the canceling of events he had scheduled. Mr. Hawley\u2019s publisher, Simon & Schuster, dropped his book after the Jan. 6 siege, though it was quickly picked up by the conservative publishing house Regnery Publishing.\n The New York Post declined to comment.\n Mr. Murdoch\u2019s media empire, which includes The Post and Fox News, is trying to navigate a tense political moment. It is attempting to maintain conservative viewers who, unhappy with some of the straight news reporting on Fox, tuned in to Newsmax and One America News, which embraced former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Fox News executives this month fired the politics editor Chris Stirewalt, who was an on-screen face of the network\u2019s election night projections, and introduced more right-wing opinion programming.",

        "source": "washpost",
        "title": "Biden signs order pushing federal government to buy more American-made products",
        "body_text": "President Biden on Monday signed an executive order aimed at forcing the federal government to buy more goods produced in the United States, a key part of his campaign pledge to revive domestic manufacturing.\n Standing in front of a blue backdrop reading \u201cThe Future Will Be Made in America,\u201d the president said he was directing regulators to tighten the definition of American-made products and creating a position in the Office of Management and Budget to oversee stepped-up purchases of domestic goods.\n The president\u2019s order also will make it harder for federal agencies to issue waivers allowing the government to purchase some products made overseas. Under the new rules, agency officials will be required to justify such choices to the White House.\n Biden acknowledged that efforts to promote domestic content have been a familiar part of previous presidents\u2019 agendas. Former president Donald Trump issued regulations increasing the share of a product\u2019s components that must be produced domestically to qualify as U.S.-made just one day before he left office.\n \u201cThis is different and not the same,\u201d Biden said.\n The executive order will create a website where American businesses can see what contracts are being awarded to foreign vendors, allowing them to alert the government to the availability of a domestic alternative, Biden said.\n The order reflects the shifting consensus in American politics away from free trade and toward direct government intervention to promote U.S. manufacturers, a position Trump embraced as well. The coronavirus pandemic has intensified calls for the United States to shore up its domestic manufacturing capabilities, given gaps last year in the medical supply chain that left U.S. medical workers scrambling for personal protective equipment.\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America,\u201d Biden said Friday.\n The measure drew labor union plaudits, with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka calling it \u201ca good first step in revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.\u201d But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the initiative was unlikely to bring home lost manufacturing jobs and would boost the cost of government projects.\n Turning Biden\u2019s aspirations for reviving domestic manufacturing into reality may be difficult. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, pushed aggressively for similar \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions but was often rebuffed by other officials who argued that his proposals risked backlash from foreign nations as well as higher costs for U.S. taxpayers.\n Trump\u2019s last-minute regulations, which take effect Feb. 22, give American companies the edge over foreign rivals even if their products cost 20 percent to 30 percent more.\n Major U.S. allies oppose Buy American efforts, fearing the loss of lucrative contracts. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised his concerns in a phone call with Biden last week, officials in Ottawa said.\n An aggressive Buy American campaign also may complicate Biden\u2019s hopes of securing a united front among allies to meet rising Chinese influence.\n \u201cThe Biden administration is sending a clear signal that it intends to aggressively protect U.S. commercial and trade interests, belying the hopes of U.S. trading partners anticipating a softer touch from the new government,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a former International Monetary Fund official now teaching at Cornell University. \u201cIt is clear that the Biden administration is hardly rushing to usher in a new era of global trade and economic cooperation.\u201d\n Still, the administration is determined to move beyond the traditional focus on price and efficiency in its approach to trade policy.\n \u201cAs we sort out what globalization is going to look like in the future, we\u2019re headed toward a more thoughtful policy,\u201d said a trade specialist advising the administration who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.\n The federal government spends as much as $600 billion annually on contracts, but a significant portion of that money goes to foreign businesses, said Lori Wallach, a trade expert at Public Citizen, a nonprofit watchdog organization.\n It is unclear exactly how much federal contracting money goes abroad, Wallach said. The U.S. Chamber says that 97 percent of federal procurement funds go to \u201cU.S. firms.\u201d But that figure includes the foreign subsidiaries of American corporations, meaning the purchases could support workers in Vietnamese or Mexican factories rather than Americans.\n Under a World Trade Organization accord on government procurement, the United States generally has been more receptive to foreign firms bidding on contracts than other countries have.\n In 2010, the most recent data available, the United States opened $837 billion in government contract competitions to foreign firms, more than twice the combined figure of the next five \u2014 the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Norway and Canada, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n The United States that year allowed foreign companies to bid on about 48 percent of its $1.7 trillion government procurement market while the other five put out to bid just 16 percent of their combined $2.4 trillion market.\n William Reinsch, a trade specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the White House announcement would have little immediate impact. But by raising domestic content requirements, the administration could have an effect on corporate supply-chain decisions.\n \u201cThis is going to be a long-term play, not a short-term play,\u201d said Reinsch, a Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration.\n Biden has the power to reduce the list of 60 countries whose companies are granted waivers from Buy American regulations, meaning their products are treated as if they were U.S.-made for purposes of government contracting. Those waivers, which he said Monday have been issued \u201cwith impunity,\u201d will be permitted only under \u201cvery limited circumstances,\u201d such as to meet national security requirements.\n Loopholes in government procurement regulations must be closed before Biden launches other major initiatives, according to Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.\n \u201cBiden is envisioning this massive new federal investment in infrastructure, in clean energy, in economic recovery, so getting the updated statutes in place ahead of this spending is going to be key to its success,\u201d he said.\n Pentagon spending also could be ripe for a greater Buy American focus, according to one trade specialist advising the Biden administration. A 2018 Defense Department study found a \u201csurprising level\u201d of foreign suppliers, including the Chinese, and recommended that the government mitigate it by expanding taxpayer investment in low-level defense manufacturers.\n Most economists have panned Buy American provisions, saying they raise costs for the U.S. government.\n \u201cNeither protectionism nor purposefully raising the cost of the federal government will help the economy grow any faster,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, an economist at the online freelancing site Upwork, adding that he had not been briefed on the details of the Biden plan.",

        "title": "In first call with Putin, Biden pressed Russian president on several issues, White House says",
        "body_text": "President Biden had his first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, discussing a range of topics, including arms control, reports of Russian bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan and interference in the 2020 election, the White House said Tuesday.\n Meanwhile, nearly all Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), voted against holding an impeachment trial, all but assuring that former president Donald Trump has the votes to avoid conviction. The Senate is moving ahead with the trial Feb. 9, with Trump facing the House charge of \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n In an interview on CNN on Tuesday night, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain defended teachers unions that have pushed for schools to remain closed amid the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that more resources need to be provided in order for educators to feel it is safe to return to the classroom.\n \u201cPresident Biden has sent a plan to Congress that will make sure that a majority of our schools can be open within 100 days,\u201d Klain told host Erin Burnett. \u201cWe need Congress to pass that plan so we can do the kinds of things you need to do so that the schools can be safe, so the teachers can be safe, so the students can be safe. Sadly, it costs money, Erin.\u201d\n Klain\u2019s comments come even as researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday they have found scant transmission of the coronavirus in schools that are operating in person, particularly when masks and distancing are employed.\n The CDC team reviewed data from studies in the United States and abroad and found the experience in schools differed from nursing homes and high-density work sites where rapid spread has occurred.\n In recent months, some have argued that teachers unions have been overruling the results of such studies, opposing a variety of efforts to reopen schools across the country.\n But Klain argued Tuesday that\u2019s not the case. Congress, he said, needs to act first before students can safely return to the classroom.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think unions are overruling studies,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing is schools that haven\u2019t made the investments to keep students safe. ... We need to do the things to open safely. Most of the teachers I talk to, they want to be back in the classroom. They just want to know that it\u2019s safe. And we as a country should make the investments to make it safe.\u201d\n As Karl S. \u201cButch\u201d Bowers Jr. works from his one-lawyer office in Columbia, S.C., preparing to defend former president Donald Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, he thinks back to the day in 1983 when his father called him before heading to federal prison.\n Ever since his father served time for defrauding the government, Bowers said, he felt that the conviction was politically motivated and unfair, and he has spent much of his career defending political figures, including two South Carolina governors, against various allegations of wrongdoing.\n So he said he did not hesitate to defend Trump, a job that lawyers at big, high-profile law firms apparently did not want.\n Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the president pro tempore of the Senate, has been released from the hospital after being taken there earlier Tuesday night for observation because he was not feeling well, a spokesman said.\n \u201cThe Capitol Physician suggested that Senator Leahy go to George Washington University Hospital this evening for observation, out of an abundance of caution,\u201d Leahy\u2019s spokesman, David Carle, said in a statement. \u201cAfter getting test results back, and after a thorough examination, Senator Leahy now is home. He looks forward to getting back to work.\"\n The senator and his wife, Marcelle, \"deeply appreciate the well wishes they have received tonight,\u201d Carle said.\n During the day, Leahy, 80, had been sworn in by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) so he could preside over the impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump. Then Leahy swore in members of the Senate as jurors.\n In a statement earlier Tuesday night, Carle said the attending physician of the U.S. Congress examined Leahy after the senator \u201cwas not feeling well\u201d in his Capitol office.\n \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation,\" Carle said.\n The new acting chief of the Capitol Police on Tuesday offered House lawmakers a wide-ranging apology for the \u201cfailings\u201d that allowed rioters to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, saying the department should have been better prepared for the attack and did not do enough to protect those inside.\n Acting chief Yogananda D. Pittman cited a lack of manpower, an insufficient supply of \u201cless-lethal\u201d weapons, confused and garbled communications, and a possible failure in lockdown procedures as reasons the Capitol and its occupants were exposed to the marauding crowds that pressed their way into the building.\n \u201cWe fully expect to answer to you and the American people for our failings on January 6th,\u201d she told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting of the House Appropriations Committee, according to a prepared statement of her remarks obtained by The Washington Post.\n In a Senate confirmation hearing, President Biden\u2019s nominee to run the Commerce Department said she plans to be \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in combating China\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices, but she declined to detail how she would handle issues such as Chinese tech giant Huawei or the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed under President Donald Trump.\n Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) also pledged to help the U.S. economy recover from the pandemic, to expand broadband access to regions with patchy Internet connections and to promote manufacturing and clean-energy jobs.\n On China, she said the United States needs to develop a \u201cwhole-of-government response,\u201d in coordination with U.S. allies, to combat unfair trade practices, which U.S. officials say include China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, its hefty state subsidies for industry and its efforts to block Western access to the Chinese market.\n There remains a dense cloud of uncertainty surrounding the events of Jan. 6, a fog of unanswered what-ifs.\n What if the mob that stormed the Capitol had encountered members of Congress or Vice President Mike Pence unimpeded? What if they\u2019d used their numbers to overwhelm security protecting the legislators? What if they\u2019d refused to leave, instead forcing a confrontation with police? What if the armaments and explosives found on some protesters and in the city had been deployed in the building? How bad could it have been?\n There are some questions that have clear answers. Were it not for Trump\u2019s months of claims that the election would be and then was stolen, there would have been no mass of people who believed that he was being wrongfully deprived of a second term in office. Had he not persisted in making those claims, or had he not actively encouraged his supporters to come to Washington on that day specifically because Congress was meeting, the streets around the Capitol and the White House wouldn\u2019t have been crowded with furious Trump supporters. Had he not riled up the crowd that morning and encouraged them to head to the Capitol, far fewer probably would have. But all of those things happened, and there was a critical mass of fury that poured over the Capitol Police and into the building.\n The Justice Department has formally rescinded a Trump administration memo that led to the separation of children from their migrant parents illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that was a hallmark of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration.\n Acting attorney general Monty Wilkinson issued a memo Tuesday canceling a previous one issued in 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The earlier memo decreed that any adult caught crossing the border illegally would be prosecuted for illegal entry. As a result, any children traveling with those adults could not remain with them. That led to government agents separating more than 5,500 children from their parents at the border, until the practice was abandoned amid a firestorm of criticism later in 2018.\n Some smaller number of family separations still occur under current policy, based on the circumstances of individual cases. \u201cA policy requiring a prosecutor to charge every case referred for prosecution \u2026 without regard for individual circumstances is inconsistent with our principles,\u201d Wilkinson wrote in Tuesday\u2019s memo, which was first reported by the Associated Press. \u201cWhile policies may change, our mission always remains the same: to seek justice under the law.\u201d\n Addressing reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Biden acknowledged the role of the Trump administration and public health experts in getting the coronavirus vaccine program up and running, but noted that he was surprised upon taking office to discover that the initiative was in \u201cworse shape\u201d than he had expected.\n \u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, we want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere for \u2026 getting the program off the ground,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd that credit is absolutely due.\u201d\n He continued, \u201cBut it\u2019s also no secret that we have recently discovered, in the final days of the transition \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t until the final days we got the kind of cooperation we needed \u2014 that once we arrived, the vaccine program is in worse shape than we anticipated or expected.\u201d\n The Trump administration dragged its feet in allowing the presidential transition to proceed, hindering the Biden team\u2019s ability to swiftly take the reins of the pandemic response effort.\n In his remarks Tuesday, Biden repeatedly referred to the national coronavirus response plan as a \u201cwartime undertaking,\u201d noting that more Americans died in the first year of the pandemic than in all of World War II.\n He also delivered an implicit critique of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic, saying: \u201cWe now have a national strategy to beat covid-19. It\u2019s comprehensive. It\u2019s based on science, not politics. It\u2019s based on truth, not denial. And it is detailed.\u201d\n And he reminded Americans that even as vaccines become more widely available, social distancing and the use of masks are still important in slowing the spread of the virus.\n \u201cIn the next few months, masks, not vaccines, are the best defense against covid-19,\u201d Biden said.\n The Biden administration said Tuesday that it will seek to buy 200 million more doses of the two coronavirus vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use in the United States.\n The purchases would increase the available supply by 50 percent, bringing the total to 600 million doses by this summer.\n Because both products \u2014 one developed by Pfizer and German company BioNTech, and the other by Moderna \u2014 are two-dose regimens, that would be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million people. An estimated 260 million people in the United States are considered eligible to receive a coronavirus vaccine, though Pfizer and Moderna have initiated trials for children as young as 12, the results of which could expand the pool.\n Vice President Harris visited the National Institutes of Health to receive her second coronavirus vaccine dose, thanking the doctors and scientists for their lifesaving work and urging Americans to get the vaccine when they can.\n \u201cThese scientists, these medical professionals, doing the work of pursuing what is in the interest of the public health \u2026 created something that will save your life and the life of your family and the community,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd so I want to urge everyone to take the vaccine when it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\n The nurse administering the shot explained to Harris that she might have an \u201cenhanced reaction\u201d to the vaccine because her body was building immunity, to which Harris said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what we want.\u201d\n After receiving the shot, Harris said it \u201creally was painless, relatively painless.\u201d\n Harris then spoke about her late mother\u2019s work as a peer reviewer at NIH, and how Harris was raised in a home where science was \u201ctaught to me by someone so profoundly passionate about the gift, the gift that scientists give to us, in that their whole reason for being is to see what can be, unburdened by what has been.\u201d\n \u201cI want to say to everyone who works here, I know who you are and I know what you do,\u201d she said.\n Most senators, including all but 17 Republicans, voted in favor of the Senate impeachment trial rules even though most GOP senators were opposed to holding Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial at all.\n But since there is going to be one, 83 senators agreed to the resolution setting the parameters for the process. The impeachment trial will resume Feb. 9 after both sides have had time to file pretrial briefs and responses.\n The 17 Republican senators who voted against the procedures for the trial are: Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Mike Lee (Utah), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Rand Paul (Ky.), James E. Risch (Idaho), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Rick Scott (Fla.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), and Tommy Tuberville (Ala.).\n Most Senate Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), voted Tuesday against holding an impeachment trial, all but assuring former president Donald Trump has votes to avoid conviction.\n The final vote count was 55 in favor of holding the trial and 45 against. Only five Republicans joined Democrats in voting in favor: Sens. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.), Mitt Romney (Utah), Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Ben Sasse (Neb.).\n Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) forced the vote, calling a trial an \u201cunconstitutional sham\u201d and claiming that the Senate cannot hold a trial of a private citizen. In fact, the Senate has held trials for private citizens.\n While he was the losing side and the trial will proceed on Feb. 9, the procedural vote made it clear that there are not enough votes for now to hold Trump accountable for his role in inciting the deadly Jan. 6 mob attack on the Capitol. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict Trump.\n Paul raised a point of order with the Senate parliamentarian Tuesday, just moments before senators were set to be sworn in for Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial.\n \u201cI think there will be enough support on it to show there\u2019s no chance they can impeach the president,\u201d Paul told reporters ahead of the vote. \u201cIf 34 people support my resolution that this is an unconstitutional proceeding, it shows they don\u2019t have the votes and we\u2019re basically wasting our time.\u201d\n Paul argued, in part, that the Founders did not intend for impeachment to be used against individuals who no longer hold public office.\n In a floor speech shortly before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) fired back that if the framers had only intended impeachment to apply to those currently in office, they would not have included a provision aimed at disqualifying those who have been impeached from running for office in the future.\n \u201cIt\u2019s been completely debunked by constitutional scholars from all across the political spectrum,\u201d Schumer said of Paul\u2019s argument.\n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he has not spoken with Trump since the day after the GOP leader declared that Biden had won the presidential election.\n \u201cThe last time I spoke with him (Trump) was the day after I had declared that Biden had obviously won the election \u2026 It would have been December the 15th,\u201d McConnell told reporters.\n McConnell stayed on good terms with Trump during his presidency, either defending or demurring when it came to the latest Trump controversy. But as Trump continued to promote false conspiracy theories about a rigged election, McConnell eventually said after the electoral college vote that Biden was the rightful victor in a contest that wasn\u2019t particularly close.\n Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said McConnell and Biden have spoken \u201ca couple of times,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t provide any more details about those conversations.\n \u201cHe has spoken with Leader McConnell, as he said, had spoken with him a couple of times,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to I\u2019m not going to read out specific calls to all of you on the pace or number of their phone calls.\u201d\n President Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday afternoon to discuss a litany of issues and to warn him that America would defend itself against \u201cmalign actions by Russia.\u201d\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that the call \u2014 initiated by Biden \u2014 happened.\n Psaki said Biden called Putin to discuss America\u2019s \u201cwillingness to extend New START for five years,\u201d referring to the nuclear arms reduction treaty between the two countries. Signed in 2010, the treaty expires next week, on Feb. 5.\n The president also pressed Putin on \u201cRussia\u2019s ongoing aggression\u201d with Ukraine, as well as \u201creports of Russia placing bounties on United States soldiers in Afghanistan, interference in the 2020 election, the poisoning of [Russian opposition leader] Alexei Navalny and treatment of peaceful protesters by Russian security forces,\u201d Psaki said.\n The Kremlin had a slightly different readout of the call, saying in a statement that the two leaders had discussed \u201ctopical issues,\u201d including cooperation on the coronavirus pandemic, trade and economic matters.\n The Kremlin mentioned \u201cthe Ukraine domestic settlement\u201d but none of the hot-button issues listed by the White House. It said the two leaders discussed President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Open Skies agreement and the preservation of the Iran nuclear deal. It described the call as \u201cbusinesslike and frank\u201d and said the two men agreed to stay in touch.\n Trump was often criticized for being too easy on Russia and Putin, particularly on issues of national security. During the presidential campaign, Biden promised a tougher posture when it came to Putin.\n \u201cHis intention was also to make clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actions by Russia,\u201d Psaki said.",

        "title": "Sen. Patrick Leahy home from brief hospitalization after presiding over opening of Trump's impeachment trial",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Sen. Patrick Leahy returned home Tuesday night from the hospital after seeking treatment out of an abundance of caution, according to a spokesman.\n Leahy had been hospitalized just hours after presiding over the opening of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. A spokesman said he was not feeling well and the Capitol physician recommended he go to a local hospital.\n \"The Capitol Physician suggested that Senator Leahy go to George Washington University Hospital this evening for observation, out of an abundance of caution,\" spokesman David Carle said in a statement. \"After getting test results back, and after a thorough examination, Senator Leahy now is home. He looks forward to getting back to work. Patrick and Marcelle deeply appreciate the well wishes they have received tonight.\n As the Senate president pro tempore -- the longest-serving senator of the majority party -- the 80-year-old Vermont Democrat is presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in lieu of Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts, who oversaw Trump's first impeachment trial, chose not to oversee the proceedings because Trump is no longer in office, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n Sen. Dick Durbin, the second highest-ranking Senate Democrat, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier on Tuesday evening that Leahy could be back in the chamber Wednesday.\n \"Pat Leahy's wife, Marcelle, is a nurse, and she's with him, and this was just an abundance of caution,\" Durbin said. \"He was feeling uncomfortable, as you mentioned, so they wanted to give him a trip to the hospital so they can watch him for a little while. She says things are going well, so we have all got our fingers crossed he will be back tomorrow.\"\n Leahy's hospitalization came soon after the impeachment trial began Tuesday afternoon with his swearing in. Leahy then swore in the rest of the Senate, and senators went four at a time to sign an \"oath book\" as jurors for the trial.\n The deal that Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached last week pushed back the start date for the substance of the proceedings, but several ceremonial functions of the trial took place Tuesday.\n The trial is effectively on hold as the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial to begin in earnest.\n House impeachment managers, a group of Democratic lawmakers who will act as prosecutors presenting the case against Trump during the trial, delivered the single article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday, which typically triggers a quick start to an impeachment trial. But the move to delay the start gives Democrats more time to confirm Biden's Cabinet and potentially take up a new Covid-19 relief bill while Trump's defense team has more time to prepare for trial.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Jeremy Herb and Lauren Fox contributed to this report",

        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday brought an end to lawsuits over whether Donald Trump illegally profited off his presidency.\n The justices threw out Trump\u2019s challenge to lower court rulings that had allowed lawsuits to go forward alleging that he violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International Hotel and patronize other businesses owned by the former president and his family.\n The high court also ordered the lower court rulings thrown out as well and directed appeals courts in New York and Richmond, Virginia, to dismiss the suits as moot now that Trump is no longer in office.\n The outcome leaves no judicial opinions on the books in an area of the law that has been rarely explored in U.S. history.\n The cases involved suits filed by\u00a0Maryland and the District of Columbia, and high-end restaurants and hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., that \u201cfound themselves in the unenviable position of having to compete with businesses owned by the President of the United States.\u201d\n The suits sought financial records showing how much state and foreign governments have paid the Trump Organization to stay and eat at Trump-owned properties.\n Other cases involving Trump remain before the Supreme Court, or in lower courts.\n Trump is trying to block the\u00a0Manhattan district attorney\u00a0\u2019s enforcement of a subpoena for his tax returns. Lower courts are weighing congressional subpoenas for Trump\u2019s financial records. And the justices also have before them Trump\u2019s appeal of a decision forbidding him from blocking critics on his Twitter account. Like the emoluments cases, Trump\u2019s appeal would seem to be moot now that he is out of office and also had\u00a0his Twitter account\u00a0suspended.",

        "title": "A rise in student suicides has pushed the 5th largest US school district to speed up a return to in-person learning",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The fifth-largest district in the United States is expediting its plan to bring students back for in-person learning after a rise in student suicides.\n Nevada's Clark County School District, which has more than 326,000 students enrolled, has been fully remote since March 2020 -- when the Covid-19 pandemic began. In the nine months since March, there have been 19 student suicides in the district, a school official confirmed to CNN. In the year before, there were only nine.\n The district did not give evidence of a direct link between the deaths and remote learning. However, six students died by suicide between March 16 and June 30, and 12 students died between July 1 and December 31. There was one more death earlier this month, a district official confirmed to CNN on Monday.\n Citing in part social and emotional wellness, the Clark County Board of Trustees voted unanimously to start bringing students back for in-person learning at a meeting on January 14.\n \"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be very challenging for education,\" said Superintendent Dr. Jesus Jara. \"We will continue to make the health and safety of students and staff a top priority. As we continue to look at the academic and health crisis that the pandemic has caused, I believe that the plan proposed provides the first steps in returning our students and educators to the classroom.\"\n The district has an early warning system put in place to help monitor student's mental health and well-being. With the help of that system, students have received more than 4,300 virtual wellness checks and more than 1,400 in-person wellness checks. Suicide protocols were initiated 30 times since March 2020, according to a report put out by the district.\n The district's report also outlined the strain long-term remote learning is having on students academically, stating that 90.4% of schools have given more Fs this year than the previous year, and 77.2% of schools gave more Ds than last year. Among those who got an F during the Fall semester, 11.2% of them earned all As and Bs in the Fall of 2019.\n As Covid-19 cases climb across the country, school districts are faced with an impossible dilemma of protecting student mental health by returning to the classroom or physical health by keeping them home.\n In October, a group of researchers warned about the mental health consequences of Covid-19, predicting a second wave of issues like increased deaths from suicide and drug overdoses.\n However, some teachers in the US have died from the virus -- which has led to a push from some educators to move to all-virtual classes.\n In a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the kind of spread seen in crowded offices and long-term care facilities has not been reported in schools.\n In-school transmission has occurred, but the researchers said there is little evidence that it contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.\n To get help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454.\n CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report",

        "title": "Josh Hawley And Republicans Are Besieged By Imaginary Mobs",
        "body_text": "Ever since a violent mob ransacked the Capitol earlier this month, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has been warning of mobs everywhere and pledging to remain vigilant against them.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to represent the people of Missouri without fear of any mob,\u201d Hawley said on Fox News Monday night.\n But Hawley isn\u2019t talking about the same mob that trashed the ultimate symbol of democracy in Washington, D.C., to undo the election of Joe Biden. He\u2019s not talking about the mob that cheered for him that day before he formally objected to the election result. He is talking about a metaphorical mob that wants to obliterate Republicans, and he is pretending to be this fake mob\u2019s most persecuted victim.\n \u201cIf they think I\u2019ll roll over and say, \u2018Go on ahead, tear down the Senate, tear down all of our democratic traditions,\u2019 I am not going to stand for it,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThe people of Missouri sent me here to represent them. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do and I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by the liberal mob.\u201d\n Hawley\u2019s victimization narrative is one that has taken firm root in the Republican Party in the past decade. It plays to a similar sense of victimization expressed by the party\u2019s voter base, including both the self-identifying white working class and wealthy conservative elites.\n Although Republicans control 27 out of 50 governorships and 30 out of 50 state legislatures and have appointed six out of nine Supreme Court justices, Hawley and others insist they\u2019re the ultimate underdogs.\n A 2020 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute taken at the height of last year\u2019s racial justice protests found 62% of Republicans still agreed with the statement that white people face similar discrimination as Black people and other minority groups. Among Trump supporters, Hawley\u2019s main target audience, 69% agreed that whites face equal discrimination.\n In 2016, PRRI also found that 74% of Republicans believed that discrimination against Christians was as bad as that faced by other groups.\n The 2020 Republican National Convention played into this victimization complex by focusing on the party\u2019s opposition to Black Lives Matter protests, even going so far as to feature Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the wealthy St. Louis couple indicted for pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protesters marching past their mansion. (The protestors were simply walking past the McCloskey\u2019s home on their way to protest in front of the mayor\u2019s residence.)\n \u201cIf you stand up for yourself, the mob, spurred on by allies in the media, will try to destroy you,\u201d Mark McCloskey said at the convention.\n This sense of grievance among both working-class and rich white conservatives fueled Trump\u2019s political success. And he played into it by positing himself, the leader, as the physical representation of the people. Any attack on him was really an attack on them.\n \u201cAlways remember,\u201d Trump said in his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president in 2020, \u201cthey are coming after me because I am fighting for you.\u201d\n In the two weeks since the Capitol riot, Hawley and other Republicans have begun to complain more loudly about the backlash against them for sharing a common cause with the rioters. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who initially said Trump bore responsibility for the attack but then recanted a week later by saying Trump had not \u201cprovoked\u201d it, complained over the weekend that reporters observing his irreconcilable statements were treating him unfairly.\n \u201cThe distortions of my comments are completely disingenuous,\u201d McCarthy tweeted. His press team begged allies for retweets.\n And on Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who refused to say the election wasn\u2019t stolen and demanded an investigation of it \u2015 even though dozens of state courts and the U.S. Department of Justice couldn\u2019t find any fraud \u2015 declared that calling Republicans liars is simply unfair.\n \u201cI won\u2019t be cowed by liberals in the media who say there\u2019s no evidence here and you\u2019re a liar if you talk about election fraud,\u201d Paul said.\n But Hawley is playing victim on another level. When he lamented mob intimidation on Monday night, he was talking about Democratic senators filing an ethics complaint against him for his role in helping incite the Jan. 6 riot. He\u2019d told supporters to \u201cstand up\u201d and even held out the possibility that Congress could overturn the election. Before the riot, he raised his fist to the crowd that stormed the Capitol within hours.\n Nevertheless, Hawley likened the complaint against him to an effort to \u201ctear down the Senate, tear down all of our Democratic institutions\u201d \u2015 as though an actual mob had not just stormed the actual Senate. Rioters talked on the Senate floor about Hawley and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) approving of their actions, according to a\u00a0video published by The New Yorker.\n Hawley seems to be making a deliberate effort to appropriate the word \u201cmob.\u201d\u00a0After the riot, which left five people dead and dozens of police officers injured, Hawley first used the word not to\u00a0describe the rioters, but\u00a0to complain\u00a0that a \u201cwoke mob\u201d at publisher Simon & Schuster had canceled his book deal.\n Then, in a guest column for a Missouri newspaper, Hawley explained why he voted to object to the election even after the insurrection at the Capitol.\n \u201cThe reason is simple: I will not bow to a lawless mob, or allow criminals to drown out the legitimate concerns of my constituents,\u201d he wrote \u2015 as though the mob had not just cheered for him when he raised his fist.\n The word \u201cmob\u201d usually refers to a large, angry crowd of people bent on violence. To Hawley, a mob is his Democratic colleagues, or a book publisher, or anyone who disagrees with him.",

The company declined to comment further on any attacks.\n The company pushed out the security patches on Tuesday as part of its new iOS 14.4 software, which also includes fixes for keyboard lag and allows smaller QR codes to be read by the camera.\n Apple said two security issues stem from its WebKit, an open source browser engine used by Safari and iOS browsers. \"A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution,\" the company said in the description notes. Meanwhile, Kernel, an Apple developer framework, was also affected.\n The exploits were reported by \"an anonymous researcher,\" according to the webpage.\n Apple prides itself on device security but it's not immune to exploits. Last year, Google researchers found several websites with code that allowed hackers to quietly infiltrate iPhones. Meanwhile, an iOS13 bug exposed contact details stored in iPhones without requiring a passcode or biometric identification \u2014 a flaw that the company did not publicly address until several months after it was first reported.",

        "body_text": "Who let the dogs in? Well, President Joe Biden did.\n As the president and his family settle in to the White House, two very important family members made the trip to their new home this weekend: Major and Champ.\n The pair of German shepherds belonging to Biden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, arrived this weekend, marking the first time a pet has taken up residence in the White House since the Obamas left in 2017.\n Notably, President Donald Trump was the first president in more than a hundred years to not have had a pet while in office.\n \u201cThe First Family wanted to get settled before bringing the dogs down to Washington from Delaware. Champ is enjoying his new dog bed by the fireplace, and Major loved running around on the South Lawn,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, press secretary for Jill Biden, in a statement to CNN on Monday.\n Of the two very good boys, Champ is more than 10 years old and has lived with the Bidens since December 2008, previously cohabitating with the family at the vice president\u2019s residence during Obama\u2019s presidency. Major, 3 years old, is the first-ever dog adopted from a shelter to live in the White House.\n The canine duo did not waste time making their presence known and were even heard in the background during Biden\u2019s Monday press briefing:\n Unsurprisingly, the dogs even have Twitter accounts dedicated to their lives \u2015 two of which are @TheFirstDogs and @TheOvalPawffice\u00a0\u2015 where updates about their goings-on are often posted.\n Welcome to the biggest, fanciest dog house, Champ and Major!",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Goldman Sachs cut chief executive David Solomon's annual compensation by $10 million, or 36%, following a penalty deduction that resulted from the bank's role in a corruption scandal involving a Malaysian investment fund, known as 1MDB.\n Solomon's compensation package was reduced to $17.5 million for 2020, down from the $27.5 million he received in 2019, according to a US Securities and Exchange filing on Tuesday. The $10 million payout comes after Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3 billion after pleading guilty to charges the bank conspired to violate US anti-bribery laws in a massive scandal with 1MDB.\n In October, the bank said that Solomon would face a pay cut, along with other top executives including its CFO Stephen Scherr and COO John Waldron in light of findings from the investigation that involved the US Department of Justice and other authorities.\n The scandal relates to bond sales that Goldman Sachs (GS) arranged and underwrote for 1MDB, from which the US Justice Department alleges $4.5 billion was stolen. The Justice Department accused Malaysian financier Jho Low, who had ties to the film \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" of masterminding a plot to channel the money from the fund to former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's bank accounts.\n Scherr's pay was reduced to $15.5 million from $22.5 million in 2019. Waldron's pay was slashed to $18.5 million, down from $24.5 million in 2019. In total, the three executives' total compensation for 2020 was reduced by $24 million in response to the bribery scandal fallout.\n \"While none of Messrs. Solomon, Waldron or Scherr was involved in or aware of the firm's participation in any illicit activity at the time the firm arranged the 1MDB bond transactions, the Board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,\" the filing stated.\n CNN's Eoin McSweeney contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Airbnb was ensnared in the Capitol Riot fallout. It somehow still came out on top",
        "body_text": "Washington, DCBrian Chesky had some air mattresses, but not much more, in 2008 when the presidential election triggered an idea for his then-fledgling startup, Airbnb.\n To draw attention to their site, Chesky and his co-founders started selling politically themed cereals. There were Obama-os, \"the breakfast of change,\" and Captain McCains, \"a maverick in every bite,\" as Chesky has recalled in interviews. Money had been so tight that year, Chesky said, that he lost 20 pounds as he ate less.\n Luckily, the cereal gimmick was a hit, selling out in days, Chesky said in a 2013 interview with the tech publication Pando. Airbnb sold about $30,000 of cereal, and got mostly out of debt, he said. Politics could be part of the marketing strategy, especially for a company just scraping by.\n Just over 13 years later, Chesky doesn't have to worry about his next meal. He's worth billions of dollars after Airbnb's December 2020 initial public offering. The company's stock doubled on its first day.\n But the most recent presidential election and inauguration have proven radically different than the first for which Airbnb was around.\n In a world in which American corporations can no longer maintain a sense of detached indifference, Chesky and Airbnb must increasingly wrangle with politics and power beyond what a company like Airbnb would usually have to deal with, as Washington, DC's violent insurrection illustrated. Few in the hospitality industry could have imagined having to consider issues like an insurrection when Chesky first launched Airbnb.\n But somehow, Chesky and Airbnb might come out on top all over again.\n Earlier this month, Airbnb hosts were alarmed to find their homes used as staging grounds for violence. Calls came for Airbnb and competitors to restrict rentals.\n Organizers calling for a DC shutdown said that their volunteers messaged 3,400 DC Airbnb hosts and encouraged them not to rent their properties.\n Chesky and Airbnb faced questions of their responsibility to the American democracy. Any move in either direction could have had a significant financial impact on Airbnb, as presidential inaugurations historically attract thousands of visitors who are willing to pay top dollar to stay in the nation's capital.\n Get it right, and Chesky would look like a responsible corporate steward. (Both Chesky and Airbnb declined to comment for this story.)\n Days after the Capitol insurrection, Airbnb released a \"Capitol Safety Plan,\" saying it would review DC reservations and ban individuals involved in criminal activity at the Capitol. But that didn't quiet critics. DC residents continued to call on Airbnb to halt reservations. Government officials like DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan called for people to not attend the inauguration in person.\n Chesky announced a revised plan Jan. 13, canceling all short-term reservations in the greater Washington, DC area, not only refunding guests' payments, but reimbursing lost reservation income to hosts, too. Long-term reservations that extended outside Jan. 15-21 were unaffected.\n Peter Kern, CEO of VRBO's parent company Expedia told CNN Business Jan. 18 that there were \"a lot of completely legitimate and appropriate uses of the properties.\" A day later, though, Expedia announced that new reservations would be blocked in Washington, DC, following updated guidance from government officials.\n In a blog post in which it announced its decision Airbnb warned of \"armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration\" in its blog post.\n Airbnb seems to have navigated the situation without any major issues. But doing so wasn't a given.\n It was unclear before the inauguration how effective Airbnb's reservation review process was, and if it led to meaningful cancellations, or any at all. Airbnb declined to say how many cancellations were made before the inauguration. Its competitor, VRBO, also declined to say if its own reviews had led to cancellations.\n Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president, public affairs and policy at U.S. Travel Association, which represents travel industry companies like Airbnb and Expedia Group, believes that there could be more coordination and information sharing in the future to benefit the industry. Hotels and rental car companies could receive the same access to security threats as airlines do.\n \"We're witnessing these kinds of events in a way that in most of our lifetime, we haven't seen,\" Barnes said. \"The more engagement, the better.\"",

        "title": "Parts of California will need yardsticks to measure snow this week thanks to atmospheric river",
        "body_text": "Check the forecast >>>\n \"This is a blockbuster winter storm event for us\" said Mark Deutschendorf, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada. \"Travel is not recommended from late Tuesday night to Friday across the Sierra and Lake Tahoe area, including western Nevada. If you do venture outdoors, be prepared to spend time an extended period of time in your car.\"\n This is just another example of California stuck in a \"weather whiplash\" -- moving from one weather extreme to the opposite extreme.\n A dramatic shift in scenery will occur as winter kicks into high gear.\n \"Parts of the Sierra will need a yardstick to measure the forecast snow in the forecast,\" tweeted the NWS in Sacramento Monday.\n The foothills could see 6 inches to a foot of snow while the mountains could see anywhere from 3 to 5 feet. In some areas, up to 7 feet is forecast across the Sierra Nevada's favored terrain through Friday.\n \"This storm remains projected to be a major headache for the region and will bring heavy snowfall to the Sierra as well as portions of western Nevada,\" said NWS Reno.\n A backcountry avalanche watch is in effect for much of the region, including the Tahoe Basin, through Friday. The combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds will lead to extreme avalanche danger, says the NWS.\n Ridgetops in the Sierra could see gusts exceeding 125 mph.\n This heavy snow is all thanks to a category 3 -- out of 5 -- atmospheric river.\n Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere -- like rivers in the sky -- that transport water vapor, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n The moisture laden air from this atmospheric river (AR) event will be forced to rise over the mountains' crest and loft upwards, cooling as it rises. As the air cools, it condenses, forming heavy precipitation, which will flirt with snowfall duration records.\n \"The Owens Valley (Great Basin Desert) could receive near-record amounts of snow over a two-day period. Their previous 48-hour snowfall record was 23 inches set back in 1969,\" NWS Meteorologist Jenn Varian told CNN.\n As the atmospheric river points its firehose along the central coast, excessive rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches will threaten flash flooding in the region.\n San Francisco averages 4.19 inches of rain during January. Suppose the atmospheric river concentrates the heaviest rain across the Bay Area: In that case, it's possible the city could receive a month's worth of precipitation in just a few days.\n Depending on the precise placement of the atmospheric river, coastal locations south of San Francisco to Santa Barbara could get between 5 to 10 inches of rain with locally higher amounts. Lesser but still significant rain totals of 1 to 2 inches are likely from Los Angeles to San Diego.\n This heavy rainfall combined with the burn scars of the record wildfire season of 2020 brings a dangerous risk of mudslides and debris flows.\n Forecasters are especially concerned about Monterey County and Santa Cruz County where evacuations are underway, according to a statement released by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n Intense wildfires can compromise soil structure, making sloped terrain more vulnerable to debris flows and mudslides during heavy rain events.\n If enough rain falls upon a recent burn scar, a torrent of mud, rock and debris can cascade downhill and put communities in danger. Properties directly affected by recent fires or those located directly downstream from burn areas are at the most risk.\n Although atmospheric rivers can be hazardous, residents rely upon them to bring beneficial precipitation to the region.\n \"Thirty to 50 percent of annual precipitation on the west coast occurs in just a few AR events,\" according to NOAA.\n California's winter snowpack, fueled in part by atmospheric rivers, is crucial to the state's water supply. Warmer spring temperatures melt the snow and fill reservoirs, so freshwater is available during the dryer summer months.\n This AR event can be viewed as much needed relief because the current statewide snowpack is just 40% of average to date.\n This storm, along with an active weather pattern forecast into early February, will help alleviate drought conditions across California and the Great Basin.\n Severe drought conditions cover nearly 80% of California.\n However, just like anything in moderation, it's possible to have too much of a good thing.\n Research shows that the US West Coast, specifically California, can expect more climate extremes in the future.\n Precipitation extremes -- such as the current atmospheric river -- will intensify while dry spells are likely to become longer and more frequent, according to climate scientists.\n \"In a place like California, we really need to be thinking about both risks [drought and flood] simultaneously,\" said Daniel Swain, a University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist and lead author of a study on the subject.\n Dramatic swings are becoming more common and will continue to do so in the coming decades thanks to man-made climate change, according to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\n Drastic swings from extremely wet to extremely dry and vice versa will be nearly twice as likely, occurring on average once every 25 years, by 2100.\n Climate variability is due, in part, to human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels.",

But what many didn't know was that this rock, dubbed Lunar Sample 76015,143, had been on an Odyssean journey to get there, one 3.9 billion years in the making.\n The current thinking is that 4.5 billion years ago, a protoplanet the size of Mars slammed into a magma ocean-covered Earth. Debris from the baby planet and the spaceborne projectile was sent into orbit, eventually clumping together to make the moon.\n The solar system was a bit like the inside of a pinball machine back then, with countless would-be worlds crashing into each other. Like the adolescent Earth, the youthful moon was a target too, with several enormous impacts carving out ginormous basins on its surface. And around 600 million years after it was formed, the moon rendezvoused with a rock the size of New Jersey, weighing about 25,000 trillion tons and moving at a speed of around 52,000 miles per hour.\n This interloping giant rock, which hit the moon at an inclined angle, disintegrated upon impact, sending boulders shooting across the lunar surface, cutting deep, long grooves into the crust as if it were attacked by a cosmic, clawed beast. The impact would have been way more powerful than a gargantuan volcanic explosion like Mount St. Helens, which itself had unleashed more energy than the sum total of all the explosives used during World War II, including the two nuclear bombs. The rock carved out a circular chasm some 710 miles across. For the sake of comparison, the asteroid that careened into Earth 66 million years ago and heralded the end of the age of the dinosaurs excavated a pit a mere 110 miles in diameter.\n Around 250 million years later, lava later poured into this great depression, forming a sea of molten rock named Mare Imbrium, the \"Sea of Rains.\" And as lava lapped at the shores of this magnificent desolation, a curious rock sat nearby: a mangled amalgam of crushed sediment and once-molten matter, a product of the ferocity of that ancient, colossal impact.\n For what seemed like an eternity, that rock sat silently on the moon, hit by the occasional micrometeorite. And 3.9 billion years after it was formed, in the twilight days of 1972, two visitors from another world, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt -- Schmitt was the first and only geologist sent to the moon -- saw it glinting in starlight.\n The last two people to set foot on the moon carved off a chunk and brought a sample back home. Like the other rocks brought back by the Apollo missions, it was housed at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, it was broken up, and its pieces -- including number 76015,143 -- were examined by scientists hoping to unravel the secrets of the moon's origins and its evolution, as well as providing them with a window into Earth's obfuscated distant past.\n That we can host such stunning off-world geologic treasures on Earth and decode the epochal stories they tell without needing to invent time travel is a remarkable achievement. But Lunar Sample 76015,143 isn't sitting in any old building. It's in the office of the most powerful person in the world. That imbues this lithic archive with novel significance.\n For the last four years, the Trump administration threw science into the sewers, treating it like an inconvenience at best and a shameful pursuit at worst. More than 400,000 Americans died of Covid-19 during Donald Trump's time in office. We may never know how many lives could have been saved had the former president not shown an allergic reaction to reality -- not only on the pandemic, but on another death-dealing existential crisis: climate change.\n Biden is clearly ushering in a new era. Immediately after the inauguration, the new administration went to task, initiating their 198-page plan to defeat the pandemic while beginning the difficult work of stemming climate change. The Oval Office's moon rock is, for many, a cathartic sight, a symbol of the new President's science-driven agenda, of his administration's adherence to facts and to objective truths, something America needs now more than ever.\n Landing astronauts on the moon was a political ambition first and foremost. But that rock, on loan from NASA at the request of the Biden administration, represents what can happen when a national priority is made of the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. If America can send people across the expanse and bring them back with geologic treasures, then it can also bring an end to a pandemic.\n Ideally, this rock also represents a calling card to the stars. We can only comprehend our place in the cosmos if we go out and explore it -- and look not just to the moon, but beyond it. NASA is about to land its Perseverance rover on Mars, the first step in an 11-year operation to bring back the first pristine rocks from that planet's surface. One day, astronauts will be hauling Martian rocks home themselves. But who will be the first Earth-born emissaries to the Red Planet?\n A future president of the United States may have a piece of Mars sitting on her bookshelf. If so, I suspect Americans will look back in pride at the moment they saw a moon rock sitting in Biden's Oval Office. It may mark the day the White House was exorcised of its ignorance, transforming once again -- and, we hope, forevermore -- into a place that champions science.",

        "title": "James R. Flynn, Who Found We Are Getting Smarter, Dies at 86",
        "body_text": "In 1978, James R. Flynn, a political philosopher at the University of Otago, in New Zealand, was writing a book about what constituted a \u201chumane\u201d society. He considered \u201cinhumane\u201d societies as well \u2014 dictatorships, apartheid states \u2014 and, in his reading, came across the work of Arthur R. Jensen, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n Dr. Jensen was best known for an article he published in 1969 claiming that the differences between Black and white Americans on I.Q. tests resulted from genetic differences between the races \u2014 and that programs that tried to improve Black educational outcomes, like Head Start, were bound to fail.\n Dr. Flynn, a committed leftist who had once been a civil rights organizer in Kentucky, felt instinctively that Dr. Jensen was wrong, and he set out to prove it. In 1980 he published a thorough, devastating critique of Dr. Jensen\u2019s work \u2014 showing, for example, that many groups of whites scored as low on I.Q. tests as Black Americans. But he didn\u2019t stop there.\n Like most researchers in his field, Dr. Jensen had assumed that intelligence was constant across generations, pointing to the relative stability of I.Q. tests over time as evidence. But Dr. Flynn noticed something that no one else had: Those tests were recalibrated every decade or so. When he looked at the raw, uncalibrated data over nearly 100 years, he found that I.Q. scores had gone up, dramatically.\n \u201cIf you scored people 100 years ago against our norms, they would score a 70,\u201d or borderline mentally disabled, he said later. \u201cIf you scored us against their norms, we would score 130\u201d \u2014 borderline gifted.\n Just as groundbreaking was his explanation for why. The rise was too fast to be genetic, nor could it be that our recent ancestors were less intelligent than we are. Rather, he argued, the last century has seen a revolution in abstract thinking, what he called \u201cscientific spectacles,\u201d brought on by the demands of a technologically robust industrial society. This new order, he maintained, required greater educational attainment and an ability to think in terms of symbols, analogies and complex logic \u2014 exactly what many I.Q. tests measure.\n \u201cHe surprised everyone, despite the fact that the field of intelligence research is intensely data-centric,\u201d the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker said in an interview. \u201cThis philosopher discovered a major phenomenon that everyone had missed.\u201d\n Though Dr. Flynn published his research in 1984, it was not until a decade later that it drew attention outside the narrow world of intelligence researchers.\n The turning point came with the publication in 1994 of \u201cThe Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,\u201d by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles A. Murray, which argued that genes play a dominant role in shaping intelligence \u2014 a position that its fiercest critics called racist. In reviewing arguments for and against their position, the authors outlined Dr. Flynn\u2019s research and even gave it a name: the Flynn effect.\n A buzzword was born. The Flynn effect became shorthand for an optimistic view of the human condition and made Dr. Flynn something of a pop-culture hero, an image underscored by his lanky build, rumpled outfits and Einsteinian mess of curly white hair. A 2013 TED Talk in which he explained \u201cwhy our I.Q. levels are higher than our grandparents\u2019\u201d has been viewed 4.4 million times.\n Dr. Flynn died at 86 on Dec. 11 at an assisted living center in Dunedin, New Zealand. The cause was intestinal cancer, said his son, Victor Flynn, a math professor at Oxford.\n In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Emily (Malkin) Flynn, a divorce lawyer, and his daughter, Natalie Flynn, a clinical psychologist.\n Dr. Flynn and Dr. Murray became frequent debating partners, especially after Dr. Flynn showed in subsequent research, with William T. Dickens, that the Black-white I.Q. gap had diminished significantly between 1972 and 2002.\n But while they differed intellectually, Dr. Flynn was also quick to defend Dr. Murray \u2014 and Dr. Jensen, for that matter \u2014 against the accusations of racism. He dedicated one of his books to Dr. Jensen, and he took Dr. Murray\u2019s side in 2017 after students at Middlebury College in Vermont shut down a speech by Dr. Murray.\n \u201cJim was a paragon of intellectual curiosity and willingness to look at all the evidence,\u201d Dr. Murray said in an interview. \u201cHe had almost a childlike curiosity, and I mean that in a good way.\u201d\n James Robert Flynn was born on April 28, 1934, in Washington, to Joseph and Mae Flynn. His father was a journalist, and his mother was a homemaker.\n Raised a Roman Catholic, he renounced religion when he was 12. As a scholarship student at the University of Chicago, he had originally planned to study mathematics or physics, but he was nagged by the question of how morality functions without faith. Having completed all his core requirements in his freshman year, he dived into political philosophy. He received his doctorate in 1958, when he was just 24.\n Already a man of the left \u2014 Dr. Flynn joined the Socialist Party in college \u2014 Dr. Flynn became involved in the civil rights movement after graduating. He met Emily Malkin at a protest against a segregated amusement park in the Washington suburbs, and they named their first child after Dr. Flynn\u2019s hero, the American socialist Eugene Victor Debs.\n He continued his activism as a professor at what is now Eastern Kentucky University, in the town of Richmond, about 30 miles south of Lexington. There he helped organize against the city\u2019s segregated downtown businesses, drawing threats from the mayor and a reprimand from the college president. A lifelong competitive runner, he was removed as the track coach.\n He left in 1961 for a job at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, then another at Lake Forest College, outside Chicago. But he came to believe that his left-wing politics had foreclosed the possibility of an academic career in the United States. He looked abroad, and in 1963 he landed a job at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Four years later he moved to the University of Otago, in Dunedin, where he remained until his retirement in 2020.\n Though Dr. Flynn was based in the university\u2019s political studies department, his writings and interests ranged widely. In between books on liberalism, world history and political censorship, he advised Australia\u2019s prime minister on foreign policy, organized against the war in Vietnam and, in the 1990s, founded two left-wing political parties. He ran unsuccessfully for Parliament three times.\n Though he was widely recognized for making one of the most significant psychological discoveries of the late 20th century, Dr. Flynn was modest about his contributions, as well as his standing in his adopted field. He had, he said, merely taken a \u201choliday\u201d in psychology, then stuck around out of a sense of obligation to clean up the \u201cmess\u201d he had made.\n He was always careful to qualify his claims: Despite his success in overturning the notion that genes are everything, he never dismissed it entirely. Genes played a large part in determining intelligence, he maintained, especially at the individual level, but so did environment and what he called \u201cchance factors,\u201d like accidents and life decisions \u2014 in other words, free will. And environment made all the difference in explaining the gaps between different groups within a society, whether racial, gender, class or otherwise.\n He was also aware of the uncomfortable implications of his position: that by ascribing differences between Black and white I.Q. tests to environment, he was running the risk of blaming Black parenting and culture.\n \u201cYou\u2019re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,\u201d he said in an interview with Skeptic magazine. \u201cEither you say it\u2019s genetic or you say there is something about Black child-rearing practices that don\u2019t provide cognitive challenge, in which case you\u2019re blaming the victim.\u201d\n Unlike many academics, Dr. Flynn increased his output as he aged: Eleven of his 18 books appeared in his last decade, many of them going back to his earlier interests in political theory and free speech. He became increasingly focused on academic freedom and a critic of so-called cancel culture, especially on campus.\n His last book, \u201cIn Defense of Free Speech: The University as Censor,\u201d was rejected by its first publisher as incendiary \u2014 though, as Dr. Flynn pointed out, he was merely summarizing the positions of people he disagreed with, in order to make a larger point. Frustrated, he found a new publisher for the book, which he retitled \u201cA Book Too Risky to Publish: Free Speech and Universities\u201d (2019).\n \u201cDad was always very respectful of people he disagreed with, and hated the trend of boycotting academics because of their views,\u201d Professor Flynn, his son, said. \u201cHe very much thought that people should be able to express their views, and if you don\u2019t agree, argue with them.\u201d",

        "title": "What the Biden administration means for the future of Silicon Valley",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The biggest tech companies spent much of the last four years in Washington playing defense: Answering to threats of regulation and repeatedly being called before congressional committees; serving as former President Donald Trump's foil on social media moderation; and protesting his approach to immigration and tariffs.\n Now, with President Joe Biden in the White House, Big Tech may be hoping to turn a page. The industry's trade groups are already lining up proposals to the new administration in hopes of shaping a more favorable agenda.\n But despite Biden's early moves like overturning Trump's travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries and tapping tech industry staffers to serve in his government, Silicon Valley's future remains as uncertain as ever. Even with Congress under Democratic control -- with a razor-thin margin -- many of the tech-related challenges for policymakers remain the same.\n Among them are what to do with an enormously powerful social media industry that largely continues to spread misinformation and hate, despite the platforms' efforts to crack down on it; how to ensure that all Americans have affordable high-speed internet access amid a global pandemic; and responding to a suspected Russian intrusion into US computer networks that's been described as the worst government data breach in years. It's also unclear if the government's approach to Chinese-linked companies, including TikTok, whose business deal with Oracle and Walmart still hasn't been approved, may change.\n Here are the big tech issues that policy experts say America's new government will likely confront.\n Policy experts say tech companies are still in for a reckoning in Washington, even with the departure of Trump \u2014 the industry's chief antagonist for the last four years. Perhaps nowhere is that more apparent than with Section 230, the liability shield that largely protects tech companies from lawsuits over their content moderation decisions.\n Democrats and Republicans disagree, however, over what the problem is.\n GOP lawmakers have lobbed baseless claims of unconstitutional censorship at the hands of tech platforms (the Constitution does not require private companies to carry user speech). At the same time, Democrats including Biden say tech companies haven't done enough to combat misinformation and must be held accountable. One of Biden's top tech advisors, Bruce Reed, said in December that it's \"long past time to hold the social media companies accountable for what's published on their platforms.\"\n For their part, companies including Google and Facebook have said they've hired thousands of human content moderators and ramped up artificial intelligence-based content filters.\n With Democrats enjoying a slim margin in Congress, policy experts anticipate the conversation on Section 230 to drift away from Republican-driven legislation targeting perceived censorship. That's particularly the case now following the Capitol riots earlier this month, which were facilitated by online misinformation about the 2020 election outcome, said Carl Szabo, general counsel at NetChoice, a tech trade group.\n \"I believe Democrats are going to be much, much more aggressive in pushing for reforms of Section 230 to force stricter moderation of content,\" he said.\n The threats to big tech companies don't end there. Major platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google received a great deal of scrutiny last year over their dominance, with a House Democratic-led report finding that the companies enjoy \"monopoly power.\" Facebook and Google are battling multiple lawsuits by federal and state officials, and Apple and Amazon have been hit by private antitrust lawsuits. All of those suits are expected to continue.\n With Democrats in control of the House and nominally in the Senate, that provides an opening for the party to push for some of the more aggressive changes to competition law contemplated in the House antitrust report. While Republicans had expressed support for some proposals, such as giving the Federal Trade Commission more resources, they had balked at others, such as a bill that might prevent tech companies from both owning a digital platform and competing on it, as Amazon does with its e-commerce site.\n \"If Congress does flip, you could end up with some kind of new [regulatory] scheme for the big digital marketplaces,\" Columbia University law professor Tim Wu predicted in October.\n One of the Trump Federal Communications Commission's first actions in 2017 was to repeal the US government's net neutrality regulations, which had prohibited internet service providers from blocking, slowing or selectively speeding up websites and apps. The move was widely opposed by tech companies, internet activists and consumer groups, while telecom providers welcomed the de-regulation.\n Now, with control of Congress and the White House, Democrats have an opportunity to restore those rules \u2014 either by re-introducing them at the FCC, or by passing legislation to enshrine the regulations into law.\n That could put an end to what had become a ping-pong match in Washington, with different FCCs enacting different rules each time the Oval Office changed hands.\n \"We might find a permanent solution for net neutrality,\" said Chip Pickering, a former US congressman from Mississippi who now leads INCOMPAS, a telecom trade group. Pickering said a likely path would be for Congress to impose net neutrality obligations on providers including Comcast, Verizon and others without explicitly regulating them like the FCC does with legacy telephone service, a key fault line in past debates.\n As the pandemic has driven many Americans to remote work and schooling, it's highlighted how rural and low-income Americans don't enjoy the same access to high-speed internet as those with more resources. Closing that digital divide has historically been a rallying cry for both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 making investments in broadband a potentially easy, bipartisan accomplishment, policy experts say.\n Expect broadband funding to become a part of infrastructure talks on Capitol Hill, following Biden's campaign promise to extend high-speed connectivity to \"every American.\" The FCC is likely to expand existing federal subsidy programs for connectivity, according to the Brookings Institute. And industry leaders have called for streamlining the rollout of 5G wireless service.\n The devastating breach of US government and corporate networks by suspected Russian hackers will be an enormous challenge for the Biden administration, as investigators continue to assess the damage.\n It will be up to Biden to determine how the US will respond and there are numerous tools at his disposal for doing so, said Keith Alexander, retired general and former director of the National Security Agency. But any response would need to be carefully calibrated to avoid an escalation, he said.\n \"You can respond by indicting individuals and by diplomatic and economic measures, which they should do,\" Alexander told CNN. \"But any response in cyber in the physical space would probably develop into a bigger attack on us, and we're not prepared to defend against that.\"\n Speaking to reporters Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to say what the administration will do.\n \"We reserve the right to respond at a time and manner of our choosing to any cyberattack,\" she said.\n With the Biden administration's executive actions last week, Silicon Valley appears hopeful for a more welcoming US immigration policy \u2014 one that supports the industry's use of immigrant talent.\n Companies including Apple, Airbnb and IBM quickly applauded Biden's reversal of Trump's travel ban and his efforts to preserve the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. That program, which Trump had sought to limit, protects undocumented immigrants from deportation who had arrived in the United States as children.\n Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week he was \"inspired\" by Biden's moves. In a blog post, Airbnb said it celebrated the executive actions to undo restrictions that it said went \"against Airbnb's mission and values.\" And IBM said those who benefit from the DACA program \"make vital contributions to our communities and economy.\"\n \"We look forward to a permanent, bipartisan solution in the future,\" the tech giant said.",

        "title": "Joe Biden Halts Trump Plan To Speed Up Processing Lines In Poultry Plants",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden struck a blow to his predecessor\u2019s legacy of deregulation on Monday, blocking a rule from the Trump administration that would have allowed faster line speeds in poultry plants as a pandemic raged.\n The Trump administration proposal, put forth late last year, would have allowed more facilities to increase the maximum number of chickens processed per minute from 140 to 175. Worker safety groups and a prominent labor union had warned that raising the line speeds would exhaust already-taxed workers and lead to more injuries and COVID-19 infections.\n The Biden administration announced Monday that the Agriculture Department was withdrawing the proposal as part of a regulatory review of Trump policies. A department spokesperson said in an email that the line speed measure was \u201cone of several rules and regulations\u201d that would be reconsidered.\n The poultry industry has fought for years to achieve faster line speeds in plants, and the Trump administration hurried to complete the rule before leaving office last week. The outgoing administration sent the rule to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget for review just days after the election, but now it may never see the light of day.\n The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents workers in poultry and other meat plants, called withdrawing the rule \u201ca key step\u201d in protecting essential workers.\n \u201cEven though it has been less than a week since his inauguration, President Biden is already showing the type of commitment to the health and safety of frontline food workers that the American people expect and deserve,\u201d Marc Perrone, the union\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n Labor groups and Democrats were furious that the Trump administration had sought to increase line speeds during a pandemic when meatpacking workers were already getting sick with COVID-19 in alarming numbers. Food processing facilities have been home to some of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the country.\n The UFCW and safety experts warned that the Trump rule would make the viral spread even worse. A study published in November found that virus transmission rates were worse in plants that had already received government permission to run at higher speeds.\n In addition to the poultry rule, Trump also issued an executive order aimed at keeping meat processing facilities open despite COVID-19 outbreaks. Meanwhile, leadership at Trump\u2019s Labor Department declined to crack down on plants where workers died, issuing only a few, small safety fines against processors.\n Biden signaled last May during the presidential campaign that he saw faster lines as a dangerous cash grab by the meat companies.\n \u201cWhether it\u2019s cattle, whether it\u2019s beef, whether it\u2019s pigs, whether it\u2019s chicken, they\u2019re moving down that line faster and faster and faster to increase the profit rate,\u201d the then-candidate said during a Yahoo News town hall. \u201cPeople are getting sicker. People are getting hurt. The very thing we should be doing now is making sure these people are protected.\u201d\n Despite criticism from worker groups, the idea of a line speed increase used to enjoy some bipartisan support. The Agriculture Department had considered such an increase under the Obama administration, with the backing of then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Biden has chosen Vilsack to be his own agriculture secretary.\n The environmental watchdog Food & Water Watch applauded Biden\u2019s decision to stop the Trump version of the rule from moving forward, but given Vilsack\u2019s history, the group said it would remain \u201cdiligent and aggressive in holding this administration accountable.\u201d",

        "title": "The pandemic destroyed 225 million jobs worldwide, but billionaires got richer, reports find",
        "body_text": "LONDON \u2014 At least 225 million full-time jobs disappeared worldwide last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report published Monday by the International Labor Organization, losses four times worse than those from the global financial crisis in 2009. But the ultrarich have seen their wealth soar.\n According to another report released Monday, by the anti-poverty nonprofit group Oxfam, the combined wealth of the world\u2019s 10 richest men has risen by more than $500 billion since the crisis began \u2014 enough to vaccinate the entire planet and then some, according to the organization.\n Both sets of findings identify rising inequity as one of the pandemic\u2019s principal outcomes. \u201cJob destruction has disproportionately affected low-paid and low\u2011skilled jobs,\u201d which \u201cpoints to the risk of an uneven recovery, leading to still greater inequality in the coming years,\u201d the ILO found. That unevenness is already apparent: Global poverty could take 14 times longer to return to pre-pandemic levels than the recovery of the world\u2019s wealthiest, according to Oxfam.\n Last year, 8.8 percent of global working hours were lost, according to the report by the ILO, a U.N. agency. It found \u201cunprecedented disruption\u201d among global labor markets, and that women and young people have felt the worst impact. Globally, women saw 5 percent employment loss in 2020, as opposed to 3.9 percent for men.\n \u201cIn line with the focus of Oxfam\u2019s report on inequality, ILO\u2019s estimates confirm that the crisis has resulted in relatively larger employment and income losses for women and young people, along with the low-paid and low-skilled,\u201d Sher Verick, head of the ILO\u2019s employment strategies for inclusive transformation unit, told The Washington Post. \u201cCertain sectors have been hit harder, such as accommodation and food services.\u201d\n Employment loss among people ages 15 to 24 stood at 8.7 percent. The data \u201chighlights the all too real risk of a lost generation,\u201d according to the report.\n Guy Ryder, the director general of the ILO, said during a news briefing that the effect of the pandemic had been greater than not only that of the financial crisis but also that of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Job losses, he said, were likely to continue through 2021 \u2014 although he noted that battered economies could begin to rebuild once vaccination efforts start to take effect.\n \u201cI am pleased to say that there is some relatively good news in all of this, that we do see tentative signs of recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cThese signs are fragile, they are uncertain, and the prospects are notably uneven.\u201d\n The Oxfam findings also suggest a slow path to economic recovery: It could take at least a decade for the world\u2019s poorest to recover from the health crisis, while the 1,000 richest people already have made back their losses and the wealthiest 10 have earned more than $500 billion during the pandemic.\n Authors of the report said the pandemic could trigger a simultaneous rise in inequality nearly everywhere, for the first time since records began.\n \u201cThe virus has exposed, fed off and increased existing inequalities of wealth, gender and race,\u201d the report said.\n British lawmaker David Lammy of the Labour Party called the Oxfam findings \u201ctruly staggering.\u201d\n \u201cThe wealth of ten of the world\u2019s richest men has increased by more than \u00a3400bn during the pandemic \u2014 more than enough to vaccinate every person in the world,\u201d he tweeted.\n Lawmaker Claudia Webbe, also of the Labour Party, branded Oxfam\u2019s findings \u201cobscene\u201d and called for a wealth tax to be placed on the ultrarich \u2014 a proposal that some experts say could be the answer to the United Kingdom\u2019s financial recovery after the government was forced to spend billions of pounds in borrowed money to save jobs and lives during the coronavirus pandemic.\n Britain\u2019s Wealth Tax Commission says taxing the rich would be a more equitable solution to helping the country\u2019s recovery as opposed to increasing taxes on goods or incomes, political decisions they argue would damage those who need the money to survive.\n \u201cIt is morally repugnant to allow the poorest people to continue to pay the price for the crisis, when it is clear that a fair tax on the richest could make such a difference,\u201d Rebecca Gowland, Oxfam\u2019s head of inequality, said last month, the BBC reported.",

        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2014 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is stepping up efforts to track coronavirus mutations and keep vaccines and treatments effective against new variants until collective immunity is reached, the agency\u2019s chief said on Sunday.\n Dr. Rochelle Walensky spoke about the rapidly evolving virus during a Fox News Sunday interview as the number of Americans known to be infected surpassed 25 million, with more than 417,000 dead, just over a year after the first U.S. case was documented.\n Walensky, who took over as CDC director the day President Joe Biden was sworn in, also said the greatest immediate culprit for sluggish vaccine distribution was a supply crunch worsened by inventory confusion inherited from the Trump administration.\n \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know today, five days into this administration, and weeks into planning, how much vaccine we have just gives you a sense of the challenges we\u2019ve been left with,\u201d she told Fox News Sunday.\n Biden\u2019s transition team was largely excluded from the vaccine rollout deliberations for weeks after his election, as then President Donald Trump refused to concede defeat and permit access to information his successor needed to prepare to govern.\n In a separate interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s chief of staff, said a plan for distributing the vaccine, particularly beyond nursing homes and hospitals, \u201cdid not really exist when we came into the White House.\u201d\n Walensky said she was confident the government would soon resolve supply questions, and go on to dramatically expand vaccine production and distribution by late March.\n Uncertainty over immediate supplies, however, will hinder efforts at the state and local levels to plan ahead for how many vaccination sites, personnel and appointments to set up in the meantime, exacerbating short-term shortages, she added.\n Vaccination has become ever more urgent with the recent emergence of several coronavirus variants believed to be more transmissible, and in the case of one strain first detected in Britain, possibly more lethal.\n \u201cWe are now scaling up both our surveillance of these and our study of these,\u201d Walensky said, adding that the CDC was collaborating with the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and even the Pentagon.\n The object, she said, was to monitor \u201cthe impact of these variants on vaccines, as well as on our therapeutics,\u201d as the virus continues to mutate while it spreads.\n Until vaccines can provide \u201cherd\u201d immunity in the population, mask-wearing and social distancing remain vital to \u201cdecrease the amount of virus that is circulating, and therefore, decrease the amount of variants,\u201d Walensky added.\n Although British officials on Friday warned that the so-called UK variant of the coronavirus, already detected in at least 20 U.S. states, was associated with a higher level of mortality, scientists have said existing vaccines still appeared to be effective against it.\n They worry, however, that a more contagious South African variant may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines and shows resistance to three antibody treatments developed for patients.\n Similarities between the South African variant and another identified in Brazil suggest the Brazilian variety may likewise resist antibody treatment.\n \u201cWe\u2019re in a race against these variants,\u201d said Vivek Murthy, nominated by Biden to become the next U.S. surgeon general, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program on Sunday.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease specialist, said in late December he was optimistic the United States could achieve enough collective immunity to regain \u201csome semblance of normality\u201d by the fall of 2021.\n But Murthy said getting to herd immunity before a new school year begins in September was \u201can ambitious goal.\u201d\n Nevertheless, Murthy suggested the government may exceed Biden\u2019s objective of 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days of his presidency, telling ABC News, \u201cThat\u2019s a floor; it\u2019s not a ceiling.\u201d\n Fauci, appearing separately on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said the 100-million goal includes those who may have received both injections of the two-dose vaccines and those who only got the first.\n About 21.8 million Americans, or about 6.5% of the population, have received at least one dose of vaccine to date, of the 41.4 million doses shipped, CDC data showed on Sunday.\n (Reporting by Susan Cornwell in Washington and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles;

        "body_text": "\u201cWarp speed\u201d may be a term of the moment, thanks to the federal coronavirus vaccine program. But it\u2019s also one with a history \u2014 which goes back farther than \u201cStar Trek,\u201d to a forgotten 1952 science fiction story in the pulp magazine Imagination.\n Ditto for \u201ctransporter,\u201d \u201cmoon base\u201d and \u201cdeep space,\u201d to name just a few of the more than 400 words whose origins are getting pushed back earlier than their previously first appearance, thanks to the Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction, a new free online resource released on Tuesday.\n A historical dictionary devoted to the history of something as future-oriented (and imaginary) as science fiction may seem like a contradiction in terms. But then science fiction has always had a curious relationship to the real world, said Jesse Sheidlower, its editor.\n \u201cDespite the fact a lot of people look down on science fiction as a genre, it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a very interesting crossover between science fiction and science.\u201d\n The dictionary is the latest in a series of eclectic projects for Sheidlower, a former editor at large at the Oxford English Dictionary who first came to prominence in the 1990s, as part of a new generation of lexicographers injecting the field with a fresh nerd-cool factor.\n In 1995, he published \u201cThe F-Word,\u201d a cheekily learned history of the notorious obscenity. More recently, Sheidlower, now an independent lexicographer, worked as a language consultant on Amazon\u2019s adaptation of Philip K. Dick\u2019s \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d\n Peter Gilliver, an executive editor at the O.E.D. and the author of \u201cThe Making of the Oxford English Dictionary,\u201d called the new online dictionary \u201cquite impressive, and very stylishly presented.\u201d\n \u201cJesse doesn\u2019t like to leave any stone unturned,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very dogged researcher.\u201d\n Historical dictionaries aim to show not just what words mean, but who has used them, in what contexts, and how those meanings have evolved. They range from behemoths like the O.E.D. itself, which attempts to cover the whole of the language, to national dictionaries like the \u201cDictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles\u201d to more specialized efforts dedicated to golfing terms or hip-hop.\n The science fiction dictionary grew out of the Science Fiction Citations Project, a crowdsourced effort initiated in 2001 by the O.E.D. and managed by Sheidlower. The goal of that project was to expand the O.E.D.\u2019s coverage of science fiction, something of a gap in its research, by drawing on the reading and knowledge of fans. (\u201cBrave New Words,\u201d a print historical dictionary based on the project and edited by Jeff Prucher, appeared in 2007.)\n In early 2020, Sheidlower, who left the O.E.D. in 2013, got permission to continue the project independently. (In addition to the editing, he coded the site himself, and shares his research back with the O.E.D.) He turned out to have more free time than he expected, thanks to the pandemic. He also had a resource that didn\u2019t yet exist when the original project started: the Internet Archive\u2019s vast collection of digitized \u2014 and searchable \u2014 pulp magazines.\n As for his own science fiction consumption, Sheidlower described himself as more of a \u201cregular reader\u201d than a superfan. \u201cIt\u2019s probably good to keep a little distance, just to maintain perspective,\u201d he said.\n The Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction includes some 1,800 separate entries, from \u201cactifan\u201d and \u201caerocar\u201d to \u201czero-gravity\u201d and \u201czine.\u201d Headwords and other display type are rendered in Sagittarius, a new typeface by the designer Jonathan Hoefler, whose original typefaces have appeared on \u201cStar Trek: Picard\u201d (and in The New York Times).\n Users can look up individual words, or browse through subject categories like fandom, weaponry, demonyns (names for beings for particular locations), FTL (shorthand for faster-than-light travel) and, yes, \u201cStar Trek.\u201d\n The citations lean toward so-called hard science fiction (defined as science fiction based on hard science, which does not violate known scientific laws), and origin dates thin out in recent decades.\n The most cited authors are Robert Heinlein, Poul Anderson and Isaac Asimov. But if an author is not represented, Sheidlower emphasized, that\u2019s not a value judgment.\n \u201cThe harder your science fiction, the more likely you are to be using terms other people are using,\u201d he said. But writers of \u201csoft science fiction\u201d (defined in the dictionary as science fiction based on soft sciences like anthropology or sociology, or in which science plays a relatively small role), he said, may actually be more innovative in their language.\n He mentioned N.K. Jemisin, whose Broken Earth trilogy, published between 2015 and 2017, won three consecutive Hugo Awards. \u201cShe\u2019s not, for the most part, using words everyone is using.\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s not in here doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s unimportant. It can actually mean the opposite.\u201d\n One of the main goals of historical lexicography is finding antedatings, as instances that push back the earliest known use of a term are called. Some included here involve large leaps: \u201cThought-controlled,\u201d used to describe devices controlled by neural impulses, is pushed back to 1934 from 1977.\n The dictionary also illustrates the complicated interplay between imaginative literature and the real world. The words \u201cgraviton\u201d and \u201cbiotechnician,\u201d for example, first appeared in science fiction sources before being adopted in the real world.\n Conversely, Sheidlower said he was surprised to learn that \u201chypospray,\u201d another term chiefly associated with \u201cStar Trek\u201d (defined as \u201can injection device which forces a fine, high-pressure jet of fluid through the skin without breaking it\u201d), not only appeared as early as the 1940s, but was in fact a real device that was trademarked in 1948.\n Antedatings may be the sexy, attention-grabbing aspect of lexicography. But the guts of dictionary-making is the writing of definitions, which for science fiction terms carries particular challenges.\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about nonexistent things, the precise way they operate is often hand-waved away\u201d by the writer, he said.\n And then there\u2019s the challenge of defining \u201cscience fiction\u201d itself, as well as related genre terms like \u201cscience fantasy\u201d and \u201cspeculative fiction.\u201d\n The dictionary defines the term science fiction (which it dates to 1911) as referring to \u201ca genre (of fiction, film, etc.) in which the plot or setting features speculative scientific or technological advances or differences.\u201d\n The day before the dictionary went live, Sheidlower was still fiddling with that definition. But he said it was hard to improve on the one offered by the author and critic Damon Knight in 1952: \u201c\u2018Science fiction is what we point at when we say, \u2018This is science fiction.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cIn some ways, that\u2019s the ultimate pass-the-buck thing,\u201d Sheidlower said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s the most accurate definition you could possibly come up with.\u201d",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN) Martha Stewart wants to help pet owners turn dog days into dog daze.\n The lifestyle guru is bringing a new line of CBD dog treats to the market.\n Stewart's CBD for Pet line includes soft-baked chews and oil drops in three different formulas, including wellness, calm and mobility, with flavors such as chicken and cranberry, according to a press release from Stewart's partner, Canopy Growth (CGC).\n The chews range in price from $20 to $25 depending on the size of the dog. The oil sells for  $40 for a 600 mg bottle.\n Stewart announced her CBD product line \u2014 which includes the pet treats \u2014 in September, the result of a partnership with\u00a0Canopy Growth, the Canadian cannabis company backed by multibillion-dollar US alcohol giant\u00a0Constellation Brands (STZ). She joined Canopy as an adviser in early 2019 with the intention of developing cannabis products for humans and pets after being introduced to Canopy's founder by her friend Snoop Dogg. His Leafs by Snoop cannabis brand is produced by Canopy.\n \"Just as CBD can support human wellness, it's been shown to improve the quality of life for pets as well,\" Stewart said in a press release.\n The product packaging features images of Chow Chows and French Bulldogs, a design choice that was inspired by Stewart's own pups.\n Demand for pets has soared during the pandemic, with millions of people working from home and seeking companionship at a time of social distancing.\n Strewart's CBD line joins a long list of other celebrity-connected CBD brands, including Whoopi Goldberg's line, Whoopi & Maya and Willie's Reserve, from Willie Nelson.\n The overall market for pet CBD products was estimated at roughly $426 million in 2020, and is forecast to exceed $1 billion by 2024, according to Brightfield.\n All of the Martha Stewart treats are available starting Tuesday on Canopy Growth's website.\n CNN Business' Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "As one Kardashian relationship sets, another rises: Kourtney Kardashian is reportedly dating Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, multiple outlets reported over the weekend.\n And while we can only imagine that after seeing the news Kardashian\u2019s ex Scott Disick is watching, waiting and quite possibly commiserating with anyone who\u2019s witnessed a former flame move on, the romance between the Poosh princess and the tattooed rocker shouldn\u2019t really come as a surprise.\n The two have actually been longtime friends and neighbors in their gated Calabasas, California, community, and Barker has even appeared on a handful of \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d episodes over the years.\n But Kardashian and Barker have reportedly taken their friendship to the next level after years of raising their families side by side.\n \u201cTravis has liked her for a while. They\u2019ve been dating for about a month or two,\u201d an unnamed source told People. \u201cThey\u2019ve been friends for a long time but it\u2019s turned romantic.\u201d\n \u201cTravis has always had an eye for Kourtney,\u201d a separate source added to E! News. \u201cThe chemistry and flirtation has always been there. They have a lot in common, and Kourtney has always been attracted to how Travis is as a parent. He\u2019s an amazing, hands-on dad, and Kourtney loves that about him. They love relaxing at home with their kids, and everyone gets along. It\u2019s going well, and they aren\u2019t putting pressure on it being super serious at this point.\u201d\n Kardashian and Disick, who split in 2015 after nine years together, share three children: sons Mason, 11, and Reign, 6, as well as 8-year-old daughter Penelope.\n Barker, meanwhile, shares two children with ex-wife Shanna Moakler,\u00a0whom he was married to for four years before officially going their separate ways in 2008.\n Fans have long speculated that Kardashian and Barker were more than friends, as they\u2019ve been spotted out and about together in recent years, but the musician shut down romance rumors back in 2019.\n \u201cKourtney\u2019s like a dear friend. That\u2019s it,\u201d Barker told\u00a0People at the time.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I love her to death. I love her family to death. But yeah, just friends.\u201d\n Over the weekend, Instagram sleuths suspected that something was definitely going down between the two after each shared similar photos from Kris Jenner\u2019s Palm Springs home on their separate social media accounts.\n Barker also has been leaving flirty, but cryptic emojis on Kardashian\u2019s\u00a0 Instagram posts as of late, further sending the rumor mill into overdrive.\n As the future for the newly minted couple unfolds, perhaps we\u2019ll even see it play out on-screen. The musician starred in his own reality series \u201cMeet The Barkers\u201d years before Kardashian and her family conquered the genre.",

        "title": "What Marco Rubio gets wrong about impeachment (it's a lot)",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Marco Rubio isn't a big fan of the House's decision to impeach former President Donald Trump over the incitement of rioters who overran the US Capitol on January 6.\n \"Waste of time impeachment isn't about accountability,\" the Florida Republican senator tweeted on Tuesday morning. \"It's about demands from vengeance from the radical left. And a new 'show' for the 'Political Entertainment Industry.'\"\n Now, it's not clear whether Rubio actually believes that or whether he is simply posturing to appeal to the pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party as he contemplates another fun for president in 2024. (Maybe it's a little of both!)\n But either way, he's wrong.\n Here's the thing: There is a legitimate argument to be made as to whether impeaching a former president is Constitutional. (Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is expected to force a vote later Tuesday about that very thing.) The Constitution is very, very vague on that subject.\n But that's not at all what Rubio is arguing here. He is suggesting that the reason for an impeachment trial next month in the Senate will be because of \"demands from vengeance from the radical left.\"\n Which, well, here's the thing: The reason that the House impeached Trump because he egged on his supporters at a massive rally in Washington earlier this month that eventually led to the violent occupation of the Capitol.\n \"You'll never take back our country with weakness,\" Trump told the crowd on January 6. \"You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.\"\n Trump also used the words \"fight\" and \"fighting\" more than a dozen times in that address. So yeah, message received.\n Rubio must also be unfamiliar with the fact that 10 Republicans -- including Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in House leadership -- voted for the impeachment of Trump. And that even Mitch McConnell, the leader of Senate Republicans, has assiduously avoided taking a position on whether he could see himself voting to convict the former president.\n Does the liberal left loathe Trump? And do they believe the Senate should not only vote to convict him but also ban him from ever running for federal office again? Absolutely! Is that the same thing as suggesting, as Rubio does, that the reason for the impeachment trial is because of a desire for \"vengeance\" from liberals and the media's never-ending desire for drama -- or something? Nope.\n What sits at the heart of the effort to decide what to do with Trump isn't vengeance. It's accountability.\n The question before the Senate is whether it's OK for a sitting president to act the way Trump did on January 6. (It wasn't just what he told the crowd before the Capitol storming; it was his delayed and lukewarm responses amid the violence.)\n The Constitutional vagueness may allow some (many?) Republican senators to sidestep that fundamental question, voting to \"acquit\" because Trump isn't in office anymore and removing him is pointless.\n But what Rubio is doing is simply irresponsible -- and the same sort of rhetoric that hatched the mentality of January 6. This isn't about Democrats or the media. This is about Donald Trump and how a president should act.",

        "title": "Democrats weigh whether they need witnesses to make a visceral case against Trump at impeachment trial",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Facing highly skeptical Republican senators, House impeachment managers are preparing a case to show the visceral evidence of the Capitol insurrection and how former President Donald Trump's words and actions motivated the rioters to breach the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.\n The Senate's 55 to 45 procedural vote Tuesday is not deterring the House from making what they see is a clear case against Trump for his role inciting the insurrectionists. There are still key questions for them to decide before next month's trial: They haven't made a final decision, for instance, on whether they will call witnesses. They're preparing for the possibility they won't have any witnesses -- but they may decide to use them if they find a witness willing to voluntarily step forward, according to sources.\n Even without witnesses, Democrats are considering using evidence from video and social media to help illustrate how Trump's words, actions and tweets motivated the rioters to attack the Capitol, the sources say.\n The House managers are also preparing to make the constitutional argument -- they're led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a former constitutional law professor -- that the Senate can convict a former President, just as it's held trials for other former officials in the past. It's a case that's taken on newfound importance in the wake of the Senate's vote Tuesday that Sen. Rand Paul forced as part of his argument that most of the Republicans think the trial is unconstitutional -- and there simply aren't 17 Republican votes needed for conviction.\n But Senate Democrats say that the case the House managers make can still sway some Republicans, particularly if they can use witnesses who would help corroborate Trump's mindset and actions leading up to the January 6 Capitol riots.\n \"I think that the core of this case is Trump's incendiary and inciting words, the words out of his own mouth,\" Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told reporters. \"But his intent to do harm, to cause injury and maybe even death may come from witnesses who were with him when he was watching the assault on the Capitol. So witnesses can corroborate and powerfully document what we know but they need to prove.\"\n One complicating factor for the House impeachment team is whether potential witnesses would be willing to be called -- particularly those who were in the White House. The House impeachment managers want to avoid any kind of court fight over witnesses like the House had to deal with during the first impeachment of Trump.\n Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said Tuesday it was an open question whether executive privilege would still apply to former White House officials after Trump left office who could be called as potential witnesses. King argued that such testimony could shine light on the President's thinking during the time of the trial.\n \"It will be either witnesses or documents, and what was given in the way of intelligence,\" King said.\n The opening day of Trump's second impeachment trial showed just how high the bar is for House Democrats to get anywhere close to the votes needed for conviction, with just five Republicans voting with Democrats to defeat Paul's procedural motion.\n While not every Republican who voted with Paul said the trial was unconstitutional outright, the 55 to 45 vote was as clear a sign as any that the path to the 67 votes needed to convict Trump and bar him from running again was all but impossible. Paul claimed after the vote it showed the trial was already over before it started.\n Even one of the Republicans who voted with Democrats and is opened to convicting Trump said the writing was on the wall.\n \"Do the math. I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that the President will be convicted,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of the five Republicans to break with Paul.\n Following Tuesday's procedural vote to defeat Paul's point of order that the trial was unconstitutional, the Senate adjourned the impeachment trial until February 9, when arguments will begin.\n Senate Republicans have coalesced in recent days around the argument that the trial is not constitutional, giving them a way to push back on House Democrats' impeachment without condoning Trump's conduct when rioters attacked the Capitol on January 6, breaching the very chamber where the impeachment trial will be held.\n \"I think it showed that impeachment is dead on arrival,\" Paul said of the vote he forced Tuesday. \"If you voted it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?\"\n Democrats argued that Republicans were skirting their responsibility to hold Trump accountable for his behavior by claim the trial was unconstitutional. \"They don't want to be held accountable on that vote so they're going to try to make it another argument that is all about the Constitution,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.\n There were signs ahead of Tuesday's vote that most Senate Republicans would stay united. At their party lunch Tuesday, Senate GOP leaders hosted Jonathan Turley, one of the leading conservative law scholars arguing that the trial is unconstitutional.\n While Turley has argued against holding an impeachment trial for a former president, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote this month that \"most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.\"\n Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has said Trump committed impeachable offenses and voted against Paul on Tuesday, expressed frustration with the vote that occurred before the trial even started -- and with less than a day's notice.\n \"I think it was a little unfortunate that we had this very spontaneous vote on an extraordinarily significant matter without the considered debate and analysis. People had to make really quick decisions,\" Murkowski told reporters Tuesday. \"I'm not saying there's bad faith, but I do think this is significant enough that it deserved greater consideration by this body and I think what you've seen now is people have been forced to take a quick position. Whether or not that changes as we move forward I think remains to be seen.\"\n Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, downplayed the significance of Tuesday's vote, saying that he saw it as only a procedural motion and not a statement of whether the trial was constitutional or not.\n \"I want to hear it debated,\" Portman said. \"I do have questions about the constitutionality, and as a practical matter the precedent, but I want to hear it briefed, and we will hear it.\"\n But Senate GOP leaders remained united with Paul. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has expressed an openness to hearing the impeachment arguments, voted with Paul on Tuesday, in a sign he has questions about the constitutionality of the process. Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership who is up for reelection in 2022, said following the vote he believes the trial is unconstitutional.\n \"I believe the constitutional purpose of impeachment is to remove a president from office, not to punish a person after they have left office,\" Blunt said in a statement. \"No consideration was given to impeach President Nixon when he left office in 1974. The Constitution hasn't changed and the Congress should not set a new, destructive precedent.\"\n Several GOP senators have cited the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding over the trial -- with Senate president pro tempore Pat Leahy of Vermont presiding instead -- as the clearest sign that the trial doesn't pass constitutional muster.\n \"That would send a pretty clear signal to me what Roberts thinks of the whole thing,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.",

        "body_text": "When Jack Carlson wears his mom\u2019s old green Lehman Brothers sweatshirt around New York City, people try to buy it off his back.\n \u201cPeople will just come up to me and offer me money for it in restaurants,\u201d said Mr. Carlson, 33, the founder of the clothing company Rowing Blazers, which sells a contemporary version of the so-called banker bag, a Wall Street accessory that dates to 1978. Branded merchandise of defunct investment banks that were key architects of the financial crisis in 2008: officially hot, if in an arch, allusive way.\n Buying and selling products associated with the crash has become, paradoxically, a thriving niche market. So too has memorabilia associated with other disasters in recent financial history, like the dot-com bubble and the Enron scandal.\n In a Bloomberg article in which financial experts described how they would personally invest or spend $1 million, Akshay Shah, the founder of the investment firm Kyma Capital, said, \u201cWhen businesses go bust, they leave behind reminders of corporate power and the effects of time.\u201d eBay sellers, he noted, have scooped up branded items and then offer them for sale \u201cat a pretty substantial multiple after a suitable passage of time \u2014 like the $500 Lehman sticky notes.\u201d (Sounding a note of caution, Mr. Shah said, \u201cThe key to success here would be volume of products and being patient.\u201d)\n These days, however, there are also more affordable items on hand, a Lehman Brothers-branded baby bib ($59.59 on eBay) and an emergency evacuation kit ($98.99). A Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. certificate dated to 1987 will set you back $295, however \u2014 even though the stock it once represented is worth nothing. And an Enron \u201cConduct of Business Affairs Booklet\u201d is on sale for $395 on the \u201cstock market gifts and collectibles\u201d website Wall Street Treasures.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been selling a lot of Enron memorabilia lately,\u201d said Scott Davidson, 38, an accountant and financial planner who runs Wall Street Treasures, and has been selling finance-related memorabilia through various channels for nine years. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of appetite. Everyone loves a good scandal.\u201d\n Among the current items Mr. Davidson has in stock is a framed promotional piece that displays a \u201cMost Innovative Company\u201d Award that went to Enron four years in a row. It\u2019s now on sale for $1,495. \u201cOf course, the only innovative thing about them was their accounting scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cThe innovation was the fraud.\u201d\n In a disorienting boomerang of value, a once-valuable stock certificate becomes totally worthless, and then, in an afterlife as a collector\u2019s item, becomes more valuable than it was before. Why, one might ask, is anyone buying this stuff? Financial scandals and crises, which left millions impoverished, might seem like odd fodder for office d\u00e9cor or workout sweatshirts.\n \u201cI think it partly has to do with collective identity,\u201d Mr. Davidson said. \u201cSo many people owned a piece of Enron at one time, through their mutual funds. Everyone knew the story.\u201d Personal identity is part of it, too; he often gets contacted by former employees of defunct companies looking for souvenirs of their time there.\n The popularity of these cultural artifacts has led to a whole subgenre of new offshoots and homages, like Rowing Blazers\u2019 banker bag. There are two versions, emblazoned with \u201cDuke&Duke Commodities Brokers\u201d or \u201cPierce&Pierce Mergers and Acquisitions\u201d \u2014 both fictional firms from movies.\n To produce it, Mr. Carlson worked with Warden Brooks, the company founded by Joan Killian Gallagher that made the original canvas bag in 1978, which came to telegraph \u201cNew York finance\u201d in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cIt has been a staple for interns, IB conferences, special events, elite clubs, associations, university and prep school reunions, off-site meetings, corporate programs and incentive groups,\u201d Warden Brooks\u2019s website proclaims.\n The Rowing Blazers version ($135) is one of the company\u2019s most popular items. \u201cThe banker bag is such a polarizing object,\u201d Mr. Carlson said. \u201cFor some people it\u2019s this really important status symbol, and for others it\u2019s kind of a symbol of everything that went wrong.\u201d Rowing Blazers also makes a yellow hat ($48) that reads \u201cFINANCE,\u201d in black letters \u2014 which is, he said, the best-selling object on the site.\n Sometimes people wearing FINANCE hats are simply people who work in finance and think finance is cool, Mr. Carlson said. But perhaps more often it\u2019s an ironic gesture. \u201cThe people who are buying the hat, or the banker bag, are not necessarily people who are idolizing these extinct financial institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost like a sense of appropriation or a sense of empowerment that comes along with it.\u201d (Someone who works in finance did once email Mr. Carlson to accuse him of appropriating financial culture, he said.)\n The popularity of these items has surprised him. \u201cI really did not expect this to take off like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre.\u201d Occasionally Mr. Carlson will sell vintage items, like a knitted Merrill Lynch sweater emblazoned with bulls that went for $300 to $400, but they go out of stock very quickly.\n This buying and selling of finance-adjacent memorabilia is a cousin of scripophily, the collecting of stock certificates: a niche hobby among, mostly, financial professionals and history buffs. Paper stock and bond certificates, which are being phased out of circulation, are often highly decorative. Bob Kerstein, 68, founded scripophily.com, the primary website for buying and selling stock and bond certificates, in 1996. He now has roughly 14,000 of them on the website, ranging from stock certificates for 19th-century mining companies to Ask Jeeves stock issued in 2001, with Jeeves himself on the top.\n \u201cThe financial crisis is one of our biggest sellers right now,\u201d Mr. Kerstein said. \u201cWe have mortgage obligation bonds on our website, and people like those a lot, because that was really the starting point of the Great Recession.\u201d When he first started, he said, collectors were most interested in the older certificates but now, \u201crailroads are deader than a doorknob,\u201d he said. \u201cModern certificates are more popular.\u201d\n Other popular items include Trump-branded stock certificates, and those for defunct dot-com companies. Even the names of companies, like MP3.com and Fashionmall.com, can instantly conjure stories about the overspeculation that happened in the heyday of the early web, when it seemed like almost everyone with a website could find investors.\n \u201cHaving one of these on the wall in your office can be a reminder that in the stock market you can make a lot of money, but you can lose a lot too,\u201d Mr. Kerstein said.\n The idea that objects can impute lessons about the follies of money management is not a new one. William Goetzmann, a professor at the Yale School of Management, is the co-author of the book \u201cThe Great Mirror of Folly: Finance, Culture, and the Crash of 1720,\u201d inspired partly by memorabilia of the first great stock market crash.\n This crash, popularly known as the South Sea Bubble, inspired a range of scrapbooks and satirical drawings that pointed to the absurdities of speculating. Playing cards even emerged out of this crash printed with satirical drawings; people may well have gambled with cards that poked fun at the feverish atmosphere of trading and speculating that led to the crash.\n \u201cSaving the artifacts from stock market crises is about more than just saying, \u2018We want something to remember it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Goetzmann said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having something that you can use ironically or satirically to force yourself to realize that human behavior can lead to these crises.\u201d\n This seems to be part of what\u2019s at work in the obsession with Lehman Brothers and Enron memorabilia \u2014 not just memorializing scandals or crises, but also processing them through irony. Sometimes that means buying and selling in a mode of speculation that mimics the very thing you\u2019re mocking.\n Or, sometimes it\u2019s simpler than that. As Mr. Davidson said, \u201cWhat else are you going to get your financial adviser?\u201d",

        "body_text": "New York  (CNN Business) Rosalind Brewer will be the next CEO of Walgreens \u2014 making her the only Black woman currently slated to take the helm of a Fortune 500 company.\n Brewer is set to begin on March 15, Walgreens said Tuesday. She currently serves as the chief operating officer at Starbucks, and will remain in the role until the end of February. The coffee company announced her departure on Tuesday.\n \"I am excited to work alongside the entire [Walgreens Boots Alliance] team as we deliver further innovation and positively impact the lives of millions of people around the world every day,\" said Brewer in a statement. \"This is especially true today as the company plays a crucial role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n Brewer will succeed Stefano Pessina, who became Walgreens' CEO in 2015. The pharmacy chain announced his decision to step down in July.\n \"It's really great to see her in this position,\" said Lorraine Hariton, president and CEO of Catalyst, a nonprofit research group that keeps track of the number of women serving in leadership positions at large companies.\n Only one other Black woman, Xerox's former CEO Ursula Burns, has ever held the chief executive role at a Fortune 500 company, Hariton said.\n \"We are definitely accelerating the number of women CEOs, period, in the Fortune 500,\" Hariton said. But \"as it relates to Black women, that has been a place that has been lagging,\" she said. \"We still have to work to do to really have a pipeline for women of color.\"\n Before she became COO at Starbucks in 2017, Brewer was the president and CEO of Sam's Club. In that role, she was both the first woman and the first African American to lead a Walmart division.",

        "title": "A judge has approved a $17 million settlement plan for sexual misconduct victims of Harvey Weinstein",
        "body_text": "(CNN) A US bankruptcy judge has approved a Weinstein Company liquidation plan that allocates over $17 million for Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and assault victims, an attorney for the Weinstein Company confirmed to CNN Monday.\n \"It is true that Judge (Mary) Walrath approved the settlement plan at a hearing today,\" Attorney Paul Zumbro said, adding that they are \"pleased with Judge Walrath's ruling, and particularly so given there is now a mechanism that allows victims to receive compensation without having to endure the hardships and uncertainties of litigation.\"\n CNN has reached out to Elizabeth A. Fegan, an attorney for the class action plaintiffs, for comment.\n The Weinstein Company Holdings LLC and 54 affiliate companies previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2018 and were later sold to Lantern Capital, a Dallas-based private equity firm, for $310 million. The company also said at the time that it would release victims of, and witnesses to, Weinstein's alleged misconduct from any nondisclosure agreements.\n The company's $35.2 million liquidation plan allocates $17,064,525.30 for the establishment of a \"Sexual Misconduct Claims Fund\" and a liquidation trust for the payment of sexual misconduct claims, according to court documents.\n The approved plan also provides $9.7 million for legal costs, none of which provide any reimbursement for any defense costs and expenses incurred by Harvey Weinstein. An additional $8.4 million will be allocated to a liquidation trust to settle claims unrelated to sexual misconduct, the documents state.\n Harvey Weinstein, the company's former chief executive, was sentenced to 23 years in prison in March 2020 on charges of criminal sexual act and rape. He still faces six more sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.\n After new charges were lodged in October, his spokeswoman said, \"Harvey Weinstein has always maintained that every one of his physical encounters throughout his entire life have been consensual. That hasn't changed.\"",

        "title": "How Oregon just proved Donald Trump isn't going anywhere",
        "body_text": "(CNN) On Monday night, the Oregon Republican Party issued a formal condemnation of the 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.\n Here's a sampling of actual lines from the Oregon GOP's, uh, proclamation.\n * Whereas history tells us that after George Washington appointed Major General Benedict Arnold to command West Point, Arnold conspired to surrender the fort to the British.\"\n * \"Whereas the ten Republican House members, by voting to impeach President Trump, repeated history by conspiring to surrender our nation to Leftist forces seeking to establish a dictatorship void of all cherished freedoms and liberties.\"\n * \"Whereas there is growing evidence that the violence at the Capitol was a 'false flag' operation designed to discredit President Trump, his supporters, and all conservative Republicans; this provided the sham motivation to impeach President Trump in order to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power, in a frightening parallel to the February 1933 burning of the German Reichstag.\"\n OK, OK, OK.\n So, just so we are clear here, the Oregon Republican Party is saying that in voting to impeach Trump, these 10 Republicans are the equivalent to the burning of the German seat of government that led to Adolf Hitler's seizure of absolute power? Or that they are in the same boat as legendary traitor Benedict Arnold who conspired to sell out America during the Revolutionary War?\n Oh, and also that the January 6 riot at the Capitol was also a \"false flag\" operation organized by anti-Trump forces designed \"to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power.\" (Worth noting: The claim that the Nazis purposely started the Reichstag fire is still up for debate.)\n Uh ... this is crazy.\n And yet, it's not an isolated incident.\n In recent days, the Arizona Republican Party has reelected Kelli Ward as its chair -- a woman who has repeatedly insisted that the 2020 election was stolen and that Republicans in Congress should have sought to overturn the results. And the state party censured its own governor -- Doug Ducey -- as well as Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, and former Sen. Jeff Flake.\n Those moves follow this tweet from the Arizona GOP's official account on January 1:\n \"As the sun sets on 2020, remember that we're never going back to the party of Romney, Flake, and McCain. The Republican Party is now, and forever will be, one for the working man and woman! God bless.\"\n Taken together, what the moves in Arizona and Oregon -- not to mention the Arkansas gubernatorial candidacy of former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and the attempts to oust Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership for her impeachment vote -- suggest that attempts by the likes of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky) and other prominent establishment Republicans to rid the GOP of the memory (and influence) of the 45th president are very likely to fail.\n As CNN's Michael Warren wrote Tuesday in a piece about the ongoing civil war within the GOP:\n \"Some in congressional leadership have signaled their desire to move the party beyond Trump by impeaching and convicting him. Allies of the former President, on the other hand, are proclaiming their loyalty to him in conservative media and in state and local party organizations. Still other Republicans remain fearful of the power Trump may yet wield in GOP primaries or see electoral possibilities in embracing a version of his populist-conservative approach.\n \"The result is a Republican Party in a fight with itself over who will determine its path forward -- and, more crucially, who should be kept from the levers of power in the GOP. For the moment, party unity is giving way to recriminations, a culmination of the longstanding dispute between the party's grassroots and its leadership class that was mostly put on hold during Trump's presidency, when few Republicans dared to cross him.\"\n As North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer (R), an ardent defender of the former president who did not vote to object to the Electoral College results on January 6, put it in an interview with CNN's Lauren Fox: \"There are a lot of Republicans who would like my head. I haven't been loyal enough.\"\n Add it all up and you get this: The GOP isn't at the end of this war for its future. It's at the very beginning, And it is going to get very, very ugly.\n CNN's Allison Gordon contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) The Justice Department formally rescinded the Trump administration's controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy that called for the criminal prosecution of adults crossing the border and led to the separation of thousands of families, according to a memo obtained by CNN.\n The policy was ended by former President Donald Trump in June 2018 after mounting criticism, but on Tuesday, the department moved to rescind it altogether.\n \"Consistent with this longstanding principle of making individualized assessments in criminal cases, I am rescinding -- effective immediately -- the policy directive,\" acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson said in a memo to federal prosecutors.\n \"While policies may change, our mission always remains the same: to seek justice under the law,\" Wilkinson added.\n The Associated Press first reported on the memo.\n RELATED: Biden wasting no time naming officials to reverse Trump's immigration policies\n Lawyers are still unable to reach the parents of 611 children who had been split from their families by US border officials between 2017 and 2018, according to the latest court filing.\n \"This action is a good start, but what is really needed is for Congress to repeal penalties for unauthorized entry that result in family separation,\" said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the family separation lawsuit.\n \"And the end of the zero-tolerance policy does not impact already separated families. The Biden administration should reunite the separated families in the United States and provide them citizenship, resources, care, and a commitment that family separation will never happen again.\"\n President Joe Biden has pledged to undo Trump's policies and on Friday is expected to announce a task force that will focus on reuniting separated families.\n In a statement to CNN, a Justice Department spokeswoman called the \"zero tolerance\" policy \"inconsistent with the Department's longstanding principle that we exercise judgment and make individualized assessments in criminal cases.\"\n \"Today's action restores to prosecutors their traditional discretion to make charging decisions based on a careful review of the particular facts and circumstances of individual immigration cases,\" the spokeswoman said.\n The policy had long-term ramifications for the thousands of families it affected.\n Since the policy ended, a series of government watchdog reports have detailed the disarray within agencies when the policy was implemented, the lack of planning, and trauma it inflicted on the children separated from their parents.\n Earlier this month, the Justice Department's inspector general revealed that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions knew early on migrant families would be separated when the Trump administration implemented the policy and proceeded with it anyway.\n READ: Justice Department IG report on family separations\n \"[T]he Department's single-minded focus on increasing prosecutions came at the expense of careful and appropriate consideration of the impact that prosecution of family unit adults and family separations would have on children traveling with them and the government's ability to later reunite the children with their parents,\" the IG report stated.\n This story has been updated with additional details of the zero tolerance policy.",

        "title": "Biden Signs Executive Order Bolstering \u2018Buy American\u2019 Provisions",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden signed an executive order on Monday aimed at strengthening \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions that encourage the federal government to purchase goods and services from U.S. companies, a move that labor unions and manufacturing supporters cheered but that some critics said could raise costs for the federal government.\n Mr. Biden, speaking at the White House, cast the move as a first step in what he and his administration have promised will be an aggressive push to steer more federal dollars to American suppliers and to rebuild domestic manufacturing in industries that have dwindled in recent decades.\n The order \u2014 and the push to bolster American manufacturing \u2014 mirrors several Buy American directives issued by Mr. Biden\u2019s predecessor in the White House, Donald J. Trump. But Mr. Biden and his allies tried to distinguish his efforts from what they called the failed policies of the Trump administration.\n \u201cThe previous administration did not take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all,\u201d Mr. Biden said before signing the order. \u201cThat is going to change on our watch.\u201d\n Supporters of Mr. Biden\u2019s order said it would strengthen Buy American requirements far more than Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts had, particularly when coupled with another order Mr. Biden issued last week to invoke the Defense Production Act to speed the production of coronavirus tests, personal protective equipment and other tools to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\n But they also said the president\u2019s unilateral actions were far less important for bolstering domestic manufacturing than the Buy American rules his administration has promised to include in an infrastructure proposal next month, which is expected to include trillions of dollars in new federal spending.\n Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts on P.P.E. and Buy American, \u201ccoupled with the Defense Production Act, it all works together\u201d to help rebuild domestic supply chains, said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. The infrastructure proposal, Mr. Brown said, \u201cis the biggest thing of all.\u201d\n Existing law already requires the government to contract with American companies when possible, but there are many exceptions and waiver opportunities that for years have frustrated advocates for small and medium-size businesses.\n Previous administrations, including Mr. Trump\u2019s, have tried to clamp down on the process in the hopes of directing more federal dollars toward an American work force that sometimes struggles to compete with cheap goods and services imported from abroad. Mr. Trump issued several Buy American orders, as recently this month, before he left office. That order is now paused under a regulatory freeze Mr. Biden issued last week.\n Some economists and budget policy experts oppose Buy American requirements, saying they raise costs for the federal government and reduce the availability of products it can buy, sometimes causing delays in procurement projects, because in many cases there is not sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to supply what the government needs.\n Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Monday that Mr. Biden\u2019s order was unlikely to do much to help domestic manufacturers produce more and create jobs.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a legal reality they\u2019re going to run into, as the Trump administration did,\u201d Mr. Lincicome said. \u201cThere\u2019s also an economic reality. There\u2019s only so much global supply chains are going to allow.\u201d\n Mr. Biden said on Monday that his order would go further than previous efforts by reducing opportunities for waivers from the Buy American requirements and by tightening standards that would result in fewer federal contracts being awarded to overseas companies.\n His aides acknowledged that the changes would take time. Mr. Biden\u2019s executive order will direct agencies to re-evaluate the current Buy American procedures and will set a deadline by which they are required to report their findings back to the White House for consideration.\n Mr. Biden also said he would create a position at the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to oversee the revisions to the requirements, in order to add more accountability to the waiver process.\n The order will also require a review of that process. And it calls on the government to examine the way in which a company\u2019s \u201cdomestic content\u201d is measured in the hopes of closing loopholes that companies use to claim that their goods and services are made in America.\n \u201cIf an agency wants to issue a waiver saying we are not going to buy an American product, we are going to buy a foreign product, they have to come to the White House and explain it to us,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe are going to require waivers be publicly posted. If someone is building a particular vehicle or facility and they are going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver, the request is going to be posted. Then we will work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, \u2018I can do that here in my shop in my town.\u2019\u201d\n Democratic senators from the industrial Midwest, including Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Mr. Brown, have pushed Mr. Biden to act swiftly to reduce the number of waivers and increase transparency in the waiver process. They praised his order on Monday and said it was a contrast with Mr. Trump.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to make a very significant difference, in my mind,\u201d Ms. Baldwin, a longtime proponent of Buy American provisions, said in an interview.\n Unlike Mr. Trump, she said, Mr. Biden was \u201cfollowing up the talk with action.\u201d\n Union leaders also celebrated the move. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the order would lift the economy. Rory L. Gamble, the president of the United Auto Workers, said it \u201ccommits the vast power of the U.S. government to U.S.-citizen-made products.\u201d",

        "title": "White people are getting vaccinated at higher rates than Black and Latino Americans",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Black and Latino Americans are receiving the Covid-19 vaccine at significantly lower rates than White people -- a disparity that health advocates blame on the federal government and hospitals not prioritizing equitable access.\n A CNN analysis of data from 14 states found vaccine coverage is twice as high among White people on average than it is among Black and Latino people. The analysis found that on average, more than 4% of the White population has received a Covid-19 vaccine, about 2.3 times higher than the Black population (1.9% covered) and 2.6 times higher than the Hispanic population (1.8% covered).\n CNN's findings come as the government struggles with vaccine supply shortages and a chaotic rollout that has caused delays in vaccinating the elderly.  The federal government has recommended that states open up vaccination to more groups of people, including everyone 65 and older. Initial guidance from the CDC had suggested health care workers and elderly in long-term facilities be the first to receive the vaccine.\n Health experts and advocates say the federal government can help alleviate the disparities by strengthening partnerships with leaders and churches in Black and Latino communities -- and be intentional about not leaving people of color out of vaccination efforts.\n Hospitals, for example, must ensure their entire workforce, including the food and maintenance staff, receive all correspondence about signing up to get the vaccine, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n Black, Latino and Asian Americans make up 41% of health care workers while 59% are White, according to Kaiser. And the majority of workers in long-term health care settings, 52%, are people of color.\n Benjamin said the vaccine also needs to be administered outside of traditional hours so people who work hourly, frontline jobs don't have to take off work. Communities, he said, should consider a plan for transporting poor families without vehicles to health facilities to get the vaccine.\n \"You have to say, 'I want to make sure everyone gets this,'\" Benjamin said. \"We have to make sure we think about all the ways that people can give in (to getting vaccinated) and we have to make sure we have vaccine available for them when they call in.\"\n Some researchers said it was alarming to have disparities so early in the process when most of the people getting vaccinated are health care workers.\n Dr. Fola May, a health equity researcher at the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity, said she would expect health care workers to be the most informed and the least hesitant about science.\n May fears this could be indicative of bigger racial gaps when the vaccine becomes widely available.\n \"I think we've botched this,\" May said. \"If we're seeing it in this population that should have the least biases against science, then when we look into the bigger populations we're going to have even fewer people who have the right information and access.\"\n In many states, the number of White people who have been vaccinated exceeds the Covid-19 case count for their racial group, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Meanwhile, Black and Latino people have fewer vaccinations than their case and death counts in some of those same states.\n For example, in Pennsylvania Black people make up 13% of Covid-19 deaths but only 3% of vaccinations.\n Pennsylvania also has the most striking disparity: White people have been vaccinated at four times the rate of Black people when accounting for the population of each racial group, the CNN analysis found.\n Andrea Custis, president and CEO of the Urban League of Philadelphia, said the vaccine data in Pennsylvania raises a \"warning flag\" about racial inequality and the federal government should address it with urgency.\n Custis said she believes the Black community is becoming less hesitant about the vaccine after seeing other Black Americans receive the shot and administer it. Last month, a Kaiser study found that more than a third of Black Americans would probably or definitely not get the vaccine if it was determined to be safe by scientists and widely available for free.\n But Custis said if the federal government allows \"trust messengers\" to help roll out the vaccine and educate the public, Black people will get the shot.\n \"The ones who are dying, the ones who need it are Black folks,\" Custis said. \"Everybody needs it, but you've got a fire going in the Black community and you need to be running to the community to vaccinate them.\"\n Black pastors and community advocates are also urging President Joe Biden's administration to act swiftly in its promise to reach communities of color with the vaccine and lean on them for help doing it.\n \"I think the biggest problem we have with the vaccine is the distribution methods and the availability,\" said Debra Fraser-Howze, founder of Choose Healthy Life -- a national group of Black pastors who are fighting the pandemic's impact on the Black community. \"All of the real estate in the community should be used.\"\n Fraser-Howze said former President Donald Trump's administration failed to partner with Black churches and trusted leaders that could help administer the vaccine and reach the people of color who qualify for the first phases but are hesitant or don't know where to get the shot. She said she is confident Choose Health Life and other Black advocacy groups could help boost the number of Black people getting vaccinated.\n Biden and his administration have released details of an ambitious national vaccination strategy with the hopes of combating concerns with vaccine access and hesitancy among people of color.\n Biden's five-point plan includes putting federally supported vaccination centers in high-risk neighborhoods, setting up mobile vaccination sites in medically underserved areas, administering the vaccine at independent pharmacies, partnering with community health centers and ensuring high risk facilities such as jails and homeless shelters have access to the vaccine.\n \"We are going to make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, in Black and Latino communities and rural communities as well,\" Biden said.\n CNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn and Priya Krishnakumar, contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Apollo C.E.O. to Step Down After Firm Finds More Payments to Jeffrey Epstein",
        "body_text": "The founders of Apollo Global Management, one of the world\u2019s biggest private equity firms, engaged in a brief power struggle this weekend over control of the firm, a rift that opened up after an inquiry revealed that one founder \u2014 Apollo\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Leon Black \u2014 had paid more than $150 million to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n On Monday, Mr. Black announced his plan to step down as chief executive this year. \u201cI have advised the Apollo board that I will retire as C.E.O. on or before my 70th birthday in July and remain as chairman,\u201d he said in a statement.\n The review \u2014 ordered by the firm\u2019s board at Mr. Black\u2019s behest in October, after The New York Times detailed at least $75 million in payments \u2014 found that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein $158 million in a five-year period ending in 2017. He had also lent Mr. Epstein more than $30 million, only $10 million of which was paid back, the report found.\n Mr. Black\u2019s payments effectively bankrolled the lifestyle of Mr. Epstein \u2014 whom Mr. Black viewed as a \u201cconfirmed bachelor with eclectic tastes,\u201d according to the report \u2014 in the years after his 2008 guilty plea in Florida to a prostitution charge involving a teenage girl.\n Also, Mr. Black believed that Mr. Epstein had \u201cserved his time\u201d for that case and deserved a second chance, the report said. It found there was no evidence that Mr. Black had participated in any of Mr. Epstein\u2019s criminal activities, or that Mr. Epstein had ever introduced Mr. Black to any underage girl.\n The details of their financial dealings \u2014 Mr. Epstein\u2019s advice was worth perhaps $2 billion in tax savings to Mr. Black, according to the report \u2014 created friction between Mr. Black and one of Apollo\u2019s other founders, Joshua Harris, according to three people briefed on the discussions. In recent months, Apollo investors had begun openly questioning the financial ties between Mr. Black and Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019. One of the people said Mr. Harris believed that Mr. Black showed poor judgment in consorting with Mr. Epstein, and that the new findings would further hurt Apollo\u2019s reputation.\n Apollo\u2019s board held a videoconference on Sunday to approve the findings of the review, according to two people briefed on the discussions. At the meeting, Mr. Black also announced his plans to step down this year and hand over the chief executive job to Marc Rowan, Apollo\u2019s third founder. Mr. Black intends to remain chairman of the New York firm, which manages $455 billion for institutional investors, including pension plans and sovereign wealth funds.\n During a series of meetings on Sunday evening, including with individual board members, Mr. Harris raised objections to Mr. Black\u2019s timeline for stepping down, believing that the reputational threat was so serious that Mr. Black should relinquish the chief executive role without delay, the people said. Mr. Harris also made his case to his co-founders that night in discussions with Apollo\u2019s executive committee \u2014 which consists of the three of them.\n In the end, Mr. Harris\u2019s objection fell on deaf ears, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n Mr. Rowan, who built Apollo\u2019s insurance business but had largely stepped away from the firm\u2019s day-to-day operations in recent years, will take over when Mr. Black steps down.\n Mr. Black informed Apollo\u2019s clients of the succession plan and the findings of the review in a letter on Monday evening.\n Mr. Harris will continue in his current role as a senior managing director, focused on the firm\u2019s financial performance and working closely with Mr. Rowan, according to the letter, the contents of which were reviewed by The Times. The letter also informed clients of other proposed governance changes, including adding four more independent directors. It also laid out Mr. Black\u2019s plan to donate $200 million to charities that support gender equality and fight sex trafficking.\n The review, conducted by the law firm Dechert, began after The Times reported that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein at least $75 million in the years after his 2008 case in Florida. Mr. Epstein killed himself inside a Manhattan jail cell while facing federal sex-trafficking charges, which were filed amid widespread scrutiny of the plea deal he had reached a decade earlier.\n Dechert\u2019s review found that Mr. Epstein had provided \u201clegitimate advice\u201d on trust and estate planning, tax issues and matters related to Mr. Black\u2019s extensive art collection, and other subjects.\n Dechert said the value of the tax savings to Mr. Black was at least $1 billion and possibly as much as $2 billion. Though at the same time, the law firm noted, Mr. Epstein also \u201cwould seek to take credit for good ideas, regardless of his level of involvement, which likely was intended to bolster his perceived value to Black.\u201d\n The relationship began to deteriorate in 2016, the report said, amid a payment dispute over tens of millions of dollars in fees. The two men did not communicate after 2018, according to the review.\n Mr. Epstein did not invest in any Apollo-managed funds, according to the report, but it found that his companies had bought more than 200,000 shares in the private equity firm\u2019s initial public offering and held that stake until at least September 2019 \u2014 a month after Mr. Epstein died.\n Many of Apollo\u2019s biggest clients \u2014 including major pension funds, charitable foundations and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 had been awaiting the results of the report.\n The $63 billion Pennsylvania Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement System had said it would not invest any additional money with Apollo until the review was complete. CalPERS \u2014 the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, one of Apollo\u2019s biggest clients \u2014 had said it expected its outside investment managers to follow the fund\u2019s own values. Other pension funds \u2014 in Texas, Illinois and Ontario \u2014 also said they would be watching the investigation closely.\n In his three-page letter to investors on Monday, Mr. Black acknowledged that \u201cheightened media scrutiny of Apollo has generated unwelcome attention\u201d for those investors. \u201cI personally regret any distraction that may have caused,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Black said Apollo had hired a law firm, WilmerHale, to look into its reputational risk management practices and suggest improvements.\n Apollo grew out of the ashes of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank that collapsed in 1990 amid a trading investigation that sent the since-pardoned Michael Milken to prison.\n Although Mr. Black started Apollo with his younger partners \u2014 Mr. Harris is 56 and Mr. Rowan 58 \u2014 he has been long been the face and voice of the firm.\n In building Apollo into a global financial powerhouse, Mr. Black has made himself and his co-founders immensely rich: His personal fortune is estimated at more than $8 billion, and he owns a massive private art collection \u2014 including a version of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d \u2014 and is the chairman of the Museum of Modern Art.\n But when Apollo held its most recent earnings call in late October, there were already signs his dealings with Mr. Epstein were causing ripples, both in the firm and among investors. In an unusual move, Mr. Black read a brief statement about the Epstein matter before handing over the meeting to Mr. Harris and Mr. Rowan.\n Apollo has long specialized in buying up distressed companies and retooling them, but it also boasts large credit, infrastructure and real estate businesses. Mr. Rowan was the driving force behind Apollo\u2019s thriving insurance business and its insurance subsidiary, Athene Holding, which has fueled the Wall Street\u2019s firm earnings in recent years.\n At one time, both Mr. Rowan and Mr. Harris were seen as the heirs apparent to Mr. Black. But with Mr. Rowan\u2019s decision to pull back from day-to-day affairs, many on Wall Street assumed the job would fall to Mr. Harris, who has the run the nuts and bolts of Apollo\u2019s vast buyout operation.\n Mr. Harris, who is an owner of the Philadelphia 76rs basketball team and the New Jersey Devils hockey team, said he would \u201cfully support\u201d Mr. Rowan as chief executive. \u201cI will focus on expanding our global search for investor returns, which is at the core of our success,\u201d he said in a statement.\n As the only three members of Apollo\u2019s executive committee, the founders hold considerable sway over the company. As of now, the decision to name Mr. Rowan as Mr. Black\u2019s successor does not need approval of the company\u2019s board. And all three men \u2014 who have much of their net worth tied up in the company \u2014 have a vested interest in the stability of the firm.",

        "title": "Business exec and his wife charged after flying into remote Canadian town to get Covid-19 vaccine, officials say",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The former president and CEO of the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation and his wife are facing charges -- including failure to self-isolate -- after allegedly chartering a plane to a small town in western Canada and posing as local workers to receive the coronavirus vaccine.\n Rodney and Ekaterina Baker have been charged under Yukon's Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA), according to court documents.\n Yukon Community Services Minister John Streicker said the couple showed up at a mobile clinic last Thursday in Beaver Creek, home to an indigenous community.\n One of them presented a British Columbia health care card, the other had one from Ontario, Streicker said in a statement.\n The Bakers weren't charged for getting the vaccine. Rather, they were accused of not following quarantine requirements after arriving in the Canadian territory.\n According to a charging document, the Bakers are from Vancouver, British Columbia, southeast of the Yukon territory.\n \"I am outraged by this selfish behaviour, and find it disturbing that people would choose to put fellow Canadians at risk in this manner,\" Streicker said. \"Reports allege these individuals were deceptive and violated emergency measures for their own advantage, which is completely unacceptable at any time, but especially during a public health crisis.\"\n CNN was unable Tuesday to reach the Bakers for comment.\n Indigenous communities are one of the groups given priority for Covid-19 vaccinations, according to Canada's vaccine guidance. They are often also disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus because they can be in areas where health care access is limited.\n Beaver Creek, the westernmost community in Canada, is the home of the White River First Nation. It is just a few miles from the Alaska border.\n The Bakers allegedly chartered a plane from the city of Whitehorse in Yukon to Beaver Creek, which has about 125 residents, and claimed they were employees at a local motel, Streicker told CNN news partner CBC.\n The Bakers arrived in Yukon from Vancouver on January 19 and were supposed to be self-isolating for 14 days in Whitehorse, according to officials. According to a complaint made to law enforcement, they traveled to Beaver Creek on January 21. The travel was not allowed because of quarantine requirements, officials said.\n After getting their shots, the couple raised suspicions in the community by asking for a ride to the airport, Streicker told CNN news partner CBC.\n \"And people were like, 'Well, why would you be going to the airport?' \" Streicker said.\n Following an investigation, the couple was located at the Whitehorse airport, and Yukon officials told CNN the couple left the territory that same day.\n Members of the mobile clinic team called the motel and were informed the couple did not work there,  Streicker told CBC.\n CNN reached out to Streicker for comment on Tuesday but did not hear back.\n As for getting the vaccines, according to Streicker, the British Columbia and Ontario health cards wouldn't have necessarily prevented the Bakers from getting them, as there are many out-of-territory workers in the region.\n Rodney, 55, and Ekaterina Baker, 32, were each charged with failure to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry into the territory and failure to behave in a manner consistent with the declaration provided upon entry into the territory.\n Charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) may include fines up to $500; up to 6 months in prison; or both, according to Yukon's Covid-19 orders and directions. The Bakers were each levied a $500 fine and $75 surcharge on both counts.\n The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were alerted to the situation. The RCMP's Yukon office said Tuesday it is investigating; it would not reply to CNN questions.\n The Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, a hotel and casino company with 25 Canadian properties, told CNN that while it didn't comment on personnel matters relating to former employees, effective January 24, Rodney Baker was no longer the president and CEO of Great Canadian and is \"no longer affiliated in any way with the company.\"\n \"As a company, Great Canadian takes health and safety protocols extremely seriously, and our company strictly follows all directives and guidance issued by public health authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate,\" the statement added.\n The White River First Nation said it \"is particularly concerned with the callous nature of these actions taken by the individuals, as they were a blatant disregard for the rules in which keep our community safe during this unprecedented global pandemic.\"\n CNN's Paula Newton and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Brazil's Health Minister under investigation over health crisis in Amazonas",
        "body_text": "Sao Paulo (CNN) A Brazilian court has approved an investigation into Heath Minister Eduardo Pazuello's handling of the Covid-19 crisis, after oxygen shortages collapsed the health system of Manaus, capital city of Amazonas state, last week.\n Federal Supreme Court Judge Ricardo Lewandowski greenlit the investigation on Monday. Pazuello now has five days to provide testimony to the federal police.\n It is alleged that the Ministry of Health was alerted to the city's looming shortages of oxygen -- often critical for treating severe cases of Covid-19 -- on January 8, but only took action on January 12, according to a request for a probe sent to the Attorney General's Office (PGR) by the political party Cidadania.\n Pazuello himself visited Manaus on January 11, and the federal government subsequently sent supplemental oxygen to the city, but neither were enough to prevent a crisis. Hospitals in Amazonas soon ran out of oxygen, and on January 14 and 15 at least 29 patients died due to the shortages, according to an ongoing investigation.\n \"The reality is that there's a lower supply of oxygen,\" Pazuello acknowledged later. \"Not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen.\"\n Pazuello and other top federal officials have defended the government's reaction to warnings of a crisis in Manaus, arguing that no one could have predicted the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases that strained hospitals.\n \"This was a situation completely unknown to everyone. It was too fast,\" Pazuello told a press conference on Tuesday.\n He added that the city's health crisis was compounded by a number of issues including \"oxygen problems, lack of professionals, low number of beds.\"\n A separate report by Brazil's Solicitor General has also alleged that during Pazuello's trip to Manaus, he encouraged medical professionals to adopt an \"early treatment\" kit against Covid-19 that includes unproven drugs including hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. The health minister has since denied doing this.\n House of Representatives President Rodrigo Maia told a Monday press conference that he believed Pazuello had \"committed a crime\" not only by letting the state's health system collapse, but by promoting ineffective treatments for the city's surging Covid-19 cases and by failing to obtain vaccines for the country earlier.\n The growing criticism of Pazuello's pandemic response in Manaus follows a recent investigation by CNN Brazil, which found that top executive Abert Bourla sent a letter to the Brazilian government in September offering 70 million doses of its vaccine, which was co-developed with German pharmaceutical company BioNTech.\n But Pfizer received no response from the government, according to CNN Brazil.\n He also said that certain conditions of the sale were unacceptable to the Brazilian government -- including a payment guarantee and an agreement that contractual issues be tried in a US court -- and accused the drugmaker of \"creating embarrassing situations for the Brazilian Government, which will not accept market impositions -- which will also not be accepted by Brazilians.\"\n Brazil began its vaccination campaign last Saturday, but the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro has faced mounting criticism for its mishandling of the pandemic.\n Since the pandemic began, the country ratcheted more than 8.8 million infections and the second highest number of deaths in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) California is revamping its coronavirus vaccine delivery system amid criticism over the slow and inefficient rollout of doses, the California Department of Public Health announced Tuesday.\n The new system aims to simplify eligibility, standardize information and data, and address the available supply of doses by streamlining the process, the department said.\n California has been hit hard by the pandemic.\n \"While vaccines remain extremely limited, the goal is to build a system to equitably and efficiently administer vaccines when supply increases,\" officials said in a statement.\n Thus far, 2.6 million doses have been administered in the state, which has a population of about 39 million.\n The announcement comes a day after the state lifted its regional stay-home orders, saying that four-week projections of the need for intensive care unit beds in hard-hit areas show enough capacity to exit the order.\n It also comes amid an effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom by political opponents who criticized the strict stay-home orders.\n Send us your questions for President Biden's Covid-19 team\n Starting next month, all Californians in Phase 1B Tier 1 will be able to make an appointment to receive the vaccine under a standardized system. This includes health care workers, residents over 65 years old, and workers in education, child care, emergency services and food and agriculture sectors.\n Instead of counties and hospitals running their own vaccination delivery systems, the state will use a third-party administrator to allocate vaccines directly to providers to maximize distribution efficiency, they said.\n Officials said the third-party administrator has not been selected.\n \"The vaccine provider network is expected to include public health systems, pharmacies, health systems, public hospitals, community health centers, pharmacies and pop-up and mobile sites,\" officials said.\n The new system will continue to focus on equity, and the state plans to make sure low-income neighborhoods and communities of colors will have access to the vaccine, officials said.\n In addition, \"providers will be compensated in part by how well they are able to reach underserved communities,\" state health officials said.\n \"We have learned that to accelerate pace we need to dial up the scale of our efforts to ensure vaccine supply goes into arms as quickly as it arrives in the state,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n The state is also launching a website called \"My Turn,\" through which residents can get notified once they are eligible for the vaccine.\n It will also track vaccination data and automatically report information into state data systems. Health officials hope this will reduce data lags and provide real-time information on the vaccination process.\n The overall vaccine supply into California will continue to be dictated by the federal government, state health officials noted.\n Last week, state epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said that it may take four to five months to get all California residents 65 years of age and older vaccinated at the current rate the state is receiving its doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Newsom on Monday said the state has tripled its rate of administration of the vaccine.\n More than 3.2 million people in the state have contracted the virus, and hospitals, especially in Southern California, have been overwhelmed. In that area, ICU capacity remains at 0%.\n CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Fauci Puts A Stop To Rehashing Trump History As Fox News Host Presses Questions",
        "body_text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, drew the line on Tuesday after Fox News\u2019 Bill Hemmer pressed him about his tone toward former President Donald Trump in recent interviews.\n During the appearance on Fox News, co-host Dana Perino asked Fauci about a New York Times interview in which he discussed at length his relationship with the former president, who routinely questioned science and data and often spoke negatively of Fauci despite his leading role on the White House coronavirus task force.\n \u201cI know that those questions are irresistible for reporters to ask,\u201d Perino said. \u201cBut is there a law of diminishing returns to continue to answer questions about that relationship if the [COVID-19] crisis is as acute as you say?\u201d\n \u201cI agree with you, Dana,\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cAfter that interview, I said to myself, we\u2019ve really got to look forward and ahead and just put that behind us. I totally agree with you. So looking forward, I\u2019m really not enthusiastic at all about reexamining what happened back then rather than looking forward to what we need to do now.\u201d\n Hemmer chimed in, mentioning that he had heard many interviews with Fauci over the weekend.\n \u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s this aggressiveness toward the Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re the most respected man in America on this topic. Why do you even feel the obligation to answer these questions?\u201d\n \u201cAnd by the way, when you were at the White House, no one prevented you from talking, did they?\u201d he added.\n \u201cNo, that\u2019s why I got into trouble,\u201d Fauci said.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hemmer pressed.\n \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t happy about some of the things that I said,\u201d Fauci said. He had mentioned during his conversation with The Times that Trump and members of his inner circle were very displeased that he would contradict the president.\n \u201cAnd here again, we\u2019re getting into rehashing it again,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we should do what Dana just suggested. Namely, put that behind us and take a look at the problems we have ahead.\u201d\n Hemmer replied: \u201cAt 9:37 on this Tuesday morning, January 26th, we will mark this moment, doctor.

        "body_text": "Peter Dunn, president of CBS television stations, and David Friend, senior vice president of news for television stations, \"have been placed on administrative leave, pending the results of a third-party investigation into issues that include those raised in a recent\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0report,\" CBS said in a statement shared with CNN Business.\n \"CBS is committed to a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace where all voices are heard, claims are investigated and appropriate action is taken where necessary,\" the statement continued. The company declined to elaborate on the specific allegations.\n On Sunday, The Times published an investigation led by media reporter Meg James into the culture at CBS' TV stations. Dunn has managed CBS' 28 TV stations, which together employ 2,800 workers, since 2009, according to the article.\n The Times' investigation included allegations that Dunn disparaged female and Black employees. Friend, who works closely with Dunn, allegedly took part in the conduct and was also accused of verbal abuse, according to The Times' report.\n \"These comments I may have made about our employees or prospective hires were only based on performance or qualifications \u2014 not about anyone's race or gender,\" he said in the statement. Dunn declined to comment to The Times on the allegations.\n CBS has been no stranger to scandal in recent years. CBS chief executive Les Moonves left the company in 2018 amid a number of allegations of sexual misconduct made against him. Moonves admitted to consensual relations with three of the women named in a New Yorker investigation but he insisted that never abused his power and said he can only surmise that the allegations \"are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation and my career.\"\n The Times reported that CBS hired two law firms to look into the sexual misconduct claims, but some staffers had concerns that the investigators fixated on Moonves and didn't pay enough attention to other alleged abuses at the TV stations. CBS told The Times, \"In response to a CBS investigation in early 2019, senior management at the time addressed the situation with Mr. Dunn, and the company has not received any complaints about his conduct during the period since then.\"\n The National Association of Black Journalists met with ViacomCBS executives on Sunday to discuss the allegations.\n \"It is clear that there is a massive problem among CBS owned-and-operated stations, and in order for the company's culture to be transformed, it must begin with the firing of Dunn and Friend,\" NABJ said in a statement.",

        "title": "The High-Risk Group Left Out of New York\u2019s Vaccine Rollout",
        "body_text": "When New York announced new vaccine eligibility guidelines two weeks ago covering millions of additional state residents, one particularly hard-hit group remained unmentioned: the nearly 50,000 people incarcerated in the state\u2019s prisons and jails.\n Now, with state supplies dwindling and no clear plan for vaccinating incarcerated people, the virus that tore through the state\u2019s correctional facilities in the spring is roaring back behind bars. At least 5,100 people living and working in New York\u2019s prisons have tested positive and 12 have died in recent weeks, outpacing even the early days of the pandemic.\n But how and when to vaccinate incarcerated people as millions around the state wait has raised legal, logistical and ethical questions that the state has so far struggled to answer.\n Across the country, the arrival of a vaccine was hailed as a harbinger of the pandemic\u2019s eventual end. But administering the limited supply has proved challenging, and correctional facilities \u2014 where more than half a million people have tested positive for the virus since the start of the pandemic \u2014 present additional complications.\n Officials grappling with the same difficult questions have come to different conclusions, creating a patchwork of policies and timelines that vary dramatically, according to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, a research nonprofit devoted to reducing mass incarceration. But at least 27 states directly name inmates in their public plans, and about a dozen place them in the first phases of vaccine distribution \u2014 including Massachusetts, where tens of thousands of prisoners are set to be vaccinated by the end of next month. New Jersey began vaccinating people in prisons in December.\n Others plan to vaccinate prison and jail workers before incarcerated people, breaking with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends vaccinating everyone at correctional facilities simultaneously. Some, like New York, do not address those behind bars at all.\n \u201cWe have people dying on a weekly basis,\u201d said Stefen Short, a lawyer for the Prisoners\u2019 Rights Project at the Legal Aid Society. \u201cWhat are the plans? There\u2019s got to be a consistent message coming out of Albany and coming out of these agencies on this. Otherwise, you\u2019re just generating a lot of fear.\u201d\n Vaccinating incarcerated people in the early stages of distribution has proved politically fraught. In New York, state senators have questioned whether prioritizing people in prisons makes sense. In Colorado, a draft plan to offer the vaccine inside prisons was met with fierce backlash for, as one district attorney wrote in The Denver Post, prioritizing \u201cthe health of incarcerated murderers\u201d ahead of \u201claw-abiding Coloradans 65 and older.\u201d\n New York officials said the state was preparing a plan. But public health experts broadly agree that incarcerated people are at particularly high risk for contracting and spreading the virus, as at least 8,800 people living or working in New York\u2019s prison system have tested positive since the start of the pandemic.\n And because guards, lawyers, workers and people entering and leaving custody move between the facilities and the community at large, the public health implications of outbreaks behind bars extend far beyond the prison walls. Officials said last fall that an outbreak at Greene Correctional Facility near Albany was linked to cases at an assisted-living facility and an elementary school.\n The absence of any clear plan for incarcerated people has left their relatives and advocates confused and concerned.\n \u201cI really don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Dr. Robert Cohen, a member of the Board of Correction in New York City. \u201cBut the consequences will be quite severe.\u201d\n For Jeanette Velazquez, the uncertainty has been frustrating.\n Her brother, Jos\u00e9 Leon, is incarcerated at Adirondack Correctional Facility in upstate New York with several underlying health conditions, including hypertension and colitis. But he was not among the thousands of inmates granted early release last year to stem the spread of the virus.\n Now, Ms. Velazquez said, her brother has taken his own precautions out of fear: Mr. Leon, 62, stopped going to communal mess halls and began skipping meals; he stays as isolated as possible; and, after years of his calling her regularly, Ms. Velazquez said she has not heard from him in days, unsure whether he is avoiding public spaces or if something went wrong.\n Mr. Leon, who is one of three plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit over prison conditions during the pandemic, is serving a sentence of 15 years to life for sexual abuse, prison and court records show.\n \u201cI\u2019m scared that he\u2019s not going to make it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s not getting the medical attention that he really needs, and him not making it home alive, that\u2019s my concern. It\u2019s like he has a death sentence.\u201d\n To be sure, the first weeks of the state\u2019s vaccine rollout have not been seamless for the public at large either. Medical providers were forced to throw out shots early on as other doses sat unused for weeks. Once the rollout sped up, New York\u2019s reserve of first doses was depleted, and thousands of vaccination appointments were canceled. Even as inmates clamor for eligibility, millions of people who already qualify continue to wait.\n But incarcerated people are four times as likely to be infected and twice as likely to die from the virus compared with the general population, studies suggest. They often live in congested units and eat in crowded facilities where social distancing is nearly impossible.\n They also lack the political power and societal favor of other vulnerable groups \u2014 a dynamic that has pinned state officials between the ethical responsibility for the health of people in state custody and potential public backlash. A disproportionate number are also Black and Latino, racial and ethnic groups that have been hit harder by the pandemic.\n In October, the state released plans outlining the vaccine prioritization order. Individuals who live in \u201ccongregate settings\u201d were designated to receive doses after frontline health care workers but before people under 65 with underlying health conditions. Those guidelines, however, did not specify whether those in prisons and jails were included.\n Contributing to the uncertainty, some lawmakers said they received conflicting information about the timeline. Several members of the Republican conference in the State Senate and Assembly said that in a Jan. 5 briefing, the state\u2019s health commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, said that incarcerated people would be allowed to receive the vaccine in Phase 2.\n But two in the Democratic conference said they were told separately that would happen in Phase 1B, the state\u2019s current stage of vaccination, as first reported by NY1. The current stage includes police officers, teachers and public transit workers.\n Patrick M. Gallivan, a Republican from the Buffalo area on the Senate\u2019s health committee, said he was concerned about vaccinating incarcerated people in the earliest phases when many essential workers and residents of long-term care facilities have not been inoculated.\n \u201cI understand the issues in congregate settings,\u201d Mr. Gallivan said. \u201cMy concern is that if we were to use the short supply of vaccines, it\u2019s at the expense of some of these other priority groups.\u201d\n Spokespeople from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s office and the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said only that a plan for incarcerated people was still being developed. The first groups of people within Phase 1B were declared eligible on Jan. 11, though the announcement made no mention of incarcerated people.\n Despite the absence of a statewide plan, New York City officials received permission to start vaccinating the highest-risk people held at Rikers Island and other facilities on Jan. 5, according to a spokeswoman for Correctional Health Services.\n Two days later, medical staff began distributing doses to the roughly 500 eligible people incarcerated there. The group represents only about 10 percent of the more than 5,000 total people held at city-run jails.\n Last week, a state judge also ordered the New York corrections department to vaccinate one 65-year-old inmate at the Adirondack prison with chronic lung disease, in what appears to be the first ruling of its kind in the state and could signal similar legal battles ahead.\n The prison has confirmed two virus cases during the pandemic, though there are widespread concerns over testing and reporting practices at several facilities \u2014 as well as the particularly high-risk population of seniors at Adirondack.\n In most areas, however, the situation is less clear.\n Peter Kehoe, the executive director of the New York State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, said that out of concern he had reached out to the state last month for details on vaccinations in county jails, which sheriffs oversee. \u201cBut we\u2019ve heard nothing back,\u201d he said, adding that he was not aware of anyone at jails outside of New York City receiving doses.\n He wondered whether the spotty communication was meant to avoid political pushback, which officials have yielded to elsewhere in the country.\n In Colorado, following ire on social media and from conservative critics, the state eventually changed course. \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to go to prisoners before it goes to people who haven\u2019t committed any crime,\u201d Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat, said in December.\n Even beyond eligibility, health experts worried that other obstacles would arise in New York.\n The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be stored at extremely low temperatures, but correctional facilities do not have the required freezers. Many are also located in isolated areas of the state, creating potential challenges for distribution. And people are routinely transferred between correctional facilities, which could create difficulties in tracking who has received doses.\n There is also growing concern among several advocacy groups that incarcerated people may be skeptical of the vaccine and be reluctant to accept doses, largely because of the government\u2019s history of medical experimentation on prison populations and people of color.\n Surveys in two Massachusetts counties found that more than half of the inmates who participated would decline doses. Some states have even offered incentives like snack bags, visitation time and days off sentences in exchange for their consent.\n Theresa Grady said those anxieties resonate.\n Her husband, who is 66, is serving a 40-year sentence for robbery and attempted murder at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Dutchess County, prison records show.\n He has high blood pressure and diabetes, and has shared stories of breakdowns in safety and accounts of correctional officers not wearing face coverings, his wife said.\n Ms. Grady said her husband wants more information around the vaccine before he feels safe enough to take it, but little outreach has occurred.\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid that by the time they offer this vaccine and get the education around it, it\u2019ll be too late for him,\u201d she said.",

        "title": "'We continue to lead the nation.' In West Virginia, Covid-19 vaccinations are nearly double the national rate",
        "body_text": "(CNN) More than 9% of people in West Virginia have received at least their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationally, that number stands at less than 6%.\n \"We continue to lead the nation,\" Gov. Jim Justice said in a news conference Monday.\n The governor's announcement comes amid continued struggles with vaccine rollouts across the US. States are still working to ramp up their administrations with the help of mass vaccination sites and volunteer vaccinators, while others say they're running out of supply and have appealed to the federal government for more doses.\n West Virginia is second in the nation in terms of vaccines administered per capita and share of distributed doses that have been administered, according to CDC data, and has often led the nation in these metrics. The state has so far administered about 106% of the doses it has officially received, Justice said.\n \"This is a hard number to believe,\" the governor said. \"We're getting more doses out of the vials than what they really anticipated.\"\n The state has added a sixth syringe to ancillary kit packs, said Jim Hoyer, director of the state's interagency coronavirus task force.\n \"It is not every single vial that you get the extra dose, but we are getting enough, as the governor pointed out, that this is making a significant impact,\" he said.\n The latest CDC data shows West Virginia has administered about 84% of the doses it's received -- but the agency has previously said its data may be a few days behind. Nationally, the rate of administration is at about 55%.\n Addressing senior residents during his news conference, the governor added that the state may have saved \"a thousand, 10 thousand, twenty thousand\" lives because of its decision to move older residents higher in its priority list.\n Many seniors \"had lost hope because they knew they couldn't get a vaccine shot really and truly until probably April,\" Justice said. \"Well, it's January.\"\n And so far, West Virginia has vaccinated nearly 74,000 people 65 and older, he said.\n \"We were told, and we were given models by the federal government that, really, basically said we can't get to you probably until April. But we didn't follow that model,\" he said.\n Earlier this month, the state announced a program prioritizing the vaccinations of older residents against the virus, in an operation dubbed \"Save our Wisdom.\"\n That plan came about a week before federal leaders asked states to move people 65 and older to the front of the line, along with people with high-risk conditions. The state also opted out of a federal partnership to administer vaccines to long-term care residents and staff, working instead with local pharmacies.\n And Justice is hopeful West Virginia can keep its vaccination momentum up.\n Starting next week, he said vaccination clinics will be available in all 55 counties.\n \"They will receive a number of vaccine doses based on population,\" the governor said. \"This will make sure that our limited supply of Covid vaccines are reaching every corner of our state.\"\n CNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Dominion Voting Systems Sues Rudy Giuliani For Defamation, Seeks $1.3 Billion",
        "body_text": "Dominion Voting Systems on Monday filed a lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, alleging former President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney defamed the voting software company with incessant lies about election fraud.\n The 107-page lawsuit, first reported by The New York Times, was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and accuses Giuliani of having \u201cmanufactured and disseminated\u201d false claims that Dominion voting machines threw out or changed votes for Trump.\n This \u201cBig Lie\u201d of a stolen election \u201cdeceived millions of people into believing Dominion had stolen their votes and fixed the election,\u201d the lawsuit alleged.\n Giuliani \u201ccashed in\u201d on those defamatory claims by reportedly seeking $20,000 a day from the Trump campaign and hosting a podcast where he repeatedly peddled the lies, the lawsuit contended.\n \u201cEven after the United States Capitol had been stormed by rioters who had been deceived by Giuliani and his allies, Giuliani shirked responsibility for the consequences of his words and repeated the Big Lie,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n Dominion, headquartered in Denver and Toronto, is seeking $1.3 billion in damages.\n Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n Dominion has also taken legal actions against other Trump allies who helped the ex-president peddle outrageous and baseless conspiracy theories involving the company.\n Earlier this month, Dominion sued former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell for $1.3 billion over her accusations that the company\u2019s machines rigged the election in favor of President Joe Biden.\n Dominion sent a cease and desist letter to MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump confidante, ordering him to \u201cpreserve and retain all documents relating to Dominion and your smear campaign against the company\u201d and promised \u201cimminent\u201d litigation.\n In December, a Dominion worker filed lawsuits against several parties who pushed the stolen election lie, including Trump and conservative media outlets OAN and Newsmax, claiming the falsehoods led to death threats.\n One of the lies spread by Giuliani and other Trump allies makes the demonstrably false claim that Dominion was founded in Venezuela to rig elections in favor of dictator Hugo Cha\u0301vez. In fact, Dominion was founded in 2002 \u201cin John Poulos\u2019s basement in Toronto to help blind people vote on paper ballots,\u201d Dominion stated in its lawsuit.\n Dominion machines were used in at least 24 states during the 2020 election, including in states where Trump won.\n Dozens of prominent attorneys in New York state have called for Giuliani\u2019s censure for his role in inspiring the Jan. 6 insurrectionist mob attack against the Capitol. The chairman of the New York state Senate judiciary committee called for the state court system to disbar Giuliani.\n On Thursday, a national group of lawyers filed a lengthy ethics complaint against Giuliani that alleged he knowingly lied about the election. The nonpartisan group Lawyers Defending American Democracy urged the state of New York to investigate Giuliani\u2019s actions and suspend his law license in the meantime.",

        "title": "A Texas man who stormed the Capitol threatened to \u2018assassinate\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez, feds say",
        "body_text": "Hours after he joined a mob of pro-Trump rioters in the U.S. Capitol earlier this month, Garret A. Miller took to social media to brag about his actions and to lob threats at lawmakers and police, federal investigators said. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted \u201cImpeach,\u201d referring to President Donald Trump, Miller\u2019s response was grim.\n \u201cAssassinate AOC,\u201d Miller, 34, allegedly wrote.\n That comment, along with a trove of other posts on social media, led to Miller\u2019s arrest on Wednesday. He was charged with unlawful entry of the Capitol on Jan. 6, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, obstruction or impeding any official proceedings, civil disorder and making threats, according to a criminal complaint. Miller first appeared in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Friday.\n Ocasio-Cortez later said on Instagram Live that during the \u201ctraumatizing event\u201d inside the Capitol riots, there were moments when she thought she was going to die and that it was \u201cnot an exaggeration\u201d to say many lawmakers were \u201cnearly assassinated.\u201d\n A spokeswoman for Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n The FBI was notified of Miller on Jan. 8, according to court documents, when law enforcement sent federal agents a video Miller had posted on Twitter of people roaming the Rotunda and waving Trump and American flags with the caption, \u201cFrom inside congress.\u201d Days later, Miller posted images of crowds outside the Capitol.\n With a subpoena of Miller\u2019s account, federal agents say they tracked down the number associated with the Twitter handle and connected it to Miller, who lives in Dallas County. Investigators then found Miller\u2019s Facebook account, where they found more posts relating to his activities at the Capitol.\n On Jan. 2, Miller posted on Facebook that he was going to drive to the rally in D.C., and predicted an event involving violence and unrest, investigators said.\n \u201cSome crazy s--- going to happen this week,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cDollar might collapse \u2026 civil war could start \u2026 not sure what to do in DC.\u201d\n The following day, he wrote that he was going to bring \u201ca grappling hook and rope and a level 3 vest. Helmets mouth guard and bump cap.\u201d Miller added that unlike the last time he went to D.C. for a pro-Trump rally, he wasn\u2019t going to bring his guns.\n On the day of the insurrection, Miller defended the violent mob in several tweets by claiming they were \u201cgentle with police\u201d and \u201coverwhelmed them but did not injure them,\u201d according to court documents. The Washington Post has reported that dozens of police officers were beaten and injured. One officer died of injuries and another died by suicide.\n Miller also broadcast his exploits in the Capitol on Instagram and Facebook, federal investigators said. In response to a comment on his Facebook page asking whether he was inside the Capitol, Miller wrote that he \u201ccharged the back gates myself\u201d and that he knew he was going to force his way into the building \u201cno matter what.\u201d\n He also acknowledged that by posting on social media he \u201cjust wanted to incriminate myself a little lol.\u201d\n For days afterward, federal investigators said, Miller continued to post more evidence of his escapades. On Instagram, he wrote that he \u201chad a rope in [his] bag on that day,\u201d court documents said. On Jan. 11, he posted a picture of himself wearing a Make America Great Again hat in the Rotunda.\n Miller also allegedly commented on the fatal shooting of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Southern California who avidly followed the QAnon conspiracy theory. A Capitol Police officer fired at Babbitt as she tried to climb through a window and into the office lobby of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n Miller hurled online threats at the officer, saying that if he got his hands on him, he would \u201chug his neck with a nice rope,\u201d according to court documents. On Jan. 16, he wrote on Facebook that \u201cits huntin season\u201d and that the officer \u201cdeserve[s] to die.\u201d\n In a Facebook chat, investigators said, Miller admitted that he was \u201chappy to make death threats.\u201d And when he was asked whether police knew his name, he said it was probably time for him to \u201cbe hard to locate.\u201d\n In addition to citing the incriminating evidence on Miller\u2019s social media accounts, federal officials said he\u2019s also visible on surveillance footage inside the Capitol on Jan. 6. One clip shows Miller inside the Rotunda at 2:46 p.m. wearing a red MAGA hat and carrying a pro-Trump flag and an American flag, with his face covering pulled down below his neck. Another video shows him in a crowd at the entrance of the Rotunda, pushing past Capitol Police officers.\n Miller is one of more than 100 people who have been charged with breaching the Capitol earlier this month. Last week, Thomas Fee, a 53-year-old retired New York City firefighter from Freeport, N.Y., was arrested and charged after he allegedly sent his girlfriend\u2019s brother \u2014 who is a federal agent \u2014 a picture of himself inside the Rotunda. Similar to Miller, many alleged rioters have openly bragged about their exploits on social media, making it easier for federal agents to track them down and connect them to the insurrection.\n In a statement to The Post, Miller\u2019s attorney, Clint Broden, said his client \u201cregrets the actions he took on Jan. 6,\u201d calling them a \u201cmisguided effort to show his support for former president Trump.\u201d\n \u201cMr. Miller understands that his social media post[s] reflect very ill-considered and completely inappropriate statements made in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future,\u201d Broden said. \u201cHe has always been a law-abiding citizen. He accepts full responsibility for his actions and is prepared to testify at any legal or Congressional proceeding. Most importantly, Mr. Miller recognizes the election is over and Joe Biden is President of the United States.\u201d\n Miller is due back in court for a detention hearing on Monday, according to the Justice Department.",

        "title": "Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman Not Running For Reelection",
        "body_text": "Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) announced Monday that he will not seek reelection in 2022 \u2015 a welcome piece of news to Democrats looking to grow their razor-thin majority in the Senate.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision,\u201d Portman said in a statement released by his office on Monday.\n Portman, 65, had been expected to seek a third term. The surprise announcement from the mild-mannered former George W. Bush aide could carry huge political ramifications for the country.\n In the immediate term, Portman might feel more emboldened in voting to convict former President Donald Trump for insurrection during his second impeachment trial, which is slated to begin next month. The senator may also find it easier to cross the political aisle and support some of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. However, as a deficit hawk and conventional Republican, he\u2019s unlikely to back large spending programs.\n More long-term, Portman stepping down creates yet another test for the Republican Party and its identity post-Trump. The GOP primary for the open Senate seat is expected to be brutal, and is likely to pit establishment candidates, like Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, against more Trump-like figures, such as Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n Meanwhile, Portman\u2019s announcement is music to the ears of Democrats, who are looking to grow their narrow majority in the Senate. There are now three Senate seats currently held by Republicans that will be up for grabs in 2022: Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio.\n The Buckeye State has been trending away from Democrats in recent years, but they stand a better chance of winning an open seat than they would against an incumbent Republican. Potential Democratic candidates include Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who would probably be the safest choice, and Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who is currently running for the House.",

        "body_text": "BARTOW, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida man who had been recently named \u201cParamedic of the Year\u201d helped a supervisor steal COVID-19 vaccines meant for first responders, sheriff\u2019s officials said.\n Joshua Colon, 31, forged the vaccine screening and consent forms to help cover up the theft of three vials containing 10 doses each of the Moderna vaccine, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said in a news conference Tuesday.\n Colon was arrested on Monday, days after his resignation from Polk County Fire Rescue, Chief Robert Weech said.\n According to authorities, Colon told investigators that a captain with the fire department had asked him to take the vaccine.\n Judd said the captain will also be arrested when he returns home from a work assignment in California.\n Polk County Fire Rescue had been delivering the coronavirus vaccines to first responders, and Colon was administering the shots, Judd said.\n On Jan. 6, Colon received three vials, and was directed to administer the shots to first responders at a fire station in Davenport, Judd said.\n At the end of his shift, Colon noted that he administered 28 vaccines, adding that two of them were no good, an arrest report said. Later Colon retracted that, saying he gave 27 vaccines and three were waste.\n Colon is charged with felony counts of uttering a false instrument, criminal use of personal identification, creating a fictitious person and falsifying an official record as a public servant.\n The investigation began when a battalion chief noticed discrepancies in the paperwork Colon filed after a vaccine assignment.\n The Jan. 6 paperwork included three falsified forms, investigators said. One had the name of a former Haines City firefighter, and two were fake names, one of which resembled a former Haines City firefighter.\n During the investigation, the two firefighters were contacted and told investigators that they had not yet received the vaccine.\n Judd said deputies interviewed Colon at his lawyer\u2019s office. Judd said Colon admitted to falsifying the paperwork, and said the captain had asked him to procure doses for his mother.\n Colon told investigators he initially refused, but the captain threatened to report him for stealing and selling vaccines. Colon said that frightened him.\n According to the report, the captain ordered Colon to go on a lunch break the next day. When he returned he noticed the three doses were missing, but he did not report the issue.\n While at the lawyer\u2019s office, Colon called the captain and they discussed the vaccine, according to investigators who monitored the call. The captain told Colon that the doses were in a car parked outside a friend\u2019s house in Saint Cloud, officials said.\n According to Judd, deputies found two vials there. The third has not been recovered.\n A group of local civic clubs in Lakeland had named Colon \u201cParamedic of the Year\u201d for his actions after a serious highway crash, according to a recent Polk County Fire Rescue  social media post.\n \u201cThe bottom line is, Joshua tried to cover for the captain,\u201d Judd said of Colon\u2019s arrest. \u201cJoshua set up the circumstance for the vaccines to have been stolen. Had Joshua simply gone to his boss right then, he\u2019d have been the hero. Instead he started falsifying paperwork, making up people who didn\u2019t exist to cover it up.\u201d",

        "title": "Biden Pushes Elusive 'Buy American' Goal With New Federal Contract Guidelines",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2014 President Joe Biden will take steps on Monday to harness the purchasing power of the United States government, the world\u2019s biggest single buyer, to increase domestic manufacturing and create markets for new technologies, a senior administration official said.\n Biden will sign an executive order aimed at closing loopholes in existing \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions, which structure the $600 billion in goods and services the federal government buys each year, making any waivers more transparent, and creating a senior White House role to oversee the process.\n Increasing U.S. manufacturing, a central tenet of Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, has proven a vexing challenge for previous administrations, including that of former President Donald Trump.\n Lower wages and weaker environmental standards have triggered the exodus of key manufacturing capabilities to China and other countries in recent decades, including medical equipment, resulting in critical gaps laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n China overtook the United States as the world\u2019s top manufacturer in 2010, and was responsible for 28% of global output in 2018, according to United Nations data.\n Rebuilding critical supply chains and developing new ones is critical to U.S. growth, trade experts say.\n The U.S. trade deficit surged to $68 billion in November, its highest level in 14 years, as businesses scrambled to fill shelves with foreign goods and supply domestic factories reliant on foreign parts, offsetting a rise in exports.\n \u201cThe U.S. spends about $600 billion a year on contracts, and that is money that...can also serve to spur a revitalization of our industrial strength and help to create markets for new technologies,\u201d the official said.\n The order directs federal agencies to reevaluate the threshold used to determine U.S. content, to prevent companies it buys from importing largely foreign-made goods and selling them as U.S.-made after making just minor tweaks.\n It sets a deadline of 180 days for regulators to finalize changes once proposed, and orders up a new website to ensure transparency about any waivers granted. The official gave no new percentages for required U.S. content, saying they would be determined as a result of the process being launched on Monday.\n The move is part of Biden\u2019s broader push to drive up wages, create more union jobs and strengthen U.S. supply chains, the official said.\n \u201cHe does not accept the defeatist idea that automation, globalization mean that we can\u2019t have good-paying union jobs here in America,\u201d the official said.\n The challenge in buying more U.S.-made goods is partly a reflection of the erosion of many basic industries. Major U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart, have launched high profile \u201cMade in America\u201d campaigns, only to court foreign manufacturers afterward to get the goods consumers wanted. In 2015, the retailer faced a probe by the Federal Trade Commission for labeling products that were only partly made in the country.\n Business groups blasted the Trump administration\u2019s push to expand \u201cBuy American\u201d mandates to the medical equipment and pharmaceutical sectors, warning they could worsen shortages during the pandemic.\n Asked if the order would be seen as protectionist, the official said it was fully consistent with U.S. commitments under the World Trade Organization. The White House hopes to work with trade partners to modernize global rules, he said.\n The process beginning Monday would \u201cmake sure that we are using procurement going forward in a way that actually builds domestic capacity, particularly in those areas where we have acute economic or national security needs and vulnerabilities,\u201d he said.\n (Reporting by Andrea Shalal and Timothy Aeppel; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose; Editing by Heather Timmons and Jacqueline Wong)",

        "body_text": "(CNN) Dale Moss has opened up about his broken engagement with Clare Crawley.\n The couple made \"Bachelorette\" history this season after they fell in love and she withdrew from the show.\n Moss and Crawley got engaged and former \"Bachelor\" contestant Tayshia Adams replaced her to finish the season.\n But Moss recently announced that the engagement had ended and on Monday posted videos on the Instastory portion of his verified Instagram account, saying he finally felt \"comfortable getting on here after having some time to process everything that's gone on.\"\n \"I know a lot of y'all have seen me smiling on social media and say I don't seem as hurt or burdened by this, but that's the farthest thing,\" he said. \"This time has sucked.\"\n The former football player credited his friends and family with helping to support him through this difficult time and pointed out the challenges of having such a public relationship.\n \"Media will take things and run with them. People will spread lies or always want to point the finger,\" Moss said. \"But the fact of the matter is, there's no one person to blame in this situation.\"\n He said his relationship with Crawley had its \"ups and downs\" and he appeared to refute her earlier statement that she became aware of their break up at the same time as the public.\n \"The statements that came out, this didn't come out of nowhere,\" he said. \"I love Clare and respect Clare enough to let her know how I feel, even if that's against the expectations of everybody else.\"\n Crawley had earlier posted a statement on her verified Instagram account which read \"I was made aware of a 'mutual' statement at the same time you all were, so I've needed some time to really digest this.\"\n \"Speaking for myself, my intentions with this relationship have always been very clear, so the truth is I am crushed,\" the statement read. \"This was not what I expected or hoped for and am still trying to process this.\"\n In his video Moss said he was hurting and insisted that he was invested in building a healthy relationship with Crawley.\n \"While this is going to be difficult, what you'll see from me is trying to practice what I preach and continue to put my best foot forward each and every day,\" he said. \"While trying to find some sense of normalcy, I'm also going to try and find joy and happiness in each day and continue to share that. Everything else is in God's hands.\"",

        "title": "Why Is Big Tech Policing Speech? Because the Government Isn\u2019t",
        "body_text": "In the months leading up to the November election, the social media platform Parler attracted millions of new users by promising something competitors, increasingly, did not: unfettered free speech. \u201cIf you can say it on the streets of New York,\u201d promised the company\u2019s chief executive, John Matze, in a June CNBC interview, \u201cyou can say it on Parler.\u201d\n The giants of social media \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram \u2014 had more stringent rules. And while they still amplified huge amounts of far-right content, they had started using warning labels and deletions to clamp down on misinformation about Covid-19 and false claims of electoral fraud, including in posts by President Trump. Conservative figures, including Senator Ted Cruz, Eric Trump and Sean Hannity, grew increasingly critical of the sites and beckoned followers to join them on Parler, whose investors include the right-wing activist and heiress Rebekah Mercer. The format was like Twitter\u2019s, but with only two clear rules: no criminal activity and no spam or bots. On Parler, you could say what you wanted without being, as conservatives complained, \u201csilenced.\u201d\n After the election, as Trump sought to overturn his defeat with a barrage of false claims, Matze made a classic First Amendment argument for letting the disinformation stand: More speech is better. Let the marketplace of ideas run without interference. \u201cIf you don\u2019t censor, if you don\u2019t \u2014 you just let him do what he wants, then the public can judge for themselves,\u201d Matze said of Trump\u2019s Twitter account on the New York Times podcast \u201cSway.\u201d \u201cJust sit there and say: \u2018Hey, that\u2019s what he said. What do you guys think?\u2019\u201d\n Matze was speaking to the host of \u201cSway,\u201d Kara Swisher, on Jan. 7 \u2014 the day after Trump told supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol and fight congressional certification of the Electoral College vote. In the chaos that followed Trump\u2019s speech, the American marketplace of ideas clearly failed. Protecting democracy, for Trump loyalists, had become a cry to subvert and even destroy it. And while Americans\u2019 freedoms of speech and the press were vital to exposing this assault, they were also among its causes. Right-wing media helped seed destabilizing lies; elected officials helped them grow; and the democratizing power of social media spread them, steadily, from one node to the next.\n Social media sites effectively function as the public square where people debate the issues of the day. But the platforms are actually more like privately owned malls: They make and enforce rules to keep their spaces tolerable, and unlike the government, they\u2019re not obligated to provide all the freedom of speech offered by the First Amendment. Like the bouncers at a bar, they are free to boot anyone or anything they consider disruptive. In the days after Jan. 6, they swiftly cracked down on whole channels and accounts associated with the violence. Reddit removed the r/DonaldTrump subreddit. YouTube tightened its policy on posting videos that called the outcome of the election into doubt. TikTok took down posts with hashtags like #stormthecapitol. Facebook indefinitely suspended Trump\u2019s account, and Twitter \u2014 which, like Facebook, had spent years making some exceptions to its rules for the president \u2014 took his account away permanently.\n Parler, true to its stated principles, did none of this. But it had a weak point: It was dependent on other private companies to operate. In the days after the Capitol assault, Apple and Google removed Parler from their app stores. Then Amazon Web Services stopped hosting Parler, effectively cutting off its plumbing. Parler sued, but it had agreed, in its contract, not to host content that \u201cmay be harmful to others\u201d; having promised the streets of New York, it was actually bound by the rules of a kindergarten playground. In a court filing, Amazon provided samples of about 100 posts it had notified Parler were in violation of its contract in the weeks before the Capitol assault. \u201cFry \u2019em up,\u201d one said, with a list of targets that included Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. \u201cWe are coming for you and you will know it.\u201d On Jan. 21, a judge denied Parler\u2019s demand to reinstate Amazon\u2019s services.\n It\u2019s unlikely the volume of incendiary content on Parler could rival that of Twitter or Facebook, where groups had openly planned for Jan. 6. But Parler is the one that went dark. A platform built to challenge the oligopoly of its giant rivals was deplatformed by other giants, in a demonstration of how easily they, too, could block speech at will.\n Over all, the deplatforming after Jan. 6 had the feeling of an emergency response to a wave of lies nearly drowning our democracy. For years, many tech companies had invoked the American ethos of free speech while letting disinformation and incitement spread abroad, even when it led to terrible violence. Now they leapt to action as if, with America in trouble, American ideals no longer applied. Parler eventually turned to overseas web-hosting services to get back online.\n \u201cWe couldn\u2019t beat you in the war of ideas and discourse, so we\u2019re pulling your mic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s how Archon Fung, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, put it, in expressing ambivalence about the moves. It seemed curiously easier to take on Trump and his allies in the wake of Democrats\u2019 victories in the Senate runoffs in Georgia, giving them control of both chambers of Congress along with the White House. (Press officers for Twitter and Facebook said no election outcome influenced the companies\u2019 decision.) And in setting an example that might be applied to the speech of the other groups \u2014 foreign dissidents, sex-worker activists, Black Lives Matter organizers \u2014 the deplatforming takes on an ominous cast.\n Fadi Quran, a campaign director for the global human rights group Avaaz, told me he, too, found the precedent worrying. \u201cAlthough the steps may have been necessary to protect American lives against violence,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are a reminder of the power big tech has over our information infrastructure. This infrastructure should be governed by deliberative democratic processes.\u201d\n But what would those democratic processes be? Americans have a deep and abiding suspicion of letting the state regulate speech. At the moment, tech companies are filling the vacuum created by that fear. But do we really want to trust a handful of chief executives with policing spaces that have become essential parts of democratic discourse? We are uncomfortable with government doing it; we are uncomfortable with Silicon Valley doing it. But we are also uncomfortable with nobody doing it at all. This is a hard place to be \u2014 or, perhaps, two rocks and a hard place.\n When Twitter banned Trump, he found a seemingly unlikely defender: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who criticized the decision as a \u201cproblematic\u201d breach of the right to free speech. This wasn\u2019t necessarily because Merkel considered the content of Trump\u2019s speech defensible. The deplatforming troubled her because it came from a private company; instead, she said through a spokesman, the United States should have a law restricting online incitement, like the one Germany passed in 2017 to prevent the dissemination of hate speech and fake news stories.\n Among democracies, the United States stands out for its faith that free speech is the right from which all other freedoms flow. European countries are more apt to fight destabilizing lies by balancing free speech with other rights. It\u2019s an approach informed by the history of fascism and the memory of how propaganda, lies and the scapegoating of minorities can sweep authoritarian leaders to power. Many nations shield themselves from such anti-pluralistic ideas. In Canada, it\u2019s a criminal offense to publicly incite hatred \u201cagainst any identifiable group.\u201d South Africa prosecutes people for uttering certain racial slurs. A number of countries in Europe treat Nazism as a unique evil, making it a crime to deny the Holocaust.\n In the United States, laws like these surely wouldn\u2019t survive Supreme Court review, given the current understanding of the First Amendment \u2014 an understanding that comes out of our country\u2019s history and our own brushes with suppressing dissent. The First Amendment did not prevent the administration of John Adams from prosecuting more than a dozen newspaper editors for seditious libel or the Socialist and labor leader Eugene V. Debs from being convicted of sedition over a speech, before a peaceful crowd, opposing involvement in World War I. In 1951, the Supreme Court upheld the convictions of Communist Party leaders for \u201cconspiring\u201d to advocate the overthrow of the government, though the evidence showed only that they had met to discuss their ideological beliefs.\n It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the Supreme Court enduringly embraced the vision of the First Amendment expressed, decades earlier, in a dissent by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.: \u201cThe ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas.\u201d In Brandenburg v. Ohio, that meant protecting the speech of a Ku Klux Klan leader at a 1964 rally, setting a high bar for punishing inflammatory words. Brandenburg \u201cwildly overprotects free speech from any logical standpoint,\u201d the University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone points out. \u201cBut the court learned from experience to guard against a worse evil: the government using its power to silence its enemies.\u201d\n This era\u2019s concept of free speech still differed from today\u2019s in one crucial way: The court was willing to press private entities to ensure they allowed different voices to be heard. As another University of Chicago law professor, Genevieve Lakier, wrote in a law-review article last year, a hallmark of the 1960s was the court\u2019s \u201csensitivity to the threat that economic, social and political inequality posed\u201d to public debate. As a result, the court sometimes required private property owners, like TV broadcasters, to grant access to speakers they wanted to keep out.\n But the court shifted again, Lakier says, toward interpreting the First Amendment \u201cas a grant of almost total freedom\u201d for private owners to decide who could speak through their outlets. In 1974, it struck down a Florida law requiring newspapers that criticized the character of political candidates to offer them space to reply. Chief Justice Warren Burger, in his opinion for the majority, recognized that barriers to entry in the newspaper market meant this placed the power to shape public opinion \u201cin few hands.\u201d But in his view, there was little the government could do about it.\n Traditionally, conservatives have favored that libertarian approach: Let owners decide how their property is used. That\u2019s changing now that they find their speech running afoul of tech-company rules. \u201cListen to me, America, we were wiped out,\u201d the right-wing podcaster Dan Bongino, an investor in Parler, said in a Fox News interview after Amazon pulled its services. \u201cAnd to all the geniuses out there, too, saying this is a private company, it\u2019s not a First Amendment fight \u2014 really, it\u2019s not?\u201d The law that prevents the government from censoring speech should still apply, he said, because \u201cthese companies are more powerful than a de facto government.\u201d You needn\u2019t sympathize with him to see the hit Parler took as the modern equivalent of, in Burger\u2019s terms, disliking one newspaper and taking the trouble to start your own, only to find no one will sell you ink to print it.\n One problem with private companies\u2019 holding the ability to deplatform any speaker is that they\u2019re in no way insulated from politics \u2014 from accusations of bias to advertiser boycotts to employee walkouts. Facebook is a business, driven by profit and with no legal obligation to explain its decisions the way a court or regulatory body would. Why, for example, hasn\u2019t Facebook suspended the accounts of other leaders who have used the platform to spread lies and bolster their power, like the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte? A spokesman said suspending Trump was \u201ca response to a specific situation based on risk\u201d \u2014 but so is every decision, and the risks can be just as high overseas.\n \u201cIt\u2019s really media and public pressure that is the difference between Trump coming down and Duterte staying up,\u201d says Evelyn Douek, a lecturer at Harvard Law School. \u201cBut the winds of public opinion are a terrible basis for free-speech decisions! Maybe it seems like it\u2019s working right now. But in the longer run, how do you think unpopular dissidents and minorities will fare?\u201d\n Deplatforming works, at least in the short term. There are indications that in the weeks after the platforms cleaned house \u2014 with Twitter suspending not just Trump but some 70,000 accounts, including many QAnon influencers \u2014 conversations about election fraud decreased significantly across several sites. After Facebook reintroduced a scoring system to promote news sources based on its judgment of their quality, the list of top performers, usually filled by hyperpartisan sources, featured CNN, NPR and local news outlets.\n But there\u2019s no reason to think the healthier information climate will last. The very features that make social media so potent work both to the benefit and the detriment of democracy. YouTube, for instance, changed its recommendation algorithm in 2019, after researchers and reporters (including Kevin Roose at The New York Times) showed how it pushed some users toward radicalizing content. It\u2019s also telling that, since the election, Facebook has stopped recommending civic groups for people to join. After Jan. 6, the researcher Aric Toler at Bellingcat surfaced a cheery video, automatically created by Facebook to promote its groups, which imposed the tagline \u201ccommunity means a lot\u201d over images of a militia brandishing weapons and a photo of Robert Gieswein, who has since been charged in the assault on the Capitol. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the technology has upended the possibility of a well-functioning, responsible speech environment,\u201d the Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith says. \u201cIt used to be we had masses of speech in a reasonable range, and some extreme speech we could tolerate. Now we have a lot more extreme speech coming from lots of outlets and mouthpieces, and it\u2019s more injurious and harder to regulate.\u201d\n For decades, tech companies mostly responded to such criticism with proud free-speech absolutism. But external pressures, and the absence of any other force to contain users, gradually dragged them into the expensive and burdensome role of policing their domains. Facebook, for one, now has legions of low-paid workers reviewing posts flagged as harmful, a task gruesome enough that the company has agreed to pay $52 million in mental-health compensation to settle a lawsuit by more than 10,000 moderators.\n Perhaps because it\u2019s so easy to question their motives, some executives have taken to begging for mercy. \u201cWe are facing something that feels impossible,\u201d said Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, while being grilled by Congress last year. And Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has agreed with lawmakers that the company has too much power over speech. Two weeks after suspending Trump, Facebook said its new oversight board, an independent group of 20 international experts, would review the decision, with the power to make a binding ruling.\n Zuckerberg and Dorsey have also suggested openness to government regulation that would hold platforms to external standards. That might include, for example, requiring rules for slowing the spread of disinformation from known offenders. European lawmakers, with their more skeptical free-speech tradition (and lack of allegiance to American tech companies), have proposed requiring platforms to show how their recommendations work and giving users more control over them, as has been done in the realm of privacy. Steps like these seem better suited to combating misinformation than eliminating, as is often suggested, the immunity platforms currently enjoy from lawsuits, which directly affects only a narrow range of cases, mostly involving defamation.\n There is no consensus on a path forward, but there is precedent for some intervention. When radio and television radically altered the information landscape, Congress passed laws to foster competition, local control and public broadcasting. From the 1930s until the 1980s, anyone with a broadcast license had to operate in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d \u2014 and starting in 1949, that explicitly included exposing audiences to multiple points of view in policy debates. The court let the elected branches balance the rights of private ownership with the collective good of pluralism.\n This model coincided with relatively high levels of trust in media and low levels of political polarization. That arrangement has been rare in American history. It\u2019s hard to imagine a return to it. But it\u2019s worth remembering that radio and TV also induced fear and concern, and our democracy adapted and thrived. The First Amendment of the era aided us. The guarantee of free speech is for democracy; it is worth little, in the end, apart from it.",

        "title": "The Technology 202: Tech experts overwhelmingly approve of Trump suspensions from social media",
        "body_text": "with Aaron Schaffer\n An overwhelming majority of tech experts surveyed by The Technology 202 said social media companies made the right decision to suspend former president Donald Trump\u2019s accounts following the Capitol violence.\n \u201cIt seems extremely straightforward,\u201d said Jen Pahlka, a former U.S. deputy chief technology officer and founder of Code for America, a nonprofit that focuses on using technology to improve government services. \u201cHe incited an attack not only on the Capitol but on democracy.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m grateful Twitter, Facebook and YouTube took these actions,\u201d Steve Case, former chief executive of AOL, said. \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d He expressed concern about how the Internet has evolved since the hope from more than three decades ago that his company would be a platform for diverse voices, not a tool to \u201cdistort and divide.\u201d\n The Technology 202 Network is a panel of more than 100 experts from across government, industry and the consumer advocacy community invited to vote in our ongoing, informal surveys. (You can see the full list of experts here. Some were granted anonymity in exchange for their participation.)\n The decision by social media companies to strip Trump of his prized online megaphone during his final days in the Oval Office was deeply polarizing in Washington. Republicans criticized Twitter's permanent suspension of Trump due to \u201crisk of further incitement of violence\u201d as political censorship. But tech companies were largely united in taking some sort of action, though Facebook has not yet decided whether it will restore access and YouTube is expected to lift its suspension later this week. Even smaller platforms including Snap and Twitch have announced similar suspensions.\n Ifeoma Ozoma, who previously worked in public policy at Pinterest, Google and Facebook, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that the companies had allowed the issues to escalate so drastically that suspending Trump was their only option.\n \u201cGetting to this point was a huge miss by companies who turned a range of tools into one nuclear option,\u201d she said. \u201cBy limiting sharing, distribution, and exercising other moderation choices years or even months ago, platforms could have avoided the need to entirely remove the president\u2019s account.\u201d\n \u201cIn my opinion they waited far too long, until it was clear Trump was on the outs and didn't have the power to really retaliate,\u201d said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, CEO and founder of ReadySet, a diversity solutions firm. \u201cI firmly believe the 11th hour decision to suspend Trump was one that was driven just as much by self-interest and political expediency as it was ethics.\u201d\n Others agreed there was a new business rationale for the suspensions at the end of Trump's term and the escalation of real-world violence. \u201cThey made the rational business choice at that moment. They\u2019re not anti-conservative. They\u2019re not anti-liberal. They\u2019re not anything. They\u2019re just profit centers that make every decision solely based on long term revenue maximization,\" said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor who previously served as a political strategist for the company. \"That\u2019s why they kept Trump on the platform as long as they did and why they kicked him off.\u201d\n Some experts said the suspension was proof other interventions tech companies touted to prevent the spread of disinformation during the election didn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cTech companies bet on labels to contain lies on their platforms, and while there were benefits to the approach, labels were utterly insufficient to prevent verified politicians and far-right media outlets from disinforming tens of millions of people on their platforms,\u201d said Alex Howard, director of the Digital Democracy Project at the Demand Progress Educational Fund, a nonprofit.\n \u201cI think it was necessary because of the threat of imminent violence, but going forward decisions about the boundaries of the First Amendment should be made by the people, through democratically elected bodies \u2014 not by a few executives,\u201d said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement at the Open Markets Institute, an organization backed by groups that advocate for breaking up Big Tech.\n Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in this instance she supported the suspensions of the social media accounts, but she said there should always be concern when platforms \u201ctake on the role of censors.\u201d\n \u201cAlso, it's important not to lump together all \u2018tech companies\u2019 here,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cInfrastructure companies like Apple and Amazon and Shopify are very different, and should be thought of differently, than social networks like Twitter and Facebook.\u201d\n (Amazon pulled support for the pro-Trump social network Parler, effectively knocking it offline, following concerns about its lack of content moderation. Apple also blocked it from its App Store.)\n Ali Partovi, chief executive of Neo and co-founder of Code.org, said that it\u2019s good policy to enforce terms of service against \u201cserial abusers.\u201d\n \u201cThe real problem is that these platforms don\u2019t always act consistently or transparently,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they can improve.\u201d\n Limiting Trump's use of the platforms should be just the beginning of more intensive efforts to fight violence and extremism, several respondents said.\n \u201cWhen it comes to protecting Black people and our democracy, de-platforming Trump is the floor, not the ceiling,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, president of Color Of Change. \u201cThe greater question now is, how can we change the incentive structure that allows social media companies to choose their profit and growth over our safety and democracy in the first place? It is a profit-driven platform feature \u2014 not a design bug \u2014 that allows white nationalist and far-right extremist groups to use their platforms to incite violence against Black people and mobilize plans to infringe on our democratic process. De-platforming Trump won\u2019t change the toxic incentive structure in place; rather, it further illustrates how powerful the broken incentives are.\u201d\n Zach Graves, who serves as head of policy for the Lincoln Network, an advocacy group for conservatives and libertarians in the tech sector, said the companies faced a \u201chard choice\u201d with many competing pressures.\n \u201cParticularly given the reaction outside the U.S., I worry that this will motivate more countries to regulate tech (all the way up the stack), and ultimately make the Internet more balkanized and a less hospitable place for free expression,\u201d Graves said. \u201cI also worry conservatives will use this incident to continue to take more aggressive stances on tech regulation. Notably, social media companies had a range of other tools besides outright suspension they could have employed, which may have played out better over the long run.\u201d\n \u2014 More responses from members of our Network panel about whether social media companies made the right decision in suspending Trump:\n Amazon, Facebook, Google and four other top technology giants spent record-breaking amounts to lobby the U.S. government last year, Tony Romm reports.\n Here's how much the top companies spent:\n 2021 is also set to be a banner year for tech lobbying in Washington, with the Biden administration under pressure to break up the companies and further regulate the industry in the wake of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. And Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Jessica Rosenworcel, Biden\u2019s newly named picks to lead the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission, respectively, in acting capacities, are under pressure to investigate the companies and restore net neutrality.\n The company temporarily paused all donations through its political action committee, MSPAC, the company publicly confirmed in a blog post Saturday. The company plans to make a decision by Feb. 15 on whether it will end further donations to politicians who voted against the electoral college certification.\n Employees have raised a wide range of concerns about the candidates supported by the company. \u201cMicrosoft needs to take its role in the current political climate seriously, and pledge to make meaningful changes to how it contributes to the political process,\u201d longtime employee Carmen Crincoli argued in a blog post on Jan. 13, later writing that \u201cbecause Satya and the senior leadership team spend so much time emphasizing how Microsoft values its employees, it is disconcerting to watch those same leaders routinely fund politicians who actively legislate against the very rights and existence of many of our fellow employees.\u201d\n Microsoft President Brad Smith defended the PAC to employees on Friday, according to remarks leaked to Pinboard founder Maciej Ceglowski:\n Microsoft then published a more complete transcript of Smith\u2019s remarks. Many corporate backers of Republican lawmakers have pulled their support in the wake of the election objections and Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n Most of the food delivery app\u2019s executive team will leave, the New York Times\u2019s Mike Isaac reports, with some set to receive multimillion-dollar exit packages. The cuts come as Uber attempts to integrate the app, which it purchased last year for $2.65 billion, with its Uber Eats division.\n Last year, Uber's food delivery service outpaced its ride-hailing division for the first time; however, the company has been plagued by the transportation industry's contraction from the coronavirus pandemic.\n It's not the only food delivery service to announce cuts in recent days. Last week, grocery delivery and pickup service Instacart also told employees that it would be slashing its workforce.\n ByteDance Foe Seeks $5.4 Billion in Biggest Tech IPO Since Uber (Bloomberg )\n The company also announced it would open up Google spaces to serve as vaccination sites, CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post this morning.\n Google will provide $100 million in ad grants for the CDC Foundation, the World Health Organization and other global nonprofits. The company will also invest $50 million in partnership with public health agencies for outreach to underserved communities.\n Google also will make some of its parking lots, buildings and other open spaces available for vaccination clinics. It's beginning with a partnership with health care provider One Medical and public health authorities in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City and Kirkland, Wash. The company plans to expand nationally based on local vaccine availability.\n You\u2019re spending more money online than you think. Here are 4 ways to save.

        "title": "Indian farmers storm New Delhi's Red Fort during tractor protest",
        "body_text": "New Delhi (CNN) Thousands of Indian farmers protesting controversial agricultural reforms stormed New Delhi's historic Red Fort Tuesday, with others breaching barricades and clashing with police.\n Protesters scaled the walls of the iconic monument and a flag was hoisted alongside India's national flag.\n Tear gas and flash bangs could been seen on live streams from the city's streets as police moved to contain large crowds of protestors in tractors and on foot from breaking through barricades. Both police and protesters were spotted with large sticks in the streets.\n It was supposed to be a massive but peaceful rally, as hundreds of thousands of farmers drove their tractors in convoy into the Indian capital as part of ongoing, nationwide protests against three farm laws that protesters say put their livelihoods at risk.\n Many of the farmers, who had adorned their tractors with colorful flags, including the flag of India and various farmers unions, had been camping out in protest on the outskirts of the capital for more than two months. Others, including young farmers from the northern states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan, had gathered on the border over the past few days in time for the planned march on India's Republic Day.\n The national holiday marks the first time India's constitution went into effect in 1950 following independence from British colonial rule, and the day is annually celebrated with a huge military parade through the capital.\n Farmers planned their march to coincide with the government's parade, which has been scaled back because of the coronavirus pandemic. But as tanks paraded before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, tractors driven by protesters ran across the capital -- some could be seen almost crushing police personnel standing in their way.\n The massive protests have been a significant challenge to Modi as months of demonstrations and sit-ins across the country against his key agricultural policy have grown into a stalemate marked by deadlocked talks between farmers and his administration.\n Police had given permission for the rally to proceed on certain routes but confrontations broke out when protesters diverged from the agreed plan. Police had had created diversions along several major highways and main roads in city and the metro shut exits at least 15 stations close to protest sites.\n Tear gas and batons were used against protesters outside Delhi police headquarters and at two bordering areas of the city as farmers broke through barricades, protesters said Tuesday.\n \"Outside the Delhi police headquarters tear gas and batons were used, protestors also attacked the police buses stationed there,\" said Paramjeet Singh Katyal, a spokesperson for Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella group representing farmers' unions.\n \"We have broken the barricades, we have our tractors, people are marching, some leaders are also on horseback... thousands of farmers have already reached the capital,\" Katyal said.\n The statement thanked farmers for their \"unprecedented participation\" in Tuesday's event, but expressed regret over the \"undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today\" and dissociated the group from \"those indulging in such acts.\"\n At the Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, police used tear gas and batons to push back about 2,000 protesters, and tear gas was also used at the Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana on Tuesday morning, according to Ashutosh Mishra, a spokesperson for All India Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the unions leading the protests.\n Police placed a cap of 5,000 tractors to take part in the rally, according to Mishra. However more than 200,000 tractors were mobilized, with many young people coming from neighboring states, said Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union, one of several leading the protests.\n Singhal added that in view of this it was necessary for Delhi Police to \"maintain law and order,\" adding that the clashes had damaged property and injured a number of police personnel.\n For decades, the Indian government offered guaranteed prices to farmers for certain crops, providing long-term certainty that, in theory, allowed them to make investments for the next crop cycle. The new agricultural laws, first passed in September by Modi's government, instead allow farmers to sell their goods to anyone for any price -- giving them more freedom to do things such as sell directly to buyers and sell to other states.\n But farmers argued that the new rules would leave them worse off by making it easier for corporations to exploit agricultural workers, and help big companies drive down prices. While farmers could sell crops at elevated prices if the demand is there, conversely, they could struggle to meet the minimum price in years when there is too much supply in the market.\n The laws have been so contentious because agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India's 1.3 billion population, and farmers have been arguing for years to get the minimum guaranteed prices increased. They are the biggest voter block in the country -- making farming a central political issue.\n More than 100,000 people have been protesting the laws since late November. There have been sit-ins lasting days along each of New Delhi's three borders. Farmers have blocked roads and set up makeshift camps, some sleeping on the road or in their tractors. They arrived from numerous different states to participate in the mass protests, at times clashing with police.\n The government has held 11 rounds of talks with leaders of more than 30 farmers' unions that are opposed to the laws -- but the talks have gone nowhere.\n Earlier this month, India's Supreme Court issued an order putting the three contentious farm laws on hold and ordered the formation of a four-member mediation committee to help the parties negotiate. But farmers' leaders have rejected any court-appointed mediation committee.",

        "title": "Mexicans Worry That Even Getting Covid Won\u2019t Make Their Leader Take It Seriously",
        "body_text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A day after the news that Mexico\u2019s president had contracted Covid-19, frustration rippled through the line of Mexicans anxiously waiting Monday to refill tanks of oxygen for relatives who were suffering from the same illness and gasping for air at home.\n For nearly a year, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador had minimized the pandemic, claiming that religious amulets protected him, refusing to wear masks and even drinking from the same clay pot as supporters. It was only a matter of time until he got sick himself, some Mexicans said.\n With the president now infected, what most aggrieved many Mexicans was not only that he had flouted basic safety precautions, but that he also may go back to playing down the threat that the surging pandemic poses after his own illness.\n They noted that with top-notch medical care delivered at his living quarters, the president may well recover. But their loved ones, on the other hand, will struggle to get the most basic care, whether a bed at an overflowing hospital or just the supplies like oxygen that might help them survive at home.\n \u201cMy dad believed him \u2014 he believed him that nothing would happen by not wearing a mask,\u201d said Lilia Ram\u00edrez D\u00edaz, who was making the second trip of the day to refill an oxygen tank for her diabetic father, battling Covid-19 at home.\n \u201cThey both got sick,\u201d she said, but the president \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go around looking and begging for an oxygen tank.\u201d\n A devastated Mexico is struggling to rein in the pandemic. Three days before the president disclosed his own infection on Sunday, the authorities announced more than 1,800 coronavirus deaths, breaking the record of single-day deaths set just days earlier.\n In Mexico City, hospitals are at 89 percent capacity, according to the most recent health ministry figures, while nationwide, the figure is 60 percent. Across the country, more than half of all hospitals beds with ventilators are full.\n So far, more than 1.7 million people have contracted the virus in Mexico and more than 150,000 people have died. That is the fourth-highest death toll in the world. And some experts believe the real toll may be far higher.\n Amid widespread mistrust of hospitals, many infected people choose to stay home \u2014 and often die there. The cause of death may not be listed as Covid-19. That, combined with the country\u2019s low levels of testing, means the pandemic\u2019s true toll is most likely far worse than the official one.\n While Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said Sunday that his symptoms were mild and that he \u201cremained positive,\u201d doctors warned that the 67-year-old heart attack survivor was in a high risk category.\n And it remains to be seen if his own bout with the virus will change the Mexican leader\u2019s attitude toward it.\n Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is not the first world leader to fall ill with coronavirus.\n Early last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain famously persisted in shaking hands with Covid-19 patients only to be admitted to a hospital himself after contracting the disease.\n Mr. Johnson emerged from his health emergency experience sounding chastened, and with a new, intimate awareness of the virus\u2019s danger. He went on to embrace mask wearing and lockdowns and other measures designed to help stem transmission.\n But in Mexico, some public health experts fear their leader will go more the way of former President Donald J. Trump, who beat the virus last year and then continued to play down the pandemic and undermine health officials\u2019 recommendations.\n Several public health experts interviewed said they worried Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador might maintain his opposition to mask wearing, lockdowns and social distancing.\n And if Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador recovers and then points to his own experience to dismiss the danger, it may help worsen Mexico\u2019s surge in cases, warned Laurie Ann Xim\u00e9nez-Fyvie, the head of the molecular genetics laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\n \u201cIf L\u00f3pez Obrador comes out of this saying: \u2018See? I\u2019m an old person with high blood pressure, and see how well I did? Let\u2019s get back to business as usual,\u2019 then that could really push us over the edge,\u201d Dr. Xim\u00e9nez-Fyvie said. \u201cPeople could drop their guard even further, be more reckless.\n \u201cAnd the president has already done everything possible to make people drop their guard as it is.\u201d\n With a fragmented and weak opposition, there is little robust resistance to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policy prescriptions. The ruling party, the National Regeneration Movement, was founded by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and he holds great sway over its officials, who are said to take off their masks when they\u2019re around the president to avoid upsetting him.\n Even if Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador changes his message and urges citizens to take precautions, it may not work.\n \u201cIn Mexico it is very hard to impose closures now, because a lot of the economy is not formal,\u201d said Dr. Alejandro Macias, an infectious-disease expert. \u201cThe government may regulate the formal economy, but that ends up increasing demand for the non-regulated, informal economy.\u201d\n The government had hoped to secure enough vaccine doses to roll out an ambitious program to vaccinate most frontline health care workers by the end of February. But that program came to a standstill last week after Pfizer said it could no longer meet its promise to distribute 1.5 million doses to Mexico. By Monday night, slightly more than 640,000 doses had been administered across the country.\n On Monday, Mexican officials spoke with their Russian counterparts to secure 24 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, but health experts caution that the Russian vaccine\u2019s efficacy and safety cannot be guaranteed.\n \u201cMexico has been flying blind throughout this pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Xim\u00e9nez-Fyvie. \u201cAnd now we are flying blind with the vaccine.\u201d",

        "title": "At least 150 people have been charged by Justice Department in Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "(CNN) At least 150 people have now been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements, as a top prosecutor said charges of sedition are not out of the question.\n The milestone of 150 charged in the riot comes less than a day after the US House transmitted to the Senate an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump for inciting insurrection. Trump will now face a trial in the same Senate chamber that rioters -- aiming to stop Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's electoral win -- breached minutes after members of the Senate had been hurried to safety.\n Investigators have used 500 grand jury subpoenas and search warrants to gather information in the sweeping, unparalleled investigation, Michael Sherwin, the top US prosecutor in Washington, said in a news conference Tuesday.\n Sedition, among other charges, is \"what we're trying to build toward,\" Sherwin said.\n The dragnet has stretched across the country, with arrests in Florida, California, New Hampshire and Hawaii.\n Many of the at least 150 defendants that CNN has identified have been charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct in the Capitol. The more serious charges have ranged from theft of government property, conspiracy, interstate threats, to assault on law enforcement.\n The Justice Department now has more than 400 subjects in its investigation, Sherwin said Tuesday.\n The FBI's Steven D'Antuono said the agency has received 200,000 digital media tips from the public about the insurrection.\n Law enforcement officials have told CNN they expect hundreds of more riot participants to be arrested in the future. But they also say investigators have begun to focus on the more complex cases, like extremist groups that participated in the attack, and less on the low-hanging fruit arrests and charges.\n Sherwin said prosecutors are building toward charging Capitol riot defendants with sedition, as well as looking groups from various states who coordinated coming to the Capitol and in other long-term planning.\n \"We are going to reach a plateau I think in the very near future ... and the plateau will involve in looking at the more complicated conspiracy cases related to possible coordination among militia groups,\" Sherwin said.\n So far, the Justice Department had been bringing cases against people largely identified on the Internet, for violent entry and trespassing, and some violence toward police and weapons charges.\n The cases that have resulted in arrests already are progressing slowly, with many of the defendants going before federal judges in their home states before they move to Washington, DC. There's a bottleneck as well in the DC federal court, and many haven't yet seen a judge or had their charges formally indicted. The Justice Department has agreed to let many of the defendants be released as they await trials, with various restrictions including stay-away-orders from DC.\n A few defendants, such as men who allegedly threatened to kill lawmakers or brought bombs to the Capitol, will stay in detention, judges have ruled, and a handful are sitting in jail as federal judges review their detention decisions.\n Over the course of the riot, prosecutors say approximately 81 Capitol Police and 58 DC Metro police officers were assaulted. Capitol Hill officer Brian Sicknick died responding to the riot, \"due to injuries sustained while on-duty,\" according to a Capitol Police statement.\n D'Antuono, the FBI assistant director in Washington, DC, told reporters Tuesday that investigators are still looking for Capitol rioters who assaulted law enforcement officers and the person or people responsibility for planting pipe bombs outside of Republican and Democratic party headquarters buildings.\n The agency is still offering a $75,000 reward for help in the pipe bomb investigation, D'Antuono said.\n \"It is challenging, it is complex and it is big ... at the FBI, we do big, we do challenging, we do complex,\" D'Antuono said in a news conference. \"This case is unique in its magnitude and number of subjects.\"\n The flurry of arrests and charges takes place against the backdrop of the new Biden administration beginning to take the reins of the Justice Department, which could speak to their continued absence.\n Filing such major charges would likely require sign-off from the new Biden administration officials at Justice headquarters, which is currently led by acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson and acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. Senate confirmation for Biden's pick for Attorney General Merrick Garland and deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco is likely weeks away.\n Sedition is a Civil War-era law that brings up to 20-year penalties for plotting to overthrow the US government and to use force to oppose US government authority or to delay the execution of a US law. Last summer, amid street protests following the police killing of George Floyd, then-Attorney General William Barr encouraged federal prosecutors to use the law against leftist protesters, a move that no one made.\n This story has been updated with information from the FBI and Justice Department.",

(AP) \u2014 One person is dead after a tornado tore through an Alabama city north of Birmingham Monday night, leaving the area with crumpled buildings and downed trees.\n Fultondale Police Chief D.P. Smith said a young man trapped in the basement of his home was pronounced dead at the scene around 3 a.m. Tuesday, AL.com\u00a0reported.\n Smith said a tree fell onto the victim\u2019s home, causing it to collapse. The victim and his family took shelter in the basement and were trapped inside, Smith said.\n The victim is believed to be a teen. Smith said several other family members were critically injured and one escaped harm.\n At least a half dozen people have been hospitalized since the tornado hit the Fultondale area of Jefferson County late Monday night.\n Injuries range from minor to severe but search and rescue efforts are still ongoing, said James Coker, the director of the Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency.\n \u201cOur current goal is always life safety,\u201d Coker said. \u201cThat is not only for the people who may have been injured but also the first responders who assist them.\u201d\n Coker said Interstate 65 near Walker Chapel Road is closed due to downed power lines and debris. He also said workers are currently removing obstacles from the roadways.\n Several residential homes and buildings were damaged in the storm, including a Hampton Inn hotel, which sustained significant structural damage.\n Coker said residents are being urged to remain alert and stay out of the area to allow first responders to continue operations.\n The damage is being evaluated to determine the strength of the tornado, the\u00a0National Weather Service\u00a0in Birmingham said.\n A tornado watch has been lifted in Jefferson County but nearby areas including Clanton and western Georgia are still being monitored.",

        "body_text": "A dramatic new video makes a strong case that then-President\u00a0Donald Trump incited the deadly storming of the U.S. Capitol, using his own words and featuring rioters convinced they were following Trump\u2019s orders as they breached the building.\n The 10-minute video, posted by Just Security, an online forum hosted by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law, is a compilation of scenes, many taken from the right-wing social media platform Parler.\n \u201cThe videos, along with other information in the public record, provide strong evidence of a causal link between Trump\u2019s messages to his supporters and their dangerous, illegal conduct,\u201d Just Security noted in a statement on its website. They also demonstrate that \u201cTrump placed the life of Vice President Mike Pence, among others, in grave danger,\u201d it added. Five people, including a police officer, were killed in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters following his remarks at a rally near the White House.\n \u201cPresident Trump said we are not giving up the White House. He said we are going to fight,\u201d said one supporter on the Just Security video. \u201cWe\u2019re here to take our country back.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019re not messing around.\u201d\n Trump urged the crowd to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d\n The House has impeached Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d and formally forwarded the charge Monday to the Senate for trial, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 9. Democratic lawmakers were studying the Just Security video to aid them in their trial strategy to highlight Trump\u2019s incendiary comments and his supporters\u2019 response, The Washington Post reported.\n They believe such visuals will be the key to prosecuting Trump by clearly revealing his own compelling words, the violent response by his supporters and the peril lawmakers faced as they were trapped inside the Capitol during the insurrection.\n Even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Trump \u201cprovoked\u201d the mob that moved on the Capitol with his words and his lies that the presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won, was rife with vote fraud.\n Check out the entire Just Security video up top.",

The design is similar to the red jerseys with a blue \u201cW\u201d and white stars that the Capitals wore for the 2015 Winter Classic at Nationals Park.\n This isn\u2019t the first time that Washington has worn a blue alternate since the \u201cRock the Red\u201d era began in 2007. The team\u2019s last predominantly blue jersey was the navy \u201cCaps\u201d design the Capitals wore for their Stadium Series outdoor game in Annapolis in 2018.\n The Capitals\u2019 new third jersey will be part of their rotation for the next three seasons and replaces the third jersey modeled after the franchise\u2019s original red sweater that Washington had worn since the 2018-19 season. The blue alternate is the second new look the Capitals have introduced this season. The team will wear its \u201cReverse Retro\u201d jerseys, which feature the screaming eagle logo the franchise sported from 1995 to 2007, in four games this season.\n According to the team, the \u201cW\u201d on the front of the third jersey, which incorporates the Washington Monument, \u201cserves as a tribute to Washington, D.C.,\u201d while the three red stars represent Maryland, the District and Virginia.\n The Capitals will wear their third jerseys, which are available for purchase online, one time against each of their East Division opponents at home. Here\u2019s the full third jersey schedule:\n Tuesday vs. New York Islanders\n Feb. 7 vs. Philadelphia Flyers\n Feb. 21 vs. New York Rangers\n March 25 vs. New Jersey Devils\n April 8 vs. Boston Bruins\n April 15 vs. Buffalo Sabres\n May 1 vs. Pittsburgh Penguins\n Read more from The Post:\n Undermanned Capitals settle for a point in shootout loss to the Sabres\n Nationals and left-handed reliever Brad Hand agree to a one-year deal\n Wizards finally get back on the court, fall to the Spurs in San Antonio\n Washington\u2019s new front office is facing an important offseason, starting at QB",

        "body_text": "LONDON \u2014 Google says it\u2019s making progress on plans to revamp Chrome user tracking technology aimed at improving privacy even as it faces challenges from regulators and officials.\n The company gave an update Monday on its work to remove from its Chrome browser so-called third-party cookies, which are used by a website\u2019s advertisers or partners and can be used to track a user\u2019s internet browsing habits.\n Third-party cookies been a longtime source of privacy concerns and Google said a year ago that it would do away with them, in an announcement that shook up the online advertising industry.\n The changes will affect Chrome, the world\u2019s dominant web browser, as well as other browsers based on Google\u2019s Chromium technology such as Microsoft\u2019s Edge. Rival browsers Safari and Mozilla Firefox have already removed third-party cookies by default but Google is taking a more gradual approach.\n In a blog post, Google\u2019s group product manager for user trust and privacy, Chetna Bindra, sought to ease fears about the project, saying the proposals will \u201chelp publishers and advertisers succeed while also protecting people\u2019s privacy as they move across the web.\u201d\n Google said it was releasing new data on one proposed technology, which does away with \u201cindividual identifiers\u201d and instead groups users into large demographic flocks.\n The technique hides individual users in the online crowd and keeps a person\u2019s web history private on a device\u2019s browser. Tests results showed it can be an effective replacement for third party cookies, and advertisers can expect to see \u201cat least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising,\u201d Bindra said.\n Conversions are actions users take when they see an ad, such as clicking to make a purchase or watch a video. Advertisers will be able to test out the system for themselves in the coming months.\n Marketers for an Open Web, a U.K. industry lobbying group, said Google\u2019s announcement did nothing to ease concerns voiced by the ad industry and regulators and questioned whether the company\u2019s data showed what it claimed.\n Google\u2019s plan has drawn scrutiny from Britain\u2019s competition watchdog, which this month opened an investigation into whether it could undermine online ad competition and entrench Google\u2019s dominant position in the digital advertising industry.\n U.S. officials are also challenging Google\u2019s behavior. A group of states filed a lawsuit against the company last month accusing it of \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d in the online ad industry.\n ___\n For all of AP\u2019s tech coverage, visit https://apnews.com/hub/technology\n ___\n Follow Kelvin Chan at https://www.twitter.com/chanman\n Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

        "title": "As Angry Farmers Take to New Delhi\u2019s Streets, Protests Turn Violent",
        "body_text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 Thousands of protesting farmers poured into New Delhi on Tuesday, using their tractors to pull apart barricades and challenging government forces who fired tear gas, blocked internet access and charged demonstrators with bamboo sticks to bring some order to a capital that felt under siege.\n It was the most violent escalation in two months of generally peaceful protests that have tested the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in unprecedented ways, forcing it to offer concessions to aggrieved farmers on new market-friendly laws that were intended to overhaul the country\u2019s agriculture sector. But the farmers have insisted on nothing short of repealing the laws that were pushed through Parliament in September, leaving them, they say, vulnerable to corporate greed.\n The deadlock boiled over in what \u2014 for Mr. Modi at least \u2014 was an embarrassing showdown that came on a national holiday and in the midst of a pandemic and economic slowdown that have also challenged his leadership.\n As Mr. Modi, in a red turban, saluted his officers and watched his country\u2019s latest warplanes fly over a grand parade marking 72 years since India\u2019s inception as a republic, protesters riding atop tens of thousands of tractors were dismantling barricades and rumbling toward the city center.\n By late evening, at least one person had died and many parts of the city seemed unnerved. Farm leaders, who had promised their march would be peaceful but had clearly lost control, distanced themselves from the violence and appealed to the protesters to return to the campsites they have occupied for the past two months at the capital\u2019s borders.\n The Delhi police said 86 members of its force were wounded.\n \u201cFarmer agitators broke the agreed terms and started their march much before the agreed time,\u201d the Delhi police said in a statement. \u201cThe agitators chose the path of violence and destruction.\u201d\n Several rounds of talks between the farmers and the government over the new laws failed to bring a resolution. By choosing to carry out the tractor march on a day that eyes would be fixed on New Delhi for the parade (guests in previous years included the presidents of the United States, Russia, and France), the farmers were aiming for a show of force.\n But by the end of Tuesday, attention was focused on the chaos and clashes, and it was unclear whether the farmers had flexed their muscles or weakened their position. Until now, their cause had drawn wide popular support for how disciplined the tens of thousands farmers had remained during two months camping out in the cold and rain.\n As the farm protests have grown in size in recent weeks, Mr. Modi\u2019s government offered to amend some parts of the new laws, which it said were intended to inject private investment into the troubled sector. The country\u2019s highest court also intervened, ordering the government to suspend the laws until it found a resolution with the protesters.\n But the farmers said they would not take anything less than a complete repeal, and pressed on with their tractor march into the city. The government even made a failed, last-ditch effort to get the high court to restrain the farmers on security grounds.\n Tensions were high leading up to Tuesday, with some officials claiming that the protests had been infiltrated by insurgent elements who would resort to violence. Just days earlier, the farmers\u2019 leaders brought in front of the media a young man they claimed to have detained on suspicion of plotting to shoot the leaders and disrupt the rally. Neither set of claims could be independently verified.\n On the eve of the event, leaders of the farming unions insisted that they would carry out a peaceful march with about 150,000 tractors, and that more than 3,000 volunteers would ensure the routes negotiated with the Delhi police would be followed. Maps of the routes suggested a compromise that could allow the protesters to enter the city but not get close to sensitive institutions.\n The farmers even announced their next event: a march on foot to the Indian Parliament on Feb. 1, when the country\u2019s new budget will be presented. Whether that protest will proceed after Tuesday\u2019s violence was unclear.\n \u201cRemember, our aim is not to conquer Delhi, but to win over the hearts of the people of this country,\u201d the farmers said in instructions posted online for marchers, who were told not to carry weapons \u2014 \u201cnot even sticks\u201d \u2014 and to avoid provocative slogans and banners.\n \u201cThe trademark of this agitation has been that it\u2019s peaceful,\u201d Balbir Singh Rajewal, one of the movement\u2019s main leaders, said late Monday. \u201cMy request to our farmer brothers, to our youth, is that they keep this movement peaceful. The government is spreading rumors, the agencies have started misguiding people. Beware of it.\u201d\n \u201cIf we remain peaceful, we\u2019ve won,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we turn violent, Modi will win.\u201d\n But soon into the march, it became clear the leaders had lost control.\n At the city\u2019s border with the village of Ghazipur, one of the spots where farmers have camped, tractors pushed aside a shipping container blocking their route as the police stood by. Elsewhere, thick clouds of tear gas rose over approved march routes as farmers on tractors, horseback and foot forcefully began their rally hours ahead of schedule, or tried to go off the ring road and push their way toward the city center.\n \u201cWhat will the government do now?\u201d said Anil Kumar, 52, an electrician who watched the chaos from the roadside with his 6-year-old son. \u201cEven if you are in a family and three people agree with something and one person doesn\u2019t, you have to find a way. The laws might be good. But if you are the prime minister, in a big position, you have to convince these people.\u201d\n Large groups of tractors and protesters broke away from the approved protest routes \u2014 tipping over buses and clashing with overwhelmed police officers armed with bamboo batons \u2014 as they marched toward central Delhi.\n The Delhi police commanders deployed officers with assault rifles deeper into the routes as they tried to guard key roads. But they appeared to be outnumbered and largely helpless. In some areas, police officers beat protesters with their sticks to push them back.\n The farmers managed to breach the Red Fort, the iconic palace that once served as the residence of India\u2019s Mughal rulers, and hoisted a flag atop the fort that is often flown on Sikh temples. A large number of the protesting farmers are from Punjab, a predominantly Sikh part of the country. Many carried long swords, tridents, sharp daggers and battle axes \u2014 functional if largely ceremonial weapons customary to some Sikh sects.\n Many of the protesters were maskless, shunning a basic protection against Covid-19 infection that risked turning the march into a super-spreader event.\n By noon, some wondered if the tractor march was actually a ploy by the farmers to finally enter the capital and stay until their demands were met. In a movement that felt leaderless, some of the protesters suggested that was exactly their wish.\n \u201cOnce we make it inside Delhi, we\u2019re not going anywhere until Modi repeals the law,\u201d said Happy Sharma, a farmer from the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh who was among 27 people riding in a trailer behind a tractor. \u201cModi is a thief!\u201d\n \u201cNo, Modi is not a thief,\u201d another farmer next to him interrupted. \u201cHe is surrounded by thieves who have him by the neck.\u201d\n Some of the most violent clashes occurred at a junction near India\u2019s income-tax office and an old headquarters of the police force as protesters tried to force their way toward the city center. Angry farmers retreated and drove their tractors on a side road that led away from the city, only after the police fired several volleys of tear gas.\n Local television channels showed farmers placing the body of a protester in the middle of a road nearby. They said the man had been shot, but that could not be independently verified. New York Times reporters in the area saw wounded people carried away who said they had been hurt when a tractor tipped over. CCTV footage that aired on local television showed one tractor flipping after crashing into a police barricade at high speed.",

        "title": "The reckoning over the nation's schools and Covid is coming",
        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n (CNN) The national reckoning over where and how schoolchildren should be educated as the pandemic drags on is finally here -- or at least it should be.\n So far this week, major districts in Chicago and New Jersey have shelved plans to physically return to the classroom at the last minute in the face of opposition from teachers. On Tuesday, the CDC released a study that found the risk of Covid transmission in the classroom is minimal when paired with precautions like mask-wearing and social-distancing.\n We know that remote learning is failing Black, Hispanic and poor students. Schools, as we've written before, are also at the fulcrum of unlocking the economy to get past Covid. Here's more evidence from Gallup about how parents of remote learners are less likely to work full time.\n The CDC's study focused on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, during in-person learning last fall. What's below is from CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, although the bolded words are mine:\n When a student or staff member tested positive for the virus, school officials used interviews to identify close contacts -- anyone who was within 6 feet of the person for longer than 15 minutes over the course of 24 hours. Those close contacts were required to quarantine at home, and if they developed symptoms during that time, officials investigated whether in-school spread was the cause.\n Here's a passage from a report by CNN's Elizabeth Stuart on Monday: Public schools in Montclair, New Jersey, were scheduled to reopen for hybrid learning for elementary school students on Monday, the first day of in-person learning for students since March 2020. But plans were scrapped at the last minute after the local teachers' union cited its safety concerns and its members refused to return to classrooms.\n Stuart, along with Mirna Alsharif, reported Tuesday the status of the 20 largest public school districts in the US:\n 9 are currently all online. (One district had briefly opened in the fall, but has been all online since the holidays.) 8 offer full in-person or a choice of full online (Several of these are in Florida, where the governor ordered brick and mortar schools to offer in-person learning) 2 have hybrid plans (some in-person and some online) 1 has a combination of plans (Hawaii's plans are based on island infection rates, so plans vary from island to island)\n Even in districts that are open, like New York, a large number of kids are still not in the classroom -- specifically middle and high school students. Spikes in positivity rates in places where schools have remained open or opened routinely led to heated debates about whether those schools should stay open.\n You cannot, if you're a kid, go to public school. My kids' district has set a mid-February target for younger kids who choose to return to the classroom. Schools have been completely closed since March. The number of children failing classes, particularly Black and brown kids, has skyrocketed.\n But the district has missed previous markers to put special needs kids back in classrooms. It has set metrics, based on the spread of Covid in the community. It seems very unlikely those metrics will be met. Parents are expecting a notice pushing off the mid-February delay.\n All that makes the CDC's newly released report so maddening to parents wondering when their dual roles as full-time workers and daytime school aides and IT assistants will end.\n \"It's not so much about the idea teachers aren't going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and as safely as we can rationally make it. We can do that. We should be able to open up every school kindergarten through eighth grade if, in fact, we administer these tests,\" he said.\n It's a bold promise, since the federal government does not currently -- nor will it soon -- control local school districts. Biden signed an executive order setting as policy his goal to help get kids back in school. Read it here.\n It's a policy to issue stronger and better recommendations -- direct guidance and advice for districts from the national level. It does not provide new funds to school districts that need to upgrade facilities and invest in tests and PPE for their students. He'll need Congress and the Senate to get those funds released. And he'll need the teachers' unions to get on board. Read more here.\n Last spring, when all kids were home, the concern was about how wealthier parents could afford the time or money to create pods or hire tutors.\n But now some American kids are going to school and a large portion are not. Some are following a hybrid model. Some are all virtual. Ten months after nearly every school kid spent some time out of the classroom, the nation's children are all over the place. Read the latest on how this missing year is making American inequality worse.",

And though she shared a memorable sex scene with actor James McAvoy in 2007\u2019s \u201cAtonement,\u201d she reportedly opted for a body double for 2019\u2019s \u201cThe Aftermath.\u201d\n Elsewhere in her\u00a0\u201cChanel Connects\u201d interview,\u00a0Knightley said she feels\u00a0\u201cvery uncomfortable now trying to portray the male gaze,\u201d noting that her feelings regarding onscreen nudity have shifted since becoming a mother to daughters Edie, 5, and Delilah, 1.\n \u201cI\u2019m too vain, and [my] body has had two children now,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019d just rather not stand in front of a group of men naked.\u201d\n The two-time Oscar nominee previously opened up about the dismissive behavior she says she experienced from male colleagues in a 2018 essay, \u201cThe Weaker Sex.\u201d\n \u201cI work with men and they worry that I don\u2019t like them,\u201d she wrote at the time. \u201cIt makes them mad, it makes them sad, it makes them shout and scream. I like them. But I don\u2019t want to flirt and mother them. ... I don\u2019t want to flirt with you because I don\u2019t want to fuck you, and I don\u2019t want to mother you because I am not your mother.\u201d\n Knightley will next be seen in Camille Griffin\u2019s comedy \u201cSilent Night,\u201d which also stars Matthew Goode and Lily-Rose Depp.",

        "title": "Russians just revealed Vladimir Putin\u2019s weakness",
        "body_text": "VLADIMIR PUTIN is frequently portrayed as one of the architects of a 21st-century model of autocracy that is gaining strength globally, even as democracy stumbles in the United States and elsewhere. Events in Russia on Saturday belied that narrative. Tens of thousands of people in more than 100 cities defied freezing temperatures and riot police to join raucous protests against the Putin regime. While the Russian dictator isn\u2019t likely to be toppled soon, the unrest revealed the rotten foundations of his rule \u2014 and the opportunity that offers to democratic adversaries.\n Mr. Putin\u2019s weakness was revealed thanks to the ingenuity and stunning courage of Alexei Navalny, who survived a poisoning attack by Mr. Putin\u2019s agents in August and then returned to the country just over a week ago to take on his nemesis frontally. As expected, the 44-year-old activist was swiftly arrested. But Mr. Putin surely did not anticipate what came next: Mr. Navalny\u2019s call for demonstrations, coupled with his release of an extraordinary, 112-minute video documenting Mr. Putin\u2019s corruption, including the Versailles-scale palace he has secretly constructed on the shores of the Black Sea. By Monday, the video had accumulated more than 89 million views on YouTube \u2014 and thousands of Russians who had never before protested against Mr. Putin had taken to the streets.\n Russian observers pointed out that many of those who showed up in Moscow, where the Reuters news agency estimated the crowd at 40,000, were not the educated liberals who in the past have protested Mr. Putin\u2019s stolen elections and constitutional revisions. Many were young workers; some clashed with police. Their aim was not to demand fair elections but to oust Mr. Putin, whose rating in polls has plummeted following years of economic stagnation and a poor response to the covid-19 epidemic. Their loyalty is to Mr. Navalny, who has made the elite\u2019s corruption his overriding cause.\n Mr. Putin tried to portray Mr. Navalny as inconsequential, banning him from elections and refusing to utter his name. Then he tried to have him killed, dispatching agents of the FSB spy agency to poison him with a banned chemical weapon. But on Monday, Mr. Putin was on the defensive, forced to publicly deny that the Black Sea palace belongs to him or his relatives \u2014 \u201cNever!\u201d he insisted. Meanwhile, state television abruptly turned its attention to Mr. Navalny, predictably claiming he was a tool of Western interests.\n In fact, Mr. Navalny is hardly pro-Western, but he is seeking to bring about democratic change in Russia. In 2019, he skillfully organized opposition candidates in local elections. He offers Western governments the opportunity to get behind an authentic, homegrown and increasingly potent resistance to Mr.\u00a0Putin\u2019s autocracy. To its credit, the Biden administration and European Union have spoken out clearly: The State Department called Sunday for Mr. Navalny\u2019s \u201cimmediate and unconditional release.\u201d\n The statement should be accompanied by actions. All those in the Putin regime who bear responsibility for the imprisonment of Mr. Navalny or the repression of protests should be sanctioned. Financial authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere should identify and, if possible, freeze looted Russian assets stashed in Western banks and real estate. At stake is not just Mr. Navalny\u2019s movement, but the need for democracy to prevail in what has become a fateful new contest with autocracy.\n Read more:\n Max Boot: Biden must act to save Navalny\u2019s life \u2014 and hopes of freedom in Russia\n The Post\u2019s View: Putin\u2019s arrest of Navalny reveals his true colors\n The Post\u2019s View: Putin has the power to crush Navalny when he returns to Russia. He\u2019ll be the loser if he does.\n The Post\u2019s View: Russia\u2019s leading dissident just exposed the spy team sent to kill him\n The Post\u2019s View: America needs to reinforce the message to Putin that killing your critics is wrong",

        "body_text": "(CNN Business) Amateur investors continued a frenzied runup of GameStop for the fourth session in a row, with the stock ending Tuesday up more than 92%, or about $148 a share.\n After the market closed, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk appeared to join the pile-on with a tweet that sent GameStop shares briefly above $200. His one-word comment \u2014 \"Gamestonk!!\" \u2014 was all it took to cheer on the the popular Reddit page that's been generating most of the hype around the stock.\n That was the second Musk tweet in 24 hours to create a stir for an individual stock \u2014 Etsy shares spiked in premarket trading Tuesday following his declaration that he \"kinda\" loves the online craft market.\n GameStop is up more than 680% so far this year \u2014 an improbable spike led by investors congregating on the WallStreetBets subreddit. Those traders have essentially declared war on GameStop's short sellers \u2014 investors who have placed bets that a stock would go down. The more GameStop climbs, the more money the short sellers lose.\n The Reddit traders are also piling onto other struggling companies that short sellers tend to see as overvalued, including BlackBerry (BB),\u00a0Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY),\u00a0Macy's (M)\u00a0and\u00a0AMC (AMC).",

        "title": "Senate confirms Janet Yellen as first female treasury secretary",
        "body_text": "Janet Yellen was confirmed as the first female secretary of the Treasury Department by the Senate on Monday evening.\n Yellen\u2019s confirmation process caused little controversy, as the former Federal Reserve chair has long-standing ties to Senate policymakers and extensive economic and government credentials.\n The final vote was 84 to 15, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) among those supporting Yellen.\n The Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously last week to send Yellen\u2019s confirmation to the full Senate, with several Senate Republicans on the committee praising her qualifications for the position.\n Yellen, 74, spent years as a professor before entering politics as head of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers in the late 1990s. She chaired the Fed from 2014 to 2018, playing a key role in the recovery after the Great Recession. President Donald Trump broke with tradition when he opted not to reappoint her in 2017, instead selecting Jerome H. Powell to lead the central bank.\n The Brooklyn-born treasury secretary will try to stabilize an American economy facing its worst crisis in decades. Yellen\u2019s most immediate task will be shepherding President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion economic relief package through Congress amid pushback from Republicans and even some centrist Democrats. She will also face a daunting international portfolio that stretches from sanctions on foreign countries to U.S. trade agreements.\n Beyond facing the immediate coronavirus crisis, Yellen will play a critical role in Biden\u2019s efforts to reduce income inequality and approve an economic recovery package focused on creating manufacturing and clean-energy jobs that is expected to be introduced next month.\n \u201cWe are living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built upon wealth, while working families fell farther and farther behind,\u201d Yellen said during her confirmation hearing last week. \u201cWe have to rebuild our economy so that it creates more prosperity, for more people, and ensures that American workers can compete in an increasingly competitive global economy.\u201d\n Yellen will replace Steven Mnuchin, the Wall Street financier who was one of Trump\u2019s closest aides. McConnell voted to confirm Yellen but criticized Senate Democrats for their delay in confirming Trump\u2019s treasury pick four years ago.\n \u201cWhen the American people elect a president, and when that president selects qualified and mainstream people for key posts, the whole nation deserves for them to be able to assemble their team,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor on Monday.\n Yellen\u2019s confirmation as the first female treasury secretary follows a career of firsts. In 1971, Yellen was the only woman in her class to receive an economics PhD from Yale University. She was also the only female economics professor for part of her time teaching at Harvard University.\n That record has inspired generations of female economists in Washington and within the profession itself. Now, as the pandemic disproportionately pulls women from the workforce, in large part because of child-care issues, economists say Yellen\u2019s credentials, and the symbolism of her confirmation, are a timely match.\n \u201cOne of the deficiencies we\u2019ve seen is when you have homogeneity among a group of policymakers, even when they are well-intentioned,\u201d said Kathryn Judge, an expert on financial regulation at Columbia Law School. \u201cThere are certain challenges they\u2019ll be less inclined to see, and therefore less inclined to address.\u201d\n Yellen was the first woman at the helm of the Fed, which she chaired from 2014 to 2018.\n The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent when Yellen left the Fed, far lower than when she took over. She was also credited with openly raising issues related to inequality in speeches and public remarks. Rather than turning to the unemployment rate alone, Yellen, a labor economist, created a dashboard of various indicators \u2014 including the job openings rate and average hourly earnings \u2014 to check the pulse of the labor market.\n On monetary policy, Yellen has been criticized for raising interest rates from near zero in 2015, with some of the left arguing that the increase slowed the economy prematurely and undermined the Fed\u2019s mission of full employment. At the time, many Fed leaders feared that such low unemployment would, in turn, trigger an unwanted spike in inflation. That approach has since been overhauled by the central bank, which now maintains that interest rates can be kept lower for longer without causing a bump in inflation.\n \u201cShe understands how distinct this time is for the labor market, particularly for the lowest-wage workers out there,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation for low-wage workers that could cause some very deep scars, and fiscal policy will be required.\u201d",

Then the public seemed to relish watching her personal struggles, turning her life into fodder for late-night talk show zingers, sensationalist interviewers and a thriving tabloid magazine industry.\n That was a long time ago. These days, Spears is enduring a stranger, and maybe even darker chapter: She lives under a court-sanctioned conservatorship, her rights curtailed. She is not in control of the fortune she earned as a performer.\n Spears entered the conservatorship in 2008, at age 26, when her struggles were on public display. Now she is 39, and a growing number of her fans are agitating on her behalf, raising questions about civil liberties while trying to deduce what Spears wants.\n A new feature-length documentary by The New York Times captures what the public might not know about the nature of Spears\u2019s conservatorship and her court battle with her father over who should control her estate.\n The documentary, \u201cFraming Britney Spears,\u201d features interviews with key insiders, including:\n The new film, on FX and Hulu, also explores the fervent fan base that is convinced Spears should be liberated from the conservatorship, and re-examines the media\u2019s handling of one of the biggest pop stars of all time.\n \u201cThe New York Times Presents\u201d is a series of documentaries representing the unparalleled journalism and insight of The New York Times, bringing viewers close to the essential stories of our time.",

        "title": "Man Charged With Threatening Congressman\u2019s Family as Riot Raged",
        "body_text": "The same day that a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to stop Congress from certifying President Biden\u2019s electoral victory, the brother of Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York received several troubling text messages.\n \u201cYour brother is putting your entire family at risk with his lies and other words,\u201d one of the messages read, according to a criminal complaint. \u201cWe are armed and nearby your house. You had better have a word with him. We are not far from his either.\u201d\n The message included a picture of a home near where Mr. Jeffries\u2019s brother, Hasan Jeffries, a history professor, lives.\n The source of the threats on Jan. 6 remained unclear until Tuesday, when federal authorities in New York City arrested a California man and charged him with sending those messages, among others.\n Robert Lemke, 35, of Bay Point, Calif., told Representative Jeffries\u2019s brother in the texts that he was part of a group of \u201cactive/retired law enforcement or military,\u201d and that the group had \u201carmed members near your home,\u201d according to the criminal complaint. He insisted that they were \u201cnot white supremacists.\u201d\n On the same day, the complaint said, Mr. Lemke also threatened a family member of George Stephanopoulos, the ABC News anchor and former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Lemke texted a relative of Mr. Stephanopoulos, saying that the journalist\u2019s \u201cwords are putting you and your family at risk. We are nearby armed and ready.\u201d\n The federal complaint, unsealed in Manhattan, did not identify Hakeem Jeffries or his brother by name, but the congressman\u2019s office confirmed that they were the targets in a statement. The office thanked the F.B.I. and other law enforcement authorities for protecting Mr. Jeffries\u2019s family and other members of Congress.\n Mr. Stephanopoulos was referred to only as \u201cJournalist-1\u201d in the complaint, but a person briefed on the investigation confirmed his identity. Mr. Stephanopoulos declined to comment.\n It was unclear how Mr. Lemke, who was arrested in Bay Point on Tuesday, had obtained telephone numbers for the people he was accused of threatening. Neither he nor his family members could be reached for comment on Tuesday afternoon, and it was not immediately known if he had a defense lawyer.\n Mr. Lemke was expected to appear before a federal judge in California on Wednesday. He faces one count of threatening interstate communications, the complaint said. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.\n Mr. Lemke identified himself on Facebook as a former sergeant with the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Department as well as a former captain in the United States Air Force, the complaint said.\n But a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s department, Sergeant Ray Kelly, said that Mr. Lemke had never worked there. And a spokeswoman for the Air Force said that there was no record of Mr. Lemke\u2019s having served.\n In the days after the presidential election, Mr. Lemke posted ominous messages to his Facebook account, court documents showed. In one post, he said to his followers: \u201cFolks. Be ready for war. Trump has refused to cede.\u201d\n Mr. Lemke\u2019s is the latest in a string of cases in which the former president\u2019s supporters have been arrested on charges of threatening public figures in New York and elsewhere.\n Last week, a Queens man, Brendan Hunt, was arrested on charges that he had made death threats against several prominent Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n Earlier this month, another Queens man, Eduard Florea, was charged with weapons offenses after having posted threatening messages during the riot at the Capitol. Mr. Florea wrote that the time for peace and civility was over and that \u201chere in New York we are target rich.\u201d\n The messages from Mr. Lemke in California were a further proof of just how widespread the calls for violence were on Jan. 6, the day that Congress\u2019s plan to certify the results of the election was interrupted by a mob that overran the Capitol.\n Since then, federal agents have targeted not just participants in that riot, but various others, including Mr. Lemke, who have been accused of making violent threats and taking other actions in the run-up to the inauguration that appeared aimed at keeping Mr. Biden from assuming office.",

        "title": "Seven ways to build a child\u2019s resilience during the pandemic (and long after it ends)",
        "body_text": "When Nick von Hindenburg\u00a0 moved from the Netherlands to the District at the start of seventh grade last fall, the ongoing pandemic and online school limited his opportunities to make friends. But after moving seven times and living on three continents in his 12 years, he had the skills to adapt.\n \u201cI\u2019ve never been in this exact situation before, but I\u2019ve had to adjust to different cultures, traditions and ways of teaching,\u201d Nick said.\n He understands that life is more like a jungle gym than a ladder, said his mother, Anisha Abraham, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s National Hospital and author of \u201cRaising Global Teens: A\u00a0Practical Handbook for Parenting in the 21st Century.\u201d \u201cChallenge and change have made him stronger.\u201d\n For many children across the United States, the pandemic is the first time they\u2019ve had to deal with a disruption of this scale, and some are faring better than others. As a school counselor, I know that parents of struggling kids feel powerless and worry about long-term emotional fallout. Although caregivers can\u2019t always alter children\u2019s circumstances or shield them from discomfort, they can offer a more enduring gift: tools to manage adversity.\n \u201cResilience works like a muscle we can build through effort and repetition, and we want to keep our muscles strong and flexible, so we can think of many ways to solve a problem,\u201d says Mary Alvord, co-author of \u201cResilience Builder Program for Children and Adolescents.\u201d \u201cAt the core, resilience is the belief that while you can\u2019t control everything in your life, there are many aspects you\u00a0can control, including your attitude.\u201d\n Here are seven ways adults can help children cope with adversity and retain a hopeful outlook during the pandemic \u2014 and long after it ends.\n Fan the flames on children\u2019s passions to give them a sense of purpose, a distraction from distress and a way to connect with like-minded peers. Nick has discovered, for example, that building and painting stave off boredom during coronavirus shutdowns. He made his holiday gifts this year, and he recently designed a lemonade dispenser out of cardboard and tinfoil.\n When Abraham\u2019s son Kai, 10, had a hard time adjusting to online learning and yearned to spend more time with friends, she signed him up for an outdoor book club with other fourth- and\u00a0fifth-grade boys who enjoy reading.\n \u201cI got to know kids on my street and share something I love,\u201d Kai said. The boys like to discuss books that feature characters navigating similarly difficult situations, such as \u201cHatchet\u201d and \u201cHoot.\u201d Kai also adores animals, so he started walking a neighbor\u2019s dog \u2014 the highlight of his day.\n As the pandemic drags on, now with less  daylight, many children (and their caregivers) are running on empty. Endurance athletes have to dig deep when their reserves are low, so I asked professional ski mountaineer Caroline Gleich how she sustains her stamina. \u201cI constantly check in with myself,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I summited Everest in 2019, I had to be super honest and ask: \u2018Am I thinking clearly? Is summit fever clouding my decision-making? Are my fingers okay? Do I have enough energy?\u2019\u2009\u201d\n Help children assess their energy levels and what will refuel their tanks. Do they need time to escape into a novel? A reminder that this won\u2019t last forever? A break from social media? A mental health day? Help setting realistic goals or asserting their needs?\n Some children may simply need reassurance that they\u2019re up to the challenge. \u201cWhen I climbed Cho Oyu \u2014 the sixth-highest peak in the world \u2014 I got very sick with pulmonary edema and had to go back,\u201d Gleich recalls. \u201cI told my physician I was depleted and terrified. She said, \u2018Caroline, we\u2019re capable of so much more than we know,\u2019 and that\u2019s become a mantra for me when I\u2019m super drained.\u201d\n Acknowledge small victories, even if it\u2019s just getting off the couch or making it through another day of online school. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from injuries and setbacks to find places to celebrate,\u201d Gleich says, \u201clike running my first 5K after ACL reconstructive surgery, even though I\u2019d run marathons before.\u201d\n At the same time, recognize that no child (or adult) can always hold it together. Give your child the space and permission to, at times, fall apart.\n Draw on children\u2019s interests to help them solve problems. Ryan C.T. DeLapp, a psychologist with the Montefiore Health System in\u00a0New York, challenges groups of his Lego-loving clients to build a structure without talking.\n \u201cWe have to think of an alternative strategy, such as using a whiteboard, gesturing or writing down our instructions,\u201d he says. He uses the STEPS approach, asking kids to state the problem, think of multiple solutions, explore the pros and cons of each option, and pick a solution and backup solution.\n Help children anticipate stressful situations and how they might respond, whether it\u2019s getting cut from a team or rejected from a college. \u201cWhen I worked with kindergarten and first-grade students,\u201d DeLapp says, \u201cI would use the analogy of going to the ice cream store and ask, \u2018What if they\u2019re out of your favorite ice cream? What are options B and C, and what are the pros of those, even if option A isn\u2019t available?\u2019\u2009\u201d When kids use problem-solving skills, praise them for being flexible, despite disappointment.\n \u201cA huge element of resilience is being able to identify a goal for yourself, to be able to tolerate the discomfort that\u2019s creating resistance toward that goal and \u2014 once you meet that goal \u2014 being able to celebrate it,\u201d DeLapp says.\n Individualize kids\u2019 brave goals. If children are struggling to show their face on camera during online school, you might ask: \u201cIs not being on camera interfering with your academics or likely to make it harder for you to be visual socially when the pandemic ends?\u201d If they feel awkward being on camera but value confidence and having positive self-worth, then keeping the camera off could be impeding their goals, DeLapp says. \u201cThat represents an opportunity for a brave goal.\u201d\n Make time to reflect on progress toward their brave goals, and express gratitude and excitement when they meet them.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t completely control the restrictions placed on us to keep us safe during the pandemic, or missing out on playdates and school activities, or economic hardships of the family,\u201d but children are not helpless, Alvord says.\n Start a dialogue about what children think they can and can\u2019t control, she says. \u201cCan they control their reaction if a friend says something negative? Can they make choices about what they do during their free time?\u201d\n Then convey that they have options and can be proactive. Alvord suggests saying: \u201c\u2009\u2018What is going well? What is not going well? If something is not going well, what thoughts, statements or actions might be helpful?\u2019\u2009\u201d She recommends solving problems out loud to model for children that there is more than one way to handle something.\n Many children have lost their go-to coping strategies during the pandemic, such as playing sports or seeing friends, says social worker Amy Morin, editor in chief of Verywell Mind, an online resource for mental health. \u201cSaying, \u2018You seem frustrated,\u2019 or, \u2018You look sad,\u2019 can take the sting out of emotions\u201d and help them get to the problem-solving stage, she says.\n Encourage children to experiment with coping strategies, such as painting, writing in a journal, deep breathing, taking a walk or calling a friend. Afterward, have\u00a0them rank their mood on a scale of\u00a0one to 10. \u201cIf it\u2019s a four,\u00a0say,\u00a0\u2018What\u00a0can we do to\u00a0get\u00a0you\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0six?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u00a0Morin says.\n Label your own emotions, too, and tell your child how you\u2019re going to manage them. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to burden them with adult emotions, but they\u2019re going to pick up on your distress whether you mention it or not,\u201d Morin says. \u201cIf you say, \u2018I\u2019m stressed about an issue at work, so I\u2019m going to take a walk,\u2019 then the kid knows, \u2018Okay, mom is stressed, but she\u2019s taking care of herself, so it\u2019s going to be okay.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n Validate that the past year has involved hardship and frustration, and help your child identify any skills or insights gained because of the pandemic. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just positive thinking. It\u2019s \u2018the power of and\u2019 \u2014 acknowledging that two things can be true at the same time,\u201d DeLapp says. \u201cIf we\u2019re too positive, it can become an empty platitude. The \u2018and\u2019 addresses our natural instinct to dichotomize an experience and call it either good or bad.\u201d\n The pandemic has interrupted normalcy, but it has also \u201cstripped away certain things that we\u2019ve relied on pretty heavily, and that aren\u2019t all that necessary,\u201d DeLapp says. For example, many teens have realized that they\u2019ve been defining themselves by their academics. \u201cTheir whole schedule was geared toward getting the right r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and covid created an opportunity to take a step back, reevaluate what\u2019s important and recover from that pace.\u201d\n To demonstrate that there\u2019s more to an experience than the pain we\u2019re experiencing, DeLapp will show a child a photograph, then zoom in on a specific detail. \u201cI\u2019ll ask, \u2018If we only focus on this one part, does that mean the rest of it doesn\u2019t exist?\u2019\u2009\u201d\n Even as you help children to live in a more realistic place with shades of gray, encourage them to hang on to moments of joy. As Morin says: \u201cWe talk about resilience as bouncing back from hard times, but mental strength also is about living your best life when life is going well.\u201d",

        "title": "East Coast hit with massive internet outage, disrupting remote work and virtual school",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Many people living on America's East Coast were without Internet for part of Tuesday because of Verizon Fios service issues.\n Tens of thousands of people reported outages from Boston to New York to Washington and locations in between, according to Downdetector.com, a website that tracks complaints about service disruptions. People also reported outages on several other services, including Gmail, Zoom and Slack as well.\n Verizon acknowledged the disruption to its service, although it didn't say whether problems with Fios were the root cause of customers' unreliable access to various internet services. Google (GOOGL), Slack and Zoom did not report any outages.\n \"We are aware of an issue impacting the quality of Fios service throughout the Northeast corridor,\" said Rich Young, spokesman for Verizon. \"Our network team is fully engaged. We are working through the root cause and have already seen service levels start to restore.\"\n The US Federal Communications Commission said it was investigating the outage.\n \"We have seen reports of internet-related outages on the East Coast, making it difficult for people to work  remotely and go to school online,\" said Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a tweet. \"The FCC Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is working to get to the bottom of what is going on.\"\n Although Verizon (VZ) did not explain the cause of the outage, Verizon noted on its verified Twitter account shortly before noon ET that a fiber had been cut in Brooklyn, New York, with no estimated time for a fix.\n Fiber cuts can happen for a number of reasons, including accidents during construction, fires or utility problems. It's not clear what the cause of Tuesday's fiber cut was.\n Internet service companies typically have multiple redundancies built into their network, so when customers lose access to part of the network, other locations will make up for the loss. But the extra, rerouted traffic can make internet speeds slower -- particularly when traffic is high, such as when millions of people are working from home.\n -- CNN's Brian Fung contributed to this report",

        "title": "How Travel Restrictions Work",
        "body_text": "One of the biggest lessons of the pandemic has been the success of travel restrictions at reducing its spread. And this is a moment when they have the potential to be particularly effective in the U.S., given the emergence of frightening coronavirus variants in other countries.\n President Biden seems to realize this, and quickly reinstated some travel restrictions that President Donald Trump had lifted just before leaving office. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether Biden is willing to impose the kind of strict rules that have worked best elsewhere. So far, he has not done so and instead chosen a middle ground between Trump\u2019s approach and the approach with the best global track record.\n Many of the places that have contained the virus have relied on travel restrictions. The list includes Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Canada\u2019s four Atlantic provinces. At key points, they imposed severe restrictions on who could enter.\n There is a crucial word in that sentence: severe. Travel bans work only when countries don\u2019t give in to political temptation by allowing a lot of exceptions.\n Barring citizens from other countries while freely allowing your own citizens to return, for example, is ineffectual. \u201cViruses don\u2019t care what passport you carry,\u201d my colleague Donald G. McNeil Jr., who\u2019s been covering infectious diseases since the 1990s, told me.\n Voluntary quarantines generally don\u2019t work, either. People don\u2019t adhere to them. Many take mild precautions and then describe themselves as \u201cquarantining.\u201d As Donald says: \u201cFor it to work, it has to be mandatory \u2014 and actually enforced. And not at home.\u201d\n Australia crushed the spread of the virus in the spring partly by ending its voluntary quarantine and requiring all arrivals, including Australian citizens, to spend two weeks in a hotel. The military then helped enforce the rules. China and some other Asian countries took similar steps. In eastern Canada, tough entry rules were \u201cone of the most successful things we\u2019ve done,\u201d Dr. Susan Kirkland, a Nova Scotia official, has said.\n Travel bans had such a big effect, Dr. Jared Baeten, a prominent epidemiologist, told me last year, that public-health experts should re-examine their longtime skepticism of them. \u201cTravel,\u201d he said, \u201cis the hallmark of the spread of this virus around the world.\u201d\n Last year, the U.S. became a case study in the ineffectiveness of limited travel rules after Trump announced a ban on entry from China. But it wasn\u2019t a real ban. It did not apply to U.S. citizens or their immediate family members, among others. Trump also did little to restrict entry from Europe. Despite his claims, the restrictions had little effect.\n The Biden administration now risks a repeat.\n Infectious variants of the virus are spreading in Brazil and South Africa, and they could be even more dangerous than a variant previously found in Britain, scientists say. In response, Biden is restricting entry from Europe, Brazil and South Africa, but the policy has multiple exceptions: Americans can return home from these places if they have recently tested negative, even though the test result may not be current.\n The politics of travel bans are certainly thorny. Businesses worry about the economic impact (as The New Yorker\u2019s Lawrence Wright noted in a fascinating radio interview with Terry Gross). Progressives worry about stoking anti-immigration views. And it\u2019s already too late to keep the variants out of the U.S. entirely.\n Still, travel restrictions can save a lot of lives, even now. The U.S. is in a race \u2014 to vaccinate as many people as possible before they contract the virus. The new variants are the biggest new challenge in that race. \u201cI am worried about these variants,\u201d Dr. Vivek Murthy, the co-chair of Biden\u2019s virus task force, said on the first episode of Ezra Klein\u2019s Times podcast.\n Biden\u2019s travel restrictions will almost certainly have some impact, by keeping out some infected people. But Biden\u2019s policy stops short of minimizing the virus\u2019s spread.\n A Morning Read: The last known female Swinhoe\u2019s softshell turtle died in 2019 \u2014 or so scientists thought.\n From Opinion: Jamelle Bouie, Ross Douthat and Jennifer Senior have columns. (And, over on the news side, a new one by DealBook\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin.)\n Lives Lived: At a time when there were few Black astrophysicists, George Carruthers developed a telescope that went to the moon on Apollo 16, producing images of Earth\u2019s outermost atmosphere, stars and galaxies. He died at 81.\n This year is the 125th anniversary of the The New York Times Book Review. It started in 1896, originally called \u201cSaturday Review of Books and Art.\u201d The first issue \u2014 eight pages \u2014 included an article about Oscar Wilde\u2019s experience in prison and another about department stores posing a threat to independent booksellers.\n Most reviewers in the early days were anonymous and simply summarized the books. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t as much opining,\u201d said Tina Jordan, an editor whose new book about the Book Review\u2019s history is due out in October. \u201cThere were exceptions, of course; a handful of books got absolutely demolished in our pages.\u201d Some headlines: \u201cWorthless Edition of a Poor Anthology,\u201d \u201cTwo Pathetic Novels,\u201d \u201cSundry Novels: Some Worth Reading and Others Not Worth the Printing.\u201d\n Earlier versions of the section were also less strict about conflicts of interest. \u201cIn the 1950s, James Baldwin and Langston Hughes reviewed each other,\u201d a practice of mutual reviews that is no longer allowed, said Pamela Paul, the editor of the Book Review. \u201cNeither was especially kind.\u201d\n You\u2019ll find 25 old reviews by notable figures here. They include Bill Gates, John F. Kennedy, Vladimir Nabokov, Toni Morrison, Patti Smith and Eudora Welty \u2014 who worked briefly as an editor at the Book Review during World War II.\n A drizzle of garlic-infused butter improves this fish dinner.\n Tyler Blevins \u2014 Ninja, to video-game fans \u2014 is the closest thing gaming has to a crossover mainstream star. The 29-year-old says he makes $500,000 a month from streaming. He spoke about what\u2019s next.\n Take a trip through snow-covered mountain passes and herds of reindeer to a remote farm in eastern Iceland.\n The late-night hosts talked about impeachment.\n The pangram from yesterday\u2019s Spelling Bee was armadillo. Today\u2019s puzzle is above \u2014 or you can play online if you have a Games subscription.\n Here\u2019s today\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Kick back and relax (five letters).\n Thanks for spending part of your morning with The Times.

        "title": "The Flaming Lips Performed to People in Literal Bubbles. Is It Safer?",
        "body_text": "There are Covid-19 bubbles \u2014 small clusters of friends or family who agree to socialize exclusively with each other during the pandemic \u2014 and then there are the kinds of bubbles the Flaming Lips used at recent concerts.\n Band members and concertgoers rocked out and bounced while encased in large individual plastic bubbles amid bright swirling lights in trippy scenes at concerts on Friday and Saturday in Oklahoma City.\n The band has taken the elaborate precautions at its live performances to protect against the transmission of the coronavirus, but some health experts were unsure about the effectiveness of those measures.\n \u201cI\u2019d need to see how the air exchange was occurring between the outside and the inside of the bubbles to be able to say if it were safe over all or reduced risk of transmission,\u201d said Dr. Eric Cioe-Pe\u00f1a, director of global health at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\n The Flaming Lips, a psych-rock band founded in the early 1980s and known for their exuberant live shows and recording experiments, had a similar concert in October, and also had performed their song \u201cRace for the Prize\u201d in June using the spheres on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n The concerts held on Friday and Saturday were originally scheduled for December, but the band postponed them because of rising Covid-19 cases in the Oklahoma City metro area.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a very restricted, weird event,\u201d the band\u2019s frontman, Wayne Coyne, told Rolling Stone last month. \u201cBut the weirdness is so we can enjoy a concert before putting our families and everybody at risk.\u201d\n \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a new normal,\u201d he added. \u201cYou might go to a show, you might not, but I think we\u2019re going to be able to work it out.\u201d\n In March, Mr. Coyne posted a sketch on Instagram showing what the bubble concert might look like.\n Nathan Poppe, a videographer and photographer documenting the show for the band, said on Twitter that the floor was set up in a grid of 10 bubbles by 10 bubbles. \u201cEach bubble may contain one person or two or maybe three,\u201d he said.\n Photos showed fans climbing inside the spheres on the concert floor, where the bubbles were then inflated with leaf blowers.\n Each bubble came equipped with a high-frequency speaker, water bottle, fan, towel and a sign if someone had to use the restroom or if it was too hot inside. If it got too stuffy inside, the bubble could be refilled with cool air, Mr. Poppe said.\n He said concertgoers could take their masks off inside the bubble but had to wear them after leaving the bubble.\n \u201cYou roll your bubble to the exit and unzip it at the door,\u201d he said.\n It was not immediately clear what became of the used bubbles after the 90-minute performances, which were attended by about 200 people each.\n Some health experts had concerns about users\u2019 safety inside the bubbles.\n \u201cThere is no evidence about the efficacy \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of these bubbles from an infectious disease transmission point of view,\u201d said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health.\n He said that virus transmission control depends on good air circulation and filtration.\n \u201cSo, in theory, if air filtration is good, protective barriers can helpfully augment and reduce risk of transmission, but I would be hesitant to attend a concert in a bubble at the moment unless this has been assessed further,\u201d he said.\n Dr. Cioe-Pe\u00f1a said the plastic bubbles used at the concerts seemed to be unventilated. But if each of the bubbles \u201chad a bidirectionally filtered air supply,\u201d he said, \u201cthis would effectively prevent Covid transmission between bubbles.\u201d\n While a plastic bubble could help reduce exposure to \u201cinfectious agents\u201d if it is filled with filtered air, it could also lead to raised carbon dioxide levels inside the bubble, said Richard E. Peltier, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n \u201cMy recommendation would be to add a small CO2 sensor to the bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cThough they aren\u2019t always the most precise, they should be sufficient to tell a concertgoer that it is time for a break and refresh that stale air. And then get back to enjoying the music safely.\u201d\n At least 48 new Covid-19 deaths and 2,941 new cases were reported in Oklahoma on Sunday, according to a New York Times database.",

        "title": "Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte To Offer Resignation As Government Wobbles",
        "body_text": "ROME (AP) \u2014 Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte intends to offer his resignation on Tuesday, his office said Monday, a move likely to be a gamble that the embattled leader will get a fresh mandate from the president to forge a more viable coalition.\n Conte survived two confidence votes in Parliament last week but crucially lost his absolute majority in the Senate with the defection of a centrist ally, ex-Premier Matteo Renzi. That hobbled his government\u2019s effectiveness in the middle of the pandemic, which has devastated Italy\u2019s long-stagnant economy.\n Conte\u2019s office said Monday night that the premier will inform his Cabinet at a meeting Tuesday morning of his \u201cwill to go to the Quirinale (presidential palace) to hand in his resignation.\u201d\n Then Conte intends to head to the palace to meet with President Sergio Mattarella, who, as head of state, can accept the resignation, possibly asking the premier to try to form a more solid coalition that can command a majority in Parliament.\n Mattarella could also reject the offer. But he has frequently stressed the need for the nation to have solid leadership as it struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic, with its devastating effects on Italy\u2019s long-stagnant economy.\n After consultations with leaders of both government and opposition parties, the president could also decide to tap someone else deemed to have better chances of forming a more solid government. If no one can forge a more viable, dependable coalition, Mattarella has the option of dissolving Parliament, setting the stage for an election two years early.\n Conte has led a long-bickering center-left coalition for 16 months. Before that, for 15 months, he headed a government still with the populist 5-Star Movement, Parliament\u2019s largest party, but in coalition with the right-wing League party of Matteo Salvini.\n That first government collapsed when Salvini yanked his support in a failed bid to win the premiership for himself.\n Key support could come from the centrist opposition party of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi. Just hours before the announcement by Conte\u2019s office, the media mogul said he was trusting the \u201cpolitical wisdom\u201d of Mattarella to indicate the way out of the crisis.\n \u201cThe high road is one only,\u201d Berlusconi said in a statement. That solution would be a \u201cnew government that would represent substantial unity of the country in a moment of emergency\u201d or it could be a new election \u201cto give back the (deciding) word to the Italian\u201d voters.\n By the end of February, the Italian government must inform the European Union how it intends to spend some 200 billion euros ($250 billion) in recovery funds, focused on reforming the country\u2019s health and other institutional systems.\n One of Renzi\u2019s issues with Conte was what he contended was too much decision-making power concentrated in the premier\u2019s hand on the funding programs.",

        "body_text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot to death early Sunday inside an Indianapolis home in an apparent targeted attack, the city\u2019s police chief said, decrying the \u201cmass murder\u201d killings as a \u201cdifferent kind of evil.\u201d\n The fatal shootings were discovered by police who had been called about 4 a.m. to investigate reports of a person shot on the city\u2019s near northeast side but first discovered a juvenile male with gunshot wounds, said Sgt. Shane Foley with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.\n No suspects were in custody as of Sunday evening.\n As officers were investigating that juvenile\u2019s shooting, Foley said police received information about 4:40 a.m., that led them to a nearby home, where they found multiple adults dead inside from apparent gunshot wounds.\n Kezzie Childs, 42, Raymond Childs, 42, Elijah Childs, 18, Rita Childs, 13, and Kiara Hawkins, 19, and the unborn child of Hawkins were pronounced dead after being found in the home, Foley said.\n Hawkins was first taken to an area hospital, but both she and the unborn child died despite life-saving efforts, Foley said.\n He said the juvenile initially found with gunshot wounds is expected to survive and police believe he was wounded in the shootings that left the five others dead, along with the unborn child.\n IMPD Chief Randal Taylor said police believe the deadly shootings were not random, but were a targeted attack carried out by an assailant or assailants.\n He said the shooting came days after police department officials had announced their latest efforts to combat violent, drug-related crimes and \u201cviolence driven by poverty or desperation.\u201d\n \u201cBut what we saw this morning was a different kind of evil. What happened this morning, based on the evidence that\u2019s been gathered so far, was mass murder,\u201d Taylor said at a news conference. \u201cMore than that, we believe it was not random.\u201d\n Taylor said it was largest mass casualty shooting in the city in more than a decade, and urged the public to contact police and pass along any information they might have on the killings.\n Mayor Joe Hogsett called the shootings \u201cmass murder,\u201d and said that an individual or individuals had brought \u201cterror to our community.\u201d He said he had contacted officials with the FBI\u2019s Indianapolis field office, the local U.S. Attorneys office and other law enforcement agencies for assistance in the shooting investigation.\n \u201cI want those responsible to know that the full might of local, state and federal law enforcement are coming for them as I speak,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "Democratic Congress Prepares to Take On Big Tech",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The last time Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, sat in the majority, her party was fawning over Silicon Valley. Lawmakers praised the ingenuity of Facebook and Amazon, while President Barack Obama and regulators fought alongside Google and Twitter to protect the growth of internet businesses.\n Now, many of those same politicians are gearing up to tame those companies. And Ms. Klobuchar, who leads the Senate panel overseeing antitrust, is expected to play a leading role.\n Many Democrats, as well as some Republicans, want to take on Big Tech with laws and regulations to address issues like market power, data privacy, and disinformation and hate speech. Those ambitions have only grown since the insurrection of Capitol Hill, with more members of Congress pointing to the power of the tech companies as the root cause of many problems.\n The growing talk of new federal laws adds to the industry\u2019s many headaches. Facebook and Google are fighting federal and state regulators in court over allegations of anticompetitive conduct. Regulators continue to investigate Amazon and Apple over antitrust violations. President Biden and his nominees for attorney general and commerce secretary have also promised to hold tech companies to account for the speech they host and to strengthen policing of competition violations.\n \u201cWe have a major monopoly and competition problem,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cPeople have just finally had it.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think people were feeling very trusting when you have angry mobs of people fed by the internet going to invade buildings or when you have foreign entities trying to invade our elections,\u201d she added.\n Ms. Klobuchar has made her critiques of the industry, and existing antitrust law, well known. Last year, during her failed run for president, she promised to get tough on the biggest tech companies. She is expected to release a book this spring that presents a case against corporate concentration \u2014 from the industrial-age trusts to Silicon Valley.\n In coming weeks, she plans to introduce a bill aimed at limiting corporate monopoly power across the economy, with a particular eye on tech. The legislation would erect new hurdles for giant corporations trying to gobble up smaller competitors, preventing a repeat of deals like Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in 2012. The federal and state lawsuits against Facebook argue that the deal, which regulators did not object to at the time, eliminated competition that could have one day challenged the company\u2019s dominance.\n The bill would also include roadblocks for acquisitions of \u201cmaverick\u201d companies that present better offerings for consumers, in the way T-Mobile did before its merger with Sprint. And it would pump more money into the antitrust agencies.\n The ideas mirror many recommendations introduced last October in a House judiciary report led by Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. But her bill won\u2019t include provisions to unwind past mergers and other structural reforms, as his report had recommended.\n Her bill, as well as other laws proposed to limit the power of the tech companies, will face steep opposition. In 2020, tech companies again spent more than other industries in Washington. Facebook, with lawsuits from federal and state enforcement officials, spent almost $20 million on lobbying, up 18 percent from the previous year. Amazon spent about $18 million in lobbying, up about 11 percent from the prior year.\n Internet start-ups are also wary of regulations that could stymie their exit strategies to merge with larger companies as well as changes to rules that could hold them liable for the content they host. And agriculture, pharmaceutical and other industries will also probably balk at changes in antitrust laws.\n But Democrats are also facing pressure from the left. Progressive groups, and some liberal lawmakers, want to dismantle the biggest companies. In a sign of the battles to come, those groups have raised concerns in recent weeks about some potential nominees for top antitrust agency roles who they say won\u2019t be aggressive enough against the industry.\n \u201cWe\u2019d hope to see the antitrust subcommittee in the Senate collaborate with the House subcommittee to enact the full suite of recommendations in the digital markets report into law,\u201d said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a left-leaning nonprofit advocacy group focused on fighting corporate power. \u201cWe won\u2019t be shy about pushing for bolder approaches when the need arises.\u201d\n Ms. Klobuchar says fresh outrage over the role of social media in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 has united lawmakers in their animus toward digital platforms, but for different reasons. Democrats are angry that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube allowed President Donald J. Trump and far-right groups to spread disinformation about the election that led to the riot. Republicans are motivated by the decisions of the platforms to bar Mr. Trump and his far-right supporters.\n Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado and a senior member of the House antitrust subcommittee, said he would work with Democrats on legislation, more hearings and investigations of the tech sector.\n Republicans, like Democrats, also cozied up to the tech industry until recent years. Their grievances now are often animated by concerns that the tech platforms censor conservative voices. The decisions by Facebook and Twitter to bar Mr. Trump amplified those arguments.\n Mr. Buck said \u201ccensorship\u201d by the platforms was a way to motivate other Republicans to sign on to antitrust legislation.\n \u201cMy evolution is similar to that of many Republicans,\u201d Mr. Buck said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about privacy issues. I\u2019m concerned about censorship and concerned about large companies and monopolies crushing competition.\u201d\n Democrats fiercely disagree with the characterizations of censorship. They say tech companies need to do more to stop disinformation and calls for violence, and argue that Twitter and Facebook acted too slowly to bar Mr. Trump.\n \u201cNo private company is obligated to provide a megaphone for a malicious campaign to incite violence,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut, said in a statement. \u201cIt took blood and glass in the halls of Congress \u2014 and a change in the political winds \u2014 for the most powerful tech companies in the world to recognize, at the last possible moment, the profound threat of Donald Trump.\u201d\n Increasingly, lawmakers are looking to antitrust as a solution to consumer harms like privacy violations and the spread of disinformation. Ms. Klobuchar said the problems could be felt across the economy.\n \u201cWhy do farmers pay so much for seeds and fertilizer? Why is health care so expensive? Why are there so few incentives in place for big tech companies to protect your private information?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t paying attention, you should.\u201d",

        "title": "Democrats introduce bill to raise minimum wage to $15 by 2025",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Seeking to fulfill a long-standing Democratic ambition, a coalition of lawmakers introduced a bill on Tuesday that would raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n Democratic lawmakers have pushed for years to raise the minimum wage, which now stands at $7.25 and hasn't been increased since 2009.\n President Barack Obama pressed in his 2013 State of the Union address to bump up the hourly rate in stages to $9 an hour over two years, and state and local governments around the country have done just that. Voters have consistently approved even bigger minimum wage hikes when they appear on the ballot -- most recently in Florida, where voters supported a $15 minimum wage in November.\n But the legislative drive has stalled in Congress, where Democrats were in the minority in either the House or Senate, or both, from 2010 until this year.\n Now, with narrow majorities in both chambers and Biden in the White House, Democrats are renewing the push.\n Initially, Democratic leaders have said they will seek to pass the measure with at least some Republican support.\n Failing that, they will need to either end the Senate's legislative filibuster -- which requires 60 votes for a bill to get an up-or-down vote -- or use budget reconciliation, an arcane but frequently used process that allows legislation that affects the federal deficit to be enacted with a simple majority. If Democrats go that route, they could not afford to lose a single vote.\n The so-called Fight for $15 dates back to 2012, when fast-food workers walked off the job in New York City to call attention to their battle for higher pay.\n But the movement to raise the minimum wage -- by any amount -- has faced steep opposition from Republicans and businesses, particularly restaurants and other smaller employers, who often operate on tight profit margins. They argue that boosting wages will force them to lay off workers.\n The economic impact of a higher wage has been hotly debated among economists for years, with left-leaning experts countering that increasing salaries will allow workers to spend more and lift businesses and the economy.\n Since 1968, the minimum wage has lost more than 30% of its purchasing power, according to a fact sheet distributed by lawmakers.\n Sanders has been a longtime proponent of boosting the wage, saying no full-time worker in the US should be unable to afford to feed their families or pay the rent. He has slammed companies for paying wages that are so low that their workers need federal assistance, including food stamps.\n \"The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage,\" said Sanders, who introduced the bill Tuesday along with Washington Sen. Patty Murray and Reps. Bobby Scott of Virginia, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Stephanie Murphy of Florida. \"In the United States of America, a job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it.\"\n The legislation would raise the wages of nearly 32 million workers, more than half of whom are essential workers, according to Scott, citing legislation from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n It would increase wages for one-third of all Black workers and one-quarter of Hispanic workers. Also, nearly 60% of those helped would be women.\n \"The minimum wage today is one of the clearest examples of how weak labor standards can impose constant unrelenting hardship on millions of workers and their families,\" said Scott, noting one in nine full-time, year-round workers is paid a wage that leaves them in poverty.\n The coronavirus pandemic has shined a light on the financial struggles of low-wage Americans, many of whom are essential workers and have been hit hard by the outbreak. Those making the minimum wage are typically younger and work in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has suffered from steep job losses amid state lockdowns since the pandemic began.\n The shift in control of the agenda in Washington has quickly moved what was, in effect, a bill meant to signal Democratic intentions into the realm of the possible.\n \"Last session, the people's house, with Chairman Scott and Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi in the leadership passed the 'Raise the Wage Act' and we're ready to do it again,\" Jayapal said, before noting what has changed. \"And now, we have a President Biden who believes that we should pass a $15 minimum wage and a Senate led by Democrats ready to work for the people.\"\n Both Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the renewed effort.\n \"We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week -- working -- and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line,\" Biden said Friday.\n The legislation also calls for gradually phasing out the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, youth employees and workers with disabilities.",

        "title": "Colombians Ask: Who Would Dare Patent Panela?",
        "body_text": "VALLE DEL CAUCA, Colombia \u2014 This past April, Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez Ulloa, a shareholder at one of Colombia\u2019s largest sugar companies, was awarded U.S. Patent No. 10,632,167, which described a method for making an unrefined sugar containing high levels of policosanols, alcohols found in sugar cane wax that are purported to lower cholesterol.\n The method, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s patent claimed, would result in \u201ca cholesterol-lowering consumable product at such a low cost that it could be made readily available to all individuals, particularly the millions of people that currently do not have the financial means to afford existing pharmaceutical drugs.\u201d Raw sugar, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez was proposing, would become the Lipitor of the poor.\n Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez has now applied for similar patents in Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba, China, Australia and the European Union, and has trademarked a name for his product, calling it Policane.\n But to Colombians, the process for making Policane rings suspiciously familiar. It is indistinguishable from that for panela, a sweetener made here since the arrival of the Conquistadors. Unlike what Americans know as brown sugar, which is refined sugar with molasses mixed in, panela is traditionally made by boiling fresh cane juice in metal pots set over an oven fueled by the dried fiber of pressed cane. The result is a solid sugar with a subtle molasses-caramel flavor and slight mineral aftertaste. Its color ranges from a blond to a deep coffee brown.\n Equivalents of panela can be found across Latin America and Asia under different names. But Colombians consume more of it than anyone: a full pound per person per week, according to Fedepanela, Colombia\u2019s national federation of panela producers. At just pennies a cup, \u201cagua panela\u201d \u2014 panela dissolved in hot water \u2014 is an essential source of calories for working people, especially in the countryside. Farm hands drink it morning and night. Babies are fed it mixed with milk, and the sick receive it with lime and ginger.\n Lately, the coronavirus pandemic has caused consumption to increase, because of its perceived healthful properties \u2014 panela, as its producers are quick to point out, contains trace minerals and vitamins, which refined sugar lacks. So distinct are the two products in the minds of Colombians that they are sold in different aisles of the supermarket. And so important is panela to Colombia\u2019s rural economy that its nearly 20,000 producers, called trapiches, are protected by law from the incursions of sugar companies, which are not allowed to manufacture it.\n To patent a humble staple like panela struck Colombians as absurd, like patenting caf\u00e9 con leche. News of the \u201cpanela patent\u201d caused such an uproar in recent months that Riopaila Castilla, a sugar company based in Cali that until recently listed Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez on its board of directors, issued statements distancing itself from his efforts. Fedepanela has responded with an aggressive legal pushback, hoping to stop Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s patents from being approved in Colombia and abroad, and to revoke any issued in the United States.\n Panela producers have done much to cast their product as healthier than white sugar, perhaps setting the stage for someone like Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez to rebrand it as a \u201cnutraceutical.\u201d But to them, policosanols are a ruse \u2014 the goal is to patent all panela.\n Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s patent describes a lower-than-standard temperature for heating cane juice, to protect the integrity of the policosanols. But studies of conventionally produced panela have shown that it, too, contains policosanols \u2014 often high levels of them, said N\u00e9stor Triana, a chemical engineer with the federation. How much depends less on the temperature at which the juice is cooked and more on \u201cthe terrain, the nutrients it contains, and the variety of the sugar cane,\u201d Mr. Triana said.\n As it happens, the scientific evidence for policosanols is poor to mixed. Studies from Cuba in the 1990s and early 2000s reported drops in LDL, or bad, cholesterol, while nutrition researchers elsewhere failed to replicate those findings. By 2010, research on sugar cane policosanols largely petered out, though supplements remained popular. Only lately have trials resumed; one Korean study recently reported a benefit. Even if policosanols were found to work, delivering them in sugar \u2014 which itself can alter lipid profiles unfavorably \u2014 might not be the best way to go.\n Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who did not respond to requests through intermediaries for an interview, has shunned the news media after claiming to a Cali newspaper last summer that he had invented \u201cthe healthiest sweetener in the world, and the cheapest.\u201d Production was imminent, he insisted, but offered no hints as to who was making it or where.\n Colombia\u2019s first sugar cane fields were planted nearly 500 years ago on the wide, flat banks of the Cauca River, by the current-day city of Cali. Today the region is still sugar country, where cane grows densely under big skies and a hot sun without too much help. Most of it goes to giant mills where table sugar is centrifuged and crystallized. The rest is for panela.\n Here many trapiches are industrialized, although the process is effectively the same as it was in the 16th century. Cane is cut by hand with machetes, and pressed into a muddy green juice that is filtered and boiled, with the fiber used for fuel. The thick syrup is poured into pans and frantically stirred as it cools into a fudge-like dough that is patted into form by a pesador, someone who intuits that each panela weighs what it is supposed to.\n \u201cA good pesador is rare,\u201d said Ricardo Bueno, the head of production at the La Alsacia trapiche in Tulu\u00e1, north of Cali. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to technologize this.\u201d\n On a visit last fall, employees in lab coats and hairnets monitored Brix levels \u2014 the amount of dissolved solids in a liquid, here a proxy for sweetness \u2014 as the juice evaporated in steel tanks, infusing the air with the smell of caramel. The food scientists analyze samples of cane before giving approval to harvest, but they often must make adjustments to the juice, tweaking its pH with calcium hydroxide and monitoring variations in the ratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose, which bear on the panela\u2019s color.\n All this is to ensure that the final product, destined for supermarket chains, always looks and tastes the same \u2014 and won\u2019t contain splinters or other unwelcome surprises that have been known to appear in more rustic versions of panela.\n Large trapiches like La Alsacia send increasing amounts of panela abroad; some 9,000 tons of it were exported in 2019, most to the United States and Europe, according to Fedepanela. The round loaves are sold in Latin supermarkets, while more popular is a cone shape labeled \u201cpiloncillo,\u201d which is beloved among Mexican-Americans in California.\n Critics of Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez suspect that his patents are aimed, at least in part, at capturing these growing markets. Outside Colombia, no law would deter a sugar company from producing Policane. \u201cWhat will happen if our Cuban friends in Florida decide to make it?\u201d Javier P\u00e9rez, La Alsacia\u2019s director, said.\n The Fedepanela lawyers would like to know how an ancestral process so richly documented in Colombia could have escaped the attention of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Not only do colonial-era records describe it in minute detail but technical universities all over the country also produce literature on panela.\n \u201cThis speaks to one of the weaknesses of patent examination practices,\u201d said Polk Wagner, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Examiners are good at finding references to existing technologies when they are published in the United States, \u201cbut less so in foreign countries, in particular where the language is different.\u201d\n In the mountains of Colombia\u2019s Cordillera Occidental, just west of the Cauca River Valley, the small trapiches begin pressing and boiling cane juice before dawn, usually on a Thursday or Friday.\n Production starts when enough cane is piled up and eight or 10 workers can be assembled \u2014 every two weeks, for most. In some trapiches, the cane is hand-fed a few sticks at a time into a motorized press, while in others, the mill is powered by river water or by mules harnessed to a wheel.\n One worker feeds a voracious oven from piles of cane fiber. Another chops up a special wood pulp that pulls impurities to the surface of the juice. Syrup men skim the boiling juice with giant ladles, tossing steaming liquid from pan to pan until it becomes a thick, snapping caramel. There are no Brix monitors to show when it is ready \u2014 someone just dips a stick into it and submerges it in cool water, or uses his wet bare hand. Burns and other accidents are not uncommon.\n \u201cThankfully we\u2019re seeing less of them,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro Quintero, 34, a producer in the town of Versalles. His family\u2019s trapiche is named after his grandfather, Don Manuel, and although it is a traditional operation without a food scientist in sight, it has some modern upgrades. The packing area is sanitized, with masks and gloves obligatory, and its steel and copper surfaces scrubbed. The finished panela gets loaded onto a 1967 Jeep to be sold in a neighboring town.\n Mr. Quintero, who represents the panela federation in this region, believes Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s patents threaten small producers as much as the large ones \u2014 particularly if a patent is approved in Colombia, where one is currently before the issuing agency.\n Just downhill was another trapiche, visible as a skinny smokestack poking out from the cane. Under its aluminum roof was a scene Mr. Quintero hates to see: shirtless men smoking as they worked, chickens pecking around, someone passed out on a pile of cane fiber, wooden pans that can produce splinters. But this was the reality of panela across much of Colombia, he conceded.\n It was 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, and panela of an unusual, bright golden color was being stirred in pans when a pesador named Jimmy Buitrago showed up to work, late. He had been weighing panela at Don Manuel since 5 a.m., and before that at two other trapiches. He had not slept a full night in three days.\n Mr. Buitrago, a wiry 18-year-old, seemed no worse for the wear as he scooped the warm dough quickly to form perfect half-kilogram patties on a table, then stamped them with the initials of the trapiche\u2019s owner. Between fresh pans of hot syrup he sneaked in bites of breakfast. He had been doing this for four years, he said.\n Mr. Buitrago was unaware of Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s efforts, or even what a patent was. Lucero Copete, who was packing the cooled patties in paper for market, explained it to him. \u201cHe wants exclusivity,\u201d she said. Mr. Buitrago was incredulous: \u201cWhere\u2019s he at?\u201d\n This panela tasted different than the kind at the industrial plants: richer, smoother and off-the-charts sweet. \u201cWell, of course!\u201d said Mr. Quintero, pointing to a pile of ruddy gold stalks waiting to be pressed. \u201cLook at the quality of the cane.\u201d\n Panela is fussier and less predictable than table sugar, Mr. Quintero explained, because it contains all the components of the cane juice, not all of which can be adjusted. In small mountain plots like this, individual cane is selected for ripeness. The only additive is a little vegetable oil to keep the caramel from bubbling over.\n The policosanol content of this deliriously good panela remained undetermined, and the farthest it would ever get was just a few miles down the road.\n [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "title": "Biden plans to reopen Obamacare enrollment",
        "body_text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden is expected to reopen enrollment on the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges on Thursday as part of a series of executive actions related to health care, taking a step to help uninsured Americans that his predecessor rejected.\n It will be Biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. And it comes as more Americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.\n Open enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the Trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on December 15. But Biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies, under a special enrollment period.\n Former President Donald Trump refused to do so last year, despite heavy lobbying from elected officials of both parties and the health care industry. Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame.\n Biden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.\n He has signed 33 measures in his first six days, including mandating masks on federal property, reversing Trump's ban on transgender Americans joining the military, providing additional nutrition assistance and accelerating the manufacturing and delivery of supplies for vaccination and testing.\n On Tuesday, his actions focused on equity, including creating a police commission and promoting equitable housing policies. Wednesday is scheduled to center on combating climate change, according to a draft calendar document viewed by CNN.\n Increasing the number of insured Americans by strengthening the Affordable Care Act was at the heart of Biden's health care campaign promises. However, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing Obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require Congress and face plenty of opposition.\n Reopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.\n Anyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. Enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the Trump administration said in June.\n Also, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to Medicaid. Between February and August, Medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late December.\n During the most recent open enrollment period, overall Obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under Trump. But the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.\n The key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. They also say the period should last more than six weeks.\n The Trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures Biden is expected to reverse. Unspent revenue from exchange user fees appear to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to Kaiser.\n Just over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis released Monday.\n Thursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act and roll back Trump administration health care actions.\n Among Biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.\n The case will continue even if the Justice Department under Biden withdraws, because it originated with Texas and other Republican-led states. But the President could work with the new Democratic majority in Congress to short circuit the GOP states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.\n Biden will also likely want to reverse various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.\n Biden's health care officials are also expected to focus on Medicaid.\n The Trump administration made many historic changes to the health insurance program for low-income Americans, in line with Republicans' long-standing wish list. Officials allowed states to introduce work requirements and just approved Tennessee's request to shift its federal Medicaid funding to a type of block grant.\n The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.\n These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.\n Also, Congress has limited states' ability to trim their Medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. The Biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.\n CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "title": "First U.S. case of highly transmissible Brazil coronavirus variant identified in Minnesota",
        "body_text": "Minnesota officials announced Monday they have identified a person infected with a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus that has been spreading at alarming rates in recent weeks in Brazil.\n This is the first report in the United States of the  P.1 variant, which has been of particular concern to scientists as they have observed the disastrous surge in infections in the Brazilian city of Manaus.\n One research study published in the journal Science estimated that 76\u00a0percent of the Manaus population already had been infected by the coronavirus. That should have put Manaus close to herd immunity. The new surge has raised fears that the P.1 variant has mutations that allow it to evade the human immune system. Evidence to support this hypothesis remains limited.\n The Minnesota Department of Health said the case there involved \u201ca Minnesota resident with recent travel history to Brazil,\u201d and the variant was detected through genomic sequencing of random nasal swabs as part of a surveillance program.\n The person, a resident of the Twin Cities metro area, reported feeling sick the first week of January and was tested Jan.\u00a09. The health department said the person has been in isolation, and the department is continuing to investigate the case.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t surprising. It\u2019s a very difficult development, but at the same time not unexpected,\u201d Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to President Biden\u2019s coronavirus task force, said in an interview.\n All viruses mutate, and there are countless variants in circulation. The Brazil variant is one of three that have drawn particular global attention. The other two were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and are known to virologists as B.1.1.7 and B1.351.\n Although scientists know quite a bit about the U.K. variant, the Brazil variant \u201cis probably the one causing the most concern among people watching this,\u201d William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Monday. \u201cIt is fair to say that P.1 is the object of very, very serious attention and concern among epidemiologists. We don\u2019t know why it has been so successful in Manaus.\u201d\n The U.K. variant \u2014 already spreading in the United States \u2014 has become the dominant strain in southern England, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it could become dominant in the United States by some point in March if it outcompetes other strains. Minnesota has detected eight cases involving the U.K. variant, officials said Monday.\n The South Africa variant has not been identified in the United States.\n \u201cThese cases illustrate why it is so important to limit travel during a pandemic as much as possible,\u201d Minnesota state epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield said in a statement released by the health department.\n There is some overlap in the mutations in the three variants, but they arose independently and, along with other variants under review, provide a vivid reminder that the coronavirus is not a static target for vaccines and the human immune system. Most scientists believe the vaccines will remain effective against the variants, a belief bolstered by research released Monday by Moderna, maker of one of the two vaccines authorized in the United States.\n British scientists said late last week that they have preliminary evidence suggesting that the U.K. variant may be about 30\u00a0percent more lethal than the more common strain of SARS-CoV-2. The researchers emphasized that this is a new variant and that they are still trying to understand its clinical effects. The scientific community has not produced evidence that the South Africa or Brazil variants cause a different level of disease severity.\n But the Brazil and South Africa variants have incited particular concern among scientists because they contain mutations that may allow the virus to evade the effects of some antibodies, such as the monoclonal antibodies developed as therapies for patients with covid-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n \u201cThis is the new reality of covid,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cThis is now the dawning of the age of the variants.\u201d\n This article has been corrected to say that the Brazil variant was detected through nasal swabs.",

        "body_text": "The results signal that the pandemic is continuing to buoy the tech giant's business \u2014 from computers and gaming systems to the cloud computing systems helping companies navigate continued remote working.\n Microsoft (MSFT) posted $43.1 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter \u2014 a 17% increase from the same period in the prior year and well above the $40.2 billion analysts had predicted. Income hit $15.5 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with the $1.64 earnings per share Wall Street predicted.\n The company's stock shot up as much as 6% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. About two hours after the report, shares were up just over 3%.\n \"What we have witnessed over the past year is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"Microsoft is powering this shift with the world's largest and most comprehensive cloud platform.\"\n Commercial cloud revenue \u2014 which includes Office 365 Commercial, an essential tool for many businesses whose employees are still working from home \u2014 posted year-over-year growth of 34%, totaling $16.7 billion.\n \"This cloud shift and WFH dynamic looks here to stay and the company stands to be a major beneficiary of this trend,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors Tuesday.\n Even as Covid-19 vaccines roll out and infection numbers begin to fall, analysts expect the move to the cloud will continue. The number of workloads run in the cloud is poised to reach 55% by 2022, up from 35% currently, according to Ives. He added that he believes \"health cloud budgets (are) already in place for 2021.\"\n Microsoft also expects the strong growth in its cloud business to continue \u2014 it projects that revenue from its intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure, will grow as much as 21.5% during the current quarter, which ends March 31, CFO Amy Hood said during a call with analysts Tuesday.\n Microsoft's new Xbox Series X and Series S consoles generated massive demand during the December quarter \u2014 so much so that retailers had a hard time keeping them stocked and Microsoft asked chipmaker AMD (AMD) for help in making more available.\n Revenue from Microsoft's \"more personal computing\" segment, which Xbox sales fall under, increased 14% year-over-year to $15.1 billion.\n \"The launch of Xbox Series X and Series S was the most successful in our history, with the most devices ever sold in the launch month,\" Nadella said on the Tuesday earnings call, adding that the company is gaining console share. Hood noted that the company expects \"significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S that will still be constrained by supply\" in the current quarter.\n For the full fiscal year 2021, Hood said the company expects to generate double digit growth of both revenue and operating income.",

        "title": "Harthorne Wingo, 1970s Knick With Much-Chanted Name, Dies at 73",
        "body_text": "Any discussion of Harthorne Wingo, a popular reserve for the New York Knicks in the 1970s, usually starts with his name. His first name was Harthorne \u2014 not Hawthorne, as it was often misspelled.\n As for his surname, fans would chant it (\u201cWing-o!, Wing-o!\u201d) at Madison Square Garden to beseech Knicks Coach Red Holzman to insert him in the game.\n His name \u201cbelongs in a poem or a song,\u201d Dave Anderson, a sports columnist for The New York Times, wrote in 1973. \u201cOr maybe in a museum, as if a Wingo once were a big bird that is now extinct.\u201d\n Wingo, a high-jumping forward who stood a gangly 6-foot-6, never became a museum exhibit. But the Beastie Boys used his name in their 1989 song \u201cLay It on Me\u201d: \u201cMore updated on the hip-hop lingo (Not so hard, man)/My favorite New York Knick was Harthorne Wingo.\u201d\n Wingo joined the Knicks as a reserve during the 1972-73 season, when they won their second N.B.A. championship (and their last to date). He stayed a reserve through three more seasons. He had his best season in 1974-75, when he averaged 20.6 minutes, 7.4 points and 5.6 rebounds a game.\n \u201cHe was a marginal player, a bench player with an unorthodox shot who they put to perfect use, for his energy and rebounding,\u201d Marv Albert, the Knicks\u2019 radio announcer during Wingo\u2019s time with the team, said by phone. \u201cThe players really loved him, and so did the fans.\u201d\n After his scoring and rebounding helped cut a big Boston Celtics lead in a game in November 1973, Celtics Coach Tom Heinsohn told The Times, \u201cWingo went bananas out there.\u201d\n Wingo died on Jan. 20 in a New York City hospital, according to the New York City Medical Examiner. He was 73. He had long suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, his cousin, Jackie Wingo Wood, said.\n Harthorne Nathaniel Wingo was born on Sept. 9, 1947, in Tryon, N.C. He was one of 14 children of Nathaniel Harthorne Wingo, a construction worker, and Jessie Mae (Gary) Wingo. Harthorne was part of the first class to integrate Tryon High School, which he attended in his senior year, and he was the only Black starter on the school\u2019s basketball team, which won a conference title.\n After a year at Friendship Junior College in Rock Hill, S.C., he played basketball in an industrial league in Spartanburg, S.C., then left for New York City. He played in a winter basketball league in 1968 and then at least one summer with the vaunted Rucker Pro League in Harlem, where professionals and talented local players competed.\n \u201cFor me, it was like somebody takes a stallion out to an open field and lets him go,\u201d Wingo told PolkSports, a website that covers sports in the county where he grew up.\n The Knicks learned about him because of his Rucker success. But before they signed him he played for the Harlem Wizards and the minor-league Allentown Jets, where he became a star. When the Knicks signed him in February 1973, he joined a team with a roster that included the future Hall of Famers Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Jerry Lucas and Earl Monroe.\n \u201cLike his name, he was a very unique individual,\u201d Frazier said in a statement. \u201cHe was effervescent, gregarious, with an infectious personality not only endearing to his teammates but the Knicks Nation as well.\u201d\n The Knicks waived Wingo in 1976, and he went on to play in Italy, Switzerland and South America. After retiring from basketball in 1983, he endured financial and substance abuse problems, according to PolkSports.\n He is survived by his sister, Rosemary Wingo Palmer, and his brother, McDonald.\n Early in his career, Wingo talked about the \u201cWing-o!\u201d chant. \u201cIt makes me come alive and want to work harder,\u201d he told The Times in 1973. \u201cIt\u2019s as though the people are offering me a reward for all my years of struggle to make it here.\u201d",

        "body_text": "Ever since Donald Trump incited an assault on the Capitol, got impeached for it, found himself deplatformed by social media companies and finally decamped the White House for Mar-a-Lago, an odd split-screen effect has taken hold.\n On one screen, our former president has basically disappeared. You hear occasional noises about him forming a \u201cMAGA Party\u201d and threatening primaries against Republicans who were insufficiently slavish toward his corrupt designs, but for now he\u2019s just gone from public life.\n On the other screen, many Republicans are acting as if he still looms over them as menacingly as ever. They are offering the absolute minimum in criticism of his months-long assault on our democracy while still carefully managing their every word, as if terrified, in Stockholm syndrome fashion, of a Trumpian Twitter barrage that will never come.\n Case in point: Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. She has now offered an absolute howler, essentially casting Trump as a victim of the aftermath of the insurrection, arguing: \u201cGive the man a break!\u201d\n This is generating a lot of well-deserved mockery. But it also illustrates the strange hold Trump continues to exercise over the GOP. And it highlights what looks like a bizarre retreat from holding Trump accountable, even just rhetorically, that\u2019s underway among many Republicans, including establishment-oriented ones.\n Haley, arguing against the impeachment of Trump on Fox News, did allow that Jan. 6 was a \u201ctough day\u201d and that Trump\u2019s actions since the election were \u201cnot his finest.\u201d\n That\u2019s incredibly mild to begin with. But Haley continued: \u201cDoes he deserve to be impeached? Absolutely not.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t even think there\u2019s a basis for impeachment,\u201d Haley said, adding: \u201cThey beat him up before he got into office. They\u2019re beating him up after he leaves office. At some point, I mean, give the man a break!\"\n Give the man a break! Ever since he launched his unprecedented effort to corrupt and steal a presidential election, which included co-opting large swaths of the government toward nefarious ends, trying to invalidate millions of Americans\u2019 votes based on fictions, pressuring state officials to overturn certified results, and inciting a violent assault on the seat of government that may have almost led to outright assassinations, Trump has been through absolute hell!\n Trumpism is saturated with a toxic combination of victimization and cultish deification of Trump (who is himself cast as the chief victim in all sorts of situations), but this really takes it to rock bottom.\n What\u2019s so striking here is that Haley was actually cleaning up for her earlier criticism of Trump. Earlier in the interview, Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham confronted Haley by pointing out that she had previously said Trump would be \u201cjudged harshly\u201d for the assault. Haley actually offered this as a kind of backpedal.\n Worse still, Haley is supposed to be a rising star who might run in 2024 as a non-Trumpist Republican. As the conservative blogger Allahpundit points out, even the less Trumpy Republicans, those who fancy themselves serious conservatives, are capitulating to the notion that Trump and his coalition are largely being victimized by efforts to hold him accountable for inciting an insurrectionist assault on the Capitol:\n When Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican, came out for impeachment, it looked as though there might be a more serious effort by Republicans to move the party away from Trump.\n But since then, we\u2019ve seen a whole lot of retreat. House leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has backtracked on his previous heresy that Trump was partly responsible for the attack; he\u2019s now claiming Trump didn\u2019t \u201cprovoke\u201d the violence and is even hailing him for continuing to \u201chave that ability to lead this party.\u201d\n Meanwhile, relatively less Trumpy Republicans such as Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa) are saying things like this:\n They bear the responsibility, never mind that extensive video examined by Just Security and by ProPublica shows unambiguously that many rioters were expressly trying to carry out what they correctly understood to be Trump\u2019s instructions to them.\n And on Tuesday, all but five Senate Republicans voted for a doomed effort to kill the impeachment effort before Trump has to face a Senate trial.\n Why is it so hard for so many Republicans, including the ostensibly responsible ones, to concede forthrightly that President Biden\u2019s victory was legitimately earned, that Republicans were wrong for going to such great lengths to enable Trump\u2019s lies about the election\u2019s illegitimacy, that those lies are what inspired the attack, and that Trump should be held accountable for it?\n Read more:\n Greg Sargent: Appalling new video of the rioters is a big problem for Trump\u2019s GOP enablers\n Erik Wemple: \u2018It\u2019s a shot at my reputation\u2019: Lauren Wolfe reacts to NYT\u2019s statement about her dismissal\n Jennifer Rubin: 50 things that are better already\n Brian Klaas: Why is it so hard to deprogram Trumpian conspiracy theorists?\n Robert Robb: Arizona\u2019s GOP has been dysfunctional before, but this time feels different\n Greg Sargent: Trump\u2019s corrupt schemes to save himself keep blowing up in his face",

        "title": "Martin Baron, Who Led Three Major Papers, Retires From Washington Post",
        "body_text": "Martin Baron, a newsroom giant who led The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and The Miami Herald to numerous Pulitzer Prizes in a career noted for groundbreaking reports on the National Security Agency\u2019s secret surveillance program and serial sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic church, said on Tuesday that he will retire on Feb. 28 after eight years as The Post\u2019s executive editor.\n \u201cAt age 66, I feel ready to move on,\u201d he said in a note to the newspaper\u2019s staff.\n Mr. Baron said that he had joined the paper with \u201ca reverence for The Post\u2019s heritage of courage and independence and feeling an inviolable obligation to uphold its values,\u201d and that the news staff had delivered \u201cthe finest journalism.\u201d\n \u201cYou stood firm against cynical, never-ending assaults on objective fact,\u201d he wrote.\n In an interview on Tuesday, he said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m owed a breather after all these years, and I\u2019ll use that time to think through how I want to spend my time. I\u2019ll try to stay active. I\u2019ll try to stay involved in journalism and to continue to contribute to the profession.\u201d\n He started as The Post\u2019s executive editor in January 2013, weeks before President Barack Obama was sworn in for a second term, and spanned President Donald J. Trump\u2019s years in the White House. Mr. Trump frequently denigrated The Post as part of an effort to undercut coverage of his administration, calling the paper \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d among other insults. In 2017, The Post adopted the first official slogan in its more than 140-year history: \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness.\u201d\n Mr. Baron, who is known as Marty, joined The Post after more than 11 years as the top editor of The Boston Globe, which won six Pulitzer Prizes during his run. He oversaw The Globe\u2019s Spotlight team of investigative journalists, who reported on a pattern of sexual abuse by clergy in the Roman Catholic Church and the institution\u2019s decades-long effort to cover it up. The series of more than 20 articles earned the paper the 2003 Pulitzer in the public service category. (The Globe was owned by The New York Times Company from 1993 to 2013.)\n The investigation of the church became the basis of \u201cSpotlight,\u201d the 2015 Oscar-winning film in which Mr. Baron was played by Liev Schreiber. In a 2016 article, Mr. Baron conceded that Mr. Schreiber had captured his newsroom demeanor, writing, \u201cHis depiction has me as a stoic, humorless, somewhat dour character that many professional colleagues instantly recognize (\u2018He nailed you\u2019) and that my closest friends find not entirely familiar.\u201d\n Sacha Pfeiffer, an investigative reporter for NPR who was a member of the Globe team that investigated the church, said Mr. Baron had a \u201crare, ideal combination\u201d of traits that made for a good newspaper editor.\n \u201cIt\u2019s well known that Marty is not warm and fuzzy,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cBut he\u2019s one of the best editors I\u2019ve ever had, because he has an excellent moral compass, an uncanny instinct for what could make a good story and he seems to be fearless. He knows how hard reporting can be.\u201d\n Mr. Baron grew up in Tampa, Fla., and started his career in 1976 as a reporter at The Miami Herald. He held top editing jobs at The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. He returned to The Herald as its top editor in 2000, and the paper won a Pulitzer in breaking news under his leadership.\n Shortly after joining The Post, he oversaw an investigation that would go on to win the Pulitzer in public service: a series of articles that exposed the National Security Agency\u2019s global surveillance efforts. The work was carried out by 28 Post journalists and was based largely on classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former government contractor. (The Post shared the 2014 Pulitzer with the U.S. arm of The Guardian.)\n News organizations in possession of the top-secret government documents found themselves in thorny ethical territory. At the time of the Pulitzer win, Mr. Baron said the decision to inform the public was clear. \u201cDisclosing the massive expansion of the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance network absolutely was a public service,\u201d he said.\n Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, praised Mr. Baron for making \u201cthe tough, fast decision about the Snowden papers,\u201d as well as his overall tenure at The Post.\n \u201cThe Post was in a difficult moment when he took over,\u201d Mr. Baquet said. \u201cIt had probably lost some of its confidence. And he set a clear path.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s made every institution he touched better,\u201d Mr. Baquet added.\n Mr. Baron said in his note to the staff that The Post was now \u201cwell positioned for the future,\u201d with a larger readership and broadened coverage. The Post has about three million digital-only subscribers, up by nearly a million in the last year, and its newsroom has grown, from 580 journalists when Mr. Baron arrived to more than 1,000.\n The paper was owned by the Graham family, the caretakers of the paper for three generations, when Mr. Baron started there. It was struggling financially as it dealt with the battles all newspapers have faced: declining print ad revenue, plummeting circulation and new competition from digital news outlets.\n In August 2013, Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Post for $250 million. Since then, the combination of Mr. Bezos\u2019 resources and Mr. Baron\u2019s newsroom know-how has revived a paper perhaps best known for its reporting, by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, on the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard M. Nixon.\n Mr. Woodward, who started at The Post 50 years ago under the executive editor Ben Bradlee, said on Tuesday that he had hoped Mr. Baron\u2019s retirement would have come a bit later. \u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing job he\u2019s done,\u201d Mr. Woodward said.\n \u201cThe high bar for an executive editor of The Washington Post is to fill Ben Bradlee\u2019s shoes. Marty did it fully, with intense engagement.\u201d\n Margaret Sullivan, The Post\u2019s media columnist and a former public editor of The Times, said it had been a privilege to work for Mr. Baron. \u201cI think he is a truly outstanding editor and that American citizens owe him a standing ovation for the work he\u2019s done as editor of The Washington Post and for the work he\u2019s done in the past,\u201d she said.\n Mr. Bezos weighed in on Mr. Baron\u2019s planned retirement in an Instagram post on Tuesday that addressed the departing editor directly: \u201cOur success these past several years would not and simply could not have happened without you,\u201d he wrote. He described Mr. Baron as \u201cboth swashbuckling and careful,\u201d saying he had led the paper with integrity, \u201ceven when it was exhausting.\u201d\n Karen Tumulty, a Post political columnist who has known Mr. Baron since 1980, said he had taken the executive editor job at The Post partly because of his respect for the Graham family, but was able to adapt when Mr. Bezos took over.\n \u201cI think he immediately recognized Bezos was going to bring resources to the paper that it very badly needed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt did take a steady hand to steer us through this gigantic cultural change at the place.\u201d\n During Mr. Baron\u2019s tenure, The Post won 10 Pulitzer Prizes, including the 2020 award in the explanatory reporting category for a series on the effects of climate change.\n The paper also waged a three-year legal battle to win the release of more than 2,000 government documents known as the Afghanistan Papers. The resultant six-part series, by Craig Whitlock, reported that government officials had misled the public about the 18-year conflict in Afghanistan, \u201chiding unmistakable evidence the war had become unwinnable.\u201d The work won the George Polk Award for military reporting and the Investigative Reporters & Editors\u2019 FOI Award.\n In his note on Tuesday, Mr. Baron acknowledged there was more work to be done at The Post, including increasing diversity in the newsroom and a deepening its understanding of the communities it covers. Fred Ryan, The Post\u2019s publisher and chief executive, said in a note to the staff that The Post would conduct a \u201cbroad and inclusive\u201d search for Mr. Baron\u2019s successor, one that would include internal and external candidates.\n Mr. Baron said in the interview on Tuesday that the biggest challenge now facing the news media was the \u201clevel of conspiracy thinking that has become entrenched with a substantial portion of the American public.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s expected that in a democracy, people will debate the challenges we face, the policies that should be implemented, and that debate should be vigorous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut traditionally we have always operated from a common set of facts \u2014 and now people can\u2019t even agree on what happened yesterday.\u201d",

        "title": "Small protests in Tacoma, Wash., after police officer drives into crowd",
        "body_text": "An incident in which a police officer drove his car into a crowd over the weekend has revived demonstrations and calls for police restructuring in Tacoma, Wash., where local activists say they remain frustrated after a Black man died in police custody in March.\n Small protests in the industrial city, about 34 miles south of Seattle, flared Saturday and Sunday nights after a police officer was filmed driving his vehicle into a crowd. Police said the incident occurred as they were responding to 911 calls regarding a large group of people who were illegally blocking an intersection in downtown Tacoma to watch car enthusiasts perform automotive stunts in what is popularly known as a \u201csideshow.\u201d\n As officers tried to clear the intersection, one of the police vehicles was surrounded by people in the crowd, who then \u201chit the body of the police vehicle and its windows,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cThe officer, fearing for his safety, tried to back up, but was unable to do so because of the crowd.\u201d Then, in an event captured on cellphone videos, the officer drove forward into the crowd, sending bodies tumbling and appearing to run over at least one person amid  screams.\n Police said at least two people were injured in the incident and taken to hospitals, where one remains. A spokesman for the Pierce County Force Investigation Team (PCFIT), which is investigating the incident, said Monday that the person\u2019s condition is unknown but that the injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.\n The police officer driving the vehicle, identified only as a 58-year-old man who has served in the department for nearly 30 years, was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation by PCFIT, which is made up of area law enforcement officers and investigates fatal uses of force by police.\n Accounts and videos of the incident inflamed tension in the community where activists said they have been on edge for months, waiting to see whether the state attorney general will bring charges against four Tacoma police officers in the March killing of Manuel Ellis, 33.\n \u201cPeople are kind of in the business of keeping an eye on cops these days in Tacoma,\u201d said Jamika Scott, a co-organizer of the Tacoma Action Collective, a grass-roots organization focused on racial equity and social justice. \u201cSo there was this kind of organic, emotional response, and people were like, we\u2019re going to go down to [the intersection], we\u2019re going to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.\n Videos of Ellis\u2019s March 3 encounter with police, unearthed months after his death, raised questions about the validity of previous claims by the Tacoma Police Department that Ellis had attacked a police car. The videos show Ellis being punched, tackled and placed in a chokehold by police officers, one of whom also appears to place a knee on Ellis\u2019s neck. The Pierce County Medical Examiner ruled the killing a homicide.\n Activists have waited months since the conclusion of a Washington State Patrol investigation to learn whether any of the officers involved in Ellis\u2019s death will be charged, further degrading their expectations of justice, they said.\n Protests in Tacoma this past summer were largely overshadowed by larger national demonstrations over the similar \u2014 but more widely publicized \u2014 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n Activists said the imagery of a police vehicle striking civilians on Saturday night quickly stoked the existing tensions.\n \u201cTacoma police has a history of brutality,\u201d said Rebecca Parson, another community activist, who alleged, from the videos, that the police officer who drove into the crowd on Saturday did so maliciously, rather than back up or drive around the group.\n Videos of the incident appear to show the police vehicle largely surrounded. Police and at least one witness who spoke to a local newspaper said people were pounding on the car, trying to smash the windows.\n \u201cEveryone is a little on edge because last year they killed Manuel Ellis,\u201d said Scott, who arrived at the scene along with other activists a few hours after the incident occurred. Scott said she and a fellow activist were arrested Saturday night after police decided that the demonstrators  needed to move farther down the street from the police perimeter. A police spokeswoman, Wendy Haddow, confirmed that two people were arrested Saturday after police ordered them to disperse.\n More protesters, who activists said were spurred by social media posts from Seattle, took to the streets of Tacoma on Sunday night, some of them setting fires and breaking windows.\n Pictures and videos posted on social and local media showed a makeshift barricade on fire and crowds of protesters, including one holding a sign that read, \u201cCONVICT KILLER COPS,\u201d and another who appeared to be shining a laser at police at eye level.\n The demonstrators also rattled the fence and pounded on drums outside the county jail, chanting \u201cFree them all,\u201d according to one video.\n Haddow said that the demonstrators set a few small fires and smashed some windows but that there were no known injuries. She said earlier Sunday, before the incident, police arrested a man and a woman for attempting to access the roof of a private building, wearing \u201criot gear.\u201d",

        "body_text": "(CNN) Senate GOP leaders are bracing for more retirements within their ranks, as a handful of senior Republicans decline to commit to running again -- following four tumultuous years in the Trump era and facing a polarized political climate ahead.\n Three Republican senators have already decided to retire in 2022, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, whose announcement on Monday stunned his colleagues and ignited an all-out scramble in both parties to line up candidates to fill the crucial seat.\n But in interviews with CNN, several other GOP senators sidestepped questions about their political futures or made clear they were truly undecided about running again, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Richard Shelby of Alabama.\n Thune, 60, said he would make his announcement \"at some point in the future\" while brushing aside questions about his thinking. Johnson, 65, said he didn't think he had to decide \"for a while.\" Grassley, 87, said he would make his announcement in \"several months.\" Shelby, 86, said, \"I'll let you know.\"\n The party out of power typically gains seats in a president's first midterm election, but Republicans will have to defend 20 of their Senate seats in 2022, while Democrats only have to defend 14 seats.\n And the retirements of Portman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey have given Democrats greater hope of winning those seats and retaining their slim Senate majority. The Republicans' decisions have sparked primaries that could cost millions and bruise whoever emerges as the party's nominees against the Democrats.\n The three retirements were somewhat of a surprise since Portman, Burr and Toomey hover around the Senate's average age of about 62 years old. Yet they've bemoaned the Senate as an increasingly divided institution without the willpower to break the partisan gridlock. As of now, there are no Democratic senators who have decided to step aside, though that could quickly change.\n Johnson's choice is the most crucial in terms of the future control of the Senate, since his swing state went for Biden in 2020 by less than a point. The Wisconsin senator said he would \"work hard\" to \"make it possible for either myself or somebody else to keep that seat in Republican hands.\"\n When asked why he would stay in the Senate, Johnson said \"to be a firewall\" against Democratic control of Washington.\n \"I'm not a fan of this place,\" Johnson said of the Senate. \"I think this place is horribly dysfunctional.\"\n Other Republican senators from competitive states sounded like they would run again, even though some wouldn't say so explicitly.\n Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership, said that he has not made an \"official announcement.\"\n \"When I do, that's when the campaign will officially start,\" he added.\n And as she entered the Senate subway in the Capitol, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN, \"I'm running.\" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney then interjected, \"for now,\" and smiled.\n A number of other senators from deep red states have not announced their new campaigns, but told CNN that they intend to run, including GOP Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Boozman of Arkansas.\n \"I am running for the border first, and reelection second,\" said Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy.\n While Republicans are uncertain which of their members may be the next to call it quits, the decision by Portman caught many off-guard. \"He's a big loss, a big loss for the caucus, really for the country,\" Thune said of Portman.\n The Ohio Republican also had a unique connection to his state, winning his last race in 2016 by 20 points against former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland.\n \"I was surprised,\" Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told CNN of Portman's decision. When asked if the NRSC would get involved in the primary, Scott said: \"I don't know. I know that people have in the past, so we'll see. It will be a new experience.\"\n Scott has personally urged each of his incumbents to run again but said that Republicans would keep the US Senate seat in Ohio.\n \"It's another race that we'll raise the money for and win,\" he said. \"We're off and running. We're talking to candidates, we're recruiting candidates, we're raising money.\"\n But Democrats said the GOP retirements would be a boon to their chances of keeping the Senate.\n \"With Ohio now joining Pennsylvania and North Carolina as another open seat liability in a major battleground state, Republicans are confronting messy and divisive primaries and a 2022 map that keeps getting harder to defend,\" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss.\n Aspiring senators are now mulling their options and jockeying for donors. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he raised more than $1 million in two weeks since announcing he'd consider a bid. In North Carolina, former GOP Rep. Mark Walker, and Democrats Jeff Jackson and Erica Smith, have already announced Senate campaigns, while others, including Lara Trump, former President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, ponder launching theirs.\n Within hours of Portman's announcement came speculation that Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a close ally and vocal defender of Trump, would run. Other possible GOP candidates include: J.D. Vance, the author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" Josh Mandel, who dropped out of the 2018 GOP primary race to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Jon Husted, the state's lieutenant governor. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also seriously eying a Senate bid, along with at least four other Republican members of Congress: Rep. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson. Rep. Tim Ryan is among the Democrats ruminating a run.\n The Senate is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes, giving Democrats control of the chamber.\n Two of the most competitive Senate seats in 2022 could be in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, which are held by Republicans Toomey and Burr. But two new Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock will have to defend seats in Arizona and Georgia, which have only recently trended blue.\n Republicans recognize that their work will be cut out for them if more of their colleagues step aside.\n \"It certainly creates more focus on candidate recruitment,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican who is running for reelection in South Carolina next year. Retirements, he said, amount to a \"loss of institutional knowledge on our side that's impossible to replace.\"\n \"But finding interesting, fascinating and exciting candidates will be our task,\" Scott said.\n CNN's Aaron Pellish, Clare Foran and Jeff Zeleny contributed.",

        "title": "On immigration, Biden seeks a new approach to an old deadlock",
        "body_text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden's early moves on immigration signal his determination to learn from past efforts to reform the system, but that doesn't mean he won't repeat their legacy of frustration.\n In several key respects, Biden already is approaching the herculean task of immigration reform with a strikingly different strategy than the past two presidents who tried to restructure the system, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama.\n While both men introduced proposals to comprehensively rethink almost every aspect of immigration law, Biden's plan stresses legalization of the undocumented, the top Democratic priority, while offering little on the key asks of business groups and Republicans: guaranteeing future flows of temporary workers and toughening border and interior enforcement.\n That choice reflects another big change from the past: While Bush and Obama both engaged in extended bipartisan negotiations that ultimately failed to produce a law, congressional Democrats and immigration advocates appear unlikely to enlist in such an elongated effort again.\n Congressional Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups seem content deferring initially as Biden seeks Republican support for change. But it's clear that both groups have only limited patience for that approach if Republicans don't quickly show signs of interest.\n \"My goal is to see if there are some legitimate players on the Republican side who want to invest a little capital and are serious,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who's the legislation's chief Senate sponsor, told me. \"If the answer to that is yes, I would take weeks with them. I am not going to take months with them.\"\n The Democratic skepticism about pursuing lengthy negotiations with Republicans underscores the challenge Biden will face squaring his immigration goals with his promise to promote \"unity\" and find more common ground across party lines. On immigration, as on most of his other priorities, his promise to work with Republicans collides with the liberal tilt of his own proposals, a Republican Party that has moved to the right even since his tenure as Obama's vice president, and a Democratic base highly dubious that meaningful cooperation is possible with that modern GOP -- and thus eager to use special legislative tools to move forward without it whenever possible.\n \"In the past, George W. Bush and Barack Obama sought bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform: The problem is it allowed Republicans to demand way too much in the sausage-making and, in the end, still kill off immigration reform,\" says longtime immigration lobbyist Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of the advocacy group America's Voice. \"Biden is presenting a bill that unifies and inspires the entire Democratic coalition. In effect, he's saying, 'Work with me in good faith, Republicans, to get to 60 votes, and if you don't' -- and most of us assume they will not -- 'we'll find a way to get something done with our 51 votes.' \"\n But Biden and the immigration advocates face a challenge that will shadow almost all aspects of his legislative agenda: The threat to freeze out Republicans and pass immigration legislation solely with Democratic votes works only if every Senate Democrat is willing to vote to end the filibuster -- or to legalize millions of the undocumented through the special budget \"reconciliation\" process that allows bills to clear the upper chamber with 51 votes (including a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris).\n And it won't be easy to convince every Democrat that allowing millions of undocumented immigrants to legally enter the workforce is a defensible idea while millions of other Americans are out of work amid the disruption created by the coronavirus pandemic. Assuming that all Democrats will unite around a reconciliation strategy, says one top business lobbyist who asked to remain anonymous while discussing the group's internal calculations, is a combination of \"wishful thinking and bluster.\"\n Or, as Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, puts it: On immigration reform, \"there's a big difference between hope and experience.\"\n Biden's early moves on immigration mark a clear reversal of the policies under Trump, who moved in almost every way possible to restrict both undocumented and legal immigration. But Biden's posture also constitutes a departure from the tactics employed by Bush and Obama, who engaged in exhaustive bipartisan negotiations seeking a comprehensive overhaul.\n That process was led by the late Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and John McCain, an Arizona Republican, under Bush in 2006 and the bipartisan Senate \"Gang of Eight\" under Obama in 2013. Each time the negotiations produced a broad immigration bill that cleared the Senate with bipartisan support (though with notably fewer Republican senators supporting the package the second time). But while advocates believed they also had majority support in the House, the GOP leadership that controlled the chamber in both 2006 and 2013 refused to bring the bill to a vote, killing it.\n While Bush and Obama largely employed similar strategies, Biden has quickly indicated he intends to pursue a very different approach.\n Bush and Obama, for different reasons, did not seriously pursue immigration reform until their second terms; Biden revealed the outline of his immigration bill on his first day in office. That signals a very different level of commitment.\n \"I am hopeful that we can do more than less, because I never had a president who put his back into it,\" says Menendez, who arrived in the Senate just as the 2006 effort unfolded.\n Also different: While Bush and Obama pursued the \"three-legged stool\" of legalization for the undocumented (a Democratic priority), guaranteeing future flows of temporary workers (key for business) and tougher enforcement (a Republican emphasis), the plan Biden released offers relatively little on the latter two.\n As Sharry notes, that partly reflects a big shift in strategy: Democrats in effect are telling Republicans and their allies in the business community that any bill will reflect their concerns only if they produce GOP votes for the overall package, including a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. But it also reflects a conviction among immigration experts in both parties that Trump already implemented almost every element of the right's hardline enforcement wish list without stabilizing the system.\n \"Over the last four years the world has skewed dramatically to the right on the question of enforcement -- the wall, we have enough Border Patrol [agents] to put hands across the border almost, and [more] ICE agents, and the 'stay in Mexico' policy, the list is endless,\" says Menendez. \"On the enforcement side, that's all we've had for the last four years. It's a recognition that there has been a lot of enforcement out there; and second, a recognition there are better ways to do enforcement.\"\n Even some Republican immigration experts second that conclusion.\n Biden underscored the message from his legislative proposal by releasing on his first day new enforcement guidance for the federal immigration agencies to pause most deportations (except for people considered the greatest threats) for his first 100 days, while repealing Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations and freezing construction of his predecessor's border wall.\n That marks another sharp departure from Obama's approach. During his first two years, Obama ratcheted up immigration enforcement and deportations. His goal was to make congressional Republicans more comfortable voting to legalize the undocumented by proving he would ensure border security -- or at least to deny them the excuse that they could not vote for legalization until the border was secured. After two years of tough enforcement, Obama went to El Paso, Texas, in 2011 and declared, \"We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we've done.\"\n And yet, even after Obama's enforcement offensive, legalization still failed because not enough Republicans -- especially in the House -- supported it, while immigrant advocates bitterly labeled him the \"deporter in chief.\"\n After the bruising President Donald Trump years, Democrats and immigrant advocates are even more dubious that more than a handful of congressional Republicans will support legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, no matter the concessions offered to them on temporary workers and/or border security.\n As Trump has increased the GOP's reliance on the non-college-educated, non-urban and evangelical Christian White voters most uneasy about the way the nation is changing demographically and culturally, hostility to immigration in all forms has become one of the strongest threads binding the party.\n At the grassroots, polling by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute has found overwhelming support among Republicans for Trump's travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, his border wall and reducing legal immigration; nearly half of Republican voters even supported his policy of separating parents and children on the border (which did prove a bridge too far for some GOP elected officials). Almost three-fifths of Republicans in a recent Public Religion Research Institute poll endorsed the harshly worded sentiment that \"immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background\"; agreement was even greater among Republicans who rely primarily on Fox News for information.\n In Congress, most Republicans endorsed Trump's aggressive measures to restrict immigration -- such as declaring a national emergency to redirect money toward his border wall after Congress refused to appropriate it or slashing refugee admission levels -- and almost three-fourths of Senate Republicans supported legislation to cut legal immigration in half, though that Trump-backed bill ultimately failed.\n All of this reflects the party's retreat under Trump to the parts of the country least touched by demographic change: After November's Democratic gains in Arizona, Colorado and Georgia, Republicans, rather remarkably, hold just four of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states with the highest share of foreign-born residents.\n Already in Biden's first week, prominent Republicans -- including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Florida's Sen. Marco Rubio, who has shifted sharply to the right after helping to negotiate the 2013 Senate deal -- have denounced the new President's plan as a \"blanket amnesty\" and a threat to American workers forced from their jobs during the pandemic.\n Fox and other conservative media outlets are already touting the alleged threat of new \"caravans\" of migrants making their way toward the Southern border. Ken Paxton, the Republican Texas attorney general, a frequent antagonist on immigration issues during Obama's presidency, is suing to block Biden's deportation freeze and won an early round Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the pause. And, of course, the risk of denunciation from Trump looms over any congressional Republican considering cooperation with Democrats on legislation that legalizes any population of undocumented immigrants.\n Against that daunting backdrop, immigration advocates are already gaming out how they will proceed if, as they expect, the attempts by Biden and Democratic senators such as Menendez fail to win the 10 Republican votes they would need to break a filibuster against legislation to legalize all or some of the undocumented.\n One option is to seek legislation addressing only a portion of that population, starting with the roughly 2.1 million \"Dreamers,\" young people brought to the US as children by their parents. The House passed legislation in 2019 (with every Democrat voting yes) legalizing those undocumented young people, along with another roughly 300,000 immigrants here on so-called Temporary Protected Status, which covers migrants whose homelands are considered unsafe because of armed conflict or natural disasters.\n Even with a much narrower Democratic majority, advocates consider it highly likely the House would pass such legislation again. But while the Dreamers enjoy generally broad public support, finding 10 Republican votes for such standalone legislation in the Senate still would be difficult, since less than half of GOP voters back legalization for them. The same would be true for another undocumented population advocates might hope to legalize through standalone legislation: long-term farmworkers, who were also granted a pathway to citizenship in a separate bill the House approved in 2019.\n Democrats wouldn't need 10 Republican votes for immigration legislation (or any of their other priorities) if the Senate majority voted to end the filibuster -- but it does not appear they have the votes (or the inclination) to do that yet.\n That's why immigration advocates are scouring the legislative rules to determine whether they can include a pathway to citizenship within the special \"reconciliation\" process. Established by the 1974 Budget Act, reconciliation allows legislation with an impact on the federal budget to clear both chambers with just a majority vote, thus bypassing the filibuster.\n The assumption among immigrant advocates is that Biden, despite his outreach, won't win support from enough Senate Republicans to break a filibuster on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus \"rescue\" blueprint -- much less the larger economic \"recovery\" package he says is coming in February -- and will be forced to utilize reconciliation to pass those plans. They hope to convince congressional Democrats to include legalization for at least some of the undocumented in any reconciliation bill.\n Menendez, at least, appears open to that possibility. \"I am certainly spending a lot of my staff's time thinking about what is eligible for reconciliation,\" he told me.\n Ideally, immigrant advocates would hope to legalize as many as about 7 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented through a reconciliation bill: the Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status populations, as well as farmworkers and perhaps 5 million undocumented immigrants working in occupations deemed \"essential\" during the pandemic. (Those categories overlap somewhat.)\n But such an ambitious plan might struggle to win even majority support in Congress because too many centrist Democrats, especially in the Senate, could balk at legalizing such a huge swath of people through that expedited process. If Democrats do use reconciliation as their vehicle, Chishti predicts, they are likely to define the population of \"essential\" workers eligible for legalization much more narrowly than advocates prefer -- probably about 1 million people truly at the \"front lines\" of the pandemic, such as nurses and those in meatpacking plants.\n \"If Covid is the dominant backdrop for the next year, then you have to get reconciliation for things that are reasonably close to Covid -- so essential workers has a certain resonance in [that] context,\" he says. \"There is a reasonable argument that you can't be essential and not protected from deportation.\"\n Using the reconciliation tool likely would not only prevent Democrats from legalizing most of the undocumented, but both the rules and politics of the process would also almost certainly exclude major changes in the legal immigration system. And that could also represent another major opportunity cost.\n The efforts by Trump and congressional Republicans over the past four years to slash legal immigration collided with a clear economic imperative facing the US: the need for more working-age people to grow the nation's labor market and consumer base. As William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, recently calculated, the US from 2010 to 2020 appeared on track to record the slowest population growth in percentage terms for any decade in American history. That's occurring even as the number of seniors -- who will require federal spending on Social Security and Medicare -- is still rapidly increasing with the retirement of the baby boom.\n While unemployment is very high now, once the economy recovers from the pandemic, Frey notes, America will need more working-age adults to help pay the taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare for the growing number of seniors. And with fertility rates low, more immigration is the only realistic path to rejuvenating America's working-age population. The irony is that means an increasingly non-White and foreign-born workforce will pay the taxes to support the retirement of the preponderantly White older population that has responded most ardently to Trump's xenophobic messaging.\n \"The projections show we are going to be dealing with lower population growth and an aging population, and the only way we are going to be able to keep our labor force growing and vital is through immigration,\" Frey told me. \"Immigrants and their kids are younger than the general population and we're going to have to have a steady stream of that to counter the aging of the rest of the population.\"\n The unlikelihood of progress on legal immigration is another reason why reconciliation represents an imperfect option for immigrant advocates and their Democratic allies. But after the disappointments of the Bush and Obama breakdowns, and the searing immigration wars of the Trump years, they appear more than ready to take what they can get in the legislative process. And they look less likely than in the past to slog through lengthy negotiations if the GOP balks -- and the business groups that support reform can't move enough of those congressional Republicans to \"yes.\"\n \"My focus is to get a deal of some sort: I am not looking to bypass [bipartisan negotiations] and go to reconciliation,\" Menendez says. \"But I don't intend to go home with nothing in my hand.\"\n This story has been updated to reflect that a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration's pause on deportations.",

        "title": "Why Your TV Spies on You",
        "body_text": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n We are working, learning, staying in touch and being entertained through screens. But the companies that make those devices don\u2019t have it easy. And that makes our virtual lives creepier and less fulfilling than they could be.\n It\u2019s been true for years that for many companies, it\u2019s tough to make money from selling smartphones, personal computers, television sets, streaming TV boxes like Roku and video game consoles. It takes a lot of expertise and cash to efficiently make complex electronics, and it\u2019s a constant fight to beat competitors on price and catch shoppers\u2019 attention.\n The dynamic creates two paths for the consumer electronics that many of us rely on. One is for gigantic companies to take over and crowd out everyone else. The other path is for companies to become money grubbing monsters. Either way, it\u2019s not great for us.\n It was barely a blip for most of us, but last week the Korean electronics giant LG said it might stop making smartphones. LG was for a long time one of the top phone sellers in the world. Now it\u2019s not. LG made many mistakes, and rivals like Apple, Samsung and Huawei overtook it.\n But it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s no room for relative minnows in many categories of consumer electronics. Not too long ago, there were still lots of companies making smartphones, PCs and some other categories of devices like fitness wearables. HTC gave up on smartphones. Sony mostly ditched PCs. Remember Jawbone? Dead. Fitbit is owned by Google now. These gadget categories and more only have room for whales.\n Consolidation is natural when any product goes from the hot new thing to mainstream. I promise you that I\u2019m not nostalgic for old smartphone companies. (Well, maybe I\u2019m still misty-eyed for Palm.) But I know that we lose something when companies with fresh ideas in gadgets have little chance and don\u2019t bother to even try.\n And my bigger worry is that the difficulties of making it in hardware are nudging gadget sellers to do yucky things to us.\n Popular brands of TV sets keep track of what we\u2019re watching and report it to companies that want to sell us new cars or credit cards. (Yeah, it\u2019s gross.) One reason they do it is that selling personal information is pure profit, whereas selling you a TV set is definitely not. Roku also makes its real money not from selling its gizmos that connect our TVs to streaming apps, but from its side gigs including its troves of information about what we watch that it uses to sell ads.\n You can think of these consumer electronics companies as basically Facebook that happens to sell us the screens, too. I don\u2019t know about you, but that makes me feel less affectionate about my marathon sessions of \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d\n Microsoft a few days ago announced \u2014 and then quickly backtracked on \u2014 a steep price increase for its Xbox online video game subscriptions. The price increase was a bone-headed move, but it also reflected the harsh reality: Selling Xbox video game consoles generates relatively slim profits for Microsoft. Add-ons like online subscriptions are more profitable.\n I don\u2019t want to exaggerate what\u2019s happening. In some areas of consumer electronics, there are still plenty of new ideas flourishing. Don\u2019t shed any tears for Apple and its piles of cash. But mostly, hardware is hard. And that makes things tougher on us, too, at a time when we need our gadgets more than ever.\n Brian X. Chen, the personal technology columnist for The New York Times, tells us the essential apps to download now.\n The most downloaded apps today include TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Netflix. Left off the most popular lists are a few staples that every smartphone needs. Here are my top three:\n 1. A password manager. The rule of thumb is that each password you use should be unique and complex. But it\u2019s impossible to do that and remember them all.\n Password-management apps like 1Password and LastPass solve this problem. They let you store all your passwords in a digital vault that can be unlocked with one master password. In other words, you only need to memorize one password. The apps also include tools to automatically generate complex passwords for you.\n 2. An ad blocker. Many online ads are loaded with scripts that collect your personal information and suck up your phone battery; some even contain links to malware. Until the ad industry comes up with a better way, our best bet is using an ad blocking app like 1Blocker to prevent ads from loading in the web browser.\n Some see ad blockers as problematic because they can drain revenue from websites. But many of the apps let people select their favorite sites and unblock those ads. (For Android users: Google doesn\u2019t allow ad blockers to be downloaded through its app store. To install the apps you will need to use a method known as sideloading.)\n 3. An encrypted messaging app. Our online conversations should be no one else\u2019s business. That makes encrypted messaging crucial.\n Here\u2019s how it works: When you send a message, it becomes scrambled so that it is indecipherable to anyone but the intended recipient.\n If anyone else, including a government agency, wants to see your messages, no one \u2014 including the app provider itself \u2014 can get access to the unscrambled messages. For years, my favorite encrypted messaging app has been Signal because of its excellent privacy safeguards.\n Baby owls! In a bucket! Don\u2019t miss the little ones that need a nudge on the rump.

        "title": "Weinstein Victims To Receive $17 Million In Film Company Liquidation",
        "body_text": "A bankruptcy judge has approved a plan to liquidate the Weinstein Company that allocates slightly more than $17 million to Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual abuse victims.\n The money will form a Sexual Misconduct Claims Fund, court documents stipulate. Each of the women will have a chance to submit a claim that will be evaluated by a designated examiner using a point system, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n The disgraced Hollywood producer is currently serving out a 23-year prison sentence in New York state for sexually assaulting two women. He was convicted in March while continuing to maintain that all of his sexual encounters have been consensual.\n Nearly 40 women with sexual abuse claims against Weinstein who were a part of the lawsuit voted to move forward with the plan earlier this month.\n \u201cI will not get into an analysis of whether one victim\u2019s claim has more validity or more value than another\u2019s,\u201d Judge Mary Walrath said during a Monday hearing to approve the plan, per The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cEvery victim of Harvey Weinstein was victimized and deserves to have a say into the plan confirmation. If they choose not to release Mr. Weinstein, they have the right to have a jury trial.\u201d\n The judge noted that 83% of the women expressed \u201cvery loudly that they want closure through acceptance of this plan.\u201d\n An attorney for some of the victims,\u00a0Beth Fegan, said in a statement to HuffPost that she believed the settlement \u201cwill benefit all victims\u201d by providing \u201cmeaningful monetary compensation for their injuries in a confidential process.\u201d\n \u201cHarvey Weinstein caused irremediable harm with his decades-long, predatory sexual abuse,\u201d Fegan said. \u201cJudge Walrath\u2019s decision is the first step in bringing closure to his victims.\u201d\n An attorney for the Weinstein Company, Paul Zumbro, said in a statement to CNN that he and his clients are also \u201cpleased\u201d with Walrath\u2019s ruling, \u201cparticularly so given there is now a mechanism that allows victims to receive compensation without having to endure the hardships and uncertainties of litigation.\u201d\n To obtain her full share of the claims fund, each woman must individually agree to release Weinstein from future claims. If she does not agree, her monetary compensation will be reduced to just 25%.\n Lawyers for the handful of women who objected to the plan argued in court documents that the fund was \u201cpathetically meager\u201d and that the distribution scheme was unreasonable.\n \u201cThere is nothing fair about a plan that requires a rape victim to release her rapist in order to receive a full reward from the sexual misconduct fund,\u201d the attorneys wrote, according to The Associated Press.\n HuffPost has reached out for comment to attorneys for the Weinstein Company but did not receive an immediate response.",

        "title": "Is There a Secret to Success on Instagram?",
        "body_text": "In October of last year, Rachel Reichenbach, an artist and college student in the Bay Area, got an email from Instagram \u2014 specifically, from a human being at Instagram who was offering to help her expand her audience. She was intrigued.\n Ms. Reichenbach has more than 78,000 Instagram followers \u2014 a sizable audience, but nowhere close to the millions who follow the platform\u2019s biggest stars. Suddenly, out of nowhere, someone was offering one-on-one advice. She took the meeting.\n \u201cHe had his spiel that he had to go through,\u201d Ms. Reichenbach said of her call with the Instagram representative. \u201cBasically, it was all about Reels, and how you can use Reels to make your reach better.\u201d\n That Instagram wanted people to use Reels, a TikTok-style video feature introduced in August, wasn\u2019t a surprise. But Ms. Reichenbach was taken aback by the specificity of the advice. He said the goal was \u201cfour to seven Reels a week,\u201d she said. This felt like something more than general guidance, so she started asking questions.\n How many photos or videos should she be posting to her main feed? (Three a week, she was told.) How often should she be posting Instagram Stories? (Eight to 10 times a week, but preferably at least two times a day.) What about posting longer videos to Instagram TV? (One to three per week.) Consistency was key, the representative emphasized.\n Ms. Reichenbach, who makes \u201ca full-time living and then some\u201d selling her art, finds most of her customers through Instagram, but she doesn\u2019t consider herself an influencer. \u201cMy business is: I draw cute frog characters who like to do crimes and stuff like that,\u201d she said. She sells prints, pins, buttons and other merchandise. She\u2019s on Instagram to support her work.\n Still, her friends and peers were curious about what she\u2019d learned. \u201cI felt like I suddenly had all the secrets,\u201d Ms. Reichenbach said. Word of her meeting got around, and soon she was overwhelmed by messages in artists\u2019 groups on Discord and elsewhere. She wrote up her experience on her blog \u2014 mainly, she said, to make it easier to share with the people reaching out to her. She illustrated the post with an anxious frog.\n The post went viral within days and has been viewed nearly 200,000 times. Ms. Reichenbach was startled by some of the responses. \u201cOn Instagram, most people were like, \u2018Thank you so much, this is helpful,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOn Twitter, people were like, \u2018I want to burn Instagram and Facebook to the ground.\u2019\u201d\n Some people wanted more information; others just wanted to vent about how Instagram was making them miserable. Ms. Reichenbach began to see the guidance from her post circulating without context \u2014 she had portrayed Instagram\u2019s recommendations as unrealistic, and offered advice for reducing stress \u2014 not just on Instagram and Twitter but on TikTok. Strangers accused her of being a \u201ccorporate shill,\u201d while a few sent her \u201chateful\u201d emails.\n She also saw artists she had looked up to \u201csince middle school\u201d sharing her article. \u201cThe social media landscape is bleak as hell these days, and it\u2019s designed to whittle away at your self confidence and capitalize off of that, so do your best not to let it,\u201d tweeted one of these artists, Jen Bartel, in response to the post.\n \u201cI felt like I had dealt psychic damage to some of my heroes,\u201d Ms. Reichenbach joked. All she had done was accept a meeting and share a few notes. But, at least for a moment, that had transformed her into a guru \u2014 privy, in the eyes of the Instagram-using public, to secret information that could change others\u2019 businesses, brands, identities and lives.\n As soon as any platform shows the slightest social or economic potential, subcultures will pop up that are dedicated to optimization and growth.\n On YouTube, accounts with millions of subscribers specialize in sharing the \u201csecrets\u201d to subscriber growth. On TikTok, people claim to possess secret knowledge about how to break into the app\u2019s automatically and individually generated \u201cFor You\u201d pages. Information from meetings similar to Ms. Reichenbach\u2019s quickly becomes gospel. Useful advice can be difficult to fully separate from get-rich-quick hustling, but many professional creators can\u2019t afford to tune out these conversations completely.\n According to Jackson Williams, who helps oversee talent outreach and development on Instagram, the contents of Ms. Reichenbach\u2019s post were generally accurate, as was her characterization of the meeting.\n Mr. Williams said that a \u201clarge global team supports our partners in a variety of verticals,\u201d doing similar sorts of outreach across Instagram, but did not disclose how many people work on this team, or how many similar meetings are held during any given period of time. Ms. Reichenbach was told she got the meeting because this team noticed some of her successful Reels. \u201cVery popular\u201d Instagrammers, Mr. Williams said, might have \u201chigh-touch\u201d relationships with company representatives.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t a secret,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThis is the same type of thing that we talk about to our broad open presentations\u201d at influencer events such as VidCon. In bits and pieces, for different audiences, the information in Ms. Reichenbach\u2019s post had been shared and intuited before.\n Mr. Williams took issue, however, with some of the responses.\n In particular, he pushed back against the idea that Instagram was punishing users who didn\u2019t engage with its newest feature. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty for not using Reels,\u201d he said. \u201cBroadly speaking, this is an Instagram best practices sort of thing.\u201d A representative later added: \u201cOther content is not being downranked in service of content on Reels.\u201d\n Like most social platforms, Instagram\u2019s app has never been shy about its priorities. In the beginning, social platforms tend to be blunt about what matters, minting new currencies with likes or shares, comments or reposts, followers or reach. As social platforms mature, becoming both more crowded and more important in some users\u2019 lives, growth can become more difficult to sustain. Competition is greater. User preferences change. The platforms themselves change as they please, leaving longtime users scrambling to find their footing again.\n Currently, Reels are front and center. And like the Snapchat-inspired Stories, this new feature conscripts users into a battle more Instagram\u2019s than their own. (This time against TikTok.)\n There is also a hint of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in Instagram\u2019s broadening outreach. In the mid-2010s, Instagram\u2019s parent company Facebook was scheduling similar meetings with low-tier partners, offering advice about how to get ahead at a time when success on the platform was seen by many brands and publishers as valuable and necessary.\n I attended one such meeting as an editor at a small publication; I was advised, by a representative who did not seem familiar with the site, to diversify our Facebook content. A few image posts a day would help, in addition to the links to articles we were already sharing. Her main message was that the best way to grow our audience would be to post more videos (at least one a week, but preferably many more). Our meeting was in 2015. Facebook\u2019s video feature \u2014 a direct challenge to YouTube \u2014 wasn\u2019t yet a year old.\n A year later, publishers, brands and influencers were being invited to similar meetings, only this time the advice centered on another new Facebook feature. Regardless of whether you were an artist, or a brand of chips, a publication about animals, a fringe political page, or an arm of government, you were told that your best bet for reaching more people on Facebook, where you might have been posting for more than a decade at that point, was to start broadcasting live video. There was a whole new tab in the app for it. It was, the company said, a great way to build their audiences, and to improve reach.\n Victoria Ying, another artist admired by Ms. Reichenbach, recently took stock of her social media presence. \u201cI joined Instagram back in 2012, almost a decade ago,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was almost quaint to look back and see a raw feed full of just whatever I wanted. Back then there was no algorithm to contend with, or if there was, it wasn\u2019t something on my mind.\u201d\n At first, Ms. Ying, who had a stable job as an artist for Disney Animation Studios, didn\u2019t need to use Instagram for work. When she embarked on a \u201cmore nebulous\u201d career as a graphic novelist and teacher, she decided to try to build a bigger following. \u201cIt shocked me how difficult it was,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than five years and I haven\u2019t seen any significant growth in my following.\u201d (Ms. Ying has more than 70,000 followers.)\n \u201cEven though I\u2019ve tried to build my Instagram and follow all of the \u2018rules\u2019 for engagement, I still haven\u2019t seen any significant growth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a frustrating exercise. I tried everything that was within reason for someone who has to produce art under N.D.A. full time.\u201d It\u2019s worrying to have so little control over something that has become so professionally important, she said. \u201cMy Instagram has been cited by almost all of my clients.\u201d\n When she read Ms. Reichenbach\u2019s post, she saw the same thing many others did: secrets revealed, demands made, a company conveying to a fellow artist that Instagram would reward her for treating it like a full-time job, and that it might leave her behind if she didn\u2019t adapt.\n \u201cAfter reading the post, it all started making sense,\u201d she said. \u201cThe platform wants creators who are wholly devoted to being Instagram artists,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that this is a new and viable way of creating a career in the arts, but it\u2019s not my own personal goal.\u201d The post, she said, gave her a sense of relief. \u201cI was giving my maximum to the platform and now I knew that it would never be enough, so it made it easier for me to just let it go,\u201d she said.\n Mr. Williams said that \u201cburnout is top of mind for us\u201d at Instagram, and that the company tries to encourage users \u2014 \u201cpartners,\u201d again, in platform parlance \u2014 to be \u201cintentional about the role Instagram plays in their lives.\u201d Asked how he might convey this to anxious Instagrammers hungry for insider information and then disheartened when they finally hear it, Mr. Williams echoed Ms. Reichenbach\u2019s representative.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cconsistency is key.\u201d",

        "title": "Indian court rules that groping without removing clothes is not sexual assault",
        "body_text": "(CNN) A court in India has ruled that groping a child through their clothing does not constitute sexual assault, drawing outrage across the country and frustrating campaigners battling to address widespread sexual abuse against women and children.\n In a judgment last week, Bombay High Court judge Pushpa Ganediwala found that a 39-year-old man was not guilty of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl as he had not removed her clothes, meaning there was no skin-on-skin contact.\n According to court documents, the man brought the child to his house on the pretext of giving her guava in December 2016. While there, he touched her chest and tried to remove her underwear, according to the judgment.\n He was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to three years in prison in a lower court, but then appealed to the High Court.\n In her judgment on January 19, Justice Ganediwala found that his act \"would not fall in the definition of 'sexual assault,'\" which carries a minimum three year prison term which can be extended to five years.\n \"Considering the stringent nature of punishment provided for the offense, in the opinion of this court, stricter proof and serious allegations are required,\" she wrote. India's Protection of Children From Sexual Offenses Act 2012 does not explicitly state that skin-on-skin contact is needed to constitute the crime of sexual assault.\n Justice Ganediwala acquitted the accused of sexual assault but convicted him on the lesser charge of molestation and sentenced him to one year in prison.\n \"It is the basic principle of criminal jurisprudence that the punishment for an offense shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the crime,\" she said.\n The National Commission for Women said it planned to mount a legal challenge to the judgment, which it said will have a \"cascading effect on various provisions involving safety and security of women.\"\n Karuna Nundy, a lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, the country's top court, called for judges who passed judgments that were \"completely contrary to established law\" and basic rights to be retrained.\n \"Judgments like this contribute to impunity in crimes against girls,\" she tweeted.\n Ranjana Kumari, the director of non-profit Centre for Social Research, which advocates for women's rights in India, said the judgment is \"shameful, outrageous, shocking and devoid of judicial prudence.\"\n Sexual assault is huge issue in India, where sexual crimes are often brutal and widespread, but are often poorly dealt with under the country's justice system. Based on official figures from 2018, the rape of a woman is reported every 16 minutes.\n Following a high-profile case in 2012 when a 23-year-old student was raped and murdered on a New Delhi bus, legal reforms and more severe penalties were introduced.\n Those included fast track courts to move rape cases through the justice system swiftly, an amended definition of rape to include anal and oral penetration, and the publication of new government guidelines intended to do away with the two-finger test which purportedly assessed whether a woman had sexual intercourse recently.\n But high-profile rape cases have continued to hit headlines. Last year, number of cases sparked outrage, including the case of a 13-year-old girl who was raped and found strangled to death in a field, and an 86-year-old woman who was allegedly raped while she waited for the milkman.\n Activists have pointed to ongoing issues in the justice system. Under India's legal system, for instance, sexually abusing a transgender person carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.\n CNN's Swati Gupta and Manveena Suri contributed reporting.",

        "title": "A \u2018happy kid\u2019 at heart, Jakub Vrana is growing up with the Capitals",
        "body_text": "Jakub Vrana came off the ice at the Washington Capitals\u2019 practice facility Saturday afternoon, casually looked up and flashed a wide smile at the onlookers above. It\u2019s hard to find a moment when the 24-year-old Czech winger isn\u2019t grinning, joking or genuinely enjoying himself.\n He can\u2019t help it. Vrana describes himself as a \u201chappy kid\u201d who loves hockey, likes to have fun, laugh and then laugh some more. He knows the Capitals\u2019 fan base views him the same way.\n \u201cI mean, first off, when you are just looking at my face, I mean, I look like [a kid] a little bit,\u201d the babyfaced Vrana said with a chuckle. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d\n His escapades with teammates in the days after winning the Stanley Cup in 2018 are also enduring examples of that \u201ckid\u201d persona \u2014 the photos and videos from those nights still frequently surface on social media. His permanent personal reminder is the Stanley Cup tattoo he got on his left wrist while holding former goaltender Braden Holtby\u2019s hand.\n \u201cI wake up and I didn\u2019t even know I had it,\u201d Vrana said recently. \u201cI looked at my arm the next morning, and it was there.\u201d\n A month from his 25th birthday, Vrana isn\u2019t a kid in the hockey world anymore. The Capitals\u2019 2014 first-round draft pick is in his fourth full NHL season and is being shaped into a critical piece of the organization.\n \u201cJake Vrana is part of that [leadership] group,\u201d Coach Peter Laviolette said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a kid anymore. \u2026 His hand is on the rope.\u201d\n Vrana has three goals and three assists in six games this season, finding the scoresheet in all but one game. He has a lot to prove; his two-year, $6.7 million contract expires at the end of the season, at which point he will become a restricted free agent.\n Vrana has been tasked with top-line duties the past two games after four players, including forwards Alex Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov, were forced out of the lineup because of the NHL\u2019s coronavirus protocols. Add to the mix the lower-body injury forward Tom Wilson suffered Friday, and Vrana\u2019s importance only has grown.\n \u201cIt\u2019s been four or five years for me now [with the team], and I mean, my role, I want to be a leader,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cI want to step up in the big moments.\u201d\n Vrana\u2019s tattoo, which depicts the Stanley Cup with two sticks and three stars, is a reminder of how far he has come. Yet it also is a reminder of how far he needs to go. He has set career highs in goals in each of the past two seasons, but he produced zero points in 15 games in the 2019 and 2020 playoffs.\n When asked earlier this season to talk about his past postseason performances or the 2018 Cup run, he offered a reminder that he is focused on what\u2019s ahead.\n \u201cWhatever happened already happened,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was talking about, the mind-set. You can\u2019t change it anymore. You are not headed backwards. You are headed forwards. You are heading to your future.\u201d\n The importance of a proper mind-set to Vrana was solidified in November 2019, when he and Capitals great Peter Bondra were sitting side-by-side at an autograph session, chatting about scoring goals.\n The night before against Buffalo, Vrana had scored twice, and fans were talking about how he almost had a hat trick. As Bondra recalled, he could sense Vrana\u2019s exasperation, so he started teasing him to lighten the mood.\n There was talk of how Bondra scored 503 goals in his career, which was \u201cpretty good,\u201d Vrana remarked, and how Bondra tallied 19 hat tricks during his 16-year NHL career. When Vrana noted he hadn\u2019t yet managed one, Bondra asked why.\n \u201cWhat is stopping you from scoring a hat trick?\u201d Bondra asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have three to four scoring chances. Just do it.\u201d\n \u201cYou just need to imagine it, and it will happen,\u201d Vrana recalls Bondra telling him.\n On his ride home, Vrana started to envision his first hat trick. Twenty-four hours later, he scored three goals in a 4-2 win over the Calgary Flames.\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he is capable of,\u201d Bondra said.\n Vrana is still working on his craft, focusing mainly on improving his strength and conditioning. Playing at his best also includes keeping a clear mind. In the offseason, he went home to the Czech Republic to be with family for an extended amount of time for the first time in several years.\n \u201cJust being home [was good],\u201d Vrana said. \u201cWe were just around each other, and that\u2019s the most important thing \u2014 the people around you.\u201d\n The people around Vrana during the season are equally important. He might not be the No. 1 player on the ice or in the dressing room at all times, but his role, his place on the team and his continued growth are all under his control.\n \u201cOf course I have grown. I have gone through some things, but I am not going to change myself. \u2026 Your personality, you cannot change that,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cYou are still going to be a positive kid that loves playing hockey and bringing people what they want. And year by year, you are developing yourself.\u201d",

        "title": "Opinion:  Democrats have vigorously used the filibuster. It\u2019s pathetic they now won\u2019t pledge to protect it.",
        "body_text": "The good news is: Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has secured what he says is an ironclad promise from two Democrats not to eliminate the legislative filibuster. The bad news is: The filibuster hangs by a fragile, two-vote thread.\n In 2017, when Donald Trump was president and Democrats were in the minority, 61 senators \u2014 including 30 Democrats \u2014 signed a letter promising to preserve the right of the Senate minority to delay or block legislation. But now that Republicans are in the minority, just two Democrats \u2014 Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) \u2014 are willing to make that same pledge. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not only refused, he warned he will not allow the GOP minority to \u201cdictate to the Senate what we should do and how we should proceed.\u201d\n When Schumer was minority leader, he vigorously used the filibuster to do just that. Under his leadership, Democrats used the filibuster to block funding for construction of Trump\u2019s border wall in 2019. They used it not once, but twice to impede passage of the Cares Act \u2014 forcing Republicans to agree to changes including a $600 weekly federal unemployment supplement. They used it in September and October to stop Republicans from passing further coronavirus relief before the November election. They used it to halt Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s (R-S.C.) police reform legislation so Republicans could not claim credit for forging a bipartisan response to the concerns of racial justice protesters. They used it to block legislation to force \u201csanctuary cities\u201d to cooperate with federal officials, and to stop a prohibition on taxpayer funding of abortion, bans on abortions once the unborn child is capable of feeling pain, and protections for the lives of babies born alive after botched abortions.\n And those are just the bills Democrats killed with actual filibuster votes. More often than not, the majority doesn\u2019t even bring up legislation that does not have 60 votes needed to cut off debate. Just the threat of a Democratic filibuster stopped Republicans from moving forward on a host of priorities, including entitlement reforms, immigration reforms, lawsuit reforms, health-care reforms, budget cuts, expanded gun rights and the defunding of Planned Parenthood. And Democrats have used the filibuster to force Republicans to reduce the scope of some of their biggest legislative achievements. Republicans could not make the Trump income tax cut permanent, because they had to use the arcane budget reconciliation process (which requires a simple majority vote, but limits what can be enacted) to avoid a Democratic filibuster.\n Trump grew so frustrated by this that he repeatedly urged McConnell to eliminate the filibuster. But McConnell wisely insisted he would \u201cnot vandalize this core tradition for short-term gain.\u201d He refused to scrap this rule when it was protecting Democrats, because he knew that in politics there are no permanent victories. Yet now many of the same Democrats who defended the filibuster when Republicans had unified control of government want to abolish it when Democrats do. Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), one of the organizers of that 2017 bipartisan letter, now says that Democrats will \u201cnot stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration\u2019s initiatives blocked at every turn.\u201d\n Democrats should take stock of everything they delayed and derailed under Trump because of the filibuster \u2014 and then imagine all that and more being enacted by simple majority vote when Republicans regain control of Congress and the presidency, which they eventually will. The filibuster allowed Democrats to constrain Republicans from enacting what the Democrats consider a radical agenda under a populist right-wing president. If they eliminate that tool to enact their own radical agenda, they would rue that decision when they return to the minority \u2014 and hasten that return by provoking a populist backlash that could sweep them out of power.\n In his inaugural address, Biden declared that \u201cpolitics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war.\u201d But if Democrats eliminate the one procedural safety valve that forces negotiation, moderation, compromise and consensus, they will pour gasoline on the fires Biden wants to tamp down, and turn every election into a matter of life or death for the other side.\n Manchin and Sinema say they will not, under any circumstance, vote to abolish the filibuster. We\u2019ll see whether they back McConnell against Schumer and Biden when Republicans launch their first filibuster of a major Biden initiative. But it is pathetic that no other Democrats will pledge to preserve a tool they so liberally used in recent years \u2014 and that one of our democracy\u2019s most important institutional guardrails is just two votes away from elimination.\n Read more:\n Greg Sargent: The good and the bad in Mitch McConnell\u2019s big surrender\n Julio Ricardo Varela: Biden must fight for immigration reform like never before. Until I see that, consider me a skeptic.\n Giselle Donnelly, David Barno and Nora Bensahel: Biden has lifted the military \u2018trans ban.\u2019 But there\u2019s more work to do.\n Jennifer Rubin: 50 things that are better already\n Robert Robb: Arizona\u2019s GOP has been dysfunctional before, but this time feels different\n Karen Tumulty: Biden is betting on Senate compromise. So far, it\u2019s paying off.",

        "title": "Dr. Deborah Birx's shocking interview is way too late",
        "body_text": "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \"OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.\" Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n (CNN) Now she tells us.\n After nearly a year of supposedly coordinating the Trump White House's coronavirus response, Dr. Deborah Birx went public about the mishandling of a pandemic that has left more than 400,000 Americans dead. Dr. Birx went on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday night, and she dropped some bombshells.\n But it's not just the former president who came out looking bad. While Birx isn't wholly or even mostly responsible for Donald Trump's shocking negligence on a Covid-19 response, viewers were still left wondering: Why are we just learning about this now?\n Right off the bat, Birx said she was the only person in the White House working full-time on the Covid-19 response. A pandemic was raging, killing more Americans than any war in more than 150 years, and the Trump administration was fighting it with a dedicated team of one.\n Then Birx told her interviewer, Margaret Brennan, how the Trump administration simply passed the buck, ceding all responsibility to the states and offering them only \"support\" -- never fully explaining what that meant or understanding what they needed.\n And she disclosed that there was \"parallel data\" coming into the White House that Trump relied on. Birx said she suspected it came from Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist Trump put on the task force, who spent the pandemic spreading dangerous misinformation about Covid-19.\n She said her own ideas for fighting the virus, which she developed based on deep data-dives and extensive research and planning, were disregarded. She said she didn't know if the former president was told to listen to her at all. And she added that the Trump team muzzled her, refusing to let her speak with the national press and clearly explain the real threat of the disease to the American people.\n Another jarring revelation: That nobody but Birx and her one aide regularly wore masks in the White House.\n All of this would have been good to know back in the spring. Or summer. Or fall, as Americans were deciding whether or not to keep Trump in office.\n Birx's interview is shocking and enraging. But to be fair to Birx, there are mitigating circumstances. Unlike the many power-seeking enablers and hangers-on who eagerly attached themselves to the Trump administration, Birx is a public servant who went where she was called in an emergency. The country was in crisis. Refusing to work for Trump could have put more lives at risk.\n \"If I think I have something to add, I feel like it's my obligation to the American public to go in and do that,\" Birx told Brennan. \"That's what a civil servant is supposed to do.\"\n It would have been great if she had occasionally stood up to the president and swatted down his dangerous lies, the way Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did. But she occupied a different position, and lacked Fauci's experience navigating complex domestic politics. When Atlas came into the picture and had the ear of the president, Birx was, as Fauci himself explained, living \"with this person in the White House every day, so it was much more of a painful situation for her.\"\n Fauci was more distant from the administration, which gave him greater independence and wider leeway.\n And Birx was no Fauci, a well-known expert with a stellar reputation who quickly gained a devoted following and was widely trusted by the public. Some of that trust surely came from his willingness to gently contradict the former president. But Fauci had another advantage over Birx: while Trump is mercurial and vindictive toward anyone he perceives as contradicting him or threatening his authority, he is particularly awful to women who cross him.\n It's tough to imagine that Birx would have changed much of anything by speaking out. She had a choice: She could call out the president for lying, lose her job and leave the White House Covid-19 task force in the hands of people like Atlas. Or she could keep her mouth shut and try to clean things up from the inside.\n She said she chose the second option, setting off to meet with state governors and help them with their Covid responses -- the only effective strategy at her disposal, since the Trump administration punted everything to the states.\n Birx fundamentally sees herself as a person with technical expertise who helps to solve public health problems, not a supporter of any particular administration. But like so many long-time federal employees and creatures of Washington, she seems to have badly miscalculated just how political this administration would make a deadly virus, and just how willingly they would ignore the science and endanger the public to soothe the ego of a fragile, unpredictable man.\n Even all of this context, though, doesn't absolve Birx. Yes, she's finally spilling a few of the beans about the former president's rank mismanagement of this crisis. But even in this latest interview, she was hesitant to be too critical of the Trump administration. She outlined her frustrations, but avoided pointed criticism of her former bosses. Even now, with Trump gone and retirement looming, Birx was unwilling to hold the previous administration fully to account.\n At the very least, there should be a thorough investigation into how the Covid-19 response was so bungled. Who exactly is responsible for failing to protect millions of Americans from disease and death? How did all this happen?  Unfortunately, it's still not clear that Birx would be a transparent and fully forthcoming part of that process.\n Birx knows she made grave errors. \"I could have done more, been more outspoken, maybe been more outspoken publicly,\" she said. While she didn't know how far she could have pushed the envelope, she wished she had pushed harder.\n So do we.",

        "title": "U.S. prosecutors eye 400 potential suspects, expect sedition charges \u2018very soon\u2019 in Jan. 6 Capitol breach",
        "body_text": "U.S. authorities have opened case files on at least 400 potential suspects and expect to bring sedition charges against some \u201cvery soon\u201d in the sprawling investigation of the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol, officials said.\n Acting U.S. attorney Michael R. Sherwin said Tuesday at a news conference that while new arrests in the nationwide manhunt will soon \u201cplateau\u201d after an initial wave of 135 arrests and 150 federal criminally charged cases, investigations continue into whether different \u201cmilitia groups [and] individuals\u201d from several states conspired and coordinated the illegal assault on Congress beforehand.\n In charging papers, prosecutors have already identified a dozen members or affiliates of militant right-wing groups, including the nativist Proud Boys and the anti-government Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, the latter two of which recruit heavily among former military and law enforcement personnel.\n Sherwin suggested that seditious conspiracy charges are pending and, without commenting on grand jury indictments, said that \u201cthe results will bear fruit very soon.\u201d\n Federal law makes conspiring to overthrow or oppose by force federal authority punishable by up to 20 years in prison, including the use of violence to prevent, hinder or delay the execution of law.\n Sherwin, the top federal prosecutor in D.C., gave reporters an update on the probe, alongside FBI Washington Field Office head Steven D\u2019Antuono, roughly three weeks after mobs of Trump supporters overran police lines and smashed their way into the U.S. Capitol.\n The riot disrupted the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s electoral college victory and led to the evacuation of lawmakers and assaults on roughly 139 police officers. It also resulted in five deaths, including Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick and a California woman, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer while climbing through a window leading to an inner room of the House.\n Law enforcement officials have estimated that roughly 800 people entered the Capitol without authorization, The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n Speaking via teleconference Tuesday, officials declined to confirm that figure, saying that the total remained fluid pending video and other analysis. But D\u2019Antuono confirmed that the FBI has opened subject case files on more than 400 individuals with the help of more than 200,000 public tips, among other sources.\n Prosecutors have obtained more than 500 grand jury subpoenas and search warrants, and charged dozens with assaulting police, a number Sherwin said would quickly grow.\n Asked about the potential of related future violence, D\u2019Antuono said the FBI is \u201cdetermining if there are any viable leads we can follow.\u201d\n \u2018There\u2019s a lot of threats out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to separate the aspirational from the intentional.\u201d\n Sherwin denied that there was a private debate among law enforcement officials over whether to charge individuals not observed to have engaged in violent, threatening or destructive behavior.\n \u201cThere is no internal deliberation or confusion among any law enforcement partners .\u2009.\u2009. or the court system. Everyone is all in on these cases,\u201d Sherwin said. \u201cIf a crime was committed, we are charging you, regardless of whether you were outside or inside the Capitol, to include misdemeanors.\u201d\n The update came amid a steady surge of court appearances and detention hearings. On Tuesday, a defense lawyer for a woman accused of being involving in stealing a laptop from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during the Capitol riot said that the allegation came from an ex-boyfriend who had \u201cvowed to take revenge\u201d on the defendant and started sending messages in her name.\n A U.S. magistrate judge ordered that Riley June Williams, 22, remain on home confinement with her mother in Harrisburg, Pa., under restrictions after prosecutors in D.C. did not request her further detention.\n U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui of Washington initially voiced concern about the release given the \u201cvery frightening scenario\u201d laid out in charging papers, which stated that an unnamed former romantic partner said Williams stole a laptop during the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol and planned to sell it to a Russian friend to give to the Russian intelligence agency SVR.\n But the judge changed course after learning more during hearings Monday and Tuesday, saying the case was appearing less like a spy thriller and more like a domestic dispute.\n \u201cThis read like an episode of \u2018The Americans,\u2019 but it sounds like an American story of a different sort, frankly,\u201d about \u201csomeone with an ax to grind,\u201d Faruqui said.\n \u201cThere is a lot of reason to be skeptical\u201d of the allegations, federal public defender A.J. Kramer agreed, citing an ex-boyfriend against whom Williams is seeking a restraining order. \u201cThey are made by somebody who has vowed to take revenge on her.\u201d\n Justice Department senior trial attorney Mona Sedky asked for Williams\u2019s release on the condition that she stay off computers and the Internet, citing fresh concerns that she was destroying evidence. Sedky also asked for a mental health screening out of \u201cpersonal interest in the defendant\u2019s safety and well-being.\u201d\n Prosecutors did not make the requests lightly, Sedky said, but based on evidence learned since Williams\u2019s arrest that she had deleted social media accounts and urged others on Discord \u2014 a chat app popular with gamers \u2014 to erase messages about Jan. 6. Prosecutors identified Williams as a woman seen in video of the riot directing others upstairs, toward Pelosi\u2019s office.\n Faruqui ordered Williams, who attended the hearing by videoconference, to use the Internet only for legal or mental health consultations. The judge also said he would trust her and her mother to follow the rules because \u201cthe alternative is catastrophic\u201d \u2014 jail.\n Williams\u2019s defense argued that   she deleted social media accounts not to hide evidence but because the ex-boyfriend had started sending messages under her name.\n The FBI has \u201cseized all her electronics\u201d and searched her car and home, Kramer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve searched everywhere. She does not have the computer.\u201d\n Williams surrendered to authorities Jan. 18, a day after she was charged with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. An FBI affidavit alleged she appeared to have filmed and shared a video of another person lifting an HP computer off a desk inside the Capitol.\n Williams was charged with aiding or abetting the theft of government property, but the FBI did not allege that she personally took the device, adding that its whereabouts were unknown.\n Also Tuesday, two Rocky Mount, Va., police officers who are charged with taking part in the Capitol riot were fired.\n \u201cOur officers are held to high standards for how they conduct themselves on and off-duty,\u201d the town said in a statement. \u201cThe actions by two have driven our beautiful town into the national spotlight in ways that do not reflect our whole community.\u201d\n The officers \u2014 Jacob Fracker, 29, and Sgt. Thomas \u201cT.J.\u201d Robertson, 47 \u2014 have told reporters that they did not see any violence in the Capitol and were allowed into the building. According to court documents, one wore a gas mask and told a friend he ran through flash bangs, rubber bullets and chemical gas; he compared the experience to being in Afghanistan. Both men are combat veterans; one is a corporal in the Virginia National Guard.\n Late Monday, prosecutors charged a California man with stealing the Senate chamber\u2019s gold-fringed American flag as well as papers from the desk of Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), then the majority leader, during the breach.\n Tommy Frederick Allan, of Rocklin, Calif., was allegedly recorded outside the Capitol saying he had removed the documents he held in his hand from McConnell\u2019s desk, and the distinctive gold-corded flag and flagpole with a gold eagle finial was recovered from him, according to an unsealed FBI charging affidavit. Information about Allan\u2019s attorney was not immediately available.\n Also Monday, a Texas man charged in the attack was ordered held without bail after apologizing for urging the assassination of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Twitter; he blamed former president Donald Trump for his actions.\n \u201cI am ashamed of my comments,\u201d Garret Miller, 34, of Richardson, Tex., said in a statement released by attorney Clint Broden. \u201cI believed I was following the instructions of former president Trump and he was my president and the commander-in-chief. His statements also had me believing the election was stolen from him.\n \u201cNevertheless, I fully recognize Joe Biden is now the President of the United States and that the election is over,\u201d  Miller continued. He said he never intended to harm Ocasio-Cortez nor police, apologized to both, and called his social media posts \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d\n Miller tweeted \u201cAssassinate AOC\u201d on Jan. 6, according to charging papers. Afterward, he  threatened an officer online, writing that if he got his hands on the officer, he would \u201chug his neck with a nice rope,\u201d court documents said.\n On Jan. 16, he wrote on Facebook that \u201cits huntin season\u201d and that the officer \u201cdeserve[s] to die,\u201d prosecutors alleged.\n Nicholas DeCarlo, a friend of Hawaii Proud Boys leader Nicholas Ochs, was arrested Tuesday, according to the Justice Department. He and Ochs both claimed to be journalists covering the event; DeCarlo was photographed at the Capitol wearing a shirt that read \u201cMurder the Media,\u201d named after his alt-right live-streaming collective, according to charging papers. He is charged with trespassing and unlawfully protesting at the Capitol, as well as obstructing an official proceeding.\n Separately, a federal judge in D.C. on Tuesday barred pending further review the conditional release of the mother of a Tennessee man who authorities say carried flexible plastic handcuffs during the riot. Lisa Eisenhart is accused of conspiracy with her son, Eric Munchel of Nashville. She is also charged with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct on restricted Capitol grounds.",

        "title": "Biden administration revives effort to put Harriet Tubman on $20 bill",
        "body_text": "The $20 bill is getting a new \u2014 but familiar \u2014 face.\n The Biden administration will resume the process to replace President Andrew Jackson\u2019s face on the note with famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during her Monday news briefing. A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed the change.\n Tubman will become the first Black person on the face of American paper currency and the first woman in generations; Martha Washington appeared on a $1 bill in the 1890s, and Pocahontas was in a group picture on the $20 bill in the 1860s, according to Reuters.\n \u201cThe Treasury Department is taking steps to resume efforts to put Harriet Tubman on the front of the new $20 notes,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that our notes \u2026 reflect the history and diversity of our country, and Harriet Tubman\u2019s image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that. So we\u2019re exploring ways to speed up that effort.\u201d\n Derrick Johnson, chief executive and president of the NAACP, said in a statement: \u201cHarriet Tubman lived at a time when Congress, the Supreme Court and our nation was abhorrently paralyzed over whether it was legal to allow one person to own another. In a true act of liberty and independence, Tubman freed herself from slavery, only to return south 19 more times, risking her own life and freedom, to save her family and hundreds of others from a life spent in slavery.\n \u201cThe legacy of Harriet Tubman and other Black Americans who built the nation we know today must be recognized and celebrated in our schools, culture and currency. The NAACP applauds the Biden administration\u2019s announcement to change the design of the $20 bill to commemorate the full story of the significant figures in our history.\u201d\n The Obama administration announced plans to put Tubman on the bill in 2016, after she was chosen from among several women in an informal nationwide poll. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scuttled those plans in 2019.\n Trump was a known fan of Jackson, an enslaver whom historians also widely consider responsible for the forced displacement and death of thousands of American Indians, and displayed a bust of him in the Oval Office.\n \u201cAndrew Jackson had a great history,\u201d Trump said in 2019, \u201cand I think it\u2019s very rough when you take somebody off the bill.\u201d\n He described the decision to include Tubman on the note as \u201cpure political correctness\u201d and suggested she instead appear on the largely ceremonial $2 bill.\n Mnuchin in 2019 pushed back the release of the new $20 bill six years and said it might not include Tubman at all, even though a design of the note and a metal casting for printing was developed in 2018, according to a New York Times report.\n A spokesperson said the Treasury Department does not yet have a timeline for when the bills will enter into circulation. Designing and releasing new currency is a lengthy process that includes considerations for counterfeit protection and ensuring compliance with note-processing machines at locations such as banks and grocery stores.\n Tubman was originally slated to appear on the $10 bill, replacing Alexander Hamilton, one of only two non-presidents featured on American money. Benjamin Franklin appears on the $100 bill. But Hamilton was spared thanks in part to the popularity of the award-winning Broadway musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d Tubman was moved to the $20 instead.\n Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, announced later Monday that she\u2019d reintroduce legislation requiring a woman to appear on $20 bills issued after 2024. She\u2019d sponsored the Women on the Twenty Act in previous Congresses.\n \u201cFor several years, I worked directly with the Department of Treasury to plan the release of the new $20 design featuring Harriet Tubman to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment,\u201d Beatty said in a statement. \u201cThe American people want our currency to better reflect the diversity of our great country. I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration, including the first-ever female Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, to put a woman on the 20 and make the Tubman Twenty a reality.\u201d\n Tubman was born enslaved in 1822 on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. She escaped bondage to Philadelphia in 1849 but returned to rescue her relatives, then more enslaved people, all while battling chronic effects of a traumatic brain injury suffered as a child at the hands of a violent overseer. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 allowed bounty hunters to apprehend enslaved people in free states, Tubman led escaped individuals to freedom in Canada.\n Known as the \u201cMoses\u201d of the Underground Railroad, she was said to never have lost a \u201cpassenger.\u201d During the Civil War, she worked for the Union army as a scout and spy.\n She died of pneumonia in Auburn, N.Y., in 1913 after devoting much of her latter years as a women\u2019s suffrage activist.\n Jeff Stein and DeNeen L. Brown contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "As we move away from the events of Jan. 6, many elected Republicans seem to be settling on a strategy of collective amnesia. Some propose to forget the unpleasant past in the cause of national \u201chealing.\u201d Others adduce a thin constitutional argument against the impeachment of a former president (a position that would effectively grant immunity from impeachment to every president during his last few months in office, when the opportunity to subvert an election is greatest).\n This party-wide retreat from memory and accountability has been symbolized by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s ritual renunciation of his initial moral sanity. When the violence was fresh, he affirmed that President Donald Trump \u201cbears responsibility for [the] attack on Congress by mob rioters.\u201d More recently, under political pressure, McCarthy (R-Calif.) claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t believe he provoked it.\u201d In the process, a whole generation of idealistic young people has been given a reliable guide to public character: Don\u2019t be like this man.\n The desire to erase the memory of unpleasant events is psychologically natural. But it would be disastrous in a democracy under continuing threat. The Capitol insurrection \u2014 and the broader attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election \u2014 lies like an undigested lump in the gut of our political system. How can we be asked to forget events that we haven\u2019t fully processed? The president of the United States, with the broad approval of GOP leaders, systematically attempted to invalidate millions of votes from disproportionately minority voters. When that effort failed, Trump invited a mob to Washington, whipped up its resentments, directed it toward Capitol Hill, urged it to intimidate legislators and disrupt a constitutional process, challenged it to \u201cfight,\u201d and then refused to intervene while domestic terrorists hunted for Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in the hallways of the Capitol.\n Would Republican senators still want the country to put these events behind it if 20 Capitol Police officers had been beaten to death rather than one? If Pelosi had actually been zip-tied and held hostage? If Pence had been murdered? At what point would executive incitement of a violent mob to intimidate the legislative branch meet GOP senators\u2019 exacting standards for conviction? For what similar actions by a Democratic president would they allow bygones to be bygones?\n The problem here is a general lack of Republican shame. In everyday life, shame is a generally unhealthy emotion. In a politician, it is irreplaceable. The possibility of political shame is required by the existence of political honor. Like those in the U.S. military, federal legislators pledge to protect and defend the Constitution. This transforms their job into a calling that involves the possibility of personal sacrifice.\n Those politicians, such as Trump, who view the political enterprise as nothing more than a dirty game are quite literally shameless. Those such as McCarthy, who choose cowardice over sacrifice, are discrediting their calling.\n But what of Republican members of the Senate impeachment jury? A couple \u2014 namely Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) \u2014 are partially responsible for provoking the rage that led to the sacking of the Capitol. Along with a few colleagues, they voted to accede to the demands of the mob, even after its violent attack. They are some of American history\u2019s most reckless violators of democratic honor. And they seem firmly attached to their ignominy.\n Most Senate Republicans, however, voted against the mass disenfranchisement of minority voters. Yet they hesitate to extend Republican misery through a trial, claiming it would draw attention away from other urgent legislative matters.\n A political case can be made that only Senate conviction would liberate the GOP from its Trump captivity. But the justifications run deeper. On the pages of newspapers and in dark corners of the Internet, a consensus is taking shape about the historical meaning of the Capitol assault. Violent radicals want to interpret it as the first shots \u2014 the Lexington and Concord \u2014 of a growing racist revolution, granted the legitimacy of sponsorship by the president of the United States. A Republican senator who votes against conviction of the president would feed this dangerous narrative and empower some of the most vicious and violent people in the United States. That would merit enough shame to define a political career.\n The main reason we cannot throw this event down a memory hole is that the social threats that produced it are ongoing. If the Capitol attack is not fully and completely repudiated, then \u201cJanuary 6!\u201d will be strengthened as a radical rallying cry. And an un-convicted Trump would do his best to ensure it. I suspect he is privately proud of the Bastille-storming performed in his honor.\n By convicting Trump, Senate Republicans would be saying that the insurrection was something very different: the last gasp of a dying presidency, a uniformly condemned outbreak of hatred and an act of eternal dishonor.\n Read more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n Read more:\n Fred Hiatt: Pence and McConnell helped save democracy \u2014 after helping to endanger it\n James Downie: Republicans\u2019 tendentious two-step\n Danielle Allen: \nThe four kinds of truth America needs to pursue for reconciliation\n Jennifer Rubin: Mitch McConnell finally admits that Trump and Republicans provoked the Capitol attack.

        "title": "Biden aims to tackle American's racial inequity crisis",
        "body_text": "(CNN) If there was any doubt about the urgency of President Joe Biden's mission to tackle racial inequality, it was erased in the searing moment an insurrectionist rioter brazenly paraded the Confederate flag through the US Capitol.\n Just 20 days on from one of the most shocking moments in modern US history, Biden on Tuesday made his most detailed policy moves yet on the issue with a series of executive orders on the one crisis haunting his presidency sure to endure once Covid-19 and its economic pain are just a horrible memory.\n He said that the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, in a notorious instance of police brutality against Black Americans last year, had unleashed a common realization among citizens that they could no longer ignore systemic racism.\n \"Those eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around all over the world,\" Biden said. \"It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten.\"\n Biden pressed ahead in the looming shadow of his predecessor Donald Trump after House Democrats on Monday delivered an article of impeachment relating to his role inciting the Capitol riot.\n The uprising, incited by an ex-President who fueled white nationalism, underscored how America's oldest fault line is also one of its freshest following last summer's national racial reckoning.\n Yet subsequent events have also left a sense that while the country has rarely been more divided since a Civil War that was fought over slavery, progress is possible and as necessary as ever.\n In another striking image, on Monday, for example, the first Black, South Asian and female Vice President Kamala Harris swore in the first Black Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two juxtaposed episodes less than three weeks apart encapsulated the nation's deep divides that Biden must confront but also a democracy's potential for change.\n The President has picked the most diverse Cabinet in US history. He has instructed his nominees at the Justice Department to prioritize civil rights and to root out racism and prejudice to apply equality under the law for all Americans. This is no doubt heartfelt. But it is also smart political positioning since he owes his victory in the Democratic nominating race, his triumph over Trump and his party's capture of the Senate to Black voters especially.\n \"The President has committed the whole of our government to advance racial justice and equity for all,\" Susan Rice, the head of Biden's Domestic Policy Council said Tuesday, previewing a major address on race by the President later in the day.\n \"These aren't feel good policies, the evidence is clear -- investing in equity is good for economic growth and it creates jobs for all Americans,\" Rice said, previewing an agenda that is far broader than the most familiar racial issues, including policing and discrimination.\n Biden tackled four areas on Tuesday, including fair housing, reforming the penal system to crack down on private prisons, recommitting the government to lifting up Native American communities and tribes and combating xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n Biden has worked hard to meet the moment, after several clumsy or discordant remarks related to race earlier in his long political career.\n During a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, during the election campaign, Biden argued that the nationwide tide of emotion that followed yet another shooting of a Black man by police, that paralyzed Jacob Blake, was the catalyst for a new effort to tackle all forms of racism and inequality of opportunity.\n He also signaled understanding of the spirit of the resurgent racial justice movement by acknowledging that White Americans could never fully appreciate the historic pain felt by their Black compatriots, an experience shared by many other citizens.\n \"I can't understand what it's like to walk out the door or send my son out the door or my daughter and worry about just because they're Black they may not come back,\" Biden said.\n Soaring words and symbolism are important -- they are part of a President's armory in mobilizing the public and affecting political change. But alone, they cannot transform a country or the lived reality of African Americans. The limited social mobility of millions and the busted promises of many previous \"conversations about race\" sometimes seem little changed from the reality noted by Martin Luther King Jr. in his book \"Where do we go from here: Chaos or Community\" that was first published in 1967.\n \"Loose and easy language about equality, resonant resolutions about brotherhood fall pleasantly on the ear, but for the Negro there is a credibility gap he cannot overlook,\" King wrote.\n In a more recent lesson, the presidency of the first black commander in chief Barack Obama shows that the very act of breaking down barriers that at the time can seem epochal and irreversible can incite new prejudice and breed extremism.\n Biden's effort will require action from the Justice Department to tackle civil rights abuses and to guarantee fairness in the judicial system for all. Former national security adviser Rice's new White House job includes a sweeping mandate across all government agencies.\n Biden is also soon expected to seek reforms on policing, partly in response to the death of Minnesota man George Floyd with a policeman's knee on his neck last year.\n Last week, in the first hours of his presidency, Biden signed an executive order requiring all government departments to put racial and other forms of equality at the center of everything that they do during his term.\n One established that \"advancing equity for all -- including people of color and others who have been historically underserved and marginalized -- is the responsibility of the whole of our government.\" Biden also countermanded an earlier executive order signed by Trump.\n Like much of Biden's presidency, his capacity for action, and to secure the massive funding that serious reform requires, will be constrained by narrow majorities in Congress and Washington's fractured political scene in the post-Trump era. But he does have the moral authority of having won office against a President who tore at the nation's racial chasm with a hard line \"law and order\" campaign based on false claims that the Democratic nominee wanted to dismantle policing as it is currently known.\n The debate over what Biden has said is \"systemic\" racism in the criminal justice system puts the President between two absolutist positions. He finds himself confronted on his right by conservatives keen to demagogue him as anti-police and an enemy of White heartland values.\n Conservative media has already accused Biden of wrongly equating every Trump voter with White nationalists and racists. And many Republicans are now seeking to draw false equivalence between the Trump-inspired violence on January 6 in Washington and clashes that broke out during Black Lives Matter protests last year. Biden has condemned violence in all cases. And violence that erupted in the summer in many cities was not the true expression of the attitude of millions of people who marched to protest racial injustice. The attack on the Capitol represented an unprecedented assault on another branch of government by a US President trying to steal an election.\n To his left, Biden is confronted by progressives who want sweeping reform -- some of whom defined the term \"defund the police\" that many party leaders say helped cost Democrats victories in some key swing state races in the House.\n This particular issue also pulls Biden between two versions of his own political persona. He was severely criticized for his role in 1990s criminal justice legislation that ushered in mandatory minimum sentences that sent many young Black men to jail for years. But he has also always had a strong relationship with the police and their unions during his long political career.\n But the shocking events of last summer and the long litany of videotaped examples of police brutality against African Americans have irrevocably shifted the potency of race and policing in the Democratic Party. And Biden's positioning, though obviously sincere, is also enforced by political reality.\n Still, some of Biden's longtime contacts in policing have told CNN that his experience and familiarity with both sides of this most difficult issue may uniquely equip him to oversee a policy response that goes some way to reconciling the extraordinary, and multi-racial national protests after Floyd's death.\n This story has been updated with additional details.",

        "title": "Biden should look beyond leverage to rejoin the Iran deal",
        "body_text": "Ellie Geranmayeh is a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Yar Batmanghelidj is the founder and CEO of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n (CNN) President Joe Biden took office at a moment of global crisis, and tensions with Iran are among his most pressing foreign-policy challenges. After four years of nonstop hostility between Washington and Tehran, the first weeks of his presidency could determine the level of danger moving forward.\n President Donald Trump famously yanked the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal despite the fact that Iran was abiding by its terms, and European allies fiercely opposed the move. He ordered the killing of a top Iranian general and sustained a \"maximum pressure\" campaign of unparalleled financial sanctions against Iran. Soon after his election loss to Biden, Trump reportedly asked advisers for options to strike Iran militarily. That Trump's presidency concluded without open US-Iran conflict may be lucky for everyone.\n Biden has stated an intent to rejoin the nuclear deal, while also signaling he hopes a more expansive agreement can be reached soon after. If he is serious about a diplomatic course correction on Iran that contains its nuclear activities, his administration needs to move fast in doing so.\n As part of its response to mounting pressure from the Trump administration, Iran recently announced it will enrich uranium at more than five times the rate permitted under the nuclear deal. It also has threatened to restrict access to international inspectors if economic sanctions rallied by the Trump administration are not eased.\n As the UN's atomic watchdog chief warned on Jan. 11, there is a matter of weeks rather than months to salvage the nuclear deal.\n Most importantly, Biden should steer clear of the fallacy that President Trump's flawed policy of maximum-pressure sanctions provides the US with ample leverage and time to skip over the nuclear deal and squeeze more concessions from Iran. As the future of the nuclear accord was debated during confirmation hearings for Biden's top appointees, some senators and observers argued just that. They suggest that even if Trump was wrong to pull America out of the deal, his successor could benefit from the \"leverage\" that Trump-era sanctions created, to force a broader deal that not only further restricts Iran's nuclear activities but also curtails Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups in the Middle East. Trump had squeezed Iran's economy to such an extent that its leaders are willing to make more concessions than they had in 2015, the logic goes.\n But it is unclear why Tehran, having resisted similar maximalist demands under Trump and having already absorbed heavy costs of US sanctions, would be willing to make a deal with Biden under such terms.\n Those arguing to maintain sanctions wrongly claim that the Iranian economy is in such dire straits that Tehran will be forced to capitulate. Against the backdrop of unprecedented sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic, Iran's economy has demonstrated resilience to external shocks and will likely limp along. Recent projections from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Institute of International Finance predict Iran will achieve growth rates of anywhere from 1.5% to 3.2% this year even if sanctions remain in place. As at least one Trump official admitted, there are so many sanctions on Iran that they've become an exhausted tool.\n At this stage, maximum pressure is delivering dismal marginal returns. Iran's non-oil economy, which accounts for more than 85% of GDP according to Iranian government statistics, can grow under sanctions given both significant non-oil export revenue and also Iran's massive domestic market. Plus, China has continued to buy Iranian oil in defiance of US sanctions, according to the US government, The New York Times, and others.\n Low levels of growth will not fully alleviate the fiscal pressure facing Iran's government nor the weakness of the Iranian currency, but would mark a significant improvement after three years of steep contraction. The expectation that Iran's economy will return to growth this year has already seen the Iranian rial gain more than 9% against the dollar since the beginning of January.\n Not only is Iran retooling its economy to sustain US sanctions, but the maximum pressure campaign has reinforced hardline security logic in Iran that means the country's leaders are unlikely to cave. Iran's leadership and public alike are increasingly skeptical of any promises that sanctions will be eased \u2014 even under the Obama administration, which concluded the nuclear deal that saw much of the US sanctions regime rolled back, the hesitancy of international banks to transact with Iran stymied economic growth. Iran is unlikely to expand the scope of negotiations beyond the nuclear accord until it can have more confidence that a lifting of US sanctions would deliver real benefits.\n If Biden intends to contain Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy, he should make concrete economic relief felt on the Iranian streets. The cost of US sanctions have so far been felt most by ordinary Iranians, who have been hit with high inflation. The worsening economic situation did not lead to regime collapse or capitulation as the Trump administration had bet on, but instead contributed to low election turnout in Iran and protests that were met with brutal force by the security apparatus. Public sentiments around diplomacy with the West are much more negative than when the nuclear deal was first agreed. The Trump experience has given ammunition to hardline camps inside Iran to argue the US will never negotiate in good faith.\n If Biden adopts a gung-ho approach to renegotiating the deal, instead of honoring America's international commitments, Iranian proponents for talks won't have a leg to stand on.\n In reality, the leverage argument is a fig leaf for a continued maximum pressure policy that has backfired on US security interests. It produced an expanded Iranian nuclear program and escalation in the Middle East. If Biden is seen to be holding back from sanctions relief to drive a hard bargain, Tehran will likely continue to build up leverage of its own.\n In response to the November assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist, widely suspected to have been perpetrated by Israel, Iran passed legislation that could restrict international oversight of its nuclear facilities if Western sanctions aren't eased by late February. Iran's leap to 20% uranium enrichment this month signals it is not bluffing. Unless Iran's leaders see early signs that Washington is serious about a deal, they are likely to escalate further.\n Iran has also been explicit that it will not renegotiate the nuclear agreement or broaden it to restrict Iran's regional activities or missile capabilities. While Iranian officials have not shut the door to wider diplomacy with the West, the implementation of the nuclear deal is clearly a necessary prelude to any broader negotiations.\n As such, Biden should focus on a two-step approach toward diplomacy with Iran. First, the US and Iran should agree on technical steps required for mutual compliance with the nuclear deal, cool regional tensions and build confidence. A second step will then be for the US -- together with European allies -- to pivot toward follow-up talks that could give both Iran and the West greater benefits.\n The US can keep Iran walking the path of diplomacy not by sustaining Trump's sanctions, but by reentering the deal and restoring its ability to snap sanctions back into place in the future if Iran violates its obligations or blocks follow-up talks.\n By providing the sanctions relief required of the US under the nuclear deal it agreed to, the Biden administration can restore confidence that America sticks to its words as well as create an opportunity cost for Iran in the future. Today's incentives are tomorrow's leverage. And if Biden gives diplomacy with Iran a real shot, he may find he won't need that leverage after all.",

        "title": "Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas blocks Biden\u2019s deportation \u2018pause\u2019",
        "body_text": "A federal judge in Texas blocked President Biden\u2019s 100-day deportation \u201cpause\u201d on Tuesday in a ruling that may point to a new phase of conservative legal challenges to his administration\u2019s immigration agenda.\n Judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee, granted a temporary restraining order sought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, saying the state had demonstrated a likelihood of facing immediate harm from Biden\u2019s pause. The court order will be in effect for 14 days while Tipton considers a broader motion by the state for a preliminary injunction.\n Though the order is temporary, the state\u2019s lawsuit portends more legal challenges by Biden opponents, appealing to a judicial branch reshaped by the confirmation of hundreds of Trump appointees.\n Paxton, a close Trump ally, celebrated the ruling as a \u201cvictory\u201d on Twitter and declared Texas \u201cthe FIRST state in the nation to bring a lawsuit against the Biden Admin. AND WE WON.\u201d\n In one of his first executive actions, Biden ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt most deportations from the interior of the United States for 100 days. The pause was intended to allow ICE to overhaul its enforcement priorities, amid intense criticism from Democrats that President Donald Trump had used the agency to terrorize immigrants who had not committed violent or other serious crimes.\n Biden\u2019s moratorium did not apply to border-crossers who arrived in the United States after Nov. 1, and it allowed for other exceptions including matters of national security. Conservatives were incensed that Biden\u2019s pause would prevent most deportations of criminals with violent felony convictions, potentially allowing their release into the United States once they\u2019d completed jail or prison sentences.\n Texas argued that the moratorium would place an unfair burden on the state and that the measure violated an agreement Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott (R) had signed with Ken Cuccinelli, then serving as acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, less than two weeks before Biden was sworn in.\n Tipton\u2019s ruling did not address the agreement, which the Biden administration does not recognize as legally binding.\n The state also referenced a Fox News report citing an internal ICE email calling for the mass release of detainees. But government attorneys provided the email to the court Monday, indicating that its contents had not been accurately reported by the network.\n Paxton, a conservative firebrand who advised Trump during the former president\u2019s failed quest to overturn the 2020 election, is currently under investigation for alleged state securities fraud and is facing other legal troubles that include allegations of bribery.\n In his tweet, Paxton described Biden\u2019s deportation pause as \u201ca seditious left-wing insurrection,\u201d repeating a term used by lawmakers of both parties to describe the Jan. 6 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n Tipton, who was appointed by Trump in June, made explicit in his ruling that the restraining order applies nationwide. He scheduled a new hearing Thursday and called the issues raised by the DHS agreement with Texas \u201cof such gravity and constitutional import that they require further development of the record and briefing prior to addressing the merits.\u201d\n Tipton also left open the possibility that he would narrow his ruling in the coming weeks.\n \u201cThe Court notes that the scope of this injunction is something it is willing to revisit after the parties fully brief and argue the issue for purposes of the upcoming motion for preliminary injunction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThough the scope of this [temporary restraining order] is broad, it is not necessarily permanent.\u201d\n Tipton directed ICE to return to its previous operational posture, effectively directing the agency to resume deportations. An ICE official said the agency was preparing a statement.\n When Trump took office in 2017, he ordered several immigration-related moves, including a ban on travel from certain Muslim-majority countries that unleashed chaos and protests at U.S. airports. His administration separated more than 3,000 migrant children from their parents during a 2018 border crackdown, a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that Biden\u2019s Justice Department formally rescinded Tuesday.\n Hundreds of additional executive actions by Trump were disputed in the federal court system. Immigrant advocates and attorneys filed many of those motions in California\u2019s U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The Southern District of Texas, where Tipton presides, is part of the 5th Circuit, which is considered among the country\u2019s most conservative.\n The American Civil Liberties Union, which led legal opposition to Trump\u2019s immigration policies and filed a brief opposing Paxton, criticized Tipton\u2019s ruling.\n \u201cThis lawsuit should not be allowed to proceed,\u201d Kate Huddleston, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas, said in a statement.\n \u201cPaxton sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election by attempting to baselessly suppress votes; now he is attempting to force the Biden administration to follow Trump\u2019s xenophobic policies,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cThe administration\u2019s pause on deportations is not only lawful but necessary to ensure that families are not separated and people are not returned to danger needlessly while the new administration reviews past actions.\u201d\n Kari Hong, an immigration scholar at the Boston College of Law, called Tipton\u2019s ruling \u201cbaffling,\u201d saying it opened the door for states to sue the federal government over any immigration policy change that might affect them.\n Just as Texas argued that a deportation freeze could impose financial burdens on its state budget, Hong said, California could sue by arguing that the separation of children from their deported parents leads to additional foster-care costs.\n Tipton \u201cseems to invite states to be litigating matters of national policy, which is a slippery slope that will end in chaos,\u201d said Hong. She also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has chided lower courts for issuing nationwide injunctions and rulings.\n ICE officials have long relied upon \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d to set and adjust immigration enforcement priorities, and during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, immigrants who did not commit violent or serious crimes were more likely to be spared from arrest and deportation.\n Trump reversed that policy upon taking office, an approach his administration celebrated as removing the \u201cshackles\u201d on ICE officers who were given a freer hand to arrest anyone who lacked legal status.\n A new priority system Biden laid out, set to take effect Feb. 1, will more narrowly target serious and violent offenders once again. Tipton\u2019s restraining order does not address that priority system, so Hong said ICE still has discretion to deport \u2014 or not deport \u2014 whomever it wants.\n \u201cTipton\u2019s saying Texas has the right to stop [the pause on] deportations but inherently recognizing that not all deportation will happen,\u201d Hong said. \u201cIt\u2019s an illogical decision that quickly falls upon itself.\u201d",

        "title": "Former Voice of America overseer hired two law firms to $4 million no-bid contracts.",
        "body_text": "The former head of Voice of America\u2019s parent agency hired two law firms to open-ended, no-bid contracts, including one specifying that top lawyers would earn $1,470 per hour, according to documents and people familiar with the matter. The two agreements have cost taxpayers close to $4 million over a five-month period, far more than was previously known, and possibly in violation of federal rules.\n The first details of the arrangement were made public last week in a whistleblower complaint against Michael Pack, who was appointed chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) eight months ago, and whom President Biden forced to resign hours after he took office last week.\n Documents detailing the agreements with the law firms were turned over in early January to the State Department\u2019s inspector general, which oversees \u00adUSAGM and is now investigating, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose potential irregularities.\n From his Senate confirmation in June until his resignation last week, Pack oversaw USAGM\u2019s portfolio of international news agencies, including VOA, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. The networks specialize in broadcasting news in countries where an independent press is suppressed.\n A conservative documentary filmmaker before President Donald Trump nominated him to run USAGM, Pack had a brief and tumultuous tenure there.\n He sidelined experienced managers, investigated a VOA reporter, and sought to steer the editorial direction of the news agencies \u2014 all in the name of rooting out what he called \u201cbias\u201d against Trump. Agency bureaucrats and journalists responded with a volley of lawsuits, whistleblower complaints and a petition demanding the removal of Pack\u2019s appointees.\n The contracts were part of his effort to reshape USAGM and purge employees he saw as problematic from the news and broadcasting groups under its authority. Pack hired two Washington firms, McGuireWoods and Caplin & Drysdale \u2014 apparently in contradiction to federal contracting regulations and guidelines, according to internal documents.\n McGuireWoods has received the bulk of the payments \u2014 in excess of $3 million \u2014 for a lengthy and complex review of USAGM\u2019s email archives. Pack initiated the review to create files documenting \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d as internal records refer to it, against five executive members of USAGM. He suspended and replaced all five in August.\n The executives later filed a whistleblower complaint and a lawsuit against Pack, alleging they were wrongfully removed. Last week, Biden appointed Kelu Chao, a VOA employee who joined the lawsuit, as Pack\u2019s interim replacement.\n The two law firms are among the most expensive in Washington.\n A July 16 \u201cengagement\u201d letter from the lead Caplin partner on the project, William Klimon, spells out his rates to one of Pack\u2019s lieutenants: $735 per hour, with the range for all attorneys at his firm running from $325 to $1,470 per hour.\n A similar Aug. 12 letter to Pack from McGuireWoods partner John D. Adams indicates that Adams charges $850 per hour and that attorneys in his firm range from $400 an hour \u201cfor our newest associates\u201d to $1,400 an hour for the most senior partners \u2014 expenses extra.\n The letter notes the open-ended nature of the agreement: \u201cYou acknowledge that McGuireWoods has made, and will make, no guarantee regarding either the ultimate cost (in fees and expenses) or the outcome of the Engagement.\u201d\n The McGuireWoods expenditures were the subject of a whistleblower complaint made public last week by a law firm representing the employees. That firm, called the Government Accountability Project, alleged Pack had spent as much as $2 million on the review.\n According to those familiar with the contract, the figure has greatly exceeded that amount.\n Adams declined to comment. Klimon did not respond to requests for comment.\n No similar complaint was filed against the Caplin & Drysdale agreement. Under a separate contract, the firm advised Pack about potentially dismissing and appointing board members and top officials at four nonprofits under USAGM: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Radio Free Asia and the Open Technology Fund. (The latter is an independent but USAGM-funded nonprofit that helps dissidents and journalists abroad get around government surveillance.)\n Pack set aside as much as $375,000 for the Caplin & Drysdale contract, according to documents, although it\u2019s not clear how much the agency ultimately spent.\n Pack apparently sought Caplin\u2019s advice because the news organizations involved are government grantees, not direct government agencies, and it was not clear how much authority Pack had to replace their leadership. He also sought to hire conservative allies under an unusual two-year contract that would guarantee their jobs even if Pack left office, unless they were convicted of a felony.\n Much of Pack\u2019s effort was undone last week by Chao, his successor.\n She removed all of the Pack-appointed board members and agency heads within days of assuming leadership of USAGM. She reappointed several people Pack had removed when he took office in June. Among them was Ryan Crocker, the former U.S. ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, whom Chao brought back to help oversee the three organizations that broadcast in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n The law firm hires appear to violate federal regulations, according to people familiar with the rules. The contracts were awarded on a no-bid basis, which is permissible only if a federal agency supplies written documentation to justify it. There is no record that Pack or USAGM provided this documentation.\n \u201cMy assumption [is that] Pack was in a hurry,\u201d said David Seide, senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project, which filed the whistleblower complaint about the McGuireWoods agreement last week. He reasoned that Pack hired McGuireWoods to investigate employees because \u201che couldn\u2019t get, or didn\u2019t want, anyone in the government\u201d to do so.\n Seide said McGuireWoods began its work on Aug. 12, the same day USAGM informed the managers they were suspended, suggesting that Pack hired the firm to compile evidence against people he had already decided to suspend.\n The contract was so costly, Seide said, because it required technicians to build a search tool to sort through millions of emails archived on USAGM\u2019s servers \u2014 even before the lawyers could get to work.",

        "title": "Northeast cities finally seeing a chance of snow after a near snowless January so far",
        "body_text": "(CNN) This winter has been incredibly quiet for some places in the Northeast, where millions in big cities who are used to shoveling in January haven't had much work to do.\n That could change this week.\n A shot at snow and ice is in the forecast for the Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. New York City could see a wintry mix on Tuesday, making commutes hazardous. The city is under a winter weather advisory through midnight with snowfall amounts around an inch and a glaze of ice possible.\n The ice will make travel exceptionally treacherous. There could also be potential power outages with the accumulation of ice on trees and power lines. This will be the first time many Northeast areas along the Interstate 95 corridor will see measurable snowfall since mid-December.\n New York City is currently running about 5.5 inches below normal for snowfall for the month of January. This entire season, much of the areas surrounding New York City have received less than an inch of snow.\n New York City isn't alone. Even Boston is running well behind for snow. January 2021 has been the least snowiest January on record for Boston. Boston should have more than 10 inches of snow in January, and the city hasn't even received half an inch.\n Philadelphia hasn't seen more than a trace of snowfall in January, and even Portland, Maine, is nearly a foot below normal for January snowfall.\n \"Cities in upstate New York that are known for snow are well below normal,\" says CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. \"Buffalo is 15.9 inches below normal for the month of January and Rochester is 10.4 inches below normal.\"\n We are currently in a La Ni\u00f1a pattern and it's expected to last the rest of the winter. This phenomenon that occurs along the equator has weather consequences around the world.\n In the US, we typically see wetter than normal winters for the Northeast, but blaming the lack of snow solely on La Ni\u00f1a is tricky.\n \"It is difficult to say how much of an impact the La Ni\u00f1a we are currently in is having on the lackluster snow season in the Northeast thus far this winter, but it does fit the pattern,\" says CNN climate expert Brandon Miller.\n \"The winter outlook from NOAA, issued before the season began, called for warmer than normal temperatures for the entire East Coast, largely because of the jet stream's usual response to La Nina,\" says Miller.\n The warmer-than-average temperatures do not always correlate to low snowfall seasons, but so far this year they have for large portions of the Northeast.\n This week, the Climate Prediction Center has put out their new seasonal forecast, and is forecasting warmer than normal temperatures for the Northeast to last through April.\n This won't completely wipe out snow chances for the region, but it could mean more rain and less snow overall.\n \"There also hasn't been a big amplified jet stream this year. This is limiting snow systems from moving through the region. That has resulted in a more southerly storm track, which has brought more snow to some southern locations, and less snow to the cities in the north that typically get snow,\" Chinchar says.\n The winter season is still far from over, giving these cities plenty of time to make up for the lack of snowfall.\n A few long-range forecasts show a slight change in the forecast pattern that will give some of these big cities in the Northeast a better shot of snow during the next few weeks.\n There could be another winter storm Sunday into Monday that could bring additional snow to these areas.\n All it takes is one blockbuster snowstorm to get the snowless cities back on track.",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Target is the latest major retailer to stop selling Chaokoh coconut milk following accusations that its manufacturer uses monkey labor.\n In a statement Monday, PETA said the retailer dropped the product because an investigation conducted by the nonprofit organization found that the Thailand-based Theppadungporn Coconut Co. has been \"exploiting monkeys and lying about it.\" Target joins Costco (COST), which dropped the milk in October.\n PETA's investigation found that monkeys are forced to pick coconuts and perform for tourists, and that they are \"tethered, chained to old tires, or confined to cages barely larger than their bodies.\" Multiple investigations by PETA Asia found widespread use of monkey labor throughout Thailand's coconut farming industry. Some companies have changed their practices, PETA said, but others simply hide the monkeys when auditors come to check on the animals.\n Target (TGT) told CNN Business that it takes \"seriously the claims made against Chaokoh, and given they were unable to sufficiently address the concerns raised, we made the decision to remove their product from our assortment in November 2020.\"\n Chaokoh, one of the world leaders in producing coconut milk and other coconut products, and Theppadungporn Coconut Co., did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. But the company told USA Today that it has audited coconut plantations using a third party and \"did not find the use of monkeys for coconut harvesting.\"\n PETA said that Target joins 26,000 stores, including Wegmans, Food Lion, and Stop & Shop, that have stopped selling the milk. It's now turning its focus to Publix, Kroger (KR) and Albertsons that continue to sell Chaokoh products.\n Publix told CNN Business that it has reviewed third-party audits of the company and that Thailand's ambassador to the United States confirmed that monkeys are \"not used in the commercial harvesting of coconuts.\"\n Kroger and Albertsons did not immediately return requests for comment.\n --CNN's Lauren Padgett contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Kellyanne Conway Is Being Investigated After Topless Pic Of Teen Daughter Appears On Twitter",
        "body_text": "Former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been accused of posting a topless photograph of her teenage daughter, Claudia Conway, on Twitter.\n Social media erupted on Monday night after Conway\u2019s account, @KellyannePolls,\u00a0allegedly shared a Fleet\u00a0\u2014 a post on Twitter\u2019s mobile platform that is meant to disappear after 24 hours \u2014 showing a partially nude Claudia, who is 16. The image has since been deleted, but other Twitter users say they took screenshots of it.\n The situation then made its way over to TikTok, where Claudia often posts about the goings-on within her family. Over the course of the last year, the teenager has been sharing videos that appear to show her tumultuous relationship with her parents, Kellyanne Conway and vocal anti-Trump lawyer George Conway.\n After commenters wrote on Claudia\u2019s posts that Kellyanne Conway\u2019s account had shared a topless photo of her, the teen made videos telling her followers, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is a joke or not, but I\u2019m really scared\u201d and asking, \u201cIs this real?\u201d\n In a since-deleted video, Claudia told fans: \u201cI\u2019m assuming that when my mom took my phone ... she took a picture of that so that was on her phone. I guess she accidentally posted it or somebody hacked her. But nobody would ever have any photo like that, ever. So, Kellyanne, you\u2019re going to fucking jail.\u201d\n \u201cI have no comment,\u201d Kellyanne Conway told CNBC. Representatives for Claudia Conway did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n Federal law \u201cprohibits the production, distribution, reception, and possession of an image of child pornography,\u201d according to the Justice Department, which also states that \u201cany violation of federal child pornography law is a serious crime, and convicted offenders face severe statutory penalties.\u201d\n A spokesperson for Twitter told HuffPost that \u201cthrough technology and human review, we\u2019ll proactively remove any images that violate the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n Alpine, New Jersey, Police Chief Christopher Belcolle told HuffPost via email on Tuesday that \u201can investigation is being conducted by the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d and that \u201cno additional information can be released.\u201d The Conway family has a home in Alpine.\n The Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed \u201cthat each member of the Conway family has been fully cooperative throughout the investigation.\u201d\n Claudia also told fans in another now-deleted video to report the photo if they see it. The teenager commented on her own TikTok videos in Morse code and expressed her disbelief at the situation.\n Claudia also took part in a TikTok Live with social media influencer Tana Mongeau,\u00a0during which she appears to argue with her parents about the alleged photo. In the livestream, Claudia is heard accusing her mother of posting the photo on her Twitter account.\n Mongeau has also been attempting to make the hashtag #JusticeForClaudia trend.\n Claudia posted another TikTok on Tuesday, addressing the allegations against her mother and announcing that she\u2019d be taking a break from social media. In the video, Claudia said she has \u201cfaith\u201d in her mother that she would never share such an image online.\n \u201cWe fight like mothers and daughters. We also love like mothers and daughters,\u201d Claudia explained, adding that \u201cbeing in the public eye exacerbates\u201d their arguments.\n She went on to ask that people do not \u201cincite violence\u201d or threaten her family and said she\u2019d be taking time to work on her relationship with her mother. George Conway tweeted the video shortly after:\n In another follow-up video, Claudia asked people to \u201cplease stop calling authorities.\u201d\n Kellyanne Conway left her job within the Trump administration in August 2020 after several videos from Claudia talking about her relationship with her parents went viral.\n Previously, the presidential counselor had been accused of repeatedly violating ethics laws\u00a0and was called in 2019 by the Office of Special Counsel\u00a0a \u201crepeat offender\u201d of the Hatch Act, which prohibits public officials from using their roles for partisan purposes. The agency claimed Conway\u2019s \u201cactions erode the principal foundation of our democratic system \u2014 the rule of law.\u201d",

        "title": "Does Matthew Stafford make sense for Washington? Here\u2019s how the QB would fit.",
        "body_text": "Former Minnesota Vikings coach Bud Grant once said, \u201cA good coach needs a patient wife, a loyal dog and a great quarterback, but not necessarily in that order.\u201d Washington Football Team Coach Ron Rivera seems to have two of the three taken care of \u2014 and in what\u2019s expected to be an unprecedented offseason of quarterback movement, he has a shot at securing the trifecta.\n The coach and his new brain trust, led by General Manager Martin Mayhew and executive vice president of football/player personnel Marty Hurney, have several options for bringing in a new quarterback. They could trade for a veteran, sign a free agent or draft a prospect at No. 19 (or earlier, if they trade up).\n One of the most sensical veteran choices is longtime Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford, who will turn 33 on Feb. 7. The Lions granted Stafford\u2019s request to leave Detroit this offseason as the organization undergoes its third overhaul of his tenure. The No. 1 draft pick in 2009 is one of the most talented players at his position and age to become available via trade in some time.\n Here are some key questions surrounding his future.\n What\u2019s the scouting report on Stafford?\n He is still considered one of the better quarterbacks in the NFL, with one of the league\u2019s strongest arms, 12 years of experience and unquestioned toughness. He put many of those traits on display in a win over Washington in November, when he threw for 276 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.\n For someone who takes deep shots and has a big arm, he has done a relatively good job of not turning the ball over: His 1.9 percent interception rate in 2020 ranked 14th of 35 qualified passers. He also has proved capable of winning late, having led 31 fourth-quarter comebacks in his career.\n One of Stafford\u2019s relative weaknesses is accuracy. He has never completed better than 67.2 percent of his passes, a middling number in the modern NFL. In 2018, Peyton Manning broke down film on Stafford and chided him for staring down receivers, saying: \u201cEven if you know you\u2019re going to throw it out there to the right and to the flat, look left to start, or look down the middle. Don\u2019t let those defensive linemen know where you\u2019re going.\u201d\n Overall, though, Stafford is arguably one of the best 10 or 15 quarterbacks in the league, and he is capable of providing a significant upgrade for Washington.\n But didn\u2019t he struggle with injuries?\n Yes, and he is also one of the game\u2019s toughest quarterbacks. Last season, he started all 16 games despite rib, thumb, ankle and neck injuries. The only time he missed games because of injury over the past decade was in 2019, when he suffered multiple broken bones in his back and sat out the Lions\u2019 final eight games.\n Injuries are not expected to limit Stafford in 2021. And even if they did, he has shown no reticence to play when hurt. In Week 15, with the Lions out of playoff contention, Stafford played through torn cartilage in his rib cage that gave him body spasms.\n How would he fit with Washington?\n Stafford would immediately upgrade the position. Washington has plenty of issues to solve on offense \u2014 filling out its wide receiver corps behind Terry McLaurin, re-signing right guard Brandon Scherff, etc. \u2014 but quarterback is the most important.\n Last season, a low-ceiling offense was limited by its quarterback play. Even Alex Smith, who excelled at the intangibles and the X\u2019s and O\u2019s battle before the snap, struggled mightily. His 78.5 passer rating ranked 31st of 35 qualified quarterbacks. Stafford, with a better supporting cast, ranked 14th (96.3). It remains to be seen whether Smith will return to Washington, but it is highly unlikely the team could afford to retain Smith and add Stafford, too.\n Stafford\u2019s skill set \u2014 smarts and arm strength \u2014 also plays into offensive coordinator Scott Turner\u2019s Air Coryell-based scheme. The offense is predicated on check-downs and deep shots, and during Stafford\u2019s career, he has established a reputation for going deep.\n What\u2019s his contract situation?\n Stafford has a team-friendly deal with two years and $43 million remaining. In 2021, he is owed $20 million, and in 2022, $23 million. This is manageable for Washington, which has about $35 million in salary cap space and could create more by releasing Smith or reworking his deal, which carries a $23.3 million cap hit this year. Stafford\u2019s contract will rank about 19th in average annual value for quarterbacks in the next two seasons, according to Over The Cap.\n Perhaps most important: Even if the salary cap falls to $175 million as a result of the NFL\u2019s lost revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic, Stafford will still only account for about 11 percent of it \u2014 allowing Washington plenty of room to address other positions. It is possible, however, that Stafford, who will have a voice in Detroit\u2019s trade process, could insist upon getting a new contract as part of any deal.\n Which other teams will be in the Stafford sweepstakes?\n Indianapolis, San Francisco, New England, Denver and New Orleans could pursue him. The Colts would seem to be the strongest contender, with plenty of salary cap space and a championship-caliber roster coming off an 11-5 season. This includes, importantly, depth at the skill positions and an elite offensive line.\n What would it take for a trade to get done?\n It appears likely that acquiring Stafford would require giving up a first-round draft pick in addition to another second- or third-rounder, based on the number of teams expected to be interested. Other teams have higher first-round picks than Washington, such as Denver (No. 9), San Francisco (No. 12) and New England (No. 15). But Washington has an extra third-round pick (No. 74) from last year\u2019s Trent Williams trade; that could help it put together a trade offer.",

        "title": "Several hundred White House officials have been vaccinated for Covid-19",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Several hundred White House employees had been vaccinated for Covid-19 as of Tuesday, two Biden administration officials told CNN, with more expected in the coming weeks.\n Most officials who have received vaccinations work for the Executive Office of the President, meaning they operate inside the White House complex, either in the West Wing or Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door. Dozens of staffers are still working remotely but the White House is prioritizing vaccinations for people who work on site and aims to eventually vaccinate all in-person staff, an official told CNN.\n Even with the vaccinations, White House officials are still wearing masks when on the grounds and many are working from home or participating in virtual meetings from their offices.\n The staffers, including those who have been working remotely, came to the Eisenhower building on Tuesday for their first vaccinations.\n White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz told CNN that the latest round of vaccinations came after about three dozen members of the senior staff, national security team and incoming Cabinet nominees received their first doses in early January.\n He said the White House medical team was \"working toward vaccinating all in-person staff over the next few week to ensure a COVID-safe working environment around the President and key leaders who have national security and continuity of government responsibilities.\"\n The Biden administration's vaccination effort marks another clear break from former President Donald Trump's approach to White House coronavirus safety.\n Trump and other White House staff had regularly flouted US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for safety during the pandemic such as wearing face masks and social distancing.\n And Trump said last month that he had asked White House staffers to get the vaccine \"somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,\" after it surfaced that high-ranking administration officials were set to receive some of the first doses in the US in the US.\n But in Biden's nascent administration, many White House staffers are working from home, and will continue to do so in the coming days and weeks.\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a news briefing last week that all staff entering the complex will be required to undergo a Covid test, wear an N95 mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Acrylic glass barriers were also mounted on desks in the West Wing, something Trump officials had resisted.\n \"The President has asked us to also be models to the American people, and that's vitally important to us as well,\" she said.\n While many of the West Wing's offices have been assigned, the building will not be at capacity, as it was for much of last year despite the pandemic. The few places that did implement some work-from-home requirements under Trump, such as the National Security Council, will continue having officials work remotely.\n This story has been updated with additional information Tuesday.\n CNN's Kevin Liptak and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

        "title": "N.Y.C.\u2019s Bike Parking Problem: 1.6 Million Riders and Just 56,000 Spots",
        "body_text": "The pandemic set off an extraordinary surge in biking in New York City as people sought to avoid public transit and embrace new ways to exercise.\n But now the spike has run headlong into a familiar problem on the city\u2019s congested streets: no parking.\n Cyclists have rolled up to apartment buildings, offices, stores and restaurants only to find nowhere to leave their bikes. Many lug them inside, or improvise makeshift parking by locking them to street signs \u2014 breaking a city law that is rarely enforced \u2014 or trees, gates and fences.\n The lack of parking, cyclists and advocates complain, has even helped fuel a jump in bike thefts.\n Tasha Rose said she gets stressed trying to find a safe place to park her bike while riding around Brooklyn and Queens picking up food donations from local residents and groups to stock free community refrigerators. She had two bikes stolen last year after locking them to fences.\n \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go, I\u2019ve got to get back to my bike,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Rose, 35, a freelance tour manager and merchandise vendor for musicians who is out of work and has also used her bike to get to temporary gigs walking dogs. \u201cSince my bike is my No. 1 go-to for transportation, obviously keeping it safe and secure is my main priority when I\u2019m out and about.\u201d\n Even as New York has created the largest urban bike network in the nation with 1,375 miles of bike lanes and a thriving bike-share program, Citi Bike, it has lagged well behind other cities in making bike parking spots widely available, transportation experts and advocates say.\n New York has roughly 56,000 bike parking spots on its streets, sidewalks and plazas. Most are part of bike racks, though there are 83 corrals \u2014 car parking spots converted to hold bikes \u2014 and 20 shelters that shield bikes from snow and rain. (The 56,000 does not include Citi Bike, which has 38,000 spaces in about 1,100 docking stations.)\n By comparison, London has three times as much bike parking, with more than 150,000 cycling spaces on its streets and an additional 20,000-plus spaces at Underground and rail stations. There are also more than 1,500 curbside cycle hangers, where residents leave their bikes inside a small metal dome.\n London transit officials also recently awarded funding to create up to 2,000 more bike parking spaces across the city, including outside schools and transit stations.\n Some American cities have also stepped up efforts to create more bike parking during the pandemic. Chicago installed nearly 2,000 new bike parking spaces last year on racks and in corrals and plans to add 900 more this spring for a total of roughly 34,260.\n In New York, cycling had boomed even before the pandemic, with 490,000 daily bike trips in 2017, up from 150,000 in 2000, according to a 2019 city report. Nearly 1.6 million New Yorkers are bike riders, the report said, with almost half getting on a bike at least several times a month.\n Then came the pandemic, and cycling really took off. Citi Bike saw demand more than double to a record 2,520,045 trips in September from 1,086,410 trips in March. And crossings at the city\u2019s four East River bridges into Manhattan also jumped significantly, by 55 percent in November compared with the same month in 2019, according to an analysis by the city comptroller.\n Of course, adding bike parking can be a challenge in New York, where there is already stiff competition for limited space among pedestrians, drivers and cyclists.\n But the dearth of bike parking in New York, transportation experts say, discourages bike riding \u2014 a sustainable form of travel \u2014 and disproportionately hurts the poor and people of color who rely on bikes to get around and tend to live and work in neighborhoods with fewer bike resources and infrastructure, including buildings with indoor storage.\n \u201cWe need to ensure that New Yorkers have more \u2014 not less \u2014 options to get around in a safe and equitable manner,\u201d said Danny Harris, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, which recently released a report calling on city officials to make bike parking a priority.\n The report cited repeated instances in which city officials had failed to carry out promises to increase bike parking, including building more parking near transit hubs and adding 1,500 bike racks annually.\n City officials said they took bike parking \u201cvery seriously\u201d and were working to expand it. Despite the pandemic, 1,150 new bike parking spaces were installed last year, including around hospitals and schools to serve health workers, teachers and students and in commercial corridors and business districts. Officials also plan to add 200 more parking spaces in 13 new corrals beginning this winter.\n \u201cWe\u2019re committed to accommodating the cycling boom with more accessible parking,\u201d said Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to play offense in 2020, but we focused last year\u2019s efforts on adding capacity near hospitals and schools.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Schwartz added.\n Bike parking has become an increasingly crucial part of urban transportation systems. In the Netherlands, where biking has become a way of life, the city of Utrecht finished the world\u2019s largest bike parking garage in 2019 with room for more than 12,650 bikes under a train station. In doing so, it surpassed Tokyo, which has an automated underground parking garage for 9,400 bikes at the Kasai metro train.\n In this country, Seattle and Portland, Ore., two cities with well-established biking cultures, have accommodated cyclists by significantly expanding parking. In Seattle, parking for bikes and scooters has increased by more than a third since 2015, while Portland has added more than 1,800 bike parking spots since 2018 for a total of 8,888.\n Portland\u2019s zoning code was also updated in 2019 to require private residential developments to include more bike parking.\n In New York, cyclists complain that bike parking often seems like an afterthought. When the Moynihan Train Hall opened in Midtown Manhattan earlier this month, they pointed out the gleaming new station did not include any dedicated bike parking.\n Matthew Gorton, a spokesman for Empire State Development, which oversaw the Moynihan project, said temporary bike racks were being installed, and permanent racks would eventually be added.\n Yolanda Gonzalez, 33, an urban agriculture consultant in Chelsea, said that she has had to carry her bike upstairs when she visits a friend\u2019s apartment because there is no street parking. These days she leaves her bike at home and walks if she knows there will be no bike parking where she is going.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of convenience and theft, it\u2019s also a question of protecting your bike against exposure to the elements,\u201d said Ms. Gonzalez, who spent part of her pandemic stimulus check to replace a stolen bike.\n The need for more bike parking prompted Shabazz Stuart, 31, a Brooklyn cyclist, to found a start-up company, Oonee, which builds a modular pod where at least 20 bikes can be securely parked inside for free. It opens with a key card or access code. Each pod costs about $100,000, and is paid for through advertising and sponsorships.\n Oonee\u2019s pods can be found across from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and in front of the PATH train station at Journal Square in New Jersey. But the company had to dismantle a third pod in Lower Manhattan in 2019 after a disagreement with the city over advertising and financing issues.\n Still, Mr. Stuart said he will continue to push for more bike parking.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the single greatest most ignored issue in the transportation landscape,\u201d he said.",

        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department on Tuesday rescinded a Trump-era memo that established a \u201czero tolerance\u201d enforcement policy for migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, which resulted in thousands of family separations.\n Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson issued the new memo to federal prosecutors across the nation, saying the department would return to its longstanding previous policy and instructing prosecutors to act on the merits of individual cases.\n \u201cConsistent with this longstanding principle of making individualized assessments in criminal cases, I am rescinding \u2014 effective immediately \u2014 the policy directive,\u201d Wilkinson wrote.\n Wilkinson said the department\u2019s principles have \u201clong emphasized that decisions about bringing criminal charges should involve not only a determination that a federal offense has been committed and that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction, but should also take into account other individualized factors, including personal circumstances and criminal history, the seriousness of the offense, and the probable sentence or other consequences that would result from a conviction.\u201d\n The \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy meant that any adult caught crossing the border illegally would be prosecuted for illegal entry. Because children cannot be jailed with their family members, families were separated and children were taken into custody by Health and Human Services, which manages unaccompanied children at the border.\n While the rescinding of \u201czero tolerance\u201d is in part symbolic, it undoes the Trump administration\u2019s massively unpopular policy responsible for the separation of more than 5,500 children from their parents at the U.S-Mexico border. Most families have not been prosecuted under zero tolerance since 2018, when the separations were halted, though separations have continued on a smaller scale. Practically, the ending of the policy will affect mostly single men who have entered the country illegally.\n \u201cWhile policies may change, our mission always remains the same: to seek justice under the law,\u201d Wilkinson wrote in the memo.\n President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to undo some of Trump\u2019s restrictive policies, but the previous administration has so altered the immigration landscape that it will take quite a while to untangle all the major changes. Some of the parents separated from their children were deported. Advocates for the families have called on Biden to allow those families to reunite in the United States.\n Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, along with Trump and other top leaders in his administration, were bent on curbing immigration. The \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy  was one of several increasingly restrictive policies aimed at discouraging migrants from coming to the Southern border. Trump\u2019s administration also vastly reduced the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and all but halted asylum at the border, through a combination of executive orders and regulation changes.\n The policy was a disaster; there was no system created to reunite children with their families. A report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, released earlier this month, found that the policy led to a $227 million funding shortfall. Children suffered lasting emotional damage from the separations and the policy was criticized as grossly inhumane by world leaders.\n The policy began April 6, 2018, under an executive order that was issued without warning to other federal agencies that would have to manage the policy, including the U.S. Marshals Service and Health and Human Services. It was halted June 20, 2018. A federal judge ordered the families to be reunited and is still working to do so.\n The watchdog report also found that Sessions and other top officials knew the children would be separated under the policy and encouraged it. Justice officials ignored concerns from staff about the rollout and did not bother to set up a system to track families in order to reunite them. Some children are still separated.\n ___\n Follow Balsamo and Long on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 and https://twitter.com/ctlong1.",

        "body_text": "President Joe Biden made good on one of his campaign pledges this week by repealing the Trump administration\u2019s 2019 guidance that banned transgender people from enlisting and serving in the military.\n Monday\u2019s executive order\u00a0\u201cimmediately prohibits involuntary separations, discharges, and denials of reenlistment or continuation of service on the basis of gender identity or under circumstances relating to gender identity,\u201d a White House statement sent to HuffPost and other media outlets read.\n The long-anticipated move reinstates a 2016 Obama administration policy that allowed transgender individuals to openly serve in the military.\u00a0It was announced by the White House at Monday\u2019s ceremonial swearing in of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who has said he supports the decision.\n Less than a year into his presidency, Trump announced plans to ban trans people from serving in the military in \u201cany capacity,\u201d citing \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d that he claimed comes with employing trans personnel.\n Though numerous\u00a0surveys have shown that the majority of Americans support transgender military service, the controversial policy took effect in April 2019.\n Biden\u2019s executive order drew instant praise from international LGBTQ advocacy groups like GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n \u201cThe greatest military in the world will again value readiness over bias, and qualifications over discrimination,\u201d Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David told HuffPost in an email statement.\n Added GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis,\u00a0\u201cThe American people, military leaders, and service members themselves, all overwhelmingly support transgender military service. They know that brave trans patriots have served throughout history and continue to serve honorably and capably, defending our country.\u201d\n Lawmakers, celebrities and and other LGBTQ rights advocates also approved.\n Many in the LGBTQ community have expressed hope in Biden, who on the campaign trail signaled his intent to reverse course from the Trump administration\u2019s anti-LGBTQ platform.\n In addition to Monday\u2019s executive order,\u00a0the president has pledged to prioritize the Equality Act, a comprehensive anti-discrimination bill. Last month, he made history by nominating his former primary rival Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary. If successful,\u00a0Buttigieg will become the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate to a Cabinet post.",

        "title": "Illustrator Michaela Goade Becomes First Native American To Win Caldecott Medal",
        "body_text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Illustrator Michaela Goade became the first Native American to win the prestigious Randolph Caldecott Medal for best children\u2019s picture story, cited for \u201cWe Are Water Protectors,\u201d a celebration of nature and condemnation of the \u201cblack snake\u201d Dakota Access Pipeline.\n \u201cI am really honored and proud,\u201d the 30-year-old Goade told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for young people and aspiring book makers and other creative people to see this.\u201d\n Tae Keller\u2019s chapter book \u201cWhen You Trap a Tiger,\u201d in which a young Korean-American explores her identity and her heritage through her grandmother\u2019s stories, won the John Newbery Medal for the outstanding children\u2019s work overall of 2020. Keller, who was raised in Hawaii and now lives in New York, drew upon Korean folklore and family history for \u201cWhen You Trap a Tiger,\u201d also named the year\u2019s best Asian/Pacific American literature.\n \u201cThe book really did grow from the recognition of my grandmother as this full person with so much life and so many stories to tell,\u201d Keller, 27, told the AP. \u201cI also did a great deal of research into Korean folklore and Korean history. There was a lot I heard growing up, but I had never had a fuller, deeper understanding of it all. I think that was the most rewarding part of writing this book.\u201d\n Jacqueline Woodson, whose previous honors include a National Book Award, won her third Coretta Scott King Award for best work by a Black author for \u201cBefore the Ever After.\u201d And a tribute to Aretha Franklin, \u201cR-E-S-P-E-C-T,\u201d received the King award for best illustration. The book was written by Carole Boston Weatherford, with images by Frank Morrison.\n The awards were announced Monday by the American Library Association.\n \u201cWe Are Water Protectors,\u201d written by Carole Lindstrom, was conceived in response to the planned construction of the Dakota pipeline through Standing Rock Sioux territory. Goade, a member of the Tlingit and Haida Indian tribes in Southeast Alaska, was sent a copy of the manuscript through her agent in 2018 and responded immediately to its political message and message of water as a universal force.\n \u201cI love how it balanced lyricism and poetry with a powerful message,\u201d says Goade, who used everything from watercolors to Gouache paint as she conjured moods ranging from the water\u2019s sensual blue waves to the harsh black of the snake/pipeline and the burning red of the snake\u2019s tongue.\n The Newbery medal was established in 1922, the Caldecott in 1937. Goade, whose other books include \u201cEncounter,\u201d is the first Native American to win in either category. Her next book is the picture story \u201cI Sang You Down from the Stars,\u201d a collaboration with author Tasha Spillett-Sumner that comes out in April.\n Goade\u2019s win was widely cheered on social media, including by Lindstrom, who tweeted to the illustrator: \u201cI have no words to describe how proud of you I am. I love you so so much. You are so extremely talented and just an amazing person inside and out.\u201d\n Dr. Debbie Reese, founder of the educational resource American Indians in Children\u2019s Literature, noted that previous Caldecott awards had gone to stories about Natives that were created by non-Natives, citing Paul Goble\u2019s \u201cThe Girl Who Loved Wild Horses\u201d and Gerald McDermott\u2019s \u201cArrow to the Sun.\u201d\n \u201cWhat I see in this year\u2019s winners is a respect for Native writing,\u201d Reese told the AP. \u201cWe are so much more than what the mainstream understands, and slowly \u2014 and hopefully surely as we move into the future \u2014 editors and readers are coming to understand who we were, and who we are.\u201d\n Daniel Nayeri\u2019s \u201cEverything Sad Is Untrue (a true story)\u201d won the Michael L. Printz Award for best young adult novel, and Mildred D. Taylor, known for \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d among other works, was given a \u201cLiterature Legacy\u201d award.\n Kekla Magoon, who has written or co-written \u201cX: A Novel\u201d and \u201cHow It Went Down,\u201d won a lifetime achievement award for young adult books.\n Ernesto Cisneros\u2019 \u201cEfr\u00e9n Divided\u201d won the Pura Belpr\u00e9 prize for outstanding Latinx author. Raul Gonzalez\u2019s \u201cVamos! Let\u2019s Go Eat\u201d received the Belpr\u00e9 award for illustration. The Stonewall Book Award for best LGBT literature was given to Archaa Shrivastav for \u201cWe Are Little Feminists: Families.\u201d",

        "title": "Homeland Security secretary nomination advances as top Democrat rejects GOP request for delay",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) Alejandro Mayorkas' nomination to be Homeland Security secretary moved forward Tuesday after a Senate panel vote as a top Democrat rejected Republican calls for another hearing that would delay his confirmation.\n President Joe Biden's nominee was voted out of the Senate Homeland Security Committee with all Democrats voting yes, paving the way for Mayorkas to helm the third-largest federal department. GOP Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Rob Portman of Ohio also voted yes.\n Meanwhile, Republicans also want a hearing for Mayorkas before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in addition to his hearing before the Homeland Security Committee that was held last week.\n Several GOP senators, led by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, called for the additional hearing, citing Mayorkas' role overseeing many of the Biden administration's immigration policies, the lawmakers said in a letter released Tuesday\n But Sen. Dick Durbin, who will now chair the Judiciary Committee, threw cold water on the GOP demand.\n \"I don't see why that's necessary,\" Durbin said told CNN's Manu Raju. Durban called the demand \"an indication of mindless partisanship that at a security agency like this one if a man with his background is being held, it's totally political as far as I'm concerned.\"\n \"This is indefensible. We are withholding the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security,\" Durbin added.\n The department has been without a Senate-confirmed leader since Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted in early 2019. DHS, which was saddled with leadership turmoil for most of the Trump presidency, faces national security concerns, a pandemic and an incoming president prepared to roll out ambitious immigration plans.\n Last Tuesday, the Homeland Security Committee held an extensive hearing into Mayorkas' qualifications to lead the department. During the hearing, Mayorkas reiterated Biden's commitment to stop further construction of the wall on the southern border of the US and said the dismantling of existing immigration policies created under Trump will take time. He told lawmakers that he does not recommend defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n Mayorkas also called the threat of domestic extremism \"is one of the greatest challenges the Department of Homeland Security confronts, and it has unique capabilities in confronting that challenge.\"\n However, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, moved to block Mayorkas' quick consideration after the hearing due to his border answer, delaying confirmation.\n Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, the outgoing Homeland Security Committee chairman, also objected to the confirmation of Mayorkas, citing a controversial inspector general report.\n \"He violated his own guidelines when he provided preferential intervention for these politically connected individuals for EB-5 visas,\" Johnson said last week.\n During the Obama administration, the inspector general investigated allegations of improper influence in the EB-5 investor visa process while Mayorkas served as director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The inspector general was unable to determine Mayorkas' motives for his actions and found each of the decisions was \"legitimately within his purview.\"\n Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has urged senators to quickly confirm Mayorkas, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and domestic terrorism, among other concerns, according to a letter obtained by CNN.\n \"DHS is facing several immediate homeland and national security concerns that require confirmed leadership immediately,\" McAleenan wrote in a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Manu Raju, Clare Foran, Ali Zaslav and Lauren Fox contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Xi Jinping touts coronavirus cooperation as China persists with vaccine disinformation push",
        "body_text": "Hong Kong (CNN) Addressing the world's economic elite on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that \"containing the coronavirus is the most pressing task for the international community.\"\n In a speech to the World Economic Forum, Xi called for \"closer solidarity and cooperation, more information sharing, and a stronger global response,\" as well as \"international cooperation on Covid vaccines.\"\n China has been praised for its \"vaccine diplomacy,\" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots.\n Along with hyping reports of deaths allegedly related to vaccines -- a dangerous game that could undermine not only confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna candidates targeted by Chinese media, but all coronavirus shots -- China's propaganda organs have also pushed alternate theories about the origins of the pandemic itself, including a long-debunked claim that it began in a US army lab.\n \"If the United States truly respects facts, it should open the biological lab at Fort Detrick (and) give more transparency to issues like its 200-plus overseas bio-labs,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last week, adding that the US should invite World Health Organization (WHO) investigators \"to conduct origin-tracing\" as they are in China.\n The leading US military germ lab, Fort Detrick briefly became a trending topic on Chinese social media after Hua's comments, which were heavily promoted online by the Communist Youth League, among other Party and state-backed accounts. Previously, Chinese officials have suggested -- without evidence -- that even if the pandemic did originate in Wuhan, the coronavirus could have been brought to the city by US soldiers taking part in the Military World Games in October 2019.\n Beijing has also pushed the idea that the virus could have entered the country on frozen food or other goods, despite most outside researchers disputing claims that it could be easily spread this way.\n Asked by CNN about her Fort Detrick comments, Hua claimed there was evidence that \"the epidemic broke out in multiple places earlier in the autumn of 2019 and there might be links between the seasonal influenza in the US and the epidemic,\" adding that it was \"not for China, but for the US, to offer the answers.\"\n Claims that the pandemic had \"multiple origins\" have not been supported by most scientists, and even if true, do not change the fact that the Chinese city of Wuhan was where the first major outbreak occurred, and where local officials were found to have downplayed the danger, allowing the virus to spread.\n Wuhan remains the most likely origin of the pandemic itself, providing scientists with important data about how the virus evolved and what lessons we could draw from this for the future.\n After months of delays and diplomatic wrangling, a WHO research team arrived in the city earlier this month to begin an investigation, bringing with them additional scrutiny, which seems to have prompted the sudden resurgence of the Fort Detrick conspiracies.\n The WHO team has already said that they have no intention of assigning blame, nor is it necessarily their job to do so. However, any suggestion of uncertainty about the origins of the pandemic, or how the virus first began spreading, will likely be seized upon by Beijing to reinforce the alternative theories state media is already advancing.\n New outbreaks of the virus in China itself, after months of having largely got the pandemic under control, also add to the urgency of deflecting blame outwards, particularly as cities are plunged back into lockdown and potential economic misery.\n Xi has repeatedly emphasized the success of the Chinese Communist Party in tackling the pandemic, an achievement that is all the more striking when compared with the US and much of western Europe. As it rolls out vaccines both domestically and internationally, the chance of turning the coronavirus from a reputational disaster into a propaganda win must be all the more alluring.\n But the promotion of vaccine disinformation could have major repercussions, not only in the US but also in China.\n On Monday, Global Times, the state-backed tabloid which has led the charge on attacking the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines, used the death of a single patient in California to claim without evidence that the shots were dangerous. Health experts have said repeatedly that deaths will occur after vaccination -- especially in the early stages, when most people inoculated are elderly and sick -- but this does not mean they were caused by the shot itself.\n Global Times even cited health authorities in Placer county, who it said reject \"the link between the person's death and the vaccine.\" But this did not stop the paper using this as a peg to quote anonymous Chinese experts claiming mRNA shots were dangerous and \"may contain unknown risks.\"\n This reporting goes beyond attacking the specific Pfizer shot too, suggesting that the technology used to develop the newer mRNA vaccines is itself untrustworthy -- a claim that has no substance and could have repercussions for future Chinese products as well as the existing Pfizer/Moderna shots.\n Such reports are having an effect. Last week, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte pointed to reports -- heavily promoted by Chinese officials and state media -- of deaths in Norway, where the Pfizer vaccine is being distributed. Norwegian health authorities have said there was no correlation between receiving the Pfizer vaccine and increased risk of death among the 23 deceased patients who had previously received the shot.\n \"Almost everybody that I know is scrambling to buy this Pfizer (vaccine),\" Duterte said in addressing calls from some lawmakers to prioritize the US manufacturer's shots over Chinese vaccines. \"If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead. Nobody would stop you.\"\n His comments were quickly picked up by Chinese media, feeding another round of disinformation.\n Writing this week, Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China's success in tackling the pandemic at home may have left the country with a false sense of security when it comes to vaccines. Huang cited polling data showing that a surprising number of Chinese respondents cited \"not being enough at risk from Covid-19\" as a reason to refuse taking a shot, an unusual result even in countries where vaccine hesitancy is far more widespread than in China.\n Similar sentiment could be behind the Chinese government's willingness to play fast and loose with vaccine misinformation. China has among the least vaccine hesitant populations in the world, according to a recent Nature study, and even if skepticism were to increase, the ability of an authoritarian state to force mass inoculation is not in doubt.\n But as Xi himself noted Monday, vaccines are vital to the global pandemic response, indeed, this is why Beijing has invested in providing inoculations to developing countries. But such an effort will be undermined if, along with vaccines, China is also exporting misinformation and hesitancy.",

        "body_text": "Bangkok, ThailandThai lawmakers have voted in favor of allowing abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy while retaining penalties for later terminations, a move that pro-choice activists said fell short of protecting the rights of the mother.\n In a late night session of the Senate on Monday, legislators voted 166-7 in favor of amending a law that criminalizes abortion, backing a plan that seeks to tackle unregulated terminations by non-medical practitioners.\n Under the amendment, an abortion after 12 weeks would be allowed only in certain conditions and would otherwise be punishable by up to six months in prison, or a fine of up to 10,000 baht ($334) or both.\n \"This mean abortion is conditional and can only be done by doctors according to the law,\" Senator Wanlop Tangkhananurak told Reuters.\n The amendment was passed by the lower house last week and follows a Constitutional Court decision last February that ruled that criminalizing abortion was unconstitutional and violated human rights.\n Under the new criteria, a termination after 12 weeks would be allowed if a certified doctor deems there is a high risk of fetal impairment, danger to the life of the mother, or if a pregnancy was the result of rape, deception or coercion.\n But pro-choice activists said retaining penalties would maintain the stigma of abortion.\n \"We want all penalties to be revoked because it is a person's right to abort a pregnancy without being punished,\" Nisarat Jongwisan, councillor and activist at Tam Tang, a pro-choice group, told Reuters.\n \"The penalties will impede on a person's access to safe services and also tarnish the dignity of those women,\" she said.",

        "title": "Biden\u2019s commerce secretary pick pledges a tough line on China but doesn\u2019t detail how she\u2019d deal with Huawei",
        "body_text": "In a Senate confirmation hearing, President Biden\u2019s nominee to run the Commerce Department said she plans to be \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in combating China\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices, but she declined to detail how she would handle issues such as Chinese tech giant Huawei or the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed under President Donald Trump.\n Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo also pledged to help the U.S. economy recover from the pandemic, to expand broadband access to regions with patchy Internet connections, and to promote manufacturing and clean-energy jobs.\n On China, she said the United States needs to develop a \u201cwhole-of-government response,\u201d in coordination with U.S. allies, to combat unfair trade practices, which U.S. officials say include China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, its hefty state subsidies for industry and its efforts to block Western access to the Chinese market.\n One of the Trump administration\u2019s favorite tools for punishing China was the Entity List, a compilation of companies deemed threats to national security to which U.S. exports are blocked. The Commerce Department oversees the list, which under Trump grew to include more than 300 Chinese entities, including the telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei, large semiconductor and drone manufacturers, and companies engaged in alleged human rights violations against ethnic minorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n Asked by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) whether companies accused of human rights abuses would remain on the list, Raimondo said, \u201cChina\u2019s actions have been anticompetitive, hurtful to American workers and businesses, coercive, and, as you point out, they are culpable for atrocious human rights abuses.\u201d\n \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Entity List or tariffs or countervailing duties, I intend to use all those tools to the fullest extent possible to level the playing field for the American worker. I believe in free trade but fair trade,\u201d she added.\n Asked whether Huawei would remain on the list, Raimondo said she would \u201creview the policy, consult with you, consult with industry, consult with our allies and make an assessment about what\u2019s best for American national security and economic security.\u201d\n The Trump administration added Huawei and its affiliates to the Entity List in May 2019, hoping to undermine the company\u2019s ability to produce equipment for 5G mobile networks. It then tightened the rules several times, most recently by banning chip factories anywhere in the world from supplying Huawei if they use U.S. manufacturing equipment or chip-design software.\n The U.S. semiconductor industry has pushed officials to narrow the prohibitions, saying they are broader than necessary to protect national security and are costing the sector billions of dollars in sales to Huawei, which was once a major customer. The industry has urged that rules be eased so that sales to Huawei of \u201ccommoditized\u201d semiconductors \u2014 the kind used in cellphones and other consumer electronics \u2014 can resume.\n Raimondo said she believes that the Commerce Department needs not only to \u201cplay defense\u201d against China but also to \u201cplay offense\u201d by doing more to promote U.S. technology, including by getting more involved in the global organizations that set tech standards. China\u2019s government has taken an organized approach to promoting its companies\u2019 standards at those organizations, sparking calls for the United States to do more.\n \u201cOne area Commerce has missed is playing a role in standards-setting. I believe America has to lead in standards-setting, particularly in new technology,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cThat\u2019s one way we could help Americans to compete and lead and win.\u201d\n The Commerce Department played a central role in the tariffs Trump levied on imported steel and aluminum, finding in a 2018 report that the imports threatened national security.\n During Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) complained that those tariffs were raising costs for manufacturers in his state, including makers of cans and boats.\n Raimondo said the tariffs, levied on imports from China, the European Union, Canada and other regions, were also affecting manufacturers in her state.\n \u201cHaving said that, China has clearly behaved in ways that are anti-competitive, dumping cheap steel and aluminum into America, which hurts American workers and hurts the ability of our companies to compete,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cSo should I be confirmed, I plan to be very aggressive to help Americans compete against the unfair practices of China.\u201d\n She said the administration plans to review all trade policies in consultation with allies and domestic companies. She also noted that there is a process for U.S. businesses to seek waivers excluding them from paying the import tariffs and said she will ensure that process is \u201cswift, fair and objective and helps to balance the competing interest.\u201d",

        "title": "Biden and Putin Agree to Extend Nuclear Treaty",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia avoided a renewed arms race on Tuesday when they formally agreed to extend the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between their countries. But White House officials said Mr. Biden also confronted the Kremlin leader over the poisoning of an opposition activist and a hacking of government and private computer networks in the United States.\n It was the first call between the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers since Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration. But it was being watched as much for its tone as its substance: Mr. Biden vowed during the transition to make Russia \u201cpay a price\u201d for the hacking, and his administration, in its opening hours, demanded the release of Aleksei A. Navalny, whose arrest on Jan. 17 prompted protests last weekend across Russia that resulted in more than 3,000 arrests.\n The call was, in essence, the opening act of what promises to be a deeply adversarial relationship between the two leaders, and most likely the sharpest turn in American foreign policy since President Donald J. Trump left office one week ago.\n American intelligence agencies, led by the C.I.A., assessed before the 2020 election that Mr. Putin had a clear preference for the re-election of Mr. Trump, who, during his four years in office, treated the Russian leader with remarkable deference. Mr. Biden, in contrast, had repeatedly called Mr. Putin a \u201cK.G.B. thug\u201d and mocked Mr. Trump as \u201cPutin\u2019s puppy.\u201d Mr. Putin, for his part, had chastised Mr. Biden for his \u201csharp anti-Russian\u201d language.\n But there was none of that kind of name-calling in the official White House and Kremlin accounts of this first conversation, a tempering of language that seemed to reflect the fact that both leaders recognized that they must now deal with each other.\n Mr. Biden tried to deflect a question about the call with a joke, telling reporters at a White House event that Mr. Putin, whose government has jailed journalists and has been accused of worse, \u201csends his best!\u201d\n The call came at the request of the Russians at a moment when Mr. Biden is receiving congratulatory calls \u2014 all determined to get off on a good foot with a new administration \u2014 from many national leaders.\n But there was an immediate need: The New Start agreement, which limited the size of the two countries\u2019 strategic nuclear arsenals, expires on Feb. 5.\n On Monday night, the countries exchanged diplomatic notes to extend the treaty for five years, the maximum allowed in its text. Mr. Trump had initially declared that he would not extend it unless China also joined.\n The Chinese immediately rejected the idea, and noted that Beijing had fewer than 300 deployed nuclear weapons. Chinese officials asked, somewhat mockingly, whether the United States and Russia might be willing to cut their own arsenals by four-fifths to match China\u2019s level \u2014 or encourage China to deploy more than a thousand new weapons to match the American and Russian arsenals.\n A last-minute effort by the Trump administration to negotiate an improvement to the treaty also failed; by that time, Mr. Putin appeared to be betting that Mr. Biden would win, and would want to make good on his promise to renew the Obama-era treaty.\n The treaty limits nuclear arsenals to 1,550 strategic warheads. The five-year extension was built into the original text, if both countries agreed, so it does not need further approval by the Senate. But Mr. Putin will need to ratify the extension through the Duma, which he controls; it initially approved the treaty itself 10 years ago this week.\n Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden \u201cvoiced their satisfaction\u201d about diplomatic steps taken earlier in the day to exercise the extension, the Kremlin said.\n \u201cIn the coming days, both sides will finish the procedures necessary to assure the continued functioning of this important international legal mechanism to place mutual limits on nuclear-missile arsenals,\u201d it added.\n The extension does not cover tactical nuclear weapons, nor does it reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces agreement, amid American charges that Russia was violating its terms. There is a question whether Russia\u2019s new class of nuclear-armed undersea drones and other weapons would be covered.\n But the New Start extension avoids a costly arms race \u2014 and Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, argued that if the country was going to confront Russia for its malign activities, it was better to do so with both sides under nuclear constraints.\n Michael McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, said on Tuesday that the White House was right \u201cto engage Putin on issues of mutual interest like the New Start treaty extension,\u201d while raising Russia\u2019s \u201cbelligerent foreign policy actions\u201d and speaking \u201cbluntly about human rights violations inside Russia.\u201d\n \u201cThe challenge, of course, is implementing all three of these policy ambitions simultaneously,\u201d said Mr. McFaul, now the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. \u201cNavalny and his team, for instance, has called upon the West to sanction not just a handful of obscure Russian intelligence officers responsible for his poisoning and arrest, but instead those Russian billionaires, with real assets in the West, who enable Putin\u2019s regime. Will Biden go that far? Let\u2019s see.\u201d\n Not surprisingly, the Russian account of the conversation made no mention of Mr. Navalny, who survived the poisoning, or the considerable evidence that the attack was the work of Russian intelligence. Mr. Navalny\u2019s allies seized on that omission as evidence of Mr. Putin\u2019s brittleness.\n \u201cPutin lies always, about everything, to the last,\u201d Leonid Volkov, a close aide to Mr. Navalny, posted on Twitter.\n Mr. Biden also raised with Mr. Putin the highly sophisticated hacking of American government and private networks, called \u201cSolarWinds\u201d after the name of the Texas-based firm whose network-management software was one way Russian hackers got access to 18,000 networks. While Mr. Biden has ordered a broad assessment of the intelligence and promised that Russia would pay a price for the action, the White House gave no details of what he said \u2014 or threatened.\n American intelligence assessments of Russia placing bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan was also raised by Mr. Biden, as well as what White House officials said was \u201cinterference in the 2020 United States election.\u201d\n \u201cPresident Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,\u201d the White House statement said. \u201cThe two presidents agreed to maintain transparent and consistent communication going forward.\u201d\n For its part, the Kremlin said Mr. Putin \u201cnoted that normalizing the relationship between Russia and the United States would be in the interest of both countries and \u2014 given their special responsibility for security and stability in the world \u2014 of the entire international community.\u201d",

        "title": "Twitter\u2019s misinformation problem is much bigger than Trump. The crowd may help solve it.",
        "body_text": "The presidential election is over, but the fight against misinformation continues.\n The latest volley in that effort comes from Twitter, which on Monday announced Birdwatch, a pilot project that uses crowdsourcing techniques to combat falsehoods and misleading statements on its service.\n The pilot, which is open to only about 1,000 select users who can apply to be contributors, will allow people to write notes with corrections and accurate information directly into misleading tweets \u2014 a method that has the potential to get quality information to people more quickly than traditional fact-checking. Fact checks that are rated by other contributors as high quality may get bumped up or rewarded with greater visibility.\n Birdwatch represents Twitter\u2019s most experimental response to one of the biggest lessons that social media companies drew from the historic events of 2020: that their existing efforts to combat misinformation \u2014 including labeling, fact-checking and sometimes removing content \u2014 were not enough to prevent falsehoods about a stolen election or the coronavirus  from reaching and influencing broad swaths of the population. Researchers who studied enforcement actions by social media companies last year found that fact checks and labels are usually implemented too late, after a post or a tweet has gone viral.\n The Birdwatch project \u2014 which for the duration of the pilot will function as a separate website \u2014 is novel in that it attempts to build new mechanisms into Twitter\u2019s product that foreground fact-checking by its community of 187 million daily users worldwide. Rather than having to comb through replies to tweets to sift through what\u2019s true or false \u2014 or having Twitter employees append to a tweet a label providing additional context \u2014 users will be able to click on a separate notes folder attached to a tweet where they can see the consensus-driven responses from the community. Twitter will have a team reviewing winning responses to prevent manipulation, though a major question is whether any part of the process will be automated and therefore more easily gamed.\n Crowdsourcing models are as old as the Internet itself and are most commonly associated with services such as Wikipedia, Quora and Reddit. Each of these services has a model in which community members and administrators debate content and arrive at a conclusion, with the platform taking a limited curation and policing role. While Wikipedia\u2019s crowdsourced model is viewed as having been very effective, Reddit has struggled.\n The Birdwatch interface may slightly change the look of Twitter, but it draws from a long-standing approach.\n Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg have both said they believe that the best remedy for problematic speech is more conversation and dialogue \u2014 rather than a censorship model in which content is removed or covered up. The latter tack, which the companies doubled down on during the election and its aftermath, did not make a huge dent in preventing misinformation, and it also pushed many Trump supporters and right-leaning users to smaller, ideologically friendly platforms.\n The sense that tech companies have moved away from their ideals of a big tent for free expression was further cemented when the platforms banned President Donald Trump in the wake of his misinformation-fueled rally that preceded the violent Capitol siege this month. Experts have also pointed out that the flurry and pace of labeling, fact-checking and other enforcements are unsustainable for smaller services like Twitter.\n Two recent studies have pointed to the value of community fact-checking in correcting misinformation about the pandemic.",

Just two days later, on Jan. 21, they chartered a plane to the small community of Beaver Creek, which is roughly 270 miles northwest along the Alaska border. There, they allegedly identified themselves at a mobile vaccine clinic as new employees at a local motel in order to qualify for the coronavirus vaccine, the\u00a0Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported\u00a0citing local officials.\n The couple allegedly then traveled back to the Whitehorse airport, where they were intercepted by Yukon Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) officers for questioning.\n \u201cEffectively what they did was they put our community and our isolation team at risk,\u201d Yukon Community Services Minister John Streicker told the CBC. \u201cI\u2019m pretty angry at the whole thing.\u201d\n Yukon\u2019s rural and remote communities have been given vaccine priority due to the residents having limited access to health care. These residents include members of the Yukon First Nation.\n Anyone found to have violated Yukon\u2019s CEMA faces a maximum fine of $500 and/or up to six months in prison.\n The White River First Nation, whose main population is in Beaver Creek, condemned the couple\u2019s actions in a statement on Facebook Monday and called for them to face a more serious penalty in order to discourage similar behavior.\n \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the actions of individuals who put or elders and vulnerable people at risk to jump the line for selfish purposes,\u201d Chief Angela Demit said. \u201cWRFN was selected for vaccines given our remoteness, elderly and high-risk population, as well as limited access to health care.\u201d\n According to Yukon News reporter Haley Ritchie, Ekaterina Baker had publicly posted on Instagram about staying home, quarantining and keeping communities safe during the pandemic, suggesting that the couple were aware of the implications of their actions.

        "title": "Helping Kids Is a Very Good Idea",
        "body_text": "Some things about American politics are completely predictable, even in a time of insurrection and QAnon craziness. Anyone who has been paying attention over the past decade knew that as soon as a Democrat took the White House, Republicans would instantly do another 180-degree turn on budget deficits.\n Remember, the G.O.P. went from hyperventilating about debt as an existential threat during the Obama years to complete indifference about deficits under Donald Trump. Surely nobody is surprised to see Republicans immediately revert to deficit hysteria now that Joe Biden is president.\n Why are Republicans suddenly peddling debt phobia again? Their usual argument is that federal debt is a burden on future generations; I and others have spent considerable time trying to explain that this is bad economics.\n But leave the economics of debt aside. Shouldn\u2019t politicians who claim to be terribly worried about the future of America\u2019s children support, you know, actually helping America\u2019s children today?\n That\u2019s not a hypothetical question. Democrats are reportedly working on legislation that would offer monthly payments to most American families with children, and could, among other things, cut child poverty roughly in half.\n One especially good thing about the legislation in the works is that Democrats finally seem to have broken free of Republican framing, under which every benefit takes the form of a tax credit. This will apparently be a straightforward proposal to send money to qualifying families.\n Assuming that Democrats can eventually get past Mitch McConnell\u2019s attempt to, in effect, prevent the party that won the election from taking control of the Senate, Republicans will soon have to vote on this legislation. How will they justify voting no?\n Some background: America stands out among wealthy countries for its failure to provide much help to families with children. U.S. expenditures on family benefits as a share of G.D.P. are less than a third the rich-nation average. Largely as a consequence, we have a much higher rate of child poverty than our peers.\n Our stinginess does a lot of harm. Economists have shown that previous extensions of aid to families with children, like the gradual rollout of food stamps in the 1960s and 1970s and the expansion of Medicaid in the 1980s, didn\u2019t just improve children\u2019s lives in the short run; children who received the aid grew into healthier, more productive adults than those who didn\u2019t receive the aid. By not doing even more for children, we are stunting their future, and that of the nation as a whole.\n But can we afford to do more? Independent estimates of the cost of something like the reported Democratic proposal put its price tag at roughly $120 billion a year. To put this in perspective, it\u2019s only about half the 2021 revenue loss caused by the 2017 tax cut.\n And aid to children would achieve what proponents of the tax cut promised but failed to deliver: an improvement in America\u2019s long-run economic prospects. If the children we help today grow up into healthier, more productive adults than they would otherwise \u2014 which they will \u2014 that will eventually mean higher G.D.P.\n And aid to children would also indirectly help the budget, because those children would later pay more in taxes and be less likely to call on safety net programs. These fiscal benefits might even be big enough that helping children pays for itself, and in any case they mean that the true cost of aiding children, even in narrowly fiscal terms, would be less than it might appear.\n All in all, then, increased aid to families with children is a really good idea. It would immediately improve millions of Americans\u2019 lives, it would make us stronger in the future, and it would have only modest budget costs. So how will Republicans in Congress justify opposing it? Because you know that most, if not all, of them will.\n One answer, of course, is that they\u2019ll yell about fiscal responsibility and hope that voters have very short memories.\n Another answer is that they\u2019ll claim that the Biden administration and its allies have a \u201cradical leftist agenda\u201d \u2014 because nothing screams fanatical Marxism like giving kids enough to eat and a roof over their heads \u2014 and hope that voters don\u2019t figure out what Democrats are actually proposing. (This goes for much more than child credits: Polls suggest that on issues like taxes and health care, Republicans, not Democrats, are the radicals whose views are out of touch with public opinion.)\n Finally, we\u2019ll surely hear some version of the standard conservative argument that any policy reducing misery reduces the incentive to be self-sufficient \u2014 you know, unemployment insurance encourages people to stay unemployed, food stamps encourage them to be lazy, and so on. Making this argument about a broad-based program to help children will be hard, but they\u2019ll find a way.\n One thing I don\u2019t expect, however, is any kind of good-faith argument against aid to families with children. That\u2019s not to say that the Democratic proposal will be perfect; no doubt experts will see ways it could be better. But spending more on children is a very good idea, economically and morally, and should become law.",

        "title": "Acting Capitol Police chief tells Congress the department 'failed' during riot",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The acting head of the US Capitol Police told congressional members during a closed-door briefing Tuesday that the \"department failed to meet its own high standards\" on January 6 when a crowd of pro-Trump rioters overran the Capitol building.\n Acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman called the insurrection a \"terrorist attack\" and offered her \"sincerest apologies on behalf of the department,\" according to her prepared remarks during a briefing for lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee with a number of agencies that had a role in security on January 6.\n Pittman also said the department was aware of a \"strong potential for violence\" targeting Congress and did not take the appropriate steps to prevent it.\n Pittman's admission comes as US Capitol Police officers are debating whether to hold a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day of insurrection, including Pittman. One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief the day of the siege at the Capitol and \"never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way, shape or form.\"\n Officers have told CNN that they felt abandoned and betrayed by the department's leadership.\n \"Let me be clear: the Department should have been more prepared for this attack,\" Pittman said Tuesday. \"By January 4th, the Department knew that the January 6th event would not be like any of the previous protests held in 2020. We knew that militia groups and white supremacists organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event.\"\n Ultimately, Pittman took responsibility for mistakes that were made in protecting the Capitol.\n \"As the Acting Chief, I take responsibility for the mistakes that were made by the Department, and I pledge to this Committee, the Congress, the American people, and my USCP colleagues, that we will do better going forward, but we need to make changes,\" she said.\n Acting Sergeant at Arms Timothy Blodgett issued a blunt assessment Tuesday of the security failures that occurred, both in preparing for a protest of this nature and reacting to events as they unfolded, according to his prepared statement during Tuesday's briefing in front of lawmakers.\n \"It is clear there was a failure of preparation. Whether it was insufficient or conflicting intelligence, lacking ability to translate that intelligence into action, insufficient preparation or an inadequate ability to mobilize partner agencies for immediate assistance, a series of events, once thought unfathomable, unfolded allowing our most sacred halls to be breached. And, sadly, several lives were lost, including Officer Brian Sicknick and Officer Howard Liebengood,\" Blodgett said in his remarks.\n Pittman outlined four things that made the department ill-equipped to respond to the attack, including the lack of manpower. The acting chief said USCP officers did not have the right equipment on hand or easily accessible, and the process for sealing the building \"may not have been consistently followed.\" Lastly, Pittman stated that the department was told that communication over their radios and the public address system were hard to hear during the attack.\n Since the insurrection, Pittman said USCP has coordinated with the National Guard to secure the Capitol and the complex surrounding it and has \"taken steps to ensure\" that USCP is sharing and receiving critical intelligence information from its law enforcement partners. Pittman also said that the department's intelligence director is now holding daily internal intelligence briefings with USCP officials.\n Pittman said that going forward, \"the Capitol's security infrastructure must change and that the Department needs access to additional resources -- both manpower and physical assets.\"\n This story has been updated.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen and Peter Nickeas contributed to this report.",

        "title": "California Lifts Coronavirus Stay-At-Home Orders Across The State",
        "body_text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California lifted regional stay-at-home orders across the state Monday in response to improving coronavirus conditions, returning the state to a system of county-by-county restrictions, state health officials announced.\n The order had been in place in the San Francisco Bay Area, San Joaquin Valley and Southern California, covering the majority of the state\u2019s counties. The change will allow businesses such as restaurants to resume outdoor operations in many areas, though local officials could choose to continue stricter rules. The state is also lifting a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew.\n \u201cTogether, we changed our activities knowing our short-term sacrifices would lead to longer-term gains. COVID-19 is still here and still deadly, so our work is not over, but it\u2019s important to recognize our collective actions saved lives and we are turning a critical corner,\u201d Dr. Tomas Aragon, the state\u2019s public health director, said in a statement.\n Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to address the public later Monday.\n The decision comes with improving trends in the rate of infections, hospitalizations and intensive care unit capacity as well as vaccinations.\n Newsom imposed the stay-at-home order in December as coronavirus cases worsened. Under the system, a multi-county region had to shut down most businesses and order people to stay home if ICU capacity dropped below 15%. An 11-county Northern California region was never under the order. The Greater Sacramento Region exited the order last week. The state makes the decisions based on four-week projections showing ICU capacity improving, but officials have not disclosed the  data behind the forecasts.\n During the weekend, San Francisco Bay Area ICU capacity surged to 23% while the San Joaquin Valley increased to 1.3%, its first time above zero. The huge Southern California region, the most populous, remains at zero ICU capacity.\n Early last year, the state developed a system of color-coded tiers that dictated the level of restrictions on businesses and individuals based on virus conditions in each of California\u2019s 58 counties. Most counties will now go back to the most restrictive purple tier, which allows for outdoor dining, hair and nail salons to be open, and outdoor church services. Bars that only serve beverages cannot be open.\n The county-by-county tier system uses various metrics to determine the risk of community transmission and apply a color code \u2014 purple, red, orange or yellow \u2014 which correspond to widespread, substantial, moderate and minimal, respectively.\n As of the weekend, California has had more than 3.1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 36,790 deaths, according to the state\u2019s public health website.\n ___\n Antczak reported from Los Angeles.",

        "body_text": "Good morning. I was flying solo there for a couple of days, cooking only for myself. This was not as simple as I\u2019d thought it might be, as many over the years have pointed out to me in letters and messages, at cocktail parties, at the end of news meetings, once at a funeral. The business of cooking dinner, for me, for a lot of us, is inextricably linked to the idea of service, to the notion that by feeding others we are offering pleasure as a kind of gift, a sacrament. Left to our own devices, we might fall into traps: eggs all the time, toast, cookies. One night I found myself spooning peanut butter into my mouth over the sink.\n That\u2019s not a good place to be, and particularly during this pandemic, when so many are spending so much time alone. I resolved to do better. At the market, I found a skirt steak about the length of an iPhone, and I grabbed a single potato. I bought a thatch of watercress. I wedged the potato into eighths and showered the slices with salt and neutral oil on a small sheet pan, then slid it into a hot oven to roast. I sprayed salt all over the steak and seared it in an oil-slicked cast-iron pan, flipped it a couple times, then took it off the heat and basted it in butter and thyme, with a single clove of garlic. I let it rest.\n The potatoes were golden and crisp by then, and I put them on a plate beside some watercress, sliced the steak and drizzled everything with a little of the basting butter. Ate that at the kitchen counter watching \u201cPretend It\u2019s a City,\u201d and it was a pretty good night.\n But the next morning? Eating the leftover steak with soft scrambled eggs and saut\u00e9ed watercress while reading the newspaper and drinking a cup of tea? That was glorious stuff, self-care at its highest, and I was determined to tell you about it because all of us at some time are going to need a prompt to cook, for themselves and for others. I\u2019m here to provide it. Cook. You\u2019ll find in the meal, or the leftovers that follow, something approaching grace.\n Cook what? I\u2019ve got loads of ideas. Take a look at this creamy cauliflower soup with rosemary olive oil (above), and at these crisped chickpeas in spicy brown butter. Consider this fish with sizzling olive butter and, in a riff on my solo meal, these steak mock frites.\n Make a salad. Make chili. Make soup.\n If you\u2019re like me and dining alone, consider quartering this recipe for trout. You don\u2019t need a fireplace in which to cook it, but if you have one, it\u2019s an adventure for sure. Try this cauliflower chaat. Make a small chicken soup. Turn to the omelet. It won\u2019t let you down.\n There are many thousands more recipes to make for yourself or others awaiting your attention on NYT Cooking. Go take a look and see what you find. Then save the recipes you like. And rate the recipes you\u2019ve cooked. Leave a note on that recipe, if you\u2019ve come up with a hack or ingredient substitution that you\u2019d like to remember or alert to your fellow subscribers.\n I know I go on about that a lot, about how you need a subscription to enjoy the benefits of NYT Cooking. That\u2019s because subscriptions support the work of dozens and allow it to continue. I hope, if you haven\u2019t already, that you will subscribe to NYT Cooking today. Thank you.\n We will meanwhile be standing by at cookingcare@nytimes.com in case you get jammed up. Just drop us a line and someone will get back to you.\n Now, it\u2019s nothing to do with those sharp Japanese mandolins or how often I think about buying a countertop pizza oven, but Jericho Brown wrote a poem for The Times to commemorate the inauguration last week of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris, and I think you should read it. It\u2019s called \u201cInaugural.\u201d\n Here\u2019s a fascinating tale in The Atlantic on efforts to save the corpse flower, of which very few are left in the wild.\n This is Novos Baianos, \u201cA Menina Dan\u00e7a,\u201d from 1972.\n Finally, you need a book? Hit the library for \u201cSalmon Fishing in the Yemen,\u201d by Paul Torday. Comedy, tragedy, satire \u2014 it\u2019s all there. Enjoy, and I\u2019ll be back on Wednesday.",

        "title": "Joe Biden Signs Executive Order Condemning Anti-Asian Racism Related To COVID-19",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden signed an executive order Tuesday condemning the wave of anti-Asian racism accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a largely symbolic measure but one that nevertheless stands in stark contrast to the actions of his predecessor, who actively fomented racism against Asian Americans.\n It recommends that federal health authorities should make sure their COVID-19 response \u201cdemonstrates cultural competency, language access, and sensitivity towards AAPIs.\u201d It also directs the Department of Justice to make more concerted efforts to address hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, in partnership with AAPI community leaders.\n Since the beginning of last year, Asian Americans have experienced a surge in racist attacks and harassment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As early as January 2020, when COVID-19 cases first began to surge in China, Asian American businesses reported a precipitous drop in sales and patronage due to COVID-19 fears. By March, many Asian Americans began documenting experiences of racism, including being called racial slurs, being spat on and/or physically assaulted, as well as being denied services, experiencing workplace discrimination and other potential civil rights violations.\n A coalition of AAPI advocacy groups and scholars called STOP AAPI HATE started collecting these incidents in an online database. By August, they had received reports of 2,583 racist incidents from respondents in 47 states and Washington, D.C. The number is likely an undercount because the data is self-reported and voluntary.\n Former President Donald Trump continually poured gasoline on the fire, frequently referring to the pandemic using racist and xenophobic slurs, fear-mongering against people of Asian descent and blaming China to distract from his own shambolic response to the pandemic.\n In September, the House passed legislation similar to Biden\u2019s executive order. The nonbinding resolution condemned and denounced \u201cany and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form\u201d and urged federal, state and local officials to document, investigate and collect data on any reports of anti-Asian hate incidents.\n The vote was largely along party lines, and lawmakers spent more than two hours debating it on the House floor. GOP allies of Trump claimed the legislation was simply meant to attack him, repeatedly dismissing the magnitude of the issue.\n Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) claimed the bill wasn\u2019t \u201creally about\u201d racism, but \u201cDemocrats ignoring the real issues plaguing Americans just for the opportunity to criticize President Trump.\u201d\n And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) claimed \u201cthere is no kitchen in America that thinks this is the priority.\u201d\n Ahead of Biden\u2019s executive order on Tuesday, Asian American advocacy groups welcomed the acknowledgment but urged Biden to take more specific steps toward enforceability, accountability and outreach to AAPI communities.\n \u201cAfter four years of policies targeting the Asian American community and other communities of color, and increasing xenophobic, anti-Asian rhetoric from the former president, we are relieved that one of President Biden\u2019s first actions is to issue an order disavowing discrimination against the AAPI community,\u201d STOP AAPI HATE said in a statement Monday, while noting that \u201csignificant work must be done to address the harm done to the AAPI community. This is a time for the Biden-Harris administration to take bold action.\u201d\n Tuesday\u2019s executive order was part of a series of executive orders regarding racial equity and civil rights. Many of Biden\u2019s first actions as president have been focused on reversing Trump\u2019s racist and incendiary policies and rhetoric, such as rescinding the former president\u2019s Muslim travel ban and restoring diversity and anti-racism trainings at federal agencies.",

        "body_text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 A priest who livestreamed exorcisms aimed at rooting out what he, former President Donald Trump and some Trump supporters have falsely claimed was widespread voting fraud in the presidential election has left a Roman Catholic diocese in Wisconsin.\n The Diocese of Madison said it and the Rev. John Zuhlsdorf reached a mutual decision on his departure. Zuhlsdorf will relocate from the diocese \u201dto pursue other opportunities,\u201d the diocese said in a statement earlier this month.\n \u201cThe Bishop of Madison is grateful to the Reverend Zuhlsdorf for his faithful support of the diocese\u2019s seminarians and priests, thanks him for his many years of steadfast ministry serving the diocese, and wishes him the best in his future endeavors,\u201d the statement said.\n Zuhlsdorf did not immediately respond to a phone message and email Tuesday seeking comment.\n Zuhlsdorf claimed he had permission from Madison Bishop Donald Hying to conduct the exorcisms. Hying said, however, that he didn\u2019t give Zuhlsdorf permission to conduct exorcisms related to \u201cpartisan political activity,\u201d but rather approved an exorcism for \u201calleviation from the scourge of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n Recordings of Zuhlsdorf\u2019s exorcisms have since been removed from YouTube, the\u00a0Wisconsin State Journal\u00a0reported. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops defines an exorcism as \u201ca specific form of prayer that the Church uses against the power of the devil.\u201d\n Diocese spokesman Brent King described Zuhlsdorf\u2019s role as that of a \u201cfreelancer\u201d and he was not an employee of the diocese or a parish.",

The 24-year-old, who entered the fighting scene in January of 2020, first propelled to fame on YouTube, where he has amassed more than 20 million subscribers who are drawn to his prank videos.\n In December, Paul told ESPN that his ultimate goal is to take on Connor McGregor, a former UFC double champion.\n \"I am dedicating my life to beating Conor McGregor,\" Paul said. \"Financially, it already makes sense. Financially, I'm already one of the biggest prizefighters and there's only a couple more bosses to check off and to beat and to conquer.\"\n But first, Paul aims to get more wins under his belt. He will take on Askren in an eight-round pro boxing match at a location that is yet to be announced, according to ESPN.\n This will be Askren's first professional boxing match of his career. He was an MMA fighter until 2019 and is currently listed as retired, according to UFC.\n \"I know Jake Paul is enjoying pretending he is a fighter,\" Askren told ESPN. \"I think on April 17 he is going to have a rude awakening to what being a fighter is really like. Jake has led a privileged life and doesn't really know what the meaning of being a fighter is. I'm going to put his dreams to an end.\"\n The event will be held by Triller, a video-making and social-networking app. This will be the second time the platform has hosted a fight.",

It will play off the characters who are chased up a pole by a rhino in the current iteration of the ride.\n \u201cEach one of them will have their own story and cultural heritage,\u201d Beatty said, adding:\n \u201cThere\u2019s a birdwatcher, an entomologist, a wildlife painter and a photographer, and each one will have a different reason for being on the expedition. And, of course, they did one of the things you\u2019re never supposed to do, which is leave the boat.\u201d\n That boat will be depicted in a different scene, taken over by some of the local wildlife:\n According to a blog post on the Disney Parks website, the attraction will be changed at both Disneyland in California and at Walt Disney World in Florida to \u201creflect and value the diversity of the world around us.\u201d\n No timeline has been announced.\n The Jungle Cruise is the latest ride to be tweaked to remove images of and references to material some have found offensive.\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean was adjusted to transform a scene in which women were auctioned to the pirates.\u00a0The character of \u201cThe Redhead,\u201d once a victim in the scene, is now a pirate and the auction is for goods rather than people.\n The company also announced that the Splash Mountain flume ride will be transformed from one built around the film \u201cSong of the South\u201d \u2015\u00a0so racist the company has never released it for home video in the United States \u2015 to a new attraction based on \u201cThe Princess and the Frog.\u201d",

        "title": "Please, Biden, Try for 2 Million Shots a Day",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump\u2019s administration overpromised on coronavirus vaccines. In November, his secretary of health and human services said there would be 40 million doses available by the end of the 2020; he was off by about a month. Trump himself promised 100 million doses in that same period. Everything he and his team said was a sales pitch, designed to foster the false impression that the pandemic they let burn out of control was on the cusp of ending.\n There\u2019s a growing consensus that Joe Biden\u2019s administration has done the exact opposite. \u201cBiden\u2019s early approach to virus: Underpromise, overdeliver,\u201d says an Associated Press headline. In December, when Biden pledged 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days, some experts thought it was a reach. But now that the United States is already vaccinating a bit more than a million people a day, that figure is far too modest.\n Biden seemed to acknowledge that on Monday, telling reporters that the United States could get to 150 million shots in 100 days. Even that, however, is not enough.\n The pandemic has put members of the privileged pundit class in an unaccustomed position. I\u2019m used to thinking about politics in terms of what the government should be doing for other people. Now, like millions and millions of others, I watch the administration with a frantic eye to my own family\u2019s survival. (I used to think of myself as a moderately savvy person, but I\u2019ve yet to figure out how to get vaccine appointments for my parents.) And so I track bits of data on things that previously meant nothing to me \u2014 like the production of low dead space syringes \u2014 with the terrified desperation of someone googling symptoms while awaiting biopsy results.\n In my voracious consumption of vaccine news, I\u2019d been baffled as to why the United States was aiming so low. Pfizer and Moderna, makers of the two vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use, have promised 200 million doses, enough for 100 million people, by the end of March. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me he\u2019s in touch with people at both companies, and they\u2019ve said they\u2019ll be able to deliver.\n \u201cWe\u2019re probably on track for about two million doses a day, in terms of production,\u201d he said, and we should, in turn, \u201cabsolutely\u201d be able to get two million doses a day into people\u2019s arms. If that\u2019s true, anything less would be deeply disappointing.\n It\u2019s understandable that, less than a week in, the new administration doesn\u2019t want to set outsize expectations, especially when the Trump administration left so much confusion in its wake.\n \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much vaccine we have, and if I can\u2019t tell it to you then I can\u2019t tell it to the governors and I can\u2019t tell it to the state health officials,\u201d Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Fox News on Sunday. Before the administration can fix all the bottlenecks in the system, it needs time to figure out where they are.\n But it still needs more ambitious goals. Because the original 100 million figure included people getting their second shots, the Biden administration\u2019s promise meant that only about 67 million people would be fully vaccinated by the end of April. Especially with more infectious new variants spreading, that\u2019s a figure to inspire despair, not hope. \u201cWe need the administration to do better than that,\u201d said Jha.\n Underpromising, like overpromising, can breed cynicism, making people feel deceived. Conservatives are likely to be critical of the Biden administration\u2019s rollout no matter what. (\u201cBiden\u2019s dishonest coronavirus expectation-setting,\u201d said a Washington Examiner headline.) But even if you badly want this administration to succeed, it\u2019s frustrating to have to read between the lines of public statements to get some idea of when American life might once again become minimally tolerable.\n \u201cMy guess is that now that they\u2019re in office, and now that they\u2019re getting their arms around these questions of how much supply do we have, where are the real backlogs in distribution, my guess is they\u2019re going to come out with better projections on what they\u2019re going to be able to do,\u201d Jha said just before Biden came out with his new estimate.\n No one who cares about public health wants a return to an administration that relies on the power of positive thinking. But we do need the administration to show that it\u2019s being as bold as this terrifying, miserable moment demands.\n \u201cIt\u2019s critical for just keeping people\u2019s spirits up,\u201d said Jha. \u201cOtherwise I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of despondency\u201d about when life will start to get even a little bit better. The administration might not be able to tell us when, exactly, it can get to two million vaccinations a day. But it should display as much furious urgency in striving toward that goal as people like me feel waiting for it.",

        "title": "'Stop The Steal' Organizer With Ties To Trump Arrested After Capitol Insurrection",
        "body_text": "An organizer of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally who once spoke at a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump was arrested Monday in connection with his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol siege in Washington, D.C.\n Brandon Straka, 44, was arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, by FBI agents and charged with multiple federal crimes after investigators uncovered a litany of video and social media evidence that put Straka amid the heart of the day\u2019s violence, according to a criminal complaint.\n In a 58-minute video posted to YouTube, Straka acknowledged that he marched to the Capitol and said he was \u201cone of the speakers slated to speak at the Capitol.\u201d\n Though Straka claimed he didn\u2019t witness any violence or vandalism, authorities uncovered tweets in which he appeared to encourage those who stormed the Capitol.\n \u201cI\u2019m completely confused. For 6-8 weeks everybody on the right has been saying \u20181776!\u2019 & that if congress moves forward it will mean a revolution!\u201d Straka wrote in a tweet the day of the insurrection, according to his criminal complaint. \u201cSo congress moves forward. Patriots storm the Capitol \u2015 now everybody is virtual signaling their embarrassment that this happened.\u201d\n In another tweet, he said:\u00a0\u201cPerhaps I missed the part where it was agreed this would be a revolution of ice cream cones & hair-braiding parties to take our government back from lying, cheating globally interested swamp parasites. My bad.\u201d\n In an eight-minute YouTube video\u00a0that an unidentified witness brought to the FBI\u2019s attention, Straka can be seen storming the Capitol with the crowd.\n \u201cWe\u2019re going in,\u201d Straka says in the video. \u201cThey\u2019re saying we\u2019re going in. We\u2019re going in. We\u2019re going in. The people are going.\u201d\n As Straka and the crowd pushed forward, a U.S. Capitol officer held up his shield in an attempt to stop the crowd from advancing.\n \u201cTake it away from him,\u201d Straka can be heard saying in the video, according to the FBI. \u201cTake the shield!\u201d\n Members of the crowd begin to put their hands on the shield as Straka continues to yell in the video: \u201cTake it! Take it!\u201d\n More from the complaint:\n The crowd successfully pulled the shield away from the officer as the officer appeared to be trying to move back toward the entrance of the building. The officer then went back into the crowd to get his shield back. Several people pulled on the shield as the officer grabbed it, thus pulling the officer deeper into the crowd. A large group of people then simultaneously pushed toward the officer as STRAKA and others chanted, \u201cUSA!\u201d The officer was able to get his shield back and then appeared to exit the crowd by going through the entrance to the U.S. Capitol.\n Five people died as a result of the day\u2019s events, including U.S. Capitol police Officer Brian Sicknick.\n Straka spoke at a 2019 Trump rally in Cincinnati, where he was an opener for a lineup that included Trump, then-Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr.,\u00a0Talking Points Memo noted.\n The right-wing activist rose to prominence for his\u00a0\u201cWalkAway\u201d campaign, which aims to turn liberals into conservatives. In a January 2020 interview with C-SPAN, Straka bragged about his relationship with Trump when he described a meeting between the two at a Mar-a-Lago event in Palm Beach, Florida.\n \u201cHe had some incredibly kind and generous things to say to me about the movement itself,\u00a0but I think the most special part was, we were there at the dining area of Mar-a-Lago, and he was going around to tables nearby and just telling people, \u2018Do you know who he is? Do you know what he\u2019s doing? He\u2019s getting people to leave the Democratic Party! He\u2019s tremendous! It\u2019s tremendous!\u2019\u201d Straka told C-SPAN.\n Straka also made the news in June, when he was banned from American Airlines for refusing to wear a mask in spite of the coronavirus, which at the time had killed more than 100,000 Americans and has now killed more than 400,000.\n In connection with the Capitol siege of Jan. 6, Straka has been charged with interfering with police during civil disorder, and illegal entry and disorderly conduct on restricted Capitol grounds.",

        "title": "New coronavirus variants accelerate race to make sure vaccines keep up",
        "body_text": "The scientific and pharmaceutical race to keep coronavirus vaccines ahead of new virus variants escalated Monday, even as a highly transmissible variant first detected in people who had recently traveled to Brazil was discovered in Minnesota.\n Moderna, the maker of one of the two authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States, announced it would develop and test a new vaccine tailored to block a similar mutation-riddled virus variant in case an updated shot becomes necessary.\n The effort is a precautionary step. Evidence released Monday suggested that the Moderna vaccine will still work against two variants of concern that emerged in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The plan highlights that the scientists who responded with unprecedented speed and success to develop coronavirus vaccines are already moving to address new challenges. It also amplifies the urgency of getting as many people immunized with current vaccines as quickly as possible.\n \u201cWe need to double down on public health measures. The less a virus spreads, the less it\u2019s going to mutate,\u201d said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cWe need to get as many people vaccinated with the current vaccine that we have as we possibly can \u2026 and prepare for the potential eventuality that we might have to update this vaccine sometime in the future.\u201d\n The success of two remarkably effective coronavirus vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech in record time last year provided breathing room and hope, even as the pandemic surged. But the detection of variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil in recent weeks raised immediate concern.\n Those variants, each with a different assemblage of mutations, spread much more easily. But some of the mutations in each variant drew special concern because they sit in the spiky proteins that dot the outside of the coronavirus and have been the key target for vaccines and therapeutics.\n The British variant has been detected in the United States at least 130 times, and Minnesota public health officials announced Monday that they had detected the Brazilian variant, which some reports suggest may be able to evade natural immunity, allowing people to become reinfected. The Minnesota Department of Health said the case involved a resident with recent travel history to Brazil.\n The emergence of the variants raised the specter that the current generation of vaccines might be rendered obsolete before they have even been fully rolled out.\n The emerging evidence, though still partial, puts some of those fears to rest. The study released Monday, before peer review, suggests the Moderna vaccine will probably protect against variants first detected in Britain and South Africa. A Pfizer-BioNTech study released last week found that its vaccine probably protects against the British variant. Those findings add to a growing body of experiments testing antibody-rich blood serum from vaccinated people against new mutations, with largely encouraging results.\n But the study of the Moderna vaccine contains a clear warning sign: Although the disease-fighting antibodies appeared to work against the South African variant, that efficacy was diminished. That prompted the company to design a new potential vaccine that could be added to the current two-dose regimen if needed, which will soon be tested in human trials. Moderna will also test a third dose of its current vaccine to see whether revving up a person\u2019s immune response against the original version of the coronavirus could help protect against the variant.\n \u201cThe virus is changing its stripes, and we will change to make sure we can beat the virus where it\u2019s going,\u201d Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview. \u201cThe unknown is: Would we feel it\u2019s necessary to do that, would public health officials want this at that point or would they still be comfortable? What we\u2019re trying to do is create an option.\u201d\n Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview Monday that the agency understands the urgency of dealing with the potential problems posed by new variants. She said the utility of vaccines, monoclonal antibody treatments and some coronavirus tests \u201ccould be undermined\u201d if there is a big enough change caused by a new coronavirus strain.\n Woodcock said the FDA is in talks with manufacturers about how to deal with the threat. New FDA policies on how to test for efficacy involving a new variant, she said, would be made public because of intense interest.\n Woodcock stressed that the variants problem showed why a global response is so important. Unless the coronavirus is eradicated everywhere, she said, it will remain a threat to the United States and other countries.\n The emerging evidence shows the need to deploy current vaccines as quickly as possible, a campaign that has accelerated markedly in the United States over the past week, with more than 1 million shots given each day since last Tuesday, according to Washington Post data. It also underscores the importance of vigilance, to fully investigate any cases of the coronavirus that develop in people who are vaccinated so that there is an early alert if the virus shows it can break through the immunity conjured by vaccines.\n A growing number of scientists anticipate the potential need for periodic reboots of the coronavirus vaccines, similar to an annual flu shot, to deliver a boost of immunity tailored to closely match new variants.\n The vaccines \u201care still going to be highly effective, and they are probably the most important tools we have to get this thing under control,\u201d said Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease, who found in a study of older adults that the immune response triggered by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was modestly less effective against the British variant. \u201cWith flu, we need to adapt the vaccines. We can see that already. The companies do realize there is a problem in the longer term, and they will deal with it just as we have done with flu every year.\u201d\n In the Moderna study, antibody-containing blood serum taken from people and monkeys who received the vaccine was tested against \u201cpseudoviruses\u201d that are engineered to contain the spike protein present in the U.K. and South African variants. The serum was able to block both viruses and remained above a threshold of efficacy for the South African variant, despite a diminution in effectiveness.\n Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health and an author of the study, said more experiments are forthcoming that will help guide public health experts\u2019 thinking. But he speculated, based on his knowledge of other viruses, that the evidence so far is that the current vaccines will still work.\n \u201cI think we\u2019re okay for now, but [the virus] is changing,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt means that if some of these mutations accumulate to a certain extent, you may end up with a new strain that\u2019s not protected by the vaccine, so all of this is being done out of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n There have also been reminders that although the first two vaccines worked remarkably well, success is not guaranteed in vaccine development. Merck, a longtime vaccine company, made the surprising announcement Monday that it was abandoning two vaccine candidates after early human studies showed that both triggered inferior immune responses compared with other vaccines and natural infection.\n The Merck effort started later and significantly lagged other companies, and the nation\u2019s vaccination plan wasn\u2019t heavily reliant on a possible Merck shot. The two authorized vaccines use a novel approach that had never been used in an authorized vaccine, while Merck employed a more traditional approach.\n Late last year, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline announced they were redesigning their vaccine after a first version did not cause a robust immune response in older adults. After the setback, their candidate is not expected to be available until the end of this year.\n Public health officials are eagerly awaiting the data from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s trial, which could come in the next week. That data may suggest how a vaccine performs against the variant, because since some of the trial was conducted in South Africa.\n The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are especially well suited to rapid updates. Both use genetic material called messenger RNA that acts much like software, instructing the body\u2019s cells how to build the spike protein found on the outside of the coronavirus. To update the vaccines, scientists have to rewrite the software to block the new target.\n Hoge said the regulatory pathway for a new version of the vaccine is not entirely clear, but he does not anticipate having to run large trials with tens of thousands of volunteers, as was done to show the first vaccine was effective and safe. Instead, he said he anticipates a rebooted vaccine could be tested in hundreds or thousands of people to establish safety and that the right immune response is being triggered.\n It would be possible, Hoge said, to begin making a new vaccine at large scale by the summer.\n Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said trying to extrapolate from laboratory experiments to understand whether vaccines would still be protective was like trying to read tea leaves, because it isn\u2019t yet known what level of antibodies protects someone against the virus. But he pointed out that the immune system musters a multipronged defense, and the laboratory tests conducted so far don\u2019t capture the entirety of the response.\n \u201cI would say we don\u2019t need to worry about this until it has shown to be a problem,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThat said, we should prepare for it to be a problem.\u201d\n Monoclonal antibody treatments are more likely to be ineffective against new variants because they use only one piece of the body\u2019s immune response.\n The FDA\u2019s Woodcock said that monoclonal antibodies are \u201cfairly sensitive\u201d to changes in the virus and that the companies making them and the government are testing the treatments against various strains. She said the South African variant might pose a threat to one of the antibody treatments but that \u201cwe have a whole stream\u201d of antibodies, including some that are cocktails, under development.\n Former FDA commissioner Mark McClellan said the key to the United States staying ahead of the mutations is through surveillance by genomic sequencing.\n \u201cIf you have a good surveillance system,\u201d McClellan said, \u201cyou can identify the variants before they spread widely.\u201d",

        "title": "Europe threatens to restrict vaccine exports after AstraZeneca and Pfizer hit production problems",
        "body_text": "London (CNN Business) The European Union is calling out vaccine makers AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) over delivery delays that could slow its recovery from the pandemic. Officials are even threatening to restrict exports and take legal action as anger mounts.\n AstraZeneca will not be able to deliver as many doses of its vaccine as promised, according to EU officials, putting government rollout plans and the economic recovery at risk. The news comes after Pfizer said it had delivered fewer doses of its vaccine than expected last week.\n EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides on Monday expressed dissatisfaction on talks with AstraZeneca and said conversations would continue. She said the drugmaker \"intends to supply considerably fewer doses in the coming weeks than agreed and announced.\"\n European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen turned up the heat on the pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday, saying the bloc \"means business.\"\n \"Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines, to create a truly global common good. And now the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations,\" she said during a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.\n EU countries counting on the vaccines to rein in the health crisis and jumpstart their economies are now being forced to modify their plans. Italian Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri told TV channel Rai 1 on Sunday that people over 80 years old would be vaccinated four weeks later than planned as a result of the delays. The country is threatening legal action against the drugmakers.\n \"By the [fall] we could vaccinate up to 45 million Italians, but I don't believe in these companies,\" Sileri said. \"I want to see the vaccines.\"\n The European Union has ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which could be approved for use as soon as this week, with an option to purchase an additional 100 million.\n The company said that production has been hampered by a manufacturing issue.\n \"While there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,\" AstraZeneca said in a statement. \"We will be supplying tens of millions of doses in February and March to the European Union, as we continue to ramp up production volumes.\"\n The news has sent the bloc reeling, just as it was racing to assess the impact of delays announced by Pfizer. The US company said on Jan. 15 that it would deliver fewer doses than planned last week while it upgraded its manufacturing facility in Puurs, Belgium.\n The drugmaker said it would still be able to meet first quarter targets, and as a result of the changes to its Belgium plant would be able to churn out 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. That's up from the 1.3 billion it had originally estimated.\n Pfizer said Monday it would return to its original schedule of deliveries for the European Union this week.\n European governments are demanding answers, pointing out that the success of their vaccination efforts is dependent on the private sector.\n \"On the one hand we can only welcome the result of science, and on the other hand they have a monopoly and we are totally dependent,\" Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said on Saturday. \"There may be production issues, but these uncertainties and announcements make it very difficult to organize the campaign.\"\n Kyriakides said on Monday that the bloc would now demand \"full transparency concerning the export of vaccines\" from the European Union.\n \"In the future, all companies producing vaccines against Covid-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. Humanitarian deliveries are of course not affected by this,\" she said on Twitter.\n German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that the controls were not about putting the \"EU first\" but about making sure Europe got its fair share.\n \"In my view it makes sense that we have an export limit, meaning that vaccines which leave the European Union have a license so that we know what is being produced, what is leaving Europe, where it is leaving so that there is a fair distribution,\" he told German broadcaster ZDF.\n Supply chain experts are much more concerned by the news from AstraZeneca than Pfizer, given the latter company's commitment to increase output soon. AstraZeneca's vaccine, developed with Oxford University, is also much easier to distribute because it can be stored at higher temperatures than the Pfizer alternative.\n A delay for a week or two \"is not a big problem,\" said Burak Kazaz, a professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. \"[Though] I certainly understand that a delay means lives.\"\n The scope of the problems facing AstraZeneca, which appear more serious, would become clear in the coming weeks, he said.\n Delays from both firms are a sign that there are still kinks in the supply chain that need to be ironed out as distribution ramps up, according to Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.\n \"We will have more of these ups and downs until we get to a stable process,\" Yadav said.\n Given the rocky attempts to get up to speed \u2014 and concentration of production at just a few manufacturing sites \u2014 the public should expect monthly manufacturing capacity to fluctuate for the time being, he added.\n Richard Wilding, a professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield University in England, noted that there are at least 50 items necessary to run vaccination sites, from alcohol wipes and syringes to personal protective equipment. Supply chains for those items need to run smoothly, too.\n Crucially, the delays aren't just a problem for Europe.\n \"The price will be paid by developing countries who don't have access yet, because their deliveries may be delayed further down the line,\" Yadav said.\n \u2014 James Frater, Chris Liakos, Amanda Sealy and Stephanie Halasz contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler pepper-sprayed a maskless man who accused him of disregarding coronavirus measures",
        "body_text": "On Sunday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler was walking outside a craft brewery on the Oregon city\u2019s southwest side when a man walked up to him and shouted, \u201cThanks for ruining the city!\u201d\n Moments later, the Democratic mayor blasted the man in the eyes with pepper spray.\n \u201cOh my God!\u201d the man cried in an audio recording of the encounter published by the Willamette Week. \u201cWow ... I can\u2019t see. The mayor has just thrown something at me.\u201d\n The encounter between Wheeler and the unidentified man was recorded by former Portland mayor Sam Adams, who later told police that the man, who was unmasked, had accosted them on the street with a video camera.\n Tim Becker, a spokesman for the mayor\u2019s office, told The Washington Post in an email Monday that Wheeler is cooperating with police \u201cand encourages others involved to do the same.\u201d Adams declined to comment.\n The incident comes after a turbulent year for Portland\u2019s mayor, who in July, was tear-gassed by federal agents while attending racial justice protests. He was later forced to move out of his condo in September after protesters broke windows and tossed a burning object inside the building. Earlier this month, Wheeler said a woman confronted him at another restaurant and later swatted him on the shoulder.\n Over the past year, Wheeler has been highly criticized by protesters over his management of police amid last summer\u2019s protest crackdowns. At one point, some urged him to resign for what they saw was an insufficient response to calls for police reform.\n He\u2019s also faced criticism for his early handling of the pandemic in the city. On Monday, the state\u2019s department of health reported 291 new coronavirus cases and three deaths in Multnomah County, the city\u2019s county seat.\n Wheeler served as Oregon\u2019s treasurer from 2010 until 2016, when he was first elected mayor of Portland. He was reelected for a second term in November.\n On Sunday night, at about 8 p.m., Wheeler was leaving McMenamins Hillsdale Brewery & Public House after dining with Adams when a maskless, middle-aged White man suddenly approached, the mayor later told the Oregon police department.\n The man, who told Wheeler he had taken pictures of him at the pub, accused the mayor of disregarding coronavirus safety measures during his meeting with Adams, Wheeler wrote in an emailed statement to police.\n \u201cHe accused me of sitting in a restaurant without a mask,\u201d Wheeler said. \"I informed him the current covid regulations allow people to take their mask off for the purpose of eating and drinking.\u201d\n The man then followed him to his car while recording with his phone, Wheeler said, and refused to back away despite Wheeler\u2019s multiple requests. He was within two feet of the mayor\u2019s face, Wheeler told police.\n That\u2019s when the mayor said he gave the man a final warning: \u201cI informed him that I was carrying pepper spray and that I would use it if he did not back off,\u201d Wheeler told police. When the man didn\u2019t comply, Wheeler said, he pepper-sprayed him in the eyes. The man, who appeared surprised, according to Wheeler, finally backed off.\n \u201cYou just pepper-sprayed me for no reason at all,\u201d the man says in the recording captured by Adams.\n \u201cActually,\u201d Adams said in the recording, \u201cI was here, and you were like a foot from him. He asked you to back away, and you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n Wheeler later described the man to the police as a White man in his 40s.\n Wheeler told police he feared the maskless man could infect him with the coronavirus, adding that he was also concerned for his personal safety following the incident where a woman allegedly smacked him in a restaurant earlier this month.\n Before leaving, Wheeler said, he threw the man a bottle of water so he could wash out his eyes.\n Hannah Knowles contributed to this report.",

        "title": "'Bizarre' dinosaur Spinosaurus behaved like a giant, flightless stork, study says",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Paleontologists have long been puzzled about how the Spinosaurus -- a giant dinosaur and aquatic predator -- would have behaved.\n Now, they believe it would have been less like an otter, and more like a huge, flightless stork or heron.\n Rather than hunting fish in the water, the massive dinosaur would have likely caught prey out of the water from a position on the shoreline, researchers from Queen Mary University of London and the University of Maryland found in a study published Tuesday.\n Spinosaurs were a group of large-bodied theropods that were bigger than both Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus, growing to around 15 meters (49.2 feet) in length. These dinos lived during the Cretaceous period -- between 145.5 and 65.5 million years ago.\n The study compared Spinosaurus fossils with skulls and skeletons of dinosaurs and reptiles that lived both in and out of the water, concluding that a wading, heronlike behavior was the most likely.\n This behavior has been debated since the Spinosaurus was first discovered in 1915.\n \"Some recent studies have suggested that it was actively chasing fish in water but while they could swim, they would not have been fast or efficient enough to do this effectively,\" lead study author David Hone, senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said in a news statement.\n \"Our findings suggest that the wading idea is much better supported, even if it is slightly less exciting.\"\n Spinosaurus has proven hard to understand because it's \"a bizarre animal even by dinosaur standards, and unlike anything alive today,\" said study coauthor Tom Holtz, a paleontologist and principal lecturer at the University of Maryland's department of geology, in a statement.\n \"We sought to use what evidence we have to best approximate its way of life. And what we found did not match the attributes one would expect in an aquatic pursuit predator in the manner of an otter, sea lion, or short-necked plesiosaur.\"\n The researchers compared Spinosaurus to crocodiles in order to illustrate its relatively poor adaptation to aquatic life.\n Crocodiles are excellent in water compared to land animals, Hone said, but they can't actively chase fish.\n \"If Spinosaurus had fewer muscles on the tail, less efficiency and more drag then it's hard to see how these dinosaurs could be chasing fish in a way that crocodiles cannot,\" Hone said.\n There remains a lot to learn about Spinosaurus, said Hone, who explained that there is a lack of good fossils.\n There is still some debate as to whether there were distinct species of Spinosaurus that preferred different environments, or a single species that adapted, Hone told CNN.\n The best way to start solving some of these mysteries is to carry out more digs, said Hone, who added that there is good Spinosaurus material in Egypt, Morocco and possibly Algeria.\n The study was published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.",

        "title": "Dwayne Johnson says late dad 'would have loved' new TV series 'Young Rock'",
        "body_text": "(CNN) NBC's \"Young Rock\" may largely be about Dwayne Johnson's good old days, but it also aims to be honest: Those days weren't all good.\n That, Johnson hopes, will inject the forthcoming sitcom about his life with an authenticity that audiences will appreciate.\n \"My life -- you know, we use these terms 'wild' and 'crazy' and those are great sizzle words that we use as we promote this thing -- but it was incredibly complicated, and it was incredibly tough growing up,\" Johnson told reporters Tuesday in a virtual news conference. \"And, you know, we specifically went with these timelines in my life that were very defining times.\"\n \"Young Rock\" focuses on three time periods -- when Johnson was 10, 15 and 18 -- as well as an alternate reality version of Johnson in 2032, when he is campaigning for president. Young actors Adrian Groulx, Bradley Constant and Uli Latukefu play Johnson -- known by his family as \"Dewey\" -- at those ages and are tasked with bringing to life stories from the superstar's past.\n The show delves into everything from Johnson's sometimes-rebellious ways to what he describes as his \"complicated\" relationship with his wrestler father, Rocky Johnson.\n A larger-than-life figure in real life and portrayed as such on screen by Joseph Lee Anderson, the WWE Hall of Famer died suddenly in January 2020 at age 75.\n \"I think really when I look back on this and I can reflect, the series has really allowed, in a way, me to appreciate those hard times that much more,\" Johnson said. \"Because through the brilliance of (executive producers) Nahnatchka (Kahn) and Jeff (Chiang), they were able to craft something that still made audiences -- I hope and I think and fingers crossed -- feel a certain way and know that we all go through these tough times.\"\n Balance was key, he said. For all the \"complications,\" as he calls them, there was \"so much good stuff\" about his past. Like a childhood with lots of travel and being surrounded by big personalities, formidable female figures and wrestling greats (many of whom are portrayed on the show).\n What Johnson is sure of, he said, is that his late father would have relished seeing the world of professional wrestling portrayed in a \"positive\" light.\n \"He would have loved this and he would have been so proud because for the first time, certainly in prime time, we are showcasing this world that he and all of his brothers of the ring, so to speak ... gave their life to,\" Johnson said. \"I know it would meant a lot to my dad.\"\n \"Young Rock\" premieres Tuesday, February 16, on NBC.",

        "title": "\u2018When covid is over\u2019 sounds like \u2018when I meet Harry Styles\u2019: The new pandemic meme, explained",
        "body_text": "\u201cWhen covid is over \u2026 \u201d\n How many times have you uttered that phrase during the past 11 or so months? We all have such grand plans, when covid is over. Some of us want to get back to packed concert halls, while others want to relax comfortably at our favorite restaurants. Some just want to be able to visit our mamas again. Whatever it is, nearly everyone has a plan for when covid is over.\n But the thing about pandemics is they tend to drag on. Though we finally have vaccines, the wait to return to normalcy can feel interminable.\n It can also bring to mind other painful waiting periods \u2014 so vividly, in fact, that in the past few days it\u2019s become a meme to compare the phrase \u201conce covid is over\u201d to other events that might never arrive.\n As YouTuber Alex Elmslie tweeted, \u201c \u2018once COVID is over\u2019 is starting to sound a lot like \u2018when i fix my sleep schedule.\u2019 \u201d\n Some users compared the feeling to things we say we\u2019re going to do \u2014 but often don\u2019t get around to.\n One tweeted, \u201c \u2018when covid is over\u2019 is starting to sound a lot like \u2018we should hang out sometime!\u2019 \" Another tweeted, \u201c \u2018When COVID is over\u2019 is starting to sound like, \u2018when I\u2019m all caught up on laundry.\u2019 \u201d\n In one particularly relatable message, comedy writer Camilla Blackett tweeted, \u201c \u2018when covid is over\u2019 is starting to sound a lot like \u2018when I lose 10lbs.\u2019 \u201d Another user suggested that the end of the pandemic is about as likely as finally making a budget.\n Others chose unlikely pop culture phenomena, such as \u201cwhen One Direction comes back,\u201d \u201cwhen grey\u2019s anatomy ends,\u201d \u201cwhen I meet harry styles\u201d and \u201cwhen black widow comes out.\u201d\n Or in a particularly spicy tweet: \u201cwhen Amy Adams gets her Oscar.\u201d She\u2019s been nominated six times, after all.\n Some compared waiting for the end of covid to hoping for new material from their favorite artists. Many people are wishing for a new album from a variety of musicians, including Paramore, Hozier, Twenty One Pilots, Rihanna and the Jonas Brothers. One \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fan tweeted that the phrase sounds like \u201conce George R.R. Martin finishes The Winds of Winter.\u201d\n Others tended toward their professional sports dreams, as in \u201cwhen the bears get a good quarterback\u201d and \u201cwhen the cowboys win the Super Bowl.\u201d\n People have long used memes to make sense of the senseless and to fight sorrow with a touch of humor, which has been especially true throughout the pandemic. One of 2020\u2032s more popular memes was a short video clip of a troupe of Ghanaian pallbearers who dance as they carry a coffin. Another, colloquially called \u201c2020 Bingo,\u201d was an image of a bingo card with (usually) horrible things listed in each little box \u2014 horrible things that actually happened, like \u201cmurder hornets\u201d and \u201cstock market crash.\u201d\n It\u2019s all a form of gallows humor, dark comedy meant to make palatable something that\u2019s too terrible to contemplate, and it\u2019s been increasingly popular online since last March.\n Still, as Quartz journalist Karen Ho said in a series of tweets, perhaps the phrase \u201conce covid is over\u201d is useful in helping us navigate utter uncertainty without losing our marbles: \u201c \u2018Once covid is over\u2019 is an optimistic but non-specific way for people to look forward to or plan for the future and try to avoid disappointment when timelines change due to various circumstances.\u201d",

        "body_text": "Washington promoted Jennifer King to assistant running backs coach Tuesday, making her the first Black female assistant position coach in the NFL.\n She is the second woman in league history to be an assistant position coach after Tampa Bay\u2019s assistant defensive line coach Lori Locust. King spent the 2020 season as a full-year coaching intern under Ron Rivera and worked with running backs coach Randy Jordan.\n Rivera said King came to Washington eager for the opportunity and is deserving of the promotion.\n \u201cThe sky is truly the limit for her,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cShe got the chance to experience not only the in-season work that goes into being a full-time coach in this league but also the countless hours that are spent preparing in the offseason, as well.\n \u201cShe demonstrated all of the qualities that are needed to work full time on my staff. She is a hard worker, a great communicator and a quality person. Coach King is always eager to learn and has shown tremendous growth since starting here last season.\u201d\n King previously interned for Rivera with the Carolina Panthers and has also been an assistant at Dartmouth College and for the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football.\n \u201cI am very pleased to have coach King back to assist me full time in the running backs room,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cShe was extremely helpful last year in seeing the game from a different perspective, and she was a tremendous communicator in our room. I look forward to continuing to collaborate as we move forward in our program and as she moves forward in her coaching career.\u201d\n Washington\u2019s playoff game\u00a0against the now-\u00a0Super Bowl-bound Buccaneers\u00a0was the first NFL playoff game to have a female coach on each sideline. Tampa Bay had two: Locust and assistant strength and conditioning coach Maral Javadifar, and coach Bruce Arians called women in coaching \u201cthe wave of the future.\u201d\n \u201cThis game, it\u2019s a tremendous game,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIt should be open to everybody in terms of opportunities to play, opportunities to coach or opportunities to lead the organization. I think that\u2019s an important message that the league is putting out there.\u201d\n ___\n More AP NFL:\u00a0https://apnews.com/NFL\u00a0and\u00a0https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "title": "John Wall gets the best of the Wizards in their first game on opposite sides",
        "body_text": "John Wall\u2019s vengeance came in front of a scattered, reduced-capacity crowd in Houston as he wore a cornflower blue uniform \u2014 one of the Rockets\u2019 alternate jerseys \u2014 instead of classic red, white or black. But for the former Wizards point guard, it mattered not how Houston\u2019s 107-88 win over Washington looked. What mattered was that it felt good.\n \u201cI just felt like the [Wizards] thought I was done, no matter how much hard work I put in over the summer; they came and watched me,\u201d Wall said on the court after the game, in contrast to General Manager Tommy Sheppard\u2019s and Coach Scott Brooks\u2019s preseason statements about how fit Wall looked. \u201cI thought they thought I was done. That\u2019s why I came out here and did what I did.\u201d\n The Wizards\u2019 first meeting with their former star was the story line that shrouded all else Tuesday night in Washington\u2019s second game after resuming its season following a coronavirus pause. There were few positive takeaways for the Wizards (3-10), who are still discombobulated and have just 11 players available. Point guard Russell Westbrook, for whom Wall was traded in December, had his highest-scoring game since Jan. 6 with 19 points on 7-for-17 shooting, but he is still slowed by a left quadriceps injury.\n Bradley Beal scored a team-high 33 points, logging his 12th 25-point game for the longest streak to start a season since Michael Jordan rattled off 16 for the Chicago Bulls in 1988-89.\n The rest was less uplifting. Washington shot 39.3 percent from the field and made just five shots on 26 attempts from beyond the arc (19.2 percent). The Wizards committed 21 turnovers, handing 24 points to the Rockets (7-9) in a game that was tinged with emotion from the start.\n \u201cI mean, we turned the ball over. One, we got to make some shots,\u201d Brooks said on a video conference call after the game. \u201cWe got a lot of looks from three \u2014 we\u2019ve got to make them; otherwise the paint is going to be crowded and turnovers are going to be there. We\u2019ve got to step up and make some of these shots so it opens up things and the defense can play us honest.\u201d\n The former dynamic duo of Wall and Beal shared an elaborate handshake before tip-off \u2014 coronavirus protocols be dammed \u2014 but there was no mistaking that Tuesday night was about revenge for the Wizards\u2019 former point guard. He said as much in an interview that aired on NBC Sports Washington before the game, stating his motivation to win was in part to make Washington look bad for trading him and a protected first-round draft pick for Westbrook.\n Wall led Houston with 24 points and was somewhat more reserved during a videoconference after the game. Describing what it meant to beat the team that drafted him No. 1 in 2010, Wall pointed out how many players the Wizards are missing and how February\u2019s rematch in the District is likely to feel different.\n \u201cIt was great. You know that team is better than what they have because a lot of guys have been out. ... It wasn\u2019t really nothing about proving nothing to me,\u201d Wall said. \u201cI know how hard I worked the last two years. I just wanted to go into this game, just play aggressive, play at a high level, get my legs back. The most important thing for me was getting the win.\u201d\n Even so, when asked what it feels like to be having fun playing basketball again \u2014 the Rockets are on a three-game winning streak \u2014 Wall quipped, \u201cTo be somewhere where you\u2019re wanted, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n Wall certainly played as if he wanted to make a fool out of his old team, whipping out some of his slickest moves. The highlight of the night came with about three minutes left in the first half. Wall brought the ball up and, with Raul Neto in his sights, took a stutter step, accelerated, moved the ball behind his back then laid it in with his left hand. When he jogged back downcourt, he did so open-mouthed \u2014 in mock awe of himself.\n Victor Oladipo and Eric Gordon each scored 20 points to back him up.\n \u201cI\u2019m always happy for him, back on the floor and just showcasing he\u2019s healthy, getting back to playing the game he loves and having fun,\u201d Beal said of his former backcourt-mate. \u201cBut it definitely felt weird playing against him. At the same time, it\u2019s kind of like \u2014 we\u2019re both competitors. It was almost like a practice setting: We\u2019re just going at it, he\u2019s going hard, I\u2019m going hard. It is definitely weird, being on that other side, but I\u2019m happy for him. He played a great game tonight.\u201d\n Washington hung with the Rockets, even during an abysmal third quarter in which both teams looked exhausted and played sloppily, until the Rockets reeled off a 14-4 run that carried into the start of the fourth.\n The Wizards lost control completely after trailing 85-79; Wall was called for a charge that was overturned after a coaches\u2019 challenge, and he completed a three-point play.\n \u201cI thought that was a charge, but they said he was moving,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI trust [the officials].\u201d\n A three-pointer from Oladipo completed an 8-0 run that put the Rockets up 14 and effectively sealed the win with more than five minutes to play. Seconds later, Westbrook and Wall were each assessed technicals after jawing at each other.\n The loss aside, Tuesday wasn\u2019t all bad news for the Wizards. Deni Avdija, Davis Bertans, Troy Brown Jr., Rui Hachimura, Ish Smith and Moritz Wagner remain ineligible to play amid the NBA\u2019s coronavirus protocols, but Brooks said before the game that four players have begun working out individually and \u201ca couple\u201d could be ready to return by Friday against Atlanta. First, Washington visits New Orleans on Wednesday night.",

        "title": "Former Army secretary says DC National Guard had no plan ahead of Capitol riot beyond local traffic control",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told a House panel on Tuesday that the National Guard only planned to deal with traffic in Washington, DC, the day the deadly US Capitol insurrection occurred, with \"no contingency\" in place if things escalated in the city, according to a copy of his prepared testimony obtained by CNN.\n But McCarthy also told Congress that alternate plans would only have happened if the US Capitol Police or local authorities in Washington requested it.\n \"114 citizen soldiers ... were spread out over 20 city blocks ... with no contingency or recall plan for a change of mission in place,\" his statement reads.\n A relatively small number of guardsmen were in DC on January 6 to assist the city's police force with traffic control in an effort to allow the local authorities to focus on anything related to demonstrations planned in the city. McCarthy's statement underscores the lack of preparedness on the part of the government and federal law enforcement agencies to aggressively respond to a crisis that day, which ultimately saw a violent attack on the Capitol that resulted in the death of five people, including a US Capitol Police officer.\n The comments from the former official come the same day acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman told the same committee that the \"department failed to meet its own high standards\" on January 6. Pittman, who apologized on behalf of her department, also told the panel the department was aware of a \"strong potential for violence\" targeting Congress and did not take the appropriate steps to prevent it.\n Maj. Gen. William J. Walker, the commanding general of the Washington National Guard, meanwhile, is claiming his authority was restricted by the Department of Defense before the Capitol riot, a move he says prevented his forces from arriving to the attack sooner than they did, The Washington Post reported earlier Tuesday.\n Walker told the Post that authority he usually has to dispatch troops in dire situations as well as other powers were stripped from him ahead of the riot. That meant \"he couldn't immediately roll out troops when he received a panicked phone call\" from the US Capitol Police chief warning him that a crowd of then-President Donald Trump's supporters were about to breach the iconic building in an attack.\n \"All military commanders normally have immediate response authority to protect property, life, and in my case, federal functions -- federal property and life,\" Walker told the Post. \"But in this instance I did not have that authority.\"\n Asked by the newspaper how quickly his troops could have been able to arrive to the Capitol, which sits near the DC National Guard's headquarters, Walker said: \"With all deliberate speed -- I mean, they're right down the street.\"\n In the days leading up to the protest, defense officials pulled Walker's ability to deploy the 40-person quick response force (QRF) on his own, requiring instead that he seek the Army secretary's approval. In a letter from McCarthy to the Department of Justice written two days before the riot, he said the QRF could only be deployed as a last resort.\n This decision was made in the days before January 6 during the planning for what was expected to be a far less violent protest. If deployed, the QRF was only able to help with traffic control and crowd management, which were the tasks approved for Guardsmen on the street.\n Walker's call with former US Capitol Police Chief Steve Sund was at 1:49 p.m. that day, according to an official timeline of events from the defense secretary, which is 15 minutes after the Army secretary spoke to the DC mayor. The DC National Guardsmen who were already on the streets for traffic control were pulled a short time later to refit with riot gear.\n On Monday, Walker acknowledged that he does not have the authority to deploy troops on his own, even with a direct request from the mayor's office.\n \"Since I've been in charge, we've been very responsive to (DC Mayor Muriel Bowser). She provides a request, it comes to me. I conduct mission analysis. I send it to the Secretary of the Army for his approval,\" Walker said, speaking alongside the head of the National Guard Bureau Gen. Daniel Hokanson and acting Army Secretary John Whitley.\n Defense officials have acknowledged that the \"overly bureaucratic\" process required to activate and deploy the DC National Guard consumed valuable time as the riot was unfolding on Capitol Hill.\n \"There's too many people that are involved with the decision, and ultimately no one, one single person responsible,\" McCarthy told CNN last week, adding, \"It makes it very difficult and slow in the response.\"\n Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied accusations that it denied or delayed the deployment of additional troops as the riot worsened, though McCarthy said the response was hampered by an \"archaic system.\"\n The comments from Walker add to the already complicated chain of events from January 6, and could face intense scrutiny by Congress during any potential investigations into the attack and the government's preparations ahead of a rally held by Trump that day in which he, along with several others, incited the attack on the Capitol.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Ellie Kaufman, Whitney Wild, Annie Grayer and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

        "title": "US government urges Americans not to travel abroad after new testing requirement goes into effect",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) The US government is urging Americans not to travel abroad after new restrictions went into effect Tuesday requiring all passengers traveling by air to present negative Covid-19 tests taken within three calendar days of departure or proof of recovery from the virus within the last 90 days.\n \"Seriously reconsider going overseas right now,\" acting Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee told reporters on a call Tuesday. \"US citizens who choose to go abroad, whether it's for a holiday or a genuine emergency, everyone needs to be prepared to be potentially seriously disrupted in their trips.\"\n \"If you cannot easily access a Covid-19 test, or if you test positive, you will end up overseas for much longer than you planned,\" Brownlee added. \"If that happens, you will be responsible for covering your own lodging and medical costs during that time.\"\n The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions' director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Marty Cetron, said on the same call that the \"bottom-line message is this is really not a time for people to be engaging in discretionary travel, and that all travel should be postponed until we get a better handle on getting this virus under control, and accelerating our vaccination strategies.\"\n Despite the warnings, Brownlee said the State Department is not considering issuing a global Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory and will continue to issue advisories on a country by country basis. The department issued the worldwide warning against international travel last March and lifted it in August, but it said at the time that it continued \"to recommend U.S. citizens exercise caution when traveling abroad due to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic.\"\n Brownlee said Tuesday that the State Department is \"committed to helping US citizens overseas who find themselves in dire situations, but that assistance is likely to be limited.\"\n \"Our goal is to help people avoid those dire straits in the first place,\" he said. US embassies will be able to provide information about where to get medical care and Covid tests, Brownlee said, but will not provide those tests.\n The new testing requirement went into effect shortly after President Joe Biden's reinstatement of Covid-19 travel restrictions on non-US citizens who have been in Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom and much of Europe. It comes as new Covid variants have been detected in countries around the world. The CDC's Cetron noted that the US government is watching the variants \"very closely\"\n \"As these variants increase, the risks of international travel really are highlighted by the urgency that President Biden and this administration have taken to combat the virus and use all measures that we have at our disposal here,\" he said. \"As a consequence we reposted the original order that CDC issued on January 10, January 12, that came into effect today.\"\n \"Most importantly, the waiver that was initially contemplated to extend the deadline of implementation by a couple of weeks has been removed from this order, although we've specifically added a particular humanitarian emergency exemption to take into account,\" Cetron added.\n He said the decision to remove the waiver had been made because \"it was determined that we needed to bring this testing strategy into implementation rapidly today and not allow for an additional two weeks.\"\n \"Additionally, when we looked at the surges of this virus that have happened, in particular in the months before Thanksgiving and through the holiday season -- Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's -- we were just seeing surge upon surge in the virus at a time when more of the variants were proving themselves increasingly contagious,\" he said. \"And it was a combination of all these factors which led to the urgency of removing the two-week additional extension for implementation, and to move this into effect immediately at 12:01, midnight.\"\n Cetron told reporters they \"are holding daily morning operation calls with the airlines to ... get feedback on the early rollout and implementation.\" He said any issues that have come up overnight were \"anticipated\" and they \"have various hotlines that are available in order to adjudicate things that may come up in the middle of the night.\"\n Both officials suggested conversations were ongoing about possible restrictions for travel over land borders.",

        "title": "Day of Celebration or Mourning? Australia Grapples With Its National Holiday",
        "body_text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Those who celebrate Australia Day, the country\u2019s national holiday, associate it with barbecues and pool parties. But for those who protest against it, it is a reminder of the continent\u2019s brutal colonization.\n On Tuesday, tens of thousands of people marched through Australia\u2019s major cities in opposition to the holiday, which they instead refer to as Invasion Day. It is a blunt reframing of the legacy of the arrival of the British 233 years ago, which set in motion centuries of oppression of Indigenous people.\n Year upon year, these protests have grown and gained political traction, and Tuesday\u2019s were bolstered by the global Black Lives Matter movement. Here is a look at this contentious day.\n Australia Day, on Jan. 26, marks the date that a British fleet sailed into Sydney Harbor in 1788 to start a penal colony. The mariners raised a flag on land that the British described as \u201cTerra Nullius\u201d (nobody\u2019s land), though Aboriginal people had inhabited the continent for at least 65,000 years.\n The public holiday was first formally recognized in 1818, and it has been commemorated nationally since 1994. It takes place during the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer, so many Australians spend the day at the beach or with family and friends.\n Since the holiday\u2019s beginning, however, Indigenous Australians have been excluded from celebrations. In 1888, when Sir Henry Parkes, the father of the Australian federation, was asked how First Nations people might be involved, he remarked that it would serve only to \u201cremind them that we have robbed them.\u201d\n Australians who protest the public holiday argue that it not only excludes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also actively celebrates the day their land was taken.\n Since 1938, protesters have periodically commemorated the national holiday with a day of mourning. (That same year, several Aboriginal men were forced to participate in a re-enactment of the British landing.)\n Two Aboriginal activists, Jack Patten and William Ferguson, wrote at the time: \u201cWe, representing the Aborigines, now ask you, the reader of this appeal, to pause in the midst of your sesqui-centenary rejoicings and ask yourself honestly whether your \u2018conscience\u2019 is clear in regard to the treatment of the Australian blacks by the Australian whites during the period of 150 years\u2019 history which you celebrate?\u201d\n Since then, the demonstrations have involved sit-down protests, rallies and marches on Parliament House in Canberra. Protesters have called for a range of changes, from recognizing Indigenous Australians in the country\u2019s Constitution and creating a treaty between them and the Commonwealth, to reducing high rates of Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody.\n Previously, activists have pushed for changing the date of Australia Day \u2014 suggestions have included Jan. 1 (the date Australia was federated), the fourth Friday in January (because it would make for a good long weekend) or May 8 (because the abbreviation M8 sounds like \u201cmate\u201d).\n But this year, the messaging shifted more toward abolishing the day altogether.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness and growing solidarity right around the world among Indigenous people everywhere,\u201d said Lidia Thorpe, the first Aboriginal senator elected in the state of Victoria. \u201cThere is an uprising.\u201d\n On Tuesday, thousands of people took to the streets in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin and Perth in protest. They wore Aboriginal flags draped across their shoulders, chanted and held signs reading \u201cPay the Rent,\u201d \u201cAbolish the Date,\u201d and \u201cNo Pride in Genocide.\u201d\n Before dawn on Tuesday, the Sydney Opera House lit its sails with the artwork of Frances Belle-Parker, an Indigenous artist, while an Aboriginal flag was raised next to the Australian flag on Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n \u201cSolidarity is key,\u201d said Frankie Saliba, an activist, as he marched through downtown Melbourne holding a painted sign that read \u201cLandback,\u201d referring to the movement to return land to its original Indigenous owners.\n Another protester, Emily Hart, 11, said she hoped more of her peers would get involved in the protests. \u201cWe need to acknowledge this is not our land,\u201d she said.\n Though protests were largely peaceful \u2014 with masked activists marching in groups of 100 in Melbourne to adhere to social distancing rules \u2014 some protesters clashed with the police and were arrested in Sydney after coronavirus regulations were breached, leading organizers to cancel the remainder of the event.\n Organizers in Perth and Hobert said the turnout was the largest they had experienced.\n Support for the Invasion Day movement has been steadily rising, with even mainstream organizations like Cricket Australia removing the name \u201cAustralia Day\u201d from their promotional material.\n Still, less than a third of Australians say Australia Day should be moved from Jan. 26, according to a recent poll conducted by Ipsos. Australia\u2019s conservative political leaders have expressed the same view, at times minimizing the abuse of Aboriginal people.\n \u201cWhen those 12 ships turned up in Sydney all those years ago, it wasn\u2019t a particularly flash day for the people on those vessels either,\u201d Scott Morrison, the country\u2019s prime minister, told reporters last week. At a ceremony in Canberra on Tuesday, Mr. Morrison added that Australians had \u201crisen above\u201d their \u201cbrutal beginnings.\u201d\n Paul Fletcher, Australia\u2019s minister for communications, excoriated the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for including the term \u201cInvasion Day\u201d in an article headline, alongside the holiday\u2019s formal name, pushing the national broadcaster to remove the words.\n Marcia Langton, an anthropologist and professor of Indigenous studies at the University of Melbourne, called Mr. Morrison\u2019s comments \u201ccretinous\u201d and an insult to the hundreds of thousands of Indigenous Australians she and others estimate lost their lives in the decades following European settlement.\n \u201cThe arguments for Australia Day now are clearly morally and intellectually defective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a national day anymore; it\u2019s a day for division.\u201d",

        "title": "China Wanted to Show Off Its Vaccines. It\u2019s Backfiring.",
        "body_text": "China\u2019s coronavirus vaccines were supposed to deliver a geopolitical win that showcased the country\u2019s scientific prowess and generosity. Instead, in some places, they have set off a backlash.\n Officials in Brazil and Turkey have complained that Chinese companies have been slow to ship the doses and ingredients. Disclosures about the Chinese vaccines have been slow and spotty. The few announcements that have trickled out suggest that China\u2019s vaccines, while considered effective, cannot stop the virus as well as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, the American drugmakers.\n In the Philippines, some lawmakers have criticized the government\u2019s decision to buy a vaccine made by a Chinese company, Sinovac. Officials in Malaysia and Singapore, which both ordered doses from Sinovac, have had to reassure their citizens that they would approve a vaccine only if it had been proved safe and effective.\n \u201cRight now, I would not take any Chinese vaccine, because there\u2019s insufficient data,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, an influential former official at Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He added that he would consider it only with \u201ca proper report.\u201d\n At least 24 countries, most of them low and middle income, signed deals with the Chinese vaccine companies because they offered access when richer nations had claimed most of the doses made by Pfizer and Moderna. But the delays in getting the Chinese vaccines and the fact that the vaccines are less effective mean that those countries may take longer to vanquish the virus.\n Beijing officials who had hoped the vaccines would burnish China\u2019s global reputation are now on the defensive. State media has started a misinformation campaign against the American vaccines, questioning the safety of the Pfizer and Moderna shots and promoting the Chinese vaccines as a better alternative. It has also distributed online videos that have been shared by the anti-vaccine movement in the United States.\n Liu Xin, an anchor with CGTN, the state broadcaster, asked on Twitter why the foreign media had failed to \u201cfollow up\u201d on the deaths of people in Germany who had taken one vaccine \u2014 though scientists have said the people were already seriously ill. Ms. Liu\u2019s tweet was shared by Zhao Lijian, a top spokesman at China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\n George Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has questioned the safety of the American vaccines because their developers used new techniques rather than the traditional method embraced by Chinese makers.\n China had hoped its vaccines would prove it had become a scientific and diplomatic powerhouse. It remains on a par with the United States in the number of vaccines approved for emergency use or in late-stage trials. Sinopharm, a state-owned vaccine maker, and Sinovac have said they can produce up to a combined two billion doses this year, making them essential to the global fight against the coronavirus.\n Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, their doses can be kept at refrigerated temperatures and are more easily transported, making them appealing to the developing world. They have been doled out as aid to countries like Pakistan and the Philippines.\n China\u2019s campaign has been plagued with doubts, however. Many people have memories of the country\u2019s vaccine scandals. Several governments remain angry about Beijing\u2019s lack of openness about the virus in the early days of the pandemic. Its efforts at the start of last year to distribute masks and protective equipment to the West came under fire amid reports of shoddy quality and the demands by Chinese officials for public thanks.\n A YouGov survey this month of roughly 19,000 people in 17 countries and regions showed that most were distrustful of a Covid-19 vaccine made in China. The misinformation campaign surrounding Western vaccines could further undermine its image.\n The delays in shipments to places like Brazil and Turkey have been the latest hitch.\n In Turkey, the government initially promised that 10 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine would arrive in December. Only three million did in early January, according to Fahrettin Koca, Turkey\u2019s health minister. He did not explain the reason for the shortfall, which has been criticized by opposition politicians. The remaining doses finally arrived on Monday, according to Anadolu, Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency.\n In a statement, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry cited its needs at home, where the coronavirus has re-emerged.\n \u201cCurrently, China\u2019s domestic vaccine demand is huge,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile meeting domestic demand, we are overcoming difficulties, thinking and trying ways to develop international vaccine cooperation with other countries, especially developing countries in different ways, and providing support and assistance according to their needs and within our capacity.\u201d\n The sporadic outbreaks could also hinder production. Sinovac, which declined to comment, said on Friday online that it was looking for workers for a Beijing-area facility where an outbreak had frightened off potential employees.\n Countries like Turkey and Brazil are rolling out their immunization programs with a Sinovac vaccine because Western companies cannot deliver as quickly. But Brazil\u2019s efforts have been delayed as well. Eduardo Pazuello, the country\u2019s health minister, said China was not acting fast enough with the documents needed to export raw materials to Brazil.\n \u201cWe are making strong moves at the diplomatic level to find where that resistance is and solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Pazuello said at a news conference on Jan. 17.\n On Wednesday, Rodrigo Maia, Brazil\u2019s speaker of the house, told reporters that he had met the Chinese ambassador to Brazil, who \u201cmade it clear that there is no political obstacle, that it was a technical process that was delayed a little.\u201d\n Other vaccines are beginning to fill the gap. Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry announced on Thursday that a previously delayed shipment of two million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would arrive the next day from India.\n The world was also caught off guard by the disclosure that the Sinovac vaccine may not be as effective as previously thought. Earlier, officials in Turkey said trials there showed the vaccine had a 91 percent efficacy rate. In Indonesia, it was 68 percent. In Brazil, researchers initially said its efficacy was 78 percent.\n Then, on Jan. 12, scientists said it had an efficacy rate of just over 50 percent, once people who experienced mild symptoms were included. That level is a hair above the threshold set by the World Health Organization to consider a vaccine effective. In a news conference last week, Sinovac\u2019s chief executive officer, Yin Weidong, reiterated that the vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases. He said the lower efficacy rate was a result of the trial\u2019s focus on health care workers, who had a higher propensity of contracting Covid-19 than the general population.\n Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president and a critic of both China and its Covid-19 vaccines, pounced on the data. On Jan. 13, he mocked the vaccine\u2019s efficacy rate, asking a supporter: \u201cIs that 50 percent good?\u201d\n To be sure, the Chinese vaccines have a big appeal to many countries. More than 40 countries have expressed an interest in importing Chinese vaccines, according to China\u2019s Foreign Ministry. Several world leaders, including President Reccep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, have gotten a Sinovac vaccine.\n But the spotty and inconsistent disclosures about the vaccines remain a problem. Sinopharm has said a vaccine candidate made by its Beijing Institute of Biological Products arm has an efficacy rate of 79 percent, but it did not disclose crucial details. Sinopharm didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n In Hong Kong, a special administration region of China that has ordered 7.5 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, officials have not received an application for emergency distribution nor any data from the Chinese company.\n \u201cWhether it is because they are not making enough or if they have no plans to send the vaccines to Hong Kong yet, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Lau Chak Sing, who heads a Hong Kong government advisory panel on Covid-19 vaccines.\n Data disclosure has also been an issue in the Philippines, which has secured 25 million Sinovac vaccine doses. Risa Hontiveros, an opposition lawmaker, said President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s administration \u201ccontinues to cram their preference for Chinese-made vaccines down the public\u2019s throat, without emergency use approval and with inconsistent data.\u201d\n Leila de Lima, a senator and opposition leader who is in prison, expressed anger that the government was paying $61 a dose, more than double what Sinovac\u2019s partner in Indonesia is paying. The presidential palace said that that price was overstated but that it couldn\u2019t divulge the real ones because of a confidentiality agreement.\n Despite the uncertainty, many people may have little choice.\n \u201cI\u2019ll have my jab,\u201d said Kayihan Pala, a member of the Turkey Medical Association\u2019s Covid-19 monitoring board. \u201cI am waiting my turn, because there is no other option.\u201d",

        "title": "Democrats Reintroduce Legislation To 'Decriminalize Immigration'",
        "body_text": "Democrats are pushing sweeping legislation to decriminalize immigration and disrupt the \u201cprison-to-deportation\u201d pipeline.\n On Tuesday, Rep. Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) and co-sponsors Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) held a virtual press conference discussing their New Way Forward Act \u2014 originally introduced in 2019, alongside Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). It would ban for-profit immigration detention facilities, end the use of local police for immigration enforcement and decriminalize border crossings. It also would eliminate mandatory deportation, for instance in the case of people with previous criminal records, to instead allow judges to use their discretion in deciding cases.\n \u201cDecriminalizing immigration is not a radical concept at all,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cWhat is radical is caging school-aged children. What is radical is detaining thousands of refugees in dangerous conditions of squalor. We\u2019re simply asking for fair treatment.\u201d\n Within days of being in office, the Biden-Harris administration began their efforts to undo former President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant legacy by repealing the anti-Muslim travel ban and proposing that Congress pass a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people in the country.\n Jayapal, who identifies as a \u201cproud immigrant\u201d and naturalized citizen, said that while it was a \u201crelief\u201d to have Trump out of office after \u201cfour xenophobic years,\u201d it is \u201cnot enough to just reverse the hateful policies.\u201d\n \u201cAmerica\u2019s racist, xenophobic immigration system has been broken for decades,\u201d Jayapal said, citing the nation\u2019s history of separating families through deportation and considering immigration violations, like crossing the border outside a port of entry, as criminal and not civil offenses.\n \u201cThis legislation keeps families together, it advances racial justice and it protects due process for everyone,\u201d she said.\n Pressley hopes the legislation will end the \u201cprison-to-deportation\u201d pipeline, in which immigrants of color, who are stopped and arrested more often by police and given harsher sentences than their white peers, can end up in ICE detention and at times deported back to their home countries.\n \u201cFor too long our immigration and criminal legal systems have been deeply and fundamentally intertwined,\u201d Pressley said, adding that this bill package aims to create an immigration system that \u201cfinally centers the humanity of our immigrant neighbors.\u201d\n Chanthon Bun, a Cambodian refugee, told his story during the press conference. Born during the Cambodian genocide, he moved to Los Angeles as a child in 1985. At age 18, he got involved with a gang and committed a robbery and was sentenced to 49 years in prison. Last year, after 22 years incarcerated, Bun was set to be released on parole. Immigration and Customs Enforcement informed him that he would be deported upon release, back to a country he fled due to violence, where his father and other family members had been killed. It was only after protests from the local community that Bun was released without being placed in ICE custody.\n \u201cThe New Way Forward would help stop this prison-to-ICE detention pipeline and will keep families together,\u201d Bun said, who survived COVID-19 after contracting it during a massive outbreak in California\u2019s San Quentin state prison, where he was incarcerated. \u201cWhat ICE is doing now is traumatizing not just the person incarcerated, but the family and community.\u201d\n The Trump administration notoriously separated thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border in 2018 \u2014 hundreds of whom have still not been reunited. The Democrats\u2019 proposed legislation goes beyond simply stopping family separations at the border \u2014 they\u2019re pushing for the end of family separations through deportations and to allow those previously deported to reapply to reenter the U.S. and reunite with family still living here.\n \u201cAll families should be reunited whether they were separated by Trump or by deportation,\u201d Jayapal said Tuesday.\n After a judge in Texas issued a temporary halt to Biden\u2019s 100-day ban on most deportations on Tuesday, Garc\u00eda said Biden\u2019s deportation ban was \u201clegally sound, morally necessary and we\u2019re confident this enormous miscarriage of justice will be rectified.\u201d\n Asked whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) knew of their immigration bill, Garc\u00eda said the lawmakers \u201chope to earn her support.\u201d",

        "body_text": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 A city council in Maryland unanimously approved a resolution condemning former President Donald Trump for the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol, despite reservations from a Republican member who later voted with the majority.\n The Annapolis City Council passed the measure Monday night amid pushback from Alderman Fred Paone, who said while he supported some sentiments in the resolution, mentioning Trump made it \u201cpurely political,\u201d the Capital Gazette reported. He and others also had asked if the council should pass a resolution on an issue that did not directly affect Annapolis.\n The resolution\u2019s sponsor, Alderman Brooks Schandelmeier, pushed back, saying it\u2019s hard to separate Trump from what happened Jan. 6. \u201cHe was the biggest spreader of the unsubstantiated claims of the election being stolen,\u201d Schandelmeier said.\n The violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol that day in an attempt to overturn the presidential election. At least five people died, including one Capitol Police officer. Dozens of people have been charged and Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for a historic second time.\n Paone, who said Trump will \u201chopefully meet some sort of justice\u201d during a trial in the U.S. Senate, sought to remove the former president\u2019s name through a motion. That failed by a 5-4 vote, and Paone eventually sided with the majority for the final vote.\n For copyright information, check with the distributor of this item, The Capital.",

        "title": "What Biden and Congress can do to support unions",
        "body_text": "Richard Trumka is president of the 12.5 million member, 55 union AFL-CIO, America's labor federation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n At the ballot box, working people pushed America in a new direction. Two years ago, even two months ago, the idea of a pro-worker control of the US House of Representatives, Senate and White House was far-fetched. Following the victories of President Joe Biden in November and Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock three weeks ago in Georgia, that is now America's governing reality.\n Union members were a major reason these victories happened. But we know the value of these wins is in what happens after Election Day. If lawmakers don't ensure the economy works for working Americans, then what is the point?\n Amid the chaos of the Covid-19 pandemic, frontline workers are showing the world what heroism looks like. And as we confront the coronavirus with courage, big businesses and corporate executives are profiting from the service and sacrifice of American workers. Billionaires have increased their collective net worth by more than $1 trillion in the past three years. The profits these billionaires have seen could cover half the cost of Biden's bold relief package to rescue our entire nation \u2014 over 330 million people \u2014 from financial ruin.\n America's inequality crisis began long before this public health crisis, but failed leadership has deepened it. President Donald Trump lost his job and Senator Mitch McConnell lost his Senate majority because they lost control of this virus. On the verge of bankruptcy, state and local governments are cutting public sector workers from payrolls. The absence of a standard for infectious disease \u2014 a set of rules that require employers to protect workers from hazards \u2014 means employers can risk workers' lives with impunity, although Biden's executive order calling for a standard is a good first step. Food and housing insecurity is spreading just like the virus. Throw in the lack of safeguards for equal pay, fair scheduling and other long-overdue rights, and worker protections in America are among the weakest in the world.\n Sure, Trump and McConnell could have secured passage of the HEROES Act to provide relief back in May, but they shot it down. They refused to pass a dire relief package until December \u2014 after working people sent them a message with our votes, our power \u2014 and even that was a modest package.\n In the last Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the US House of Representatives passed the most significant worker empowerment legislation since the Great Depression by creating a much fairer process for forming a union. It is called the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. After an anti-worker majority blocked it in the Senate, reintroducing the PRO Act, passing it in both chambers of Congress and getting Biden's signature is vital to our economic recovery.\n The PRO Act would protect and empower workers to exercise their freedom to organize and bargain. It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after a union is recognized, end employers' practice of hiring permanent replacements to punish striking workers and finally hold corporations accountable by strengthening the National Labor Relations Board and allowing it to impose penalties on employers who retaliate against collective bargaining. It would also repeal so-called \"right to work\" laws, which make it harder for working people to form unions and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.\n Democrats can't afford to leave workers out to dry and repeat the missed opportunities of previous administrations and congresses. Workers know that too many Democratic candidates in the past were quick to cash our checks and court our votes, but they postponed our priorities \u2014 especially labor law reform \u2014 when they assumed power. This time must be different.\n The PRO Act is a generational opportunity that will transform America's labor landscape and marshal economic recovery for working people. Unions bargain for higher wages and better health care, and help ensure a more secure retirement. For instance, 79% of union members have access to defined benefit pension plans as opposed to 17% of non-union workers.\n The PRO Act is more than labor law reform, it's also civil rights legislation. We secure contracts that protect workers who have to care for a loved one and ensure our workers' voices are heard as technology evolves. We also defend women, people of color, LGBTQ people and people with different abilities from discrimination.\n The PRO Act is also an economic stimulus bill. Unions give more of us the collective power to win better pay and safer working conditions, putting additional money in workers' pockets, driving demand and creating jobs. And research from MIT shows nearly half of non-union workers \u2014 nearly 60 million people \u2014 would vote to join today if given the opportunity.\n I was in the meeting where Biden, just days after he was elected, looked a group of CEOs in the eye and said that in his administration, \"unions are going to have increased power.\" The CEOs just nodded, completely shocked to hear such a clear pro-worker message directly from an incoming president. Biden, who proudly calls himself \"a union guy,\" rightfully pointed out that worker power is \"not anti-business. It's about creating economic growth [and] creating good-paying jobs.\"\n I could not agree more, Mr. President. And that's why we need to make the PRO Act the law of the land.",

        "title": "Widespread Internet Outages Hit Northeast U.S.",
        "body_text": "Internet users across the northeast U.S. experienced widespread outages for several hours Tuesday, interrupting work and school because of an unspecified Verizon network issue.\n \u201cAn internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved,\u201d said spokesman Jim Greer in an emailed statement Tuesday afternoon. He said service levels \u201care returning to normal\u201d and the company is investigating what happened. The service interruptions were unrelated to a cut fiber in Brooklyn, New York, which caused problems for people in the area.\n There are about 6.5 million Fios internet customers.\n People posting on Twitter reported having issues connecting with various online services in the region stretching from Washington to Boston. That densely populated area includes key U.S. government services as well as major financial companies such as Fidelity Investments.\n Disruptions to internet services are always a hassle, but have become even more excruciating as the pandemic forces millions of people to work from home and students to attend school remotely.\n Diana Gaspar\u2019s daughter in New York couldn\u2019t connect to her online classroom because their home internet was spotty for a couple of hours in the afternoon, although her daughter was able to log in with Gaspar\u2019s phone.\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t see it as a major issue,\u201d Gaspar said. \u201cThe only inconvenience was me not having my phone.\u201d\n For the Fairfax County Public Schools in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, teachers and students found workarounds, such as switching to another instruction platform if one wasn\u2019t working, said spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell.\n At Galvin Middle School in Wakefield, Massachusetts, a suburb north of Boston, teachers sent students pen-and-paper assignments if there were internet problems, said Trish Dellanno, reached at the school by phone. \u201cTeachers have been able to keep on moving. They\u2019re going old school.\u201d\n The outage affected internet and cloud providers as well as major sites such as Google and Facebook. Amazon, whose web services division powers a wide ranges of online services, indicated its network wasn\u2019t the cause of the problem and that connectivity issues for its Amazon Web Services customers were resolved around 12:45 p.m., after an hour and a half. Google said it also had not found issues with its own services and was investigating.\n The East Coast outages began at 11:25 a.m. local time and recovery began at 12:37 p.m, according to Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network monitoring company. He reported a 12% drop in traffic volume to Verizon.\n Madory said he did not yet know if other carriers were impacted. Comcast, another major internet service provider, said it had not observed problems with its network Tuesday. AT&T did not immediately reply to questions.\n Cary Wiedemann, a network engineer who had connectivity problems at his home in Northern Virginia, said that some online services could have been disrupted even if your home internet still worked, if the issue was with the backbone of Verizon\u2019s network.\n \u201cIf Outlook works but YouTube doesn\u2019t, whose fault is it? Verizon\u2019s fault. But that\u2019s not obvious from the onset,\u201d he said.\n ___\n This story has been revised to correct the spelling of the network monitoring company Kentik.",

        "title": "Coronavirus vaccination appointments canceled in D.C. region as health officials confront scarce supply",
        "body_text": "Prince George\u2019s County closed coronavirus vaccination appointments to nonresidents on Monday, and Inova Health System canceled thousands of appointments for Fairfax County teachers as providers across the Washington region scrambled to compensate for a limited supply of vaccine doses.\n Prince George\u2019s halted vaccination appointments for nonresidents who were eager to get the shot wherever it was available. County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) said the county canceled the appointments after hearing from residents who were unable to secure a time slot amid growing competition for doses.\n The situation underscored the difficulty that localities and health departments face in balancing the ballooning eligibility pools while not having enough vaccine to go around. Local governments began the week pleading for more doses to meet the demand.\n Inova late Monday said it canceled scheduled vaccinations for teachers and staff members in Fairfax County Public Schools \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The decision affects at least 15,000 school district employees \u2014 roughly 60\u00a0percent of its workforce \u2014 all of whom registered for doses under the 1B phase of Virginia\u2019s vaccine rollout.\n Inova, which has been administering the Fairfax school district vaccinations, said in an email to school staff members that a national vaccine shortage prompted the Virginia Department of Health to direct vaccine doses away from hospitals, leaving its supply \u201cseverely diminished.\u201d\n \u201cWe understand and share the frustration that this news brings to our patients,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe are working diligently to identify new supply.\u201d\n The roughly 7,000 Fairfax schools employees who already received their first shot of the two-dose regimen will still receive their second vaccination, officials said.\n Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington on Friday canceled 10,000 vaccination appointments, citing the same change in the state\u2019s allocation system. Arlington will reschedule those, but appointments for second doses will not change, the hospital said in a statement.\n D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on Monday received her first dose of vaccine as part of a broader push to bolster public trust in its efficacy. The District will receive 14,376 doses this week, but the city\u2019s health director, LaQuandra Nesbitt \u2014 who wore a mask Monday that read \u201cDC needs more vaccine\u201d \u2014 said doses remain in short supply.\n Maryland officials said Monday that the state opened eligibility to three times as many people as the current supply could accommodate as part of a strategy to quickly administer doses. Montgomery County began allowing residents 75 and older to register for vaccination appointments on Monday, said Health Officer Travis Gayles, while officials also petitioned Gov. Larry Hogan (R) for more doses from the state.\n As more people slowly get vaccinated, infection rates have continued to hover at elevated levels.\n The first case of the virus variant found in Britain was discovered in a Northern Virginia resident who has not recently traveled, the state announced Monday. The development came days after Maryland confirmed its first two cases of the variant, which officials say is more contagious but not necessarily more deadly than the original virus.\n The Virginia Department of Health declined to say where the newly infected person lives or release details about the case.\n In Prince George\u2019s, Alsobrooks said Monday that health officials decided to cancel appointments after hearing from county residents in priority groups 1A and 1B who were unable to get appointments and then seeing how many appointments had been filled by nonresidents.\n \u201cWe share those concerns,\u201d she said at a news conference. \u201cI apologize.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. We had to ensure that equity occurred in terms of the delivery of the vaccine in our community.\u201d\n Alsobrooks said canceled appointments are being filled by seniors who live in the county who have preregistered and others who work in the county and fall into the 1A and 1B categories. She said that she understood there would be disappointment from those with canceled appointments but that the priority of health officials must be county residents.\n Those who received their first dose of the vaccine in the county will be able to receive their second dose, Alsobrooks said, even if they are not residents. Under the new guidelines, people must bring proof of residency or information that shows they work in Prince George\u2019s to make their inoculation appointment.\n Alsobrooks encouraged residents who fall into the 1C category \u2014 which includes those 65 and older \u2014 to fill out registration paperwork, but she said it could be weeks before they begin receiving vaccinations.\n Alsobrooks also announced Monday that indoor dining will be allowed to resume beginning Friday, at 25\u00a0percent capacity. She said health officials decided to end the ban because of improved metrics, including a positivity rate below 10\u00a0percent.\n In Montgomery County, people 75 and older who filled out the county\u2019s preregistration form should expect to receive an email from the county this week inviting them to set up an appointment, Gayles said. Teachers, child-care providers and other groups under the state\u2019s 1B categorization still have to wait, he said.\n \u201cWe respect that other counties are moving quicker at their own pace, [but] we\u2019re moving as fast as we can with the doses we\u2019ve received,\u201d Gayles said.\n The county government has received 31,200 vaccine doses, which is not enough to cover the 60,000 people in group 1A, much less the 75,000 others in group 1B, officials have said. Those allocations do not include what has been given to the county\u2019s hospitals and nursing homes.\n In a news conference Monday, county lawmakers called on the Hogan administration to provide more vaccine doses to Montgomery, the state\u2019s most populous jurisdiction.\n Council President Tom Hucker (D-District 5) said state officials caused confusion and panic among Montgomery residents by announcing that the state would expand eligibility to priority group 1C this week. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the doses to do that,\u201d he said of the county.\n Frederick County also announced Monday that it would not yet broaden access to the vaccine, saying it is still focused on inoculating health-care workers and people 75 and older.\n The decisions at the local level leave scores of people otherwise eligible to receive the vaccine unable to make appointments, including some people in priority groups 1B and all of 1C \u2014 a population that covers teachers, child-care workers and people ages 65 to 74.\n Top Maryland officials acknowledged Monday that people such as teachers will have to \u201ccompete\u201d with seniors for limited vaccine appointments.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very competitive,\u201d acting health secretary Dennis Schrader told a panel of state senators.\n Schrader said his personal preference would have been to let more people in group 1B, which includes people 75 or older and teachers, to get vaccinated before expanding eligibility further. But, he said, \u201cthe federal government forced our hand a little bit.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. They insisted that [people aged] 65 and older should be put in the mix.\u201d\n Schrader said the imbalance between demand from eligible residents and insufficient supply is likely to make it difficult to obtain appointments for weeks.\n Maryland has received 667,275 doses, but, as of Monday, roughly 2.1\u00a0million people are eligible to get a shot. Statewide, 330,709 first doses have been administered, and 42,228 people are fully vaccinated.\n In Virginia, 458,472 first doses have been administered, and 64,381 people are fully vaccinated. The state has distributed about 1.1\u00a0million doses.\n Of the 68,750 vaccine doses distributed in the District, 51,421 have been administered.\n The District will receive 8,776 additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 5,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine this week, Bowser and Nesbitt said during a news conference.\n The city is in its Phase 1B Tier 2 group, which includes teachers and some essential workers. Nesbitt said the city needs more vaccine doses to reach everyone in the group, calling the city\u2019s current allocation \u201cdismal.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d appreciate an amplification of this message, which is that we simply do not have enough vaccine,\u201d she said.\n D.C. public school teachers will begin receiving vaccinations this week, Bowser said, and about 70\u00a0percent of the 3,900 slots for those teachers have been filled. The city\u2019s Fire and EMS workers and D.C. police began receiving vaccinations, while seniors and health-care workers can continue to register. Nesbitt said the latest group includes officials in the \u201csuccession plan for government\u201d \u2014 a group of 50 government employees that includes the mayor.\n Bowser, who said she hates needles, made a point to say the vaccine was safe and implored residents to remind their friends and family who are 65 and older they are eligible to receive it.\n Bowser sat with her eyes closed as a nurse administered her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at Kaiser Permanente Capitol Hill Medical Center. Afterward, the mayor raised her arm in triumph, and relief.\n \u201cThat wasn\u2019t bad at all,\u201d she said with a laugh.",

        "title": "Jameson Taillon Is a Whole New Pitcher. He\u2019s Ready to Prove It.",
        "body_text": "The pitcher the Yankees acquired in a recent trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates is still known as Jameson Taillon. He still stands 6 feet 5 inches and he still throws with his right arm. But he is not the same pitcher he was when he last took the mound.\n Taillon\u2019s last appearance came in May 2019, and ended with an elbow injury. His surgeon, Dr. David Altchek, expected to repair Taillon\u2019s flexor tendon, but when the pitcher awoke, Altchek told him it had been worse than originally thought. Taillon had received Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career.\n Taillon, still in recovery, resolved that day to become a new pitcher.\n \u201cI kind of had like a coming-to-grips moment where I said, \u2018My current set of mechanics and what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t working,\u2019\u201d he said in a conference call with reporters on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s just the cold, hard truth. I need to change something or else my career is going to be over.\u201d\n Taillon had what he called a \u201cvillage\u201d of colleagues and supporters: the Pirates\u2019 medical and training staff and the team\u2019s pitching coaches, as well as visits to the Florida Baseball Ranch, a facility in Lakeland, Fla., that uses diagnostics to improve health and performance. Over time, the pitcher refashioned his windup and delivery.\n He has yet to pitch in a game since his surgery in August 2019, but in trading for him, the Yankees showed faith that he would be as good as he was before, if not better. That is why they were willing to send four minor leaguers to the Pirates on Sunday for Taillon, who is 29, but has thrown only 466 innings in the major leagues.\n Taillon declared that he was healthy and would be ready for spring training, whenever it starts. He has been throwing off a mound with the goal of preparation, not rehabilitation. He is expected to join a Yankees rotation that will include Gerrit Cole, Taillon\u2019s friend and former roommate with the Pirates, and Corey Kluber, a two-time Cy Young Award winner who agreed to join the Yankees on a one-year deal for roughly $11 million. The rotation is filled out by Deivi Garcia and Jordan Montgomery. That would seem to eliminate the need for Masahiro Tanaka, 32, a free agent.\n Taillon (pronounced tie-OWN) made seven starts in 2019, and was 2-3 with a 4.10 earned run average. In four seasons with Pittsburgh, he was 29-24 with a 3.67 earned run average.\n Those numbers came in Taillon\u2019s time as a pitcher with a long, whippy arm motion. Just the sight of his old motion is enough to turn his stomach.\n \u201cI hate seeing videos of the way I used to throw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt disgusts me. I love where I\u2019m at now.\u201d\n The goal of his mechanical renovation was to take pressure off his elbow by using more leg thrust and shortening his arm path. It took time, he said, but he has adopted the new approach and says it not only protects his elbow, but it has also changed \u2014 and, perhaps, improved \u2014 the action on several of his pitches.\n Taillon said that he now had more spin on his fastball and that his cut fastball had evolved into more of a true slider. He has found his sinker to be less effective, but he still relies on a sloping curveball, having discovered a comfortable grip on his evolving changeup, which gives him the potential for at least five pitches.\n \u201cHealth is the main goal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think performance will be a really good byproduct of it.\u201d\n As a home experiment last week, Taillon executed his old windup in his house, he said, and found the motion \u201cforeign,\u201d an indication of how entrenched his new mechanics had become.\n He underwent his first Tommy John surgery as a minor league pitcher in 2014. He recovered from testicular cancer in 2017 and still made 25 starts that year. Then, while recovering from his second reconstructive elbow surgery in 2019, he drew inspiration from his friend and former teammate Daniel Hudson, who was on the mound when the Washington Nationals clinched the World Series that year.\n Hudson also had two Tommy John surgeries, and Taillon was in Houston watching Game 7. Taillon said he grew emotional seeing Hudson prove it was possible to succeed after two such procedures. Now, in pinstripes, Taillon could inspire other pitchers, too.\n \u201cThe goal was never to be a role model or inspiration for other players who have endured two Tommy John surgeries,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if I could prove to people that, hey, the second Tommy John fits me and made me healthy. Why can\u2019t I be better than before, if I\u2019m actually healthy now, which I feel like I am.\u201d\n In a trade between rival clubs, the Yankees sent relief pitcher Adam Ottavino and the minor league pitcher Frank German to the Boston Red Sox, for either a player to be named later or cash considerations. Ottavino pitched two seasons for the Yankees and was the first Yankee to wear No. 0.\n The last time the division rivals exchanged players was when the Yankees picked up Stephen Drew from the Red Sox for Kelly Johnson in July 2014.",

        "title": "Watergate inspired movies. The Trump era history will likely be told on TV",
        "body_text": "(CNN) \"Frontline\" closes out its stellar work during the Trump presidency with \"Trump's American Carnage,\" a documentary charting the chaos and discord that characterized Donald Trump's time in the White House, methodically charting crises from his first days in office through the violent insurrection at the Capitol.\n Even now, as new stories come out, there's a temptation to think about how those \"scenes\" will play in the movie. But the real future for dramatizing the Trump years likely resides in the former President's preferred medium, TV.\n For those who have been paying close attention -- and a lot of people were -- there does seem to have been a certain inevitability to Trump's tenure ending as tumultuously as it began. As New York Times reporter Peter Baker says in \"American Carnage,\" the events that unfolded in January were \"mind-boggling ... and yet, wholly predictable.\"\n The well-documented arc of those years -- already presented in numerous bestselling books and documentaries and one scripted miniseries, \"The Comey Rule\" -- underscores why the pop-culture aftermath of the Trump years probably won't resemble the last administration to which the Trump scandals have often been compared, Richard Nixon's.\n Nixon's resignation in 1974 yielded the blockbuster book, \"All the President's Men,\" and a movie adaptation two years later. It also triggered what amounted to a golden age for paranoid conspiracy thrillers in the latter half of the 1970s, movies like \"The Parallax View\" and \"Three Days of the Condor.\"\n The entertainment world, however, moved at a different pace back then. There wasn't real-time reporting on the internet or streaming channels to pounce on a story as juicy as this one. Even the TV miniseries was still in its infancy, before \"Roots,\" in 1977, demonstrated its colossal ratings power.\n The end of the Trump years, by contrast, has had to compete in our imaginations with over-the-top portrayals of Washington, from \"House of Cards\" to \"Veep\" to the presidential corruption featured in \"24\" and \"Homeland.\"\n Cultural critics and Hollywood creative types have joked about the Trump administration giving those writers a run for their money, \"They're either taking from our show or doing their own version of it,\" \"Veep\" executive producer David Mandel told Politico.\n The HBO series was hardly alone in its cynical view of politics. The movie business, meanwhile, has significantly changed in terms of the kind of films that reliably attract audiences and has been damaged to a still-unknown degree by the fallout from the coronavirus.\n The 1970s movies mentioned above, along with similar titles like \"Marathon Man\" and \"Capricorn One,\" were hits in their day but would be hard-pressed to compete with the blockbuster-driven world of superhero sequels, \"Star Wars\" and the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise.\n Inevitably, the Trump years will still be dissected and dramatized. The first exposure for most of those projects, though, will likely be in living rooms, catering to smaller audiences.\n Writing in Esquire, Chris Nashawaty noted that films in the 1970s reflected the anxiety of the times, when \"messy truths weren't dismissed as bitter medicine and box-office poison.\" While TV has filled \"that vacuum\" for such fare, he lamented that the movie business no longer possesses much appetite for it.\n In \"American Carnage,\" the narration describes the Trump presidency and its violent end as \"a crisis in plain sight for his party, his country, democracy.\" Those elements certainly provide the stuff of great drama, with various books already painting vivid portraits of what transpired behind the scenes.\n Yet while stories of the Trump years will be told and retold, as opposed to the post-Watergate movies, look for them on HBO or streaming or expanded into four-part docuseries and multi-episode limited series. Indeed, there are already plans for one of the latter about the UK response to coronavirus, with Kenneth Branagh cast as Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n That approach might deprive future generations of the memorable theatrical movies that Watergate helped inspire. But in terms of how and where we get our entertainment now, it's very much a sign of the times.\n \"Frontline: Trump's American Carnage\" premieres January 26 at 10 p.m. ET on PBS.",

        "body_text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged coordinated global action on Monday to build an alliance against the growth and spread of neo-Nazism and white supremacy and the resurgence of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and hate speech sparked partly by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The U.N. chief also urged international action \u201cto fight propaganda and disinformation.\u201d And he called for stepped up education on Nazi actions during World War II, stressing that almost two-thirds of young Americans do not know that 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust.\n Guterres spoke at the annual Park East Synagogue and United Nations International Holocaust Remembrance Service marking Wednesday\u2019s 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, held virtually this year because of COVID-19.\n He said the pandemic \u201chas exacerbated longstanding injustices and divisions\u201d\n \u201cPropaganda linking Jews with the pandemic, for example, by accusing them of creating the virus as part of a bid for global domination, would be ridiculous, if it were not so dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the latest manifestation of an anti-Semitic trope that dates back to at least the 14th century, when Jews were accused of spreading the bubonic plague.\u201d\n The secretary-general said it\u2019s sad but not surprising that the pandemic has triggered another eruption of Holocaust denial, distortion and minimizing history.\n \u201cIn Europe, the United States and elsewhere, white supremacists are organizing and recruiting across borders, flaunting the symbols and tropes of the Nazis and their murderous ambitious,\u201d he said. \u201cTragically, after decades in the shadows, neo-Nazis and their ideas are now gaining currency,\u201d\n Guterres said U.S. authorities have warned that neo-Nazis are on the rise across the country and around the world. In some unnamed countries, he said, neo-Nazis have infiltrated police and state security services and their ideas can be heard in debates of mainstream political parties.\n \u201cThe continued rise of white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology must be seen in the context of a global attack on truth that has reduced the role of science and fact-based analysis in public life,\u201d he said.\n Guterres said fragmentation of the traditional media and the growth of social media are contributing to the absence of shared facts.\n \u201cWe need coordinated global action, on the scale of the threat we face, to build an alliance against the growth and spread of neo-Nazism and white supremacy, and to fight propaganda and disinformation,\u201d he said.\n Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor, warned that \u201cif we do not carry the tragic lessons of history, they are doomed to be repeated.\u201d\n \u201cThis guiding principle \u2015 memory not amnesia \u2015 is a moral imperative to quell the rise of hate, which is greater today than at any time since the end of World War II,\u201d he said.\n Schneier said Nazi swastikas are again defacing synagogues and cemeteries in France, Germany and most recently Montreal, and among those storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 were people wearing shirts saying \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d and \u201c6MWE\u201d \u2015 short for \u201cSix Million Wasn\u2019t Enough.\u201d\n \u201cChildren are not born with hatred; they are taught how to hate,\u201d the 90-year-old rabbi said. \u201cHolocaust education in schools is a must.\u201d",

        "title": "Deborah Birx said Trump was being given \u2018parallel data\u2019 on covid-19",
        "body_text": "As the previous administration\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Deborah Birx provided President Donald Trump with hard numbers to guide the fight against the pandemic. But all along, she said, Trump was receiving different statistics from someone else.\n \u201cSomeone out there, or someone inside, was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president,\u201d she said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI know what I sent up, and I know that what was in his hands was different.\u201d\n The 79-minute sit-down interview was Birx\u2019s first since formally exiting her role advising the Trump administration. Birx told host Margaret Brennan that she \u201calways\u201d considered quitting her job, during which she alternately drew criticism from other scientists and Trump.\n She said she will probably retire from her job at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within weeks after helping the Biden administration with its transition.\n Birx, a well-regarded HIV researcher, was selected by Vice President Mike Pence last February to serve as his \u201cright arm\u201d leading the administration\u2019s chaotic response to the pandemic.\n But even after she arrived at the White House and briefed Trump on the growing threat to the country, Birx said he continued receiving \u2014 and passing on \u2014 \u201ca parallel data stream coming into the White House that were not transparently utilized.\u201d\n \u201cI saw the president presenting graphs that I never made,\u201d she said.\n Birx added that she believed at least some of the data had been funneled along by Scott Atlas, then a White House coronavirus adviser. He was widely rebuked for playing down the pandemic despite having no infectious-disease or public health background.\n In an email to The Washington Post early Monday, Atlas said that any data he passed on to Trump was \u201cdirectly from the CDC, [Department of Health and Human Services] and ongoing scientific literature,\u201d and he maintained that listening to \u201cadditional scientists outside the administration\u201d is \u201cthe way to arrive at the best policies.\u201d\n Anecdotes like those from Birx could be a preview of the disclosures still to come from other former Trump officials, who were tasked with battling a pandemic that has now killed more than 418,000 people in the United States.\n The New York Times on Sunday published an interview with Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease specialist, in which he noted that he and his family began facing harassment and death threats as early as March.\n \u201cOne day I got a letter in the mail, I opened it up and a puff of powder came all over my face and my chest,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was very, very disturbing.\u201d\n While a security detail sprayed down Fauci\u2019s office to get rid of the powder, which ended up being a \u201cbenign nothing,\u201d the 80-year-old seemed to suggest that whatever was inside could have easily killed him.\n \u201cIf it was ricin, I was dead, so bye-bye,\u201d he said. (On several occasions, envelopes containing that lethal powder were intercepted before reaching the White House or other government officials.)\n As the pandemic shut down the country last March, Fauci and Birx rapidly became the faces of the government response, appearing in daily news conferences alongside Trump, Pence and other top officials. While Birx put her support behind the administration and for a time received praise from Trump, the president criticized Fauci from the get-go for contradicting his efforts to play down a growing death toll.\n Fauci, in his interview with the Times, noted that while he remained in his day job leading the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, \u201cBirx had to live with this person in the White House every day. So it was much more of a painful situation for her.\u201d\n He faced repeated criticism from the president for going against the White House\u2019s efforts to tamp down the virus, noting that Trump sometimes called him to \u201cexpress disappointment\u201d about these conflicts. Despite the pressure, he said he never thought about quitting his post.\n \u201cI always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I wasn\u2019t very effective in changing everybody\u2019s minds, the idea that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing back on it, I felt was important.\u201d\n Birx expressed more hesitations about her tenure, telling Brennan that she wishes she had been \u201cmore outspoken publicly\u201d on matters such as coronavirus testing.\n \u201cI always feel like I could have done more. \u2026 I didn\u2019t know all the consequences of all of these issues,\u201d she said.\n After the Associated Press reported last month that she had traveled to her Delaware vacation home over Thanksgiving, flouting public health warnings against such trips, she announced she would retire from her position at the CDC.\n Well before that, however, she had anticipated that her role at the White House would be the final chapter of her career in the federal government.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t go into something that\u2019s that polarized and not believe you won\u2019t be tainted by that experience,\u201d she said.\n Meryl Kornfield contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Song Yoo-jung, South Korean Actress, Is Found Dead at 26",
        "body_text": "A 26-year-old actress was found dead on Saturday in Seoul, South Korea, the latest loss of a young performer in the country\u2019s entertainment industry, which has faced a reckoning over the mental health burden on its glamorous stars.\n The death of the actress, Song Yoo-jung, who appeared in several television dramas, was confirmed in a statement by the company that represented her, Sublime Artist Agency. The agency did not disclose the cause, but the suddenness of Ms. Song\u2019s death brought to mind the series of suicides that has plagued Korean pop music in recent years.\n Alarms have long been raised over the pressures imposed by South Korean management companies on young entertainers, many of whom are groomed starting as teenagers to be pop idols. Their looks are closely scrutinized, and their tightly choreographed lives are often broadcast on social media platforms that expose them to both adulatory fan mail and hateful comments.\n For many, their time in the limelight is limited, if they ever reach star status. By their late 20s, some are considered replaceable.\n A number of the K-pop stars who have taken their own lives spoke of struggles with their mental health and the toll of cyberbullying. Ms. Song, an up-and-coming actress, had not mentioned publicly any such issues.\n Ms. Song began her acting career at 20 and appeared in commercials for Est\u00e9e Lauder skin care products and for the ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins. In her breakout role in 2019, Ms. Song played a fresh-faced architecture student with a pixie cut, searching for her soul mate, in a web series called \u201cDear My Name.\u201d She also acted in music videos.\n She was an advocate for people with disabilities, serving as ambassador for a South Korean group called Warm Accompaniment.\n Ms. Song\u2019s agency called her \u201ca great actress who performed with passion.\u201d It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n The problem of suicide in South Korea is not restricted to the entertainment industry. The country has the highest suicide rate among the 37 developed nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n But celebrity suicides, involving actors and others, have been a fixture in the South Korean news media over the past decade or more. In recent years, attention has fallen most sharply on deaths in the K-pop industry, one of the country\u2019s most successful cultural exports.\n In 2017, a singer, Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself at 27 after leaving a note saying that he had been overcome by depression.\n In 2019, Sulli, a 25-year-old K-pop star, took her own life after she had complained about the relentless cyberbullying she faced upon joining a feminist campaign that advocated not wearing bras.\n About six weeks later, her friend Goo Hara, 28, also killed herself, leaving a handwritten note about her despair.\n Ms. Goo had tried to reason with online critics, asking them to refrain from vicious comments.\n \u201cPublic entertainers like myself don\u2019t have it easy \u2014 we have our private lives more scrutinized than anyone else and we suffer the kind of pain we cannot even discuss with our family and friends,\u201d she wrote.\n If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.",

        "title": "Mother heard gunshots before finding 22-year-old son fatally wounded in Southeast D.C.",
        "body_text": "Edward Wade got his coffee from a corner store on Good Hope Road in Southeast Washington on Monday morning but wanted something else. He headed across the street to another market as his mother waited for him in her car.\n The moment he disappeared inside, Christine Wade heard gunshots. She ran into the store to find her 22-year-old son dying. Police said four other men were wounded in the shooting just before 9\u00a0a.m. at the market in the heart of Anacostia.\n \u201cI can\u2019t even describe it,\u201d Christine Wade, 39, said later, noting her son had graduated from Anacostia High School and was attending college in Richmond. \u201cI was numb. I was just rubbing his head and touching his neck to see if had a pulse.\u201d\n Edward Wade died in the store as his mother watched and police and paramedics arrived.\n The shooting occurred in the 1400 block of Good Hope Road, one of the main streets cutting through the Anacostia community, in an area filled with shops and eateries.\n Acting D.C. police chief Robert J. Contee III, who went to the scene, said it appears multiple people opened fire.\n One person was taken to a hospital in an ambulance, and three others showed up at emergency rooms on their own. Authorities said the four wounded men suffered injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening.\n Contee said investigators were looking for a white two-door Honda Accord with a sunroof, as well as four people of interest.\n Police said Monday night that Terrance Oxner, 21, of Manassas  was arrested and charged with murder. They said they were still investigating.\n The motive for the shooting was not known Monday, and Contee said it was not immediately clear whether any of those shot were deliberately targeted. The chief also said some shots might have been fired outside the market.\n The fatal shooting was the 12th homicide in D.C. this year, compared with nine at this point in 2020, which ended with nearly 200 killings, the most in the city since 2004. Violent crime is up 14\u00a0percent compared with the same period in 2020.\n Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), speaking at her regular Monday news conference, noted the uptick in crime and called it \u201cjolting to all of us.\u201d\n Wade had been attending Virginia Union University in Richmond, majoring in mass communications, and wanted to join the military as a Marine. Classes are being conducted virtually because of the pandemic.\n The university president, Hakim J. Lucas, said in a statement that the campus \u201cextends condolences\u201d and offered \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to Wade\u2019s family.\n Christine Wade said her son, who is survived by 10-year-old twin brothers, grew up in Anacostia and was known for his \u201clovely spirit\u201d and his outgoing personality.\n She said early in high school, he was having trouble in English class and was given an opportunity to boost his grade by writing a play. His script with an anti-bullying theme was judged among the best, and he performed his play at a theater in front of a live audience.\n Community activist Ron Moten said he worked with Edward Wade for years, beginning in his early teens at Anacostia High, where Wade stepped forward to pull in his friends to help quiet beefs brewing between his neighborhood and others around Southeast.\n During his years of attempts to broker truces, Moten said, he often sought out leaders in neighborhoods and Wade matched that description, a young man \u201cwho didn\u2019t run his mouth all the time.\u201d But if he felt strongly about something, Moten said, he did not hesitate to speak up or take action.\n And Moten said Wade had a strong mother who was active in his life, pushing him toward doing the right thing. He noted the play Wade wrote, set in Columbia Heights, saying it showed Wade\u2019s creativity and potential.\n \u201cThis one hurts because this young man had so much talent,\u201d Moten said. \u201cHe was brilliant. He was the kind of guy who would rise to the occasion.\u201d",

        "body_text": "Video games entered mainstream culture decades ago, but these days, gamers are more like celebrities, with millions of fans online. That means, among other things, that the days of gamers wearing jorts and oversize T-shirts are long past. Esports athletes and streamers alike now dress with urban panache mixed with opulent sensibilities.\n The result is a mix of luxury brand worship, Korean streetwear, video game fantasy and Japanese \u201ckawaii\u201d culture.\n Major brands have taken notice. Tyler Blevins, the mega-popular video game streamer known as Ninja, signed a deal with Adidas and released a limited edition run of \u201cnight joggers,\u201d which sold out almost immediately. Gucci partnered with the London esports team Fnatic on a $1,600 dive watch. Louis Vuitton teamed up with League of Legends, the most popular esport in the world, for a limited run of capsules and shirts. And the designer Jeff Staple, often credited with kick-starting the collectible sneaker revolution, worked with the Overwatch League on a line of jerseys.\n \u201cI feel that while streetwear was rising, gaming culture was also rising,\u201d Mr. Staple said. \u201cIn 2018, when Overwatch League first reached out, that\u2019s when the paths started to cross.\u201d\n Gaming accessories too are style. Players can be seen wearing large headphones with keyboards sticking out of their backpacks. HyperX creates a popular line of gaming headsets. Its ambassadors include the singer Post Malone, JuJu Smith-Schuster of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Daigo Umehara, the Street Fighter champ.\n For their fans, players display a wide array of styles, from a team-branded hoodie to a camo jacket to Pok\u00e9mon cosplay. We spoke to three players about how they think about their appearance: an influencer, a pro gamer and an amateur gamer.\n I see many streamers and esports athletes dying their hair in nonnatural colors. Why?\n Whether it\u2019s your hair or accessories, it really becomes part of your branding and, in essence, iconic to who you are. So for example Ninja: It\u2019s the blue hair. For me, it\u2019s become kind of curly wavy brown hair and wearing a headset, almost all the time.\n In regard to accessories, what do you like to wear while you stream?\n It\u2019s more about what kind of accessories you don\u2019t want to wear. For example, I found that I don\u2019t usually wear earrings or bracelets much because earrings really get in the way of your headset and it can kind of hurt. And bracelets get in the way of your armrest on your gaming chair.\n Streetwear is especially popular in gaming and esports circles. Why?\n It\u2019s still something that you feel comfortable in. You can dress it sort of up or sort of down. That aspect of comfort is really important when you\u2019re sitting down for six plus hours on your PC chair.\n What streetwear brands are you wearing right now?\n I love Prix. I\u2019ve always really enjoyed some nice athleisure \u2014 if you would consider an Adidas or Nike a kind of streetwear. And one of my all-time favorite stores is called Maniere De Voir.\n Is there pressure for women who stream to want to look cute, and does that come at odds with comfort?\n I think because no brands are specifically targeting that \u2014 clothing that\u2019s comfortable to sit in or walk around in \u2014 athleisure seems to be what everybody defaults to because there isn\u2019t another option. Adidas, Nike and especially Lululemon.\n With Twitch having a largely male audience, is there more demand to wear sexier outfits? Does that clash with your more modest look and how do you navigate that?\n I think there\u2019s a desire for both, to be honest. There are people that will ask you to wear more revealing clothing, but then if you decide to, there are people that will comment rude things. I found that it\u2019s best to just do what you want and what makes you comfortable.\n How has the pandemic affected your style?\n Initially, quarantine didn\u2019t impact my style too much since I\u2019ve always worked from home. However, I\u2019ve recently started reaching for the pieces I\u2019d usually save for special outings, and wearing them at home just to spice things up and put them to use until it\u2019s safe to go out again.\n What are you wearing here?\n I wore a part of my collection, which is the hoodie, and I just put on a pair of jeans and some white shoes to go with it. I\u2019m a very simple guy when it comes to clothes.\n What was your goal with this collection?\n I just wanted something that looks good that anybody can wear out in the open, no matter what the age is. I wanted something that people can wear to school that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cgamer.\u201d\n What do you mean by \u201cscream \u2018gamer\u2019\u201d?\n Like a team name maybe. Or like a bunch of sponsored jerseys, stuff like that. I wanted something more, like everyday wear that people can wear to work or wear to school or wear around the office.\n Is there anything wrong with clothing that screams \u201cgamer\u201d?\n Absolutely not. It\u2019s just, for me, not everybody knows much about gaming, so I just think having something that\u2019s more versatile that anybody can wear would be really cool. But obviously I\u2019m a gamer, so having a little bit of gaming twist to it.\n What things are integrated into clothing for gaming purposes?\n Hand warmers are a big thing. So having a nice hoodie pocket or having nice pockets like that can keep your hands warm in between matches.\n And why are hand warmers important?\n The venues are always really cold. So having hand warmers on deck, just holding between matches keeps your hands nice and warm and loose.\n You have a custom PlayStation 4 controller made by Scuf Gaming. Explain the importance of having a custom controller.\n It\u2019s a comfort thing. They do little things that help your game. They give you a really good grip on controllers. The smart triggers and smart bumpers, which I think is like the most important thing. They\u2019re just more responsive than a regular controller.\n You grew up in Cranford, N.J., and now you represent the New York Subliners. How important is your image?\n It\u2019s pretty important to me. I always want to rep the team that I play for just because I\u2019m proud of it.\n Have you changed your look in the pandemic?\n Not really, just like to change styles depending on what\u2019s hot and what season it is.\n Explain your get-up with the camo jacket.\n I decided to pick up that jacket simply because it\u2019s something a little bit different but not too flashy. I tend to not wear a ton of print varieties of colors, but I think camouflage is something that\u2019s not really worn too much anymore.\n And what are these necklaces?\n One, a skull, and the other one is a pendant of a lion. They add a little bit of flair to whatever you\u2019re wearing and it does add a sense of personality to your outfit. I think one of them in specific looks like an esports team logo, Houston Outlaws.\n And then the rest of your ensemble?\n So starting with the shoes, I\u2019m wearing the Adidas Yeezy Boost Pirate Black. I think they stand out. Fairly simple because they\u2019re all black, as well as the Levi\u2019s 501 original fit men\u2019s jeans.\n You\u2019re wearing HyperX headphones, and HyperX has landed endorsement deals with major athletes and gamers. Is that why you chose them?\n I think HyperX makes a lot of audio devices with better quality and a little bit more comfort as well as with just a cleaner look.\n What about the keyboard you\u2019re using?\n The keyboard is a Ducky One 2 Mini. It is a 60 percent keyboard, meaning that it\u2019s traditionally smaller than most keyboards also comes with less keys, so the arrow keys are actually also the I, J, K and L keys. I hopped on this hype train where the player Tfue had been using this keyboard. I thought it was really cool.\n As you build up your presence, you gain more clout. And with clout comes a greater adherence to your personal image and brand. How does fashion play into all of that?\n With clout, you have more people looking at you, you have more people idolizing you. If you don\u2019t have a sense of fashion, then you could be seen as almost like a nerd. But in a way, it changes how people look at you, it makes them think whether you\u2019re cool or not.\n How has your style changed during lockdown?\n Since quarantine, I have been going for a much more comfortable look yet with a skater aesthetic. I think the best thing about dressing this way is that it doesn\u2019t have to be super expensive. Finding clothes, with most places being closed and mainly being inside most of the time, there\u2019s lots of time to shop online.",

        "title": "Earth is now losing 1.2 trillion tons of ice each year. And it\u2019s going to get worse.",
        "body_text": "Global ice loss has increased rapidly over the past two decades, and scientists are still underestimating just how much sea levels could rise, according to alarming new research published this month.\n From the thin ice shield covering most of the Arctic Ocean to the mile-thick mantle of the polar ice sheets, ice losses have soared from about 760 billion tons per year in the 1990s to more than 1.2 trillion tons per year in the 2010s, a new study released Monday shows. That is an increase of more than 60 percent, equating to 28 trillion tons of melted ice in total \u2014 and it means that roughly 3 percent of all the extra energy trapped within Earth\u2019s system by climate change has gone toward turning ice into water.\n \u201cThat\u2019s like more than 10,000 \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 lightning strikes per second of energy melting ice around-the-clock since 1994,\u201d said William Colgan, an ice-sheet expert at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. \u201cThat is just a bonkers amount of energy.\u201d\n There is good reason to think the rate of ice melt will continue to accelerate. A second, NASA-backed study on the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, finds that no less than 74 major glaciers that terminate in deep, warming ocean waters are being severely undercut and weakened.\n And it asserts that the extent of this effect, along with its implications for rising seas, is still being discounted by the global scientific community.\n Failing to fully account for the role of ocean undercutting means sea-level rise from the ice sheets may be underestimated by \u201cat least a factor of 2,\u201d the new paper in the journal Science Advances finds.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like cutting the feet off the glacier rather than melting the whole body,\u201d said Eric Rignot, a study co-author and a glacier researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California at Irvine. \u201cYou melt the feet and the body falls down, as opposed to melting the whole body.\u201d\n \u201cI think this is an example that the current projections are conservative,\u201d Rignot said. \u201cAs we peer below we realize these feedbacks are kicking in faster than we thought.\u201d\n Together, the two studies present a worrying picture.\n The first finds that the current ice losses, which are accelerating quickly, are on pace with the worst scenarios for sea-level rise put out by the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That expert body found that ice sheets could drive as much as 16 inches of sea-level rise by 2100.\n But on top of that, the new NASA work on Greenland suggests that the IPCC, whose sea-level projections have long been faulted as being conservative, could underestimate future sea-level rise if the panel, which has a new report expected later this year, does not take full account of the power of the ocean to knock the ice backward and undermine it.\n The first study, in the journal The Cryosphere and led by University of Leeds researcher Thomas Slater, is basically an enormous work of accounting. It tallies losses from the vast Greenland ice sheet, to the jagged peaks of the Himalayas and then southward to Antarctica during the 23-year period from 1994 through 2017.\n Not all the ice the planet has lost translates directly into rising seas. For instance, 7.6 trillion tons, the largest single total, comes from the melting of the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, which does not raise seas at all. Nor do the 6.5 trillion tons subtracted from Antarctic ice shelves, as those, too, were already afloat.\n Still, the loss of floating ice paves the way for the unlocking of ice on land in Greenland and Antarctica, where 99 percent of all the planet\u2019s fresh water sits in frozen form, crushing down the invisible landforms beneath it. Greenland and Antarctica together have lost 6.3 trillion tons since 1994, the research finds, leaving out the past three years, which would surely add at least another trillion on top of that.\n So far, the world\u2019s mountain glaciers have actually been keeping pace with the ice sheets, losing 6.1 trillion tons of ice over the same time period and thus adding roughly the same amount to sea level. Over time \u2014 probably starting right around now \u2014 the polar ice sheets will begin to massively outdistance the losses from mountain glaciers and become the dominant drivers of global sea-level rise.\n \u201cIt is no surprise that the ice on our planet is melting,\u201d said Robin Bell, an expert on the polar ice sheets at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \u201cWe have turned up the temperature, and just like you can watch an ice cube in your glass melt on a hot summer day, our actions are melting our planet\u2019s ice.\u201d\n The question now becomes: Just how fast will climate change lead to the melting of the biggest and thickest ice, the ice atop Greenland and Antarctica?\n That\u2019s where the results of a six-year NASA campaign to study the influence of warming ocean waters on the melting of Greenland\u2019s glaciers have some unsettling news.\n Together with the University of Leeds study, the NASA research helps show why global ice loss is likely to further speed up as global warming continues. One of the main mechanisms causing Greenland\u2019s glaciers to flow faster into the sea, unlocking inland ice and allowing it to slide toward the coast as well, is the encroachment of warm water underneath the ice in the many deep fjords of coastal Greenland.\n Scientists have observed accelerating ice loss in nearly every sector of the Greenland ice sheet. While researchers have suspected that warming ocean waters, rather than increasing air temperatures alone, may be behind the melting of glaciers in typically frigid northwest Greenland, for example, the evidence had previously been lacking.\n The new study, led by glaciologist Mike Wood, also of UC-Irvine and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, relies on measurements taken via hundreds of instruments deployed by aircraft and ships for the past six years, revealing the shape of the land that lurks under the ice where 226 glaciers terminate in the sea, as well as the temperature structure of waters coming into contact with the ice.\n Glaciers that flow into Greenland\u2019s deepest fjords are losing the most ice, Wood said. The 74 glaciers situated in deep, steep-walled valleys accounted for nearly half of Greenland\u2019s total ice loss between 1992 and 2017, the study found. Greenland is now the largest contributor to global sea-level rise.\n \u201cIn these deep fjords, warm water lurks hundreds of feet below the ocean surface, melting the glaciers from below,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWhen those warm waters become even warmer \u2014 a phenomenon we saw through the early 2000s \u2014 the melt increases, causing the glaciers to recede, become unstable and lose ice.\u201d\n The science produced by the six-year field campaign, known as Oceans Melting Greenland, may force modelers to rethink their estimates for future ice loss, not just in Greenland but also for glaciers where similar dynamics are at work in Antarctica, such as in the West Antarctic ice sheet.\n The NASA-led research shows that the undercutting of glaciers by relatively mild ocean waters explains why so many of Greenland\u2019s glaciers have sped their movement into the ocean, adding to sea-level rise, while some others have not accelerated as much.\n In many coastal locations, relatively mild, salty waters sit below a layer of colder, fresher water in glacial fjords. These mild waters are coming into contact with the base of glaciers, where ice meets bedrock, which destabilizes the ice.\n \u201cA large amount of a glacier\u2019s stability depends on ice at its base,\u201d Wood said. \u201cRemove it and you destabilize the whole thing, like Achilles\u2019 heel.\u201d\n At the same time, during the summer months, meltwater from inland areas can flow all the way to the base of glaciers that end in the sea and pour into the fjords. This fresh water can drag some of the heavier, warm water toward the surface, accelerating melting further.\n The NASA data shows that the shape of the land undergirding glaciers and the water temperatures in coastal areas help determine the rate of Greenland\u2019s ice loss, but this information isn\u2019t being translated yet into projections for sea-level rise.\n \u201cVery few ice-sheet models include that ice process at the frontal margin with realistic forcing,\u201d Rignot said. If models were to include undercutting, their estimates of sea-level rise from the faster loss of coastal glaciers could be up to twice what they are now, the study shows.\n \u201cI think that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Rignot said. \u201cYou have to account for ocean temperatures in fjords and undercutting. If it\u2019s not in your model, you won\u2019t get the prediction right.\u201d\n The Greenland results add urgency for research into the mechanisms that are destabilizing ice in Antarctica, where melting from warming oceans coming into contact with the base of glaciers is the main contributing factor, rather than increasing air temperatures.\n \u201cBecause scientific progress is so often built small step on top of small step, I am not surprised by their findings,\u201d Twila Moon, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., said of the Greenland results. Moon was not involved in either study. \u201cBut their results are still devastating, further confirming that we are losing ice both from a warming atmosphere and from a warming ocean.\u201d\n \u201cIce loss is not a process that will stop itself,\u201d Moon said. \u201cWe humans are the ones with our hand on the climate control knob, and our decisions are the most important in determining the future of Greenland ice.\u201d",

        "title": "Pepsi bets on plant-based snacks with Beyond Meat",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Beyond Meat and PepsiCo are combining forces to develop and distribute snacks and drinks made with plant-based protein as the plant-based trend gains even more traction.\n With Pepsi, Beyond Meat \u2014 which already makes plant-based alternatives to beef and pork \u2014 will have access to a global distribution and marketing powerhouse. That means Beyond Meat will be able to enter more categories and bring new products to market more quickly, according to a Beyond Meat spokesperson. The US joint venture may include a future expansion into China  and the United Kingdom, the spokesperson added. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.\n The news prompted a surge in Beyond Meat (BYND) stock. Shares closed up about 18% Tuesday.\n Pepsi's marketing prowess could also get more people to try Beyond Meat's product.\n \"Historically, [Beyond's] marketing spend has been nominal (primarily social media),\" UBS research analyst Erika Jackson wrote in a note on Tuesday. Pepsi could help push that marketing to a new level, and bring more customers into the fold.\n For PepsiCo (PEP), the partnership is a way to get a piece of the plant-based protein pie.\n \"Consumer demand for plant-based products is large enough to make an impact in sales, as the plant-based alternative industry continues to grow,\" said Ramsey Baghdadi, consumer analyst at data and analytics company GlobalData, in a statement Tuesday. \"PepsiCo's decision to widen its existing selection of plant-based snacks will be a game changer in the long-term, as more consumers naturally gravitate towards the trend.\"\n Other consumer packaged goods companies have entered the market with acquisitions and new lines. Nestl\u00e9 (NSRGY) sells plant-based meat through Sweet Earth, a vegetarian food company it acquired in 2017. And Kellogg (K) sells plant-based meat through its Incogmeato brand.\n PepsiCo often sets up partnerships to help establish itself in attractive segments, UBS's Jackson noted. For example, PepsiCo and Starbucks (SBUX) have partnered for years on ready-to-drink coffee beverages.",

        "title": "Fact-checking 7 statistical claims from Biden's (quite factual) economic speech",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden recited a flurry of figures in a Friday speech in which he urged Congress to pass the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package he calls the American Rescue Plan.\n We fact-checked many of the statistical claims Biden made in the speech -- and found Biden was highly factual, though there are some nuances worth noting. Here's an assessment of seven of the claims we looked into:\n Biden noted that his plan includes funding for local governments to keep critical public employees on the job; his predecessor Donald Trump and other Republicans resisted this kind of direct aid to state and local governments. Biden said: \"Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns.\"\n Biden's claim is based on official federal data about people employed in \"local government education.\" That data does indeed show a loss of more than 600,000 jobs -- 681,400 jobs, specifically -- between January 2020 and December 2020. (The data for the month of December is preliminary and might be adjusted later.) It's worth noting, though, that these numbers count everyone who is employed by local educational institutions -- including such people as cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and students who are on the payroll for various reasons -- so \"educators\" shouldn't be interpreted to mean teachers specifically.\n Biden said, \"All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the Black community by one third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent.\"\n Among other assumptions, the scholars assumed an average of 6% unemployment for 2021. That's plausible -- the December rate was 6.7%; the Federal Reserve expects a decline to 5.0% in 2021. \"These estimates are totally reasonable,\" Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, said of the numbers Biden cited. Strain added: \"The Biden plan has several provisions that would substantially increase the incomes of low-income households. You would expect this to have a significant impact on child poverty rates, and the estimates produced in this report are very reasonable.\"\n Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, said \"their assumptions seem reasonable and they are known for doing careful analysis.\"\n You can click here for a summary of what is in Biden's plan. It includes additional direct payments, increased unemployment benefits, billions in rental assistance and food assistance, billions for child care, an increase to the child tax credit, and an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour.\n Biden touted an executive order that seeks to ensure people can still receive unemployment benefits if they turn down a job offer because they think the job will put them or their families at risk from Covid-19. He said, \"Right now, approximately 40 percent of households in America have at least one member with a pre-existing condition.\"\n A Gallup poll in November found that 48% of respondents said they or a family member living with them had a pre-existing condition, Gallup told CNN. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in 2019 that 45% of non-elderly families had at least one non-elderly adult member with a pre-existing condition. If you include people age 65 and older in the analysis, Cox noted, the figure would be even higher.\n Speaking about the US coronavirus crisis, Biden said, \"We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000.\"\n There were more than 413,000 US coronavirus deaths as of the day Biden spoke, according to Johns Hopkins University data. A model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation now projects a total of 569,000 deaths by May 1, and there will almost certainly be additional deaths after that date. Marc Lipsitch, epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Biden's statement is \"a reasonable projection.\"\n Touting his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour from the current $7.25 per hour, Biden said, \"No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line.\"\n The CBO said families below the poverty line under current law would see a 5.2% average increase in income because of the increased minimum wage, while families above the poverty line under current law would see an average 0.1% reduction in income (in part because of a reduction in business income). The CBO added: \"In an average week in 2025, the $15 option would boost the wages of 17 million workers who would otherwise earn less than $15 per hour. Another 10 million workers otherwise earning slightly more than $15 per hour might see their wages rise as well. But 1.3 million other workers would become jobless, according to CBO's median estimate.\"\n Though the overall economic impact of a federal minimum wage increase is complicated to assess, it's easy to understand the basics of how it would improve the outlook for some workers. The weighted average 2019 poverty threshold for a family of four was $26,172. At the current $7.25 per hour federal minimum wage, someone would be more than $11,000 below that poverty threshold even if they worked 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year. Making $15 per hour, that person would exceed the threshold if they worked 44 weeks a year.\n \"So as a labor standard -- yes, a $15 minimum wage could be accurately described as getting most families over the poverty line if they are working full-time year round,\" said Jeannette Wicks-Lim, associate research professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n Wicks-Lim noted that there are nuances here. Some people have part-time work hours, part-year employment or bigger families; the cost of living varies widely by location, but the official poverty line doesn't adjust for this fact; exceeding the poverty line may mean only someone has \"escaped severe deprivation,\" she said, not that \"they are able to sustain a decent living standard.\"\n Biden said, \"We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. One in seven households in America -- one in seven -- more than one in five Black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat.\"\n Between December 9 and December 21, 14% of adults, 24% of Black adults and 21% of Latino adults reported that they often or sometimes did not have enough to eat in the last seven days.\n Biden's plan includes a variety of measures intended to address hunger, including an extension, through September, of a 15% increase in food stamp benefits that Trump signed into law in December. The extension is currently scheduled to expire at the end of June.\n Biden said, \"Approximately 14 million Americans -- 14 million -- have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction.\"\n The bureau's experimental survey for December 9 to December 21 found that 10.1 million renters lived in households that were not caught up on rent. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank, came up with the 14 million figure by adjusting the Census Bureau data to account for the fact that many renters did not respond to the survey.\n CNN reported in December that investment bank and advisory firm Stout had found that more than 14 million American households were at risk of eviction at the time. The Census Bureau survey found that 5.2 million people said it was either very likely or somewhat likely they would have to leave their home due to eviction in the next two months.\n Biden's rescue package would provide $25 billion in rental assistance for low- and moderate-income households who have lost jobs during the pandemic (in addition to the $25 billion Trump approved in December). Another $5 billion is directed toward helping struggling households pay utility bills. And an additional $5 billion is for states and localities to assist people at risk of experiencing homelessness.\n Separate from the rescue package that must be approved by Congress, Biden took executive action on his first day in office to extend, through the end of March, pandemic moratoriums on many evictions and foreclosures. The moratoriums approved by Trump had been scheduled to expire at the end of January.\n CNN's Katie Lobosco and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Douglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator. Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n (CNN) Republican Sen. Rob Portman's retirement announcement caught Washington DC by surprise. Portman, who won reelection in Ohio in 2016 by 21 points, was seemingly not on anyone's radar for potential retirement.\n This is bad news for Republicans. Not merely because defending an open seat is more difficult than when an incumbent, especially a popular one like Portman, is running for reelection, but also because the departure of smart conservative workhorses like Portman leaves extreme candidates more likely to win a primary.\n If they win, the party is changed for the worse. And if they lose, those extreme candidates still tend to define how the Republican Party is perceived.\n That perception reflects a longtime trend.\n 2010 was a great year for Republicans. They gained more than 60 seats in the US House of Representatives and six US Senate seats. But two  congressional candidates, both unsuccessful, planted the seed that Republican candidates were increasingly outlandish in their performance and beliefs. That seed grew.\n In Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, a Tea Party-backed Republican Senate candidate, was forced to go on the defensive in an effort to explain her earlier remarks about \"dabbl[ing] into witchcraft.\" Instead of focusing her attacks on her opponent, Democrat Chris Coons, she was running an infamous ad that began, \"I am not a witch.\"\n Meanwhile, in Nevada, Tea Party-supported Sharron Angle emerged from a crowded GOP field only to have her campaign against a potentially beatable Democrat, Harry Reid, sidetracked with her strange claims that some American cities were governed by sharia law (Islamic religious law) and her avoidance of the press -- in part, because of her odd statements.\n In 2012, Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin, a candidate running against the vulnerable Democrat, Claire McCaskill, found himself on the defensive over comments about women's bodies supposedly blocking pregnancy after what he called \"legitimate rape.\" Akin apologized, but later unapologized, and McCaskill won the election by some 15 points.\n Akin practically had an ideological soulmate in Indiana's GOP Senate nominee, Richard Mourdock, who, in addition to questioning the constitutionality of Medicare and Social Security -- popular programs among seniors, the most reliable of voting blocs -- also made controversial comments about abortion. Specifically, he said God \"intended\" rape pregnancies. Though Mourdock later apologized for the \"misinterpretation\" of his comments, the damage was done. In another blown opportunity for Republicans, Democrat Joe Donnelly won election.\n What these candidates all have in common is not simply costing the GOP winnable US Senate seats. It's that they began to define the party in the run up to former President Donald Trump's rise.\n In 2010, O'Donnell became a household name and laughingstock. In 2012, Republican candidates throughout the country were taken off their messages as Democrats effectively nationalized the Akin and Mourdock comments, causing Republicans yet more problems with women voters.\n While these candidates shared a willingness to stoke anger and use fiery rhetoric, they did not have Trump's command of media or ability to dominate the political conversation.\n Which brings us back to the Portman retirement. Along with Portman, Sens. Richard Burr and Pat Toomey are retiring in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, respectively. And Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey says he won't run for US Senate in 2022.\n It's possible Republicans might nominate Trump loyalists Rep. Jim Jordan to replace Portman and Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, to replace Burr. Meanwhile, the Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, another Trump supporter, may run in the US Senate race in Arizona, in which Democrat Mark Kelly will be up for reelection. Not to mention that Trump's former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, announced Monday she was running for governor of Arkansas -- and received the former president's endorsement shortly after.\n Win or lose -- and, to be clear, Ward, who has already lost two Republican primaries, could certainly lose again -- these candidates would further define the GOP as the party of Trump even as the former president's popularity has dropped following the insurrection he inspired. For the Republicans who hoped to put Trump in rear view mirror, this could spell disaster.\n State parties may not care. Indeed, by attacking fellow Republicans, party officials in places like Arizona, Oregon and Virginia scare away potential moderate Republican voters who do not subscribe to Trumpism. Through censure and resolutions, these officials seek to cast out any Republican they view as not sufficiently loyal to the former President.\n This was misguided enough during the Trump years. Traditionally, parties have believed it is important to grow their base -- not shrink it through loyalty tests. But as the GOP continues to go further down the road of tribalism, mistaking Trumpian tactics and controversy for long-term strategy, they risk further electoral and policy losses.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden announced a series of measures on Tuesday aimed at ramping up coronavirus vaccine allocation and distribution, including the purchase of 200 million more vaccine doses and  increased distribution to states by millions of doses next week.\n With those additional doses, Biden said there would be enough to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans -- nearly the entire US population -- by the end of summer or early fall.\n He described efforts to combat Covid-19 as a \"wartime undertaking.\"\n \"We now have a national strategy to beat Covid-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it is detailed,\" he said.\n As part of the new efforts announced Tuesday, the US will buy 100 million more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 100 million more from Moderna -- the two-dose vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer and Moderna are working to step up production, and Biden said that the additional doses will be available this summer.\n The new purchase will increase the planned Covid-19 vaccine supply from 400 million to 600 million, an official told reporters on a call on Tuesday ahead of Biden's remarks.\n The President also took action on Tuesday to increase the weekly vaccine supply to states, tribes and territories -- upping the current 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses weekly. Additionally, the White House will be providing three week vaccine supply look-ahead reports to states as opposed to one week look-aheads.\n Biden's Covid coordinator, Jeff Zients, informed governors on a call Tuesday afternoon that Covid vaccine allocations for states would increase by around 16% starting next week.\n A White House document explaining the move says the Biden administration is committing to maintaining this as the minimum supply level for the next three weeks.\n The new efforts come one day after the President said he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day, which is a notable increase from the administration's previously stated target of 1 million per day. The President said that the US could surpass that initial target in about three weeks, and said that he thinks anyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get it by this spring.\n Biden's official goal on administering vaccines still remains 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office, multiple White House officials told CNN, after Biden raised the new 1.5 million doses a day aspiration. That initial goal is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses.\n There have been about 22.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered to Americans as of Tuesday afternoon, according to data provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n About 3.3 million Americans have received two doses of a vaccine as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the CDC.\n The President said Monday that the key factors involved in ramping up vaccinations are having enough of the vaccine, syringes and other necessary equipment and people administering them.\n The vaccine supply and the question of whether there will be enough doses to go around has been a key concern for the Biden administration, CNN has reported.\n Biden signed an executive order on his first full day in office to ramp up supplies for vaccinations. The order was part of a series of actions Biden took that day to address the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to devastate the nation and has claimed the lives of more than 421,800 Americans as of Tuesday afternoon.\n The Biden administration believes it did not inherit a working federal coronavirus vaccine distribution plan from the Trump administration.\n \"The sad part is the last administration didn't leave anything, didn't leave a plan,\" Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond said on CNN over the weekend.\n Before taking office, Biden was openly critical of what he described as a \"dismal\" rollout of the Covid vaccines under President Donald Trump.\n CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Oklahoma is trying to return its $2 million stockpile of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug once touted by former President Donald Trump \u2014 despite limited medical evidence \u2014 as a promising treatment for COVID-19.\n A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter confirmed to HuffPost on Tuesday that Hunter\u2019s office had been asked by the state\u2019s Department of Health to help them offload the hydroxychloroquine stash. Oklahoma\u2019s The Frontier was the first to report the news.\n Oklahoma came under scrutiny last year for its order of 1.2 million hydroxychloroquine pills \u2014 about 100,000 doses \u2014 from FFF Enterprises, a private medical supply wholesaler based in California.\n As The Associated Press noted in April, at least 20 other states also ordered the drug after Trump\u2019s promotion of it, but the vast majority of them obtained the medication through donations. Only Utah and Oklahoma chose to shell out their own money to buy the drug, AP said.\n Utah spent $800,000 on its hydroxychloroquine stockpile, but the state promptly canceled its order after facing backlash for the purchase. Oklahoma, however, defended the acquisition, with the state\u2019s then-secretary of health saying that the money would not go to waste because hydroxychloroquine \u201cis useful for any number of ailments.\u201d\n Trump last year repeatedly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment \u2014 even after multiple clinical trials found the drug to be an ineffective treatment for the virus and the Food and Drug Administration cautioned people against using the drug outside of a clinical setting because of its myriad side effects.\n According to The Frontier, Oklahoma is now seeking to return its hydroxychloroquine stockpile to FFF Enterprises.

        "title": "Democrats stunned by briefing on Capitol's security before insurrection: 'It was only by pure dumb luck' more weren't killed",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Members of Congress were left stunned during a briefing from law enforcement about their failure to prepare for the insurrection at the US Capitol earlier this month, two members who attended a House Appropriations Committee briefing told CNN on Tuesday, with one saying it was \"dumb luck\" more people didn't die.\n House Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a phone call with CNN that members were \"shaking their heads in disbelief\" throughout the briefing about the security breakdown in the lead up to January 6. During that briefing, acting US Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman admitted her department knew there was a \"strong potential for violence\" targeting Congress, but did not take appropriate steps to prevent it.\n DeLauro said the revelation left her stunned and multiple federal law enforcement agencies failed by not acting on the intelligence they had.\n \"They had the information. They did not act on it. And a question that I have, and one that I think we need to get to the bottom of, is who made the decision not to act?\" DeLauro told CNN.\n \"People said today that there was ample evidence, that the intelligence agencies had ample evidence, that an angry mob was going to descend on Washington with Congress' meeting to certify the election as the intended target,\" DeLauro added.\n After participating in the hearing, Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Pennsylvania Democrat, told CNN, \"It was only by pure dumb luck that elected officials, staffers and more Capitol policemen were not killed.\"\n Cartwright said his theory of why there was not enough action to prepare was \"that people were more worried about optics more than they were worried about security.\"\n Cartwright said he directly asked those briefing the committee whether concerns about how security preparations would look was a reason for not acting.\n \"I got no denials, and I got a couple of confirmations,\" he told CNN, declining to say who specifically confirmed that optics were a motive behind inaction.\n The briefing came as US Capitol Police officers debate whether to hold a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day of insurrection, including Pittman. One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief the day of the siege at the Capitol and \"never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way, shape or form.\" Officers have told CNN that they felt abandoned and betrayed by the department's leadership.\n According to prepared remarks, Pittman told lawmakers that Capitol Police knew two days before the insurrection that militia and White supremacist groups would be at the Capitol on January 6, and some of those people planned to be armed.\n Pittman outlined four things that made the department ill-equipped to respond to the attack: a lack of manpower, not having the right equipment on hand or easily accessible, a lack of consistency in following the process for sealing the building and communication over radios and the public address system being hard to hear during the attack.\n CNN has attempted to speak to some of the Republican lawmakers who attended the briefing.\n Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the committee, described the briefing as a \"critical first step\" and joined her Democratic colleagues in calling out the failure to act on intelligence that could have prevented the attack.\n \"While many questions remain, it is clear that the failure was not due to a lack of intelligence, but rather a failure to properly act on this intelligence. This is unacceptable and left our law enforcement men and women on the ground unprepared for the danger they would face. These heroes not only deserve our gratitude for successfully keeping Members and staff safe, they deserve answers and a commitment to do better,\" Granger said in a statement.\n Rep. David Valadao, a California Republican, said in a statement to CNN, \"Today's security briefing with the House Appropriations Committee on the events of January 6 was very informative, and I hope the committee continues to hold them.\"\n DeLauro said members were not given a clear answer when they repeatedly asked for who was responsible for the lack of preparedness and response.\n \"No one would answer the question,\" DeLauro said to CNN, suggesting that it may be worth having one individual in charge going forward to avoid the kind of miscommunication that occurred the day of the attack.\n The Connecticut Democrat said there was no specific line of questioning around tours given prior to January 6 during the briefing, other than a mention from the FBI that all matters relating to the genesis of the insurrection are being investigated. She closed her remarks at the briefing by saying tours are something that need examined, and something she believed was being investigated.\n Cartwright shared that there was a \"good discussion\" about how to more \"carefully vet\" security forces, particularly those tasked with defending the Capitol.",

        "body_text": "Kate Hudson got candid about her decadeslong estrangement from her birth father Bill Hudson during an appearance on \u201cSunday Today with Willie Geist\u201d over the weekend.\n \u201cI think that estrangement is unfortunately quite common and I think it\u2019s important for people to talk about that,\u201d the \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d actor told Geist.\n You \u201csometimes need a little bit of talk \u2015 and humor \u2015 to move us into places where we can heal some of the wounds that have affected us,\u201d she added.\n Hudson and her brother, actor Oliver Hudson, were born to Bill Hudson and\u00a0Goldie Hawn during the couple\u2019s marriage, which lasted from 1976 to 1982. After they separated, Kate and Oliver were raised by Hawn and her longtime love, actor Kurt Russell.\n Though Hudson said she had a \u201cgreat family,\u201d she said the estrangement from her dad is a \u201c41-year-old issue\u201d that deeply affects her and her brother.\n \u201cI have a great family, I have a beautiful mother. I have a stepfather who stepped in and played a huge, huge part in sharing what it is to have a dependable father figure in our life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that we didn\u2019t know our dad. And people sometimes just need to hear that they\u2019re not alone in that.\u201d\n Hudson and her brother recently opened up about their shared struggles during an episode of the podcast they host together, aptly titled\u00a0\u201cSibling Revelry.\u201d\u00a0The \u201cMusic\u201d star told her brother she\u2019d been thinking a lot about their father and connecting with their other siblings\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about our sisters that we don\u2019t spend any time with and our brother \u2014 brothers.\u00a0We\u2019ve got four siblings we don\u2019t spend any time with,\u201d she said. \u201cI just had this moment of like, it would be nice to connect a little bit, especially with my sisters.\n \u201cEspecially because [on the podcast] we\u2019ve been talking so much about sibling relationships and distraught relationships or good\u201d relationships, Kate added as her brother laughed.\n \u201cAnd we\u2019re sitting here like, \u2018We have the best family, we\u2019re so great,\u2019 and yet we don\u2019t ever acknowledge the fact that we have four other siblings. Four!\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the Hudsons, and thinking that it\u2019s important that we reach out to all of our siblings and maybe connect with them a little bit.\u201d\n Oliver spoke about reconnecting with his father after posting a Father\u2019s Day\u00a0\u201cHappy abandonment day\u201d\u00a0picture years ago on social media slamming his dad.\n The post made headlines and drew a strong response from Bill Hudson, who called it a \u201ca malicious, vicious, premeditated attack\u201d and declared Kate and Oliver \u201cdead to me now.\u201d\n But the \u201cRules of Engagement\u201d star said he didn\u2019t regret the post (which is still up), because it helped him start speaking with his father again.\n \u201cAt the end of the day it was a good thing. We\u2019re communicating now,\u201d Oliver said on \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d\u00a0in 2015. \u201cI had an amazing three-hour conversation with him. We\u2019re texting and we\u2019re trying to see each other. We might be mending something.\u201d",

        "title": "An Organ Recital, With a Coronavirus Shot",
        "body_text": "SALISBURY, England \u2014 On a recent Saturday afternoon, Margaret Drabble, 83, sat beneath the soaring arches of Salisbury Cathedral, swinging her legs back and forth under her chair like a schoolgirl.\n Minutes earlier, in a booth near the cathedral\u2019s entrance, she had received her first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus. But that wasn\u2019t why she was looking so happy, she said. Instead, it was from the elaborate organ music gently reverberating in the cathedral\u2019s interior.\n \u201cOh, I just love the organ,\u201d said Drabble, a former schoolteacher. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful, it almost makes me cry every time I hear it.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to play it,\u201d she said, wistfully. Then, she looked toward the organ\u2019s 4,000 pipes at the front of the cathedral and sat up straight to listen. She had been told to stay put for 15 minutes, to make sure she did not develop an allergic reaction.\n Britain is in the middle of a mass vaccination drive, racing to outrun the spread of the virus as a new variant discovered in the country surges. So far, some 6.3 million people have received a first dose, just under 10 percent of the population.\n England\u2019s National Health Service has signed contracts with dozens of large venues that will operate as vaccination centers. On Monday, it announced 33 new locations, including a soccer stadium in Oxford, several sports centers and a concert arena.\n Patients have been getting the vaccine at Salisbury Cathedral since Jan. 16, and it hosts the inoculation sessions twice a week for around 1,200 people a day. Sessions last about 12 hours, and, for most of that time, David Halls and John Challenger, the cathedral\u2019s organists, provide a musical backing, ranging from well-known hymns to fairground tunes and euphoric classical works.\n That makes the cathedral one of the few places in the country one can hear live music right now. With much of Britain under lockdown restrictions for the third time, theaters, museums and concert halls have been forced to shut. But in recent weeks, the British government\u2019s race to vaccinate its population has provided some cultural venues with a surprising lease on life.\n Some \u2014 like the Thackray Museum of Medicine in Leeds, in northern England, and the Hertford Theater, just north of London \u2014 have become vaccination centers, taking advantage of their large, well ventilated spaces and experience with managing crowds. Visitors now line up to receive shots, instead of to look at display cases or sing along to musicals.\n At least one well-known London attraction, the Science Museum, is being considered, according to local officials, and even circus operators have offered their big tops.\n Salisbury Cathedral is, of course, more of a religious venue than a cultural one. But beyond the organ accompaniment, anyone inoculated in the 13th-century Gothic building in southwestern England can also marvel at its architecture and contemplate several artworks throughout its grounds, including a huge reclining figure by the sculptor Henry Moore and a tapestry by the contemporary British artist Grayson Perry.\n On Saturday, few visitors were looking at those, but several were listening attentively to the music.\n \u201cI live locally, and we\u2019ve all been saying, \u2018Have you been to the organ recital yet?\u2019\u201d said Pam Scoop, 86. \u201cWe don\u2019t say, \u2018Have you been for a jab?\u2019\u201d she added, using a British term for a shot. She then closed her eyes to listen to Halls play the uplifting Bach chorale \u201cJesu, Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring.\u201d\n Nicholas Papadopulos, the cathedral\u2019s dean, said he had offered the building as a vaccine hub as soon as he heard that a successful shot had been developed. \u201cOur thought was a lot of elderly, vulnerable people who hadn\u2019t been out of their homes very much in the last year, if at all, would be coming,\u201d he said, adding that the team wanted to \u201ccreate an environment that is welcoming and reassuring and soothing.\u201d\n \u201cThe obvious solution was to make music,\u201d he said.\n David Halls, the cathedral\u2019s music director, said he had started by playing famous classical pieces from the likes of Bach, Mozart and Handel. He said he then decided to branch out, playing show tunes like \u201cOld Man River\u201d and English music-hall hits like \u201cI Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside,\u201d hoping they would stir happy memories among older listeners.\n \u201cThe phrase \u2018smooth classics\u2019 was what came to mind,\u201d Halls said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anything too spiky or unpleasant or anything too fast.\u201d\n John Challenger, the cathedral\u2019s assistant music director, said that some local residents had started emailing requests. Someone had suggested a work by the Australian organist and composer George Thalben-Ball, he said; on Saturday, someone else emailed to ask for a piece by Olivier Messiaen, including the time they would like the work played.\n \u201cIt\u2019s weird what people want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Challenger said.\n Dan Henderson, one of the doctors overseeing the center, said the cathedral was a perfect space for vaccinations, as its large, drafty space lowers the risk of catching the virus. The music was a bonus, he added, but it did have a medical benefit because it lowered people\u2019s anxiety. \u201cIt\u2019s changing this from a medical intervention to an event,\u201d he said, \u201cand that really makes patients at ease.\u201d\n There was only one, occasional, downside, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients sit in the observation area for half-an-hour listening to the music, when they\u2019re only meant to be there for 15 minutes. So sometimes it is actually impeding the flow of patients,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s quite a lovely problem to have.\u201d\n Many visitors on that recent Saturday seemed to have that urge to stick around and enjoy the music. Sue Phillips, 77, was sitting in the waiting area with her husband, William, after getting a shot. The organists were taking a break, and she seemed disappointed by the silence.\n \u201cIt\u2019d be lovely if the organ were playing,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cAll these old people, including us, have had a year deprived of culture, music and beauty, then we get a chance to get our jab to organ music.\u201d\n But shortly after, the organ surged into life and the familiar notes of Hubert Parry\u2019s \u201cJerusalem,\u201d a patriotic English hymn, filled the space.\n Phillips\u2019s eyes brightened above her mask. \u201cOh, wonderful!\u201d she said. \u201cThis is magical.\u201d\n Looking at her husband, she said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll stay for another 10 minutes.\u201d",

        "title": "Dogs likely migrated to the Americas with humans over 15,000 years ago, study says",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Dogs have been following humans for thousands of years.\n Archaeological and genetic data has revealed that dogs accompanied humans when they were migrating to the Americas from East Asia, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n Dogs were likely domesticated over 23,000 years ago in Siberia, said lead study author and archaeologist Angela Perri, a research fellow at Durham University's department of archaeology in the United Kingdom. Her team analyzed the genetic makeup of ancient dog remains to estimate when the domestication from wolves to dogs happened.\n Archaeological evidence showed that the humans migrated over 15,000 years ago from Northeast Asia across the Bering Land Bridge, a piece of land that connected modern-day Russia to Alaska. The land crossing no longer exists due to rising sea levels.\n Perri studied the lineage of American dogs outside the Arctic, which come from a different genetic ancestor than Arctic dogs, and traced it back to ancient Siberian dogs. This lineage has shown that humans brought their dogs with them when they migrated to the Americas, according to the study.\n Many people have dogs as pets today and some wonder, \"What is this animal and how did it go from a wild predator to curled up next to my bed?\" Perri noted.\n While there is no definitive answer on why dogs became domesticated, the freezing climactic conditions during this time likely brought wolves and humans closer together for survival, she said.\n \"Wolves likely learned that scavenging from humans regularly was an easy free meal, while humans allowed this to happen so long as wolves were not aggressive or threatening,\" Perri said.\n The dogs could have also helped humans transport items faster, she said. There is also evidence in the Pacific Northwest of humans using furry creatures as emergency sources of food and fur.\n The study is a fascinating example of how canine and human DNA and archaeology can be used to find out more about our past, said Jeffrey Kidd, associate professor of human genetics at the University of Michigan Medical School, who was not involved in the study.\n Modern dogs are similar to domesticated dogs from 15,000 years ago, he said, but today there are different furs and colors as a result of breeding.\n Kidd is not surprised that humans brought their dogs with them when they migrated to the Americas because of how intertwined dogs are in our society.\n \"If you and your entire community was going on a journey across the land, wouldn't you bring along your dog?\" Kidd said.\n The earliest confirmed dog bones were found in Germany over 100 years ago and are about 15,000 years old, Perri said, so her next project is to search for older dog bones in Siberia to aid in her research. She's hoping to gather more evidence to discover how dogs became man's best friend.",

        "title": "CNN survey shows some of America's biggest companies still grappling with response to deadly US Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Despite the vocal pledges from some companies to take bold action following the deadly January 6 siege on the US Capitol, many of America's corporate giants are instead taking a wait-and-see approach about their future political giving, a new CNN analysis shows.\n And even when the companies vowed to suspend campaign contributions, most declined to say how long their donation boycotts would last.\n CNN surveyed the roughly 280 companies in the Fortune 500 that supported the 147 GOP lawmakers who objected to certifying President Joe Biden's win. About 150 responded. Among the findings: Many of the firms that have chosen to suspend campaign donations have taken a broad-brush approach -- freezing contributions across the board, rather than targeting the Republican objectors.\n This month's corporate pushback sent shock waves through Washington as powerful trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce rebuked Trump's conduct in the hours before the Capitol attack. Brand-name companies, such as Coca-Cola and Marriott, swiftly went public with plans to halt giving by their affiliated political action committees.\n Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said that how long the corporate revolt from politicians will last is an open question, particularly since campaign fundraising usually slows in the months after an election.\n \"Right now, it's quite easy for them to sit back,\" Krumholz said. \"It's hard to imagine this would last through the primaries and general election in 2022.\"\n The analysis found that PACs associated with more than half of the companies -- roughly 280 firms in total -- had contributed $21 million to the 147 objectors.\n A total of 153 of those companies responded to CNN's questions about their political giving, representing firms whose PACs have donated $14 million to the 147 lawmakers during the 2020 election cycle.\n Among the findings:\n 120 of the companies said they had decided to pause or end political giving in some form. Twelve said they would not, and 21 said they were reviewing their practices but had not yet decided whether to make any changes. 33 companies said they would single out the 147 objectors, including AT&T and telecom giant Comcast, the two largest PAC contributors to this group of lawmakers. (CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia, is owned by AT&T.)\n 73 companies said they would halt donations to all federal candidates. That included the third largest PAC donor to the objectors, defense contractor Raytheon Technologies. Raytheon's PAC donated more than $560,000 to federal candidates during the 2020 cycle. In a statement to CNN, Raytheon spokesman Chris Johnson said the pause would allow it to \"reflect on the current environment and determine appropriate next steps.\"\n None of the companies that responded to CNN said they had requested refunds from lawmakers. That stands in sharp contrast to the greeting card maker Hallmark, which is not a Fortune 500 firm but made headlines with its request that two of the objectors, Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and  Roger Marshall of Kansas, return its PAC contributions.\n 31 companies had specific timetables for how long they would suspend political activity. Four -- General Electric, Texas Instruments, Public Service Enterprise Group and NGR Energy -- told CNN they planned to halt donations to the 147 objectors for the entire 2022 election cycle.\n \"This is not a decision we made lightly, but is one we believe is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company's values and commitment to democracy,\" General Electric spokeswoman Meghan Thurlow said in a statement to CNN.\n Texas Instruments spokeswoman Nicole Bernard told CNN the two-year suspension reflects the company's practice of evaluating candidates on a two-year budget cycle.\n At least one firm, Charles Schwab, has opted to shut down its PAC entirely. The Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump conservative strategists, had targeted the brokerage firm in a campaign that highlighted corporate donors to Trump or his allies on Capitol Hill.\n \"In light of a divided political climate and an increase in attacks on those participating in the political process, we believe a clear and apolitical position is in the best interest of our clients, employees, stockholders and the communities in which we operate,\" Schwab said in a statement.\n The swift and public reactions from some big-name corporate interests to the violent insurrection \"is significant in the moment,\" said Bruce Freed, who runs the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit that advocates for transparency in corporate political giving.\n \"Does the pause lead to a fundamental change or do they go back to business as usual?\" Freed asked. \"That remains to be seen.\"\n Some liberal watchdog groups are determined to keep the pressure on. End Citizens United recently published a list of firms that had donated at least $10,000 to the eight senators who objected to the election results, and it urged those companies to demand refunds.\n \"PR statements mean nothing if they're not followed by action,\" the group's president, Tiffany Muller, said in a statement. \"We're watching.\"\n Collectively, business PACs accounted for more than $360 million in federal contributions during the 2020 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. About 57% of the money flowed to GOP candidates. Corporations cannot donate directly to federal candidates, but their employees and executives fund company-aligned PACs.\n PAC donations represent just a fraction of the billions of dollars that companies and other powerful interests spend to influence policy in Washington each year. A political action committee can donate up to $5,000 directly to a federal candidate's campaign per election and an additional $10,000 to that candidate's leadership PAC over a two-year election cycle.\n Even so, how companies choose to direct their PAC money sends a powerful message about their values to their customers and workers, said David Rehr, who ran trade groups in Washington and now teaches lobbying and leadership as a professor at George Mason University.\n In the aftermath of the riot, companies \"want to signal they are on the right side of history,\" Rehr said. But they also are trying to navigate the fast-moving developments of a new Congress and new administration.\n \"The waiting buys them a lot of valuable time to assess how this torrent of change may affect their business,\" Rehr said.",

        "title": "8 myths about the Covid-19 vaccine -- Dr. Wen explains",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The United States crossed the terrible milestone of 400,000 deaths from coronavirus early last week, and there are currently over 2.1 million reported deaths worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n There are also new variants with mutations that could make Covid-19 even more transmissible and possibly even more deadly. However, there is also encouraging news, with two vaccines authorized for emergency use so far by the US Food and Drug Administration that are safe and very effective.\n Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they will try to get vaccinated and currently demand far outstrips supply, but 30% of Americans stated they will not, according to CNN poll results released January 21.\n For those who are vaccine hesitant, what are some common myths about the vaccines, and how can each of us work to address these misconceptions?\n We spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, about how everyone can debunk myths, ease concerns and spread accurate information about the Covid-19 vaccines.\n Another principle of public health is to meet people where they are. That means seeking to understand why someone may have hesitancy about the coronavirus vaccine. How you approach someone is going to be completely different if they are concerned about whether the vaccine is safe versus if they don't believe coronavirus is real. Listening to someone's concerns and then addressing them, with compassion and empathy, is crucial.\n There are common myths I often hear from my patients, but there are things that each of us can say if someone around us expresses these myths.\n Neither is true. If someone is concerned about this, you can say that none of the coronavirus vaccines being tested in the US contains live virus. So it's not possible to get coronavirus from the coronavirus vaccine.\n Another set of myths is around the mRNA platform that is used for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. I've heard people worry about whether the vaccine will somehow affect their genetic code and alter their genes.\n This is not true. It's helpful to explain what the mRNA technology is. The term \"mRNA\" stands for messenger RNA, which is a portion of the genetic code that teaches cells how to make a protein. The protein that's made by the mRNA then activates an immune response, teaching our bodies how to respond to coronavirus if we come into contact with it in the future.\n What's very important to understand is what the mRNA does not do: It never enters the nucleus of people's cells, which is where our DNA is contained. That means the vaccine does not interact with people's DNA at all, and therefore will not alter our genetic code.\n The US government and other governments invested a lot of money in the research. And, frankly, we got lucky with the research to have two vaccines already that are safe and so effective. But every phase of the clinical research was followed as it is for other vaccines, with tens of thousands of volunteers in the clinical trials. External committees of independent scientists vetted the data and there were no shortcuts taken in vaccine authorization.\n At the moment, it's not clear as to why these very rare allergic reactions are happening. That's why everyone getting the Covid-19 vaccine is required to stay around for 15 minutes after receiving it. And if you have a history of severe allergic reactions, you might be required to wait 30 minutes. If a severe allergic reaction occurs, it can be treated with an EpiPen.\n The remote possibility of a rare allergic reaction is no reason not to receive the vaccine. The very real and substantial benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the highly uncommon (and treatable) risks of allergic reactions. Those with food and medication allergies can still get the vaccine. The only reason you shouldn't get the vaccine is if you have a specific known reaction to a component of the vaccine itself.\n But just because you may need to get the vaccine again at some point again doesn't mean you shouldn't get it the first time. Think about the flu vaccine: Just because you have to get it every year doesn't mean you should never get it at all.\n Here's why. First, even those who are young and healthy may contract coronavirus and become very ill. It's less common, but deaths do occur in this population, too. Second, we need to strive for herd immunity through vaccination. That's the level at which the virus will substantially slow, and hopefully even stop, its spread. Public health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have estimated that we need about 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated to reach that point.\n The sooner we get people vaccinated, the earlier we can all return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy and end the devastation of this disease. And that requires not only the elderly and more vulnerable, but all of us getting the vaccine.\n That's why people still have to use caution even after they are vaccinated. At some point, though, as we approach herd immunity through vaccination, we will be able to do away with masks. In the meantime, think of vaccines as a tool that doesn't replace other tools but is essential to saving lives.\n Over the course of the next few months, many millions will be vaccinated. It's reasonable to point to these examples of people to say that we're showing, not just in tens of thousands of research participants, but in tens of millions of people, that the vaccine is safe and effective. You yourself getting vaccinated when it's your turn, and showing other examples of people in the community who are vaccinated, will also go a long way toward persuading reluctant friends and relatives.\n Humility and honesty are key. We should acknowledge that the vaccines are relatively new so we don't know the long-term consequences. But then add that there is no reason to believe that the vaccines will cause ill effects long-term. We have a long history of developing vaccines, and scientifically, there is no evidence for long-term harm with those vaccines.\n We know that Covid-19 can cause severe disease and death. We know that thousands of Americans are dying every day. These, too, are our family members, friends and colleagues. That's why getting the vaccine is so important. We are in the middle of a pandemic, and it takes all of us to protect ourselves and to protect others, too.",

        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Janet\u00a0Yellen\u00a0won overwhelming Senate confirmation as the first female U.S. Treasury secretary on Monday, setting her quickly to work with Congress on coronavirus relief, reviewing U.S. sanctions policy and strengthening financial regulation.\n The Senate voted 84-15 to confirm\u00a0Yellen, with all opposition coming from Republicans, several of whom have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid proposal, tax and spending plans.\n The Senate later on Monday evening was expected to receive articles of impeachment against former President Donald Trump, a move that has also stoked some partisan divisions.\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said\u00a0Yellen\u00a0had made history for a second time, seven years after she became the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve.\n \u201cAt the Treasury Department, there are long hallways where portraits hang of all 77 Treasury Secretaries \u2014 all men, all the way back to Alexander Hamilton,\u201d Schumer wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to vote for Janet\u00a0Yellen\u00a0today and add the first portrait of a woman to that hallway.\u201d\n Yellen\u00a0will play a key role in working with Congress on Biden\u2019s coronavirus stimulus plans and on his pledges to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness.\n Treasury will oversee Biden\u2019s plans to help finance these initiatives by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increase taxes on those making over $400,000 a year.\n Republicans have expressed concerns over the price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits during Trump\u2019s term with the 2017 tax cuts and nearly $5 trillion in coronavirus spending.\n Yellen\u00a0told senators at her confirmation hearing last week that they needed to raise the minimum wage and \u201cact big\u201d on stimulus measures or risk a longer, more painful recession brought on by the pandemic.\n Yellen\u00a0also said during her confirmation hearing that she would conduct an immediate review of U.S. financial sanctions policy administered by Treasury to ensure that they were used \u201cstrategically and appropriately\u201d after a major ramp-up of such measures under the Trump administration.\n Yellen\u2019s confirmation less than a week after Biden took office is quick by recent standards. Her Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration on a party-line vote.\n The Treasury on Monday announced more members of\u00a0Yellen\u2019s team, bringing back some Obama administration veterans who served at the agency.\n The Treasury named Natalie Wyeth Earnest as counselor to the secretary for strategic communications. Earnest served as assistant secretary for public affairs at Treasury under former Secretary Jack Lew and in various communications roles under former Secretary Tim Geithner.\n Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy, was named as deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in Treasury\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs.\n Treasury named Aruna Kalyanam, most recently House Ways and Means Committee deputy chief tax counsel, as deputy assistant secretary for tax and budget in the Office of Legislative Affairs.\n (Reporting by David Lawder; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal, Ann Saphir and Eric Beech; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Sonya Hepinstall)",

        "title": "Jerry Seinfeld Responds After Awkward Larry King Interview Goes Viral",
        "body_text": "Jerry Seinfeld wants to give the internet some serenity now.\n Following the death of\u00a0Larry King on Saturday, an old interview clip went viral, supposedly showing an uncomfortable exchange between the radio and TV icon and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.\n In a video of the 2007 interview, King asks Seinfeld a question about his self-titled sitcom, \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d going off the air, saying, \u201cYou gave it up, right? They didn\u2019t cancel you. You canceled them.\u201d\n Of course, Seinfeld pretty famously chose for his show\u00a0to come to an end in 1998, walking away from millions. It\u2019s something he thought King knew, and things seemingly got awkward.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not aware of this? You think I got canceled?\u201d Seinfeld said, going on to add,\u00a0\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n A consummate professional, King still somehow manages to get in a plug for Seinfeld\u2019s animated comedy \u201cBee Movie.\u201d Though, obviously, that\u2019s not why people are buzzing.\n The \u201cawkward\u201d interview has gone viral before, gaining millions of views, showing up online under titles such as \u201cJerry Seinfeld Rips Larry King,\u201d and getting referenced in various news stories\u00a0over the years.\n Following the video resurfacing yet again, headlines sprang up about the interview, saying King had \u201cirked\u201d the comedian.\n Now, Seinfeld is setting things straight.\n On Saturday, the comedian responded to the resurfaced video, saying he will miss King and \u201calways\u201d loved him.\n The comedian added, \u201cThe \u2018canceled\u2019 bit was just me having fun with his little mistake. Nothing more. Or less.\u201d\n Considering the video has floated around the internet for years, it seems about time that Seinfeld cleared things up. According to the comedian, he was just joking around in the clip. It\u2019s not about ripping into a TV legend.\n So like his sitcom, stories blowing things out of proportion are just a lot of\u00a0show about nothing.",

        "title": "Evictions, unemployment and hunger: The American economy Joe Biden inherits",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Michelle Bennett is trying to keep life inside her Waldorf, Maryland, home as normal as possible during Covid-19. Three of her four daughters are learning remotely, while she makes them three meals a day. But outside, the relentless threat of eviction keeps knocking.\n She lost her job as a receptionist at a doctors' office in March and hasn't been able to collect unemployment because she is waiting to be approved for disability. It's by the grace of a court-ordered stay that she can remain in her home while she fights the eviction through appeal.\n \"I'm basically living in fear because I don't want to be homeless,\" said Michelle Bennett. \"I don't really have anywhere to go without an income during the pandemic.\"\n The eviction crisis is just one of the economic disasters the Biden administration needs to tackle -- it's also staring down massive unemployment and a growing hunger problem. Even with the proposition of a historic $1.9 trillion relief package, President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to get the economy back to where it was before the pandemic.\n Last week, Biden signed an executive order extending a ban on evictions through the end of March. Despite the ban, it doesn't help Bennett, whose lawyer says her landlord is using a legal loophole that is growing common during the pandemic.\n Bennett is a month-to-month tenant and failure to pay rent means she has technically outstayed her lease. Landlords are filing evictions as \"tenant hold overs\" -- when renters remain in a property after the lease expires. Many judges are ruling in favor of the landlords despite the extenuating circumstances and federal and state evictions bans, according to Maryland Legal Aid.\n \"A loophole has been created that allows landlords to continue evicting tenants that cannot pay rent\" said Nicole Portnov, a lawyer with Maryland Legal Aid, representing Bennett. \"Ms. Bennett is a quintessential example of this phenomenon, and in Ms. Bennett's case this has led to the use of a relatively seldom used eviction statute to put people in the street during a pandemic.\"\n An Emergency Rental Assistance program was created under the Trump administration to help renters like Bennett, but she says she was unable to apply because the funds dried up.\n \"When you call it's like -- no money. Or call back next month, maybe there'll be money then. And then you call back the next month is still 'oh we're out of money,'\" said Bennett.\n President Biden proposed about $30 billion in additional rental assistance to renters and small landlords as part of his Covid-19 relief plan. He also wants to extend the eviction moratorium until the end of September.\n \"I'm not asking for a handout, I'm just trying to keep me and my kids together,\" said Bennett, who has not been able to find another job. \"We're in a FEMA like situation -- we don't have a flood or hurricane -- but were in a pandemic.\"\n Weekly unemployment claims are hovering near 1 million. Last month, the economy shed jobs for the first time since April, and women were hit the hardest: Of the total, a net 156,000 jobs were lost by women, and 16,000 were gained by men.\n \"It's maddening, it's frustrating, it's defeating,\" said Gabbie Riley.\n In March, Riley was furloughed from her sales job at the Loews Hotel in Minneapolis, with the hope it would return. The leisure and hospitality industry has lost more jobs than any other US industry since the pandemic began.\n \"I don't know how I can describe it. I was the one that put in the work...and to know that I just had to hand that off to the men is a lot to process,\" said Riley who detailed her story in op-ed for CNN the day before she found out she was laid off.\n As a single mother, Riley can no longer afford health insurance for her and her 19 year-old son. She's on unemployment, but says her savings is keeping her family afloat.\n As part of his Covid-19 relief plan, Biden plans to extend enhanced unemployment benefits, increasing them from $300 a week to $400. But what Riley really wants is her career back.\n \"Two years ago this week, I was accepting an award in front of 500 people for the 'Hotel Rep of the Year - East' - earned from industry client and peer nominations and voting. This year I am unemployed trying to figure out what comes next.  A total 180,\" she said.\n On a recent Friday afternoon, the line for food at The Campaign Against Hunger in Brooklyn, New York, stretched down a city block. The scene repeats seven days a week.\n Since the beginning of the pandemic, this Brooklyn food bank alone has served 1.4 million people -- made possible, in part, from government funding that is drying up fast.\n \"I don't know what I'm going to do because I still have food to buy,\" said Melony Samuels, Executive Director of The Campaign Against Hunger. \"I need assurance from all our policymakers that listen, you started, we need to finish this thing.  We started helping families, we can't leave them in thin air.\"\n Last week, President Biden signed an executive order addressing the growing hunger crisis by asking the Department of Agriculture to increase the value of special pandemic food stamp benefits 15%. The extra benefit gives money to low-income families to cover the cost of missing meals in school. But as the need for food grows, many Americans will fall through the cracks.\n \"Many people are not eligible for SNAP (food stamps), but they're here because they're not eligible and they still cannot make ends meet,\" said Samuels. \"SNAP needs to be fixed and money needs to be in the budget directly to food pantries, food banks that are actually working on the ground.\"\n -- CNN's Kate Trafecante contributed to this report",

        "title": "An Idaho newspaper editor struggled to get Excel access for staff. After tweeting about it, she was fired.",
        "body_text": "Before she was appointed the top editor at the Idaho Statesman, Christina Lords was known for going to bat for her staff.\n So when McClatchy, the Boise newspaper\u2019s parent company, initially denied a new reporter\u2019s request for access to Microsoft Excel, Lords took up the matter herself, she said. Faced with resistance to get a basic software program, the 34-year-old editor lamented the struggle on Twitter last week.\n \u201cSupport your local newspapers, people. Get a digital subscription,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted tweet. \u201cThis is genuinely what we are up against.\u201d\n On Monday, McClatchy dismissed her for violating its social media policy, Lords told The Washington Post. The paper\u2019s union publicly slammed the decision hours later, advocating not for one of its members but for the newsroom\u2019s top manager in an unusual move.\n Yet Lords, who said she respects the company\u2019s decision, said she would tweet the message again. \u201cAdvocating for a staff that has worked so hard over the last few years is the least I can do,\u201d she said. \u201cI genuinely feel like they deserve that.\u201d\n In a statement to The Post, a McClatchy spokesperson said the company does not comment on \u201cinternal personnel matters,\u201d but added \u201cthe full facts of the situation are not accurately represented on social media.\u201d\n In a letter to McClatchy news executives late on Monday, the Idaho News Guild protested Lords\u2019s \u201cabrupt and inappropriate firing\u201d and demanded she be reinstated as editor.\n \u201cWe always knew she had our back. We always knew she was going to fight for us if we needed anything,\u201d Michael Lycklama, a sportswriter and union steward, said in an interview with The Post. \u201cWhen that\u2019s what gets her fired, it\u2019s a pretty chilling message to send to your employees.\u201d\n He noted the new reporter was eventually granted access to Excel on her company laptop. But the union\u2019s letter also pointed to a broader set of frustrations, including job openings left unfilled for months, that they say have weakened the Statesman and its sister publications during an unprecedented rush of news.\n The McClatchy Co., a chain of 30 daily newspapers that includes the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee, declared bankruptcy last summer after years of declining ad revenue and shrinking print readership. In July, it was purchased by the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management.\n While McClatchy has fared better than some other local newspaper chains \u2014 the company has refused to cut journalism jobs or implement furloughs for its news staffers during the pandemic \u2014 it has given up the physical offices for the Statesman and many of its other titles.\n Without a newsroom address to receive and distribute personal protective equipment, Lords recently drove around Boise, hand-delivering N95 masks to the paper\u2019s staff.\n A fifth-generation Idahoan who has worked at three other papers across the state, she was first hired just over three years ago as the paper\u2019s breaking news editor and quickly climbed up the ranks.\n As top editor since early 2019, Lords turned competitors into collaborators, setting up content-sharing partnerships with newspapers around the state. Despite a shrinking staff \u2014 the newsroom of about 20 is one-third of what it was a decade ago \u2014 she put an emphasis on digital news and enterprise, overseeing a project on highway safety and setting up a statewide coronavirus tracker. Union members said she earned the admiration of the staff.\n \u201cIt\u2019s never been more obvious than in a pandemic,\u201d said Nicole Foy, an investigative reporter at the Statesman and member of the union\u2019s bargaining committee. \u201cWhen we\u2019re dealing with diminishing resources available to all local newsrooms and still trying to put out a paper every day, that\u2019s the thing about Christina: She will advocate for her reporters.\u201d\n Foy, who covers Latino issues and agriculture, said Lords encouraged her to seek out a fellowship that allowed the paper to translate stories on the coronavirus into Spanish. Another initiative boosting education coverage culminated in a town hall last month between Latino students and Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R).\n Among other cost-cutting measures, McClatchy did away with subscriptions to Microsoft Office for new employees, the union said. So when the Statesman\u2019s new state politics reporter was initially told she could not have access to the software, Lords took to Twitter.\n \u201cWhen that didn\u2019t happen, it was just like \u2018Dang it,\u2019 here\u2019s another example of how strapped we are for these resources,\u201d she said.\n She had been vocal on the platform about the challenges facing local newspapers and had never faced disciplinary issues before. Days after sending the tweet \u2014 which she concedes was perhaps her most pointed remark on the matter \u2014 McClatchy news executives told her she was fired.\n But Lords said she will never give up her Statesman subscription, and when the paper embarks on a fundraising campaign later this year, she will donate, too.\n Local journalism is \u201cin a crisis level of resources, and people need to truly know what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make the case for ourselves, how are they going to know that they need to pay for local news?\u201d",

        "body_text": "SEATTLE \u2014 Genetic genealogy helped identify the youngest known victim of one of the nation\u2019s most prolific serial killers almost 37 years after her remains were discovered near a baseball field south of Seattle.\n Wendy Stephens was 14 and had run away from her home in Denver before Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, strangled her in 1983, the King County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced Monday.\n Ridgway terrorized the Seattle area in the 1980s, and since 2003, he has pleaded guilty to killing 49 women and girls. Four of the victims \u2014 including Stephens \u2014 had not been identified.\n \u201cRidgway\u2019s murderous spree left a trail of profound grief for so many families of murdered and missing women,\u201d King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg said in a written statement. \u201cWe are thankful that Wendy Stephens\u2019 family will now have answers to their enormous loss suffered nearly 40 years ago.\u201d\n Researchers at the  DNA Doe Project, a volunteer organization that uses publicly available DNA databases to find relatives of unidentified victims, helped make the identification.\n Genetic genealogy has increasingly been used to track down unidentified criminal suspects and help solve scores of cold cases in recent years, some of them more than a half-century old or involving other serial killers. It unmasked the Golden State Killer, Joseph DeAngelo, who pleaded guilty to 13 murders and 13 rape-related charges that spanned much of California between 1975 and 1986.\n Stephens\u2019 remains were found in a wooded area next to a baseball field in what is now the suburb of SeaTac on March 21, 1984, after the groundskeeper\u2019s dog came home with a leg bone. She had been killed a year or more earlier, investigators believe, and she is thought to have been Ridgway\u2019s youngest victim.\n The remains of another Ridgway victim, Cheryl Wims, were discovered at the same time.\n Stephens\u2019 family requested privacy and declined to speak with reporters, said Sgt. Tim Meyer, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office.\n Cairenn Binder, who led the DNA Doe Project team that identified Stephens, said that by entering her DNA information into a genealogy website, they were able to locate distant cousins on both her mother\u2019s side and father\u2019s side. By building out a family tree with census, birth and other records, they pinpointed where the families intersected \u2014 Stephens\u2019 parents.\n Investigators found a missing person report for Stephens that had been filed in 1983, and they matched her DNA directly with one of her parents.\n It only took a few weeks for Binder\u2019s team to come up with Stephens\u2019 name. But it could have been even quicker: Years ago, one of Stephens\u2019 parents entered DNA into the database GEDmatch, in hopes of finding her or any children she might have had, Binder said.\n That would have provided a quick DNA hit. But in 2019, GEDmatch changed its policies, better protecting the privacy of users by requiring them to opt in if they wanted law enforcement to be able to use their DNA in investigations. Because the parent had provided their DNA before the policy change, and they had not subsequently opted in, Binder\u2019s team didn\u2019t see the parent\u2019s DNA profile when they searched.\n Researchers at the DNA Doe Project don\u2019t contact victims\u2019 families, Binder said, but as the mother of a 14-year-old daughter, she could imagine the trauma they endured.\n \u201cIt was a lot to think about how youthful this victim was and what she had gone through in her life,\u201d Binder said. \u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting her youth was taken away from her, but it also gives me some measure of comfort and a feeling of success because we were able to restore her name.\u201d\n Ridgway preyed on young women in vulnerable positions, including sex workers and runaways, mostly from 1982 to 1984. He sometimes showed them photos of his own young son to gain their trust.\n He was long a suspect in the Green River killings \u2014 so called because the first victims were found in the Green River, which runs through several south Seattle suburbs. Detectives were unable to prove his role until 2001, when advances in DNA technology allowed them to link a saliva sample they had obtained from him in 1987 to semen found on several victims.\n Ridgway claimed to have killed dozens more women than he was charged with \u2014 so many he said he lost count. He pleaded guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty after agreeing to help investigators find additional remains. He is now 71, spending the rest of his life at the Washington State Penitentiary.\n Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "body_text": "(CNN) Senators were sworn in for the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid an immediate challenge to the constitutionality of the trial from a Republican ally of the former President.\n Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a procedural vote on the constitutionality of the trial Tuesday afternoon, in what amounted to the first test of how Senate Republicans view the upcoming trial, the substance of which will begin with arguments next month. The Senate voted to table, or kill, Paul's point of order, 55 to 45, with just five Republicans joining Democrats to vote against dismissing the trial.\n The five Republicans who voted against Paul were Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.\n The Kentucky Republican said Tuesday that he forced the procedural vote to show there already aren't sufficient votes to convict Trump, which would require two-thirds of senators. Many Republicans have taken the position in recent days that the trial is not constitutional because Trump is no longer President, in what's become the most common argument to acquit Trump.\n \"I think it showed that impeachment is dead on arrival,\" Paul said after the vote. \"If you voted it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?\"\n LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Biden presidency and Trump impeachment trial\n Tuesday's test vote showed that it's likely next-to-impossible for Democrats to find 17 Republican votes for the two-thirds needed to convict and bar Trump from running for office again. Several Republicans said they were surprised Tuesday they were already taking a vote on the constitutionality of the trial, as the question is something that both the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team are likely to address in their presentations next month.\n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said he's going into the trial with an open mind about Trump's guilt, voted with Paul on Tuesday, suggesting he has constitutional concerns about the trial.\n The trial began Tuesday afternoon with the swearing in of Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, the Senate president pro tempore, who will preside over the trial. Leahy then swore in the rest of the Senate, and senators went four at a time to sign an \"oath book\" as jurors for the trial.\n David Carle, a spokesman for Leahy, said Tuesday evening that the senator was not feeling well after performing his duties and was taken to a local hospital.\n \"This evening, Senator Leahy was in his Capitol office and was not feeling well. He was examined in the Capitol by the Attending Physician,\" Carle said in a statement. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Attending Physician recommended that he be taken to a local hospital for observation, where he is now, and where he is being evaluated.\"\n The Senate passed its pre-trial organizing resolution, laying out the rules heading into the trial, 83-17, before the Senate adjourned as a \"court of impeachment\" until February 9, when the trial arguments are scheduled to begin.\n At their party lunch Tuesday ahead of Paul's planned vote, Senate Republicans hosted conservative legal scholar Jonathan Turley, one of the lead scholars arguing that impeaching Trump when he is out of office is unconstitutional.\n Turley has written extensively in recent days about his belief that while reasonable people can disagree about whether or not it is constitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a former President, he wrote recently on his blog, \"even if the Senate does not view this as extraconstitutional, it should view this trial as Constitutionally unsound.\"\n Given the limited language in the Constitution on impeachment, legal experts disagree about whether the Senate can convict a former president. But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional, because the Senate has held trials previously for former officials.\n Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, charged that Republicans were fixated on the constitutional issue because \"they don't want to be held accountable for President Trump's incitement of a mob to attack the United States Capitol.\"\n \"They don't want to be held accountable on that vote so they're going to try to make it another argument that is all about the Constitution,\" Durbin said.\n Several Senate Republicans say they agree it's constitutional, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said her review \"has led me to conclude that it is constitutional, in recognizing that impeachment is not solely about removing a president, it is also a matter of political consequence.\"\n Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who just won reelection, said Tuesday, \"I think there's probably a constitutional basis for it.\"\n \"I have more problem with the process and the expedited nature of it,\" he added.\n Several Republicans have pointed to the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts will not be presiding over the trial, while the Constitution says the chief justice should preside for the trial of a president.\n \"That would send a pretty clear signal to me what Roberts thinks of the whole thing,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, who declined to say how he would vote on Paul's motion.\n On Monday, the House impeachment managers, a group of Democratic lawmakers who will act as prosecutors presenting the case against Trump during the trial, delivered the single article of impeachment to the Senate. The article, approved by the Democrat-led House, charges Trump with incitement of insurrection for provoking the attack on the US Capitol that left multiple people dead.\n The two-week break until the trial begins will give both sides more time to prepare for the trial. Trump is still hiring lawyers for his impeachment legal defense team, which is being led by South Carolina lawyer Butch Bowers.\n As the House impeachment managers put together their plans for the trial, they are considering using a variety of video evidence to show how the rioters were responding to Trump's own words when they breached the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.\n The impeachment managers are still wading through the huge amount of video that exists from January 6 to determine what they should use at the trial, the sources said, including video posted to the conservative social media site Parler. The House's impeachment team has taken an interest in a 10-minute video compilation from the national security forum Just Security, which uses social media posts from rioters on Facebook and Parler to illustrate how they were reacting in real-time to Trump's comments at the January 6 rally as well as Trump's social media posts when they attacked the Capitol.\n No decisions have been finalized about how to use the video. The Washington Post first reported on the impeachment managers' interest in the Just Security clip.\n At the first Trump impeachment trial, House impeachment managers also used video to bolster their case that Trump had pushed for Ukraine's help to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden. The use of video for the upcoming trial is even more compelling given the disturbing images and video that have emerged of rioters ransacking the Capitol and attacking police officers.\n The transmission of the article typically triggers a quick start to an impeachment trial, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and McConnell reached a deal last week to push back the start date for the substance of the proceedings. That move will give Democrats more time to confirm Biden's Cabinet and potentially take up a new Covid-19 relief bill while Trump's defense team will have more time to prepare for trial.\n It remains to be seen how long the trial will last, whether the House impeachment managers will seek witnesses and what the exact contours of the President's legal defense will be.\n When the trial gets underway, one visible difference between the proceedings and Trump's first impeachment trial will be that instead of Roberts, the president pro tempore of the Senate, Leahy, will preside.\n It would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict Trump, a high bar to clear that looks increasingly unlikely to happen as a number of Senate Republicans are already arguing that it's illogical and may be unconstitutional to impeach a former president.\n Under the agreement reached by Schumer and McConnell, several ceremonial functions of the trial will take place this week. On Tuesday, the Senate is also expected to issue a summons to Trump, another step in the process of organizing for the trial to kick into high gear.\n Then the trial will effectively be put on hold as the impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial to begin in earnest.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

        "title": "I Can\u2019t Believe I Need to Say This, but We Need Schools More Than Bars",
        "body_text": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 For almost 10 months now, around 35 million Brazilian children have been out of school. When schools were closed in March, at the beginning of the pandemic, I thought we only had to be a little patient. As soon as we got the virus under control, they would be the first to reopen, right?\n Wrong. Brazil hasn\u2019t come close to controlling the pandemic: In the absence of national lockdowns and comprehensive mass testing, the daily death toll has remained constantly high. The most we got \u2014 beyond President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s brazen denials that anything was wrong \u2014 were a few restrictions applied here and there by local governments.\n Then as early as June, regional governors \u2014 hoping to mitigate the bleakness of the situation \u2014 thought it a good idea to slowly reopen the institutions that were most important to us: shopping centers, restaurants, bars, gyms, beauty salons, movie theaters, concert halls, even betting shops. Pretty much everything, it seemed, except for schools. And so it has mostly stayed.\n On public health grounds, this made no sense. As people resumed their cardio workouts and hair-dying habits, the virus continued to spread. And in response, teachers refused to return to schools while the risks were so high. (I don\u2019t blame them.) But surely our leaders wouldn\u2019t just cast children aside \u2014 they would have a plan for a gradual reopening, right?\n Wrong again! Ten months since schools were shuttered, everything is roughly as it was. In Brazil, bizarrely, bars have been deemed more important than schools, manicures of greater social significance than children\u2019s mental health. Most parents feel abandoned, forced to take on an intolerable burden with no support. And an entire generation of children, their development dangerously stalled, have been left to their own devices.\n The results have been dreadful. Many Brazilian students are currently receiving some version of remote learning \u2014 but only those who have the means to do so. Roughly 25 percent of students from public schools don\u2019t have access to the internet, according to one estimate. Other research found that close to a third of caregivers were concerned that their kids would drop out of school altogether.\n That\u2019s not surprising. It\u2019s hard to overemphasize the positive impact of in-person learning, which goes far beyond reading and writing to include children\u2019s physical and mental health, nutrition, safety and social skills. In its absence, pediatricians have reported a worrying rise in depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and aggressive behavior among their patients.\n And in a country as unequal as ours, this interruption is especially devastating. While in many cities private schools, sufficiently solvent to adapt their buildings, have been authorized to partially reopen for in-person classes, public schools \u2014 often, like the nursery my 2-year-old attended until March, small, unventilated and crowded \u2014 have mostly remained closed. The poorer the child, the greater the damage of school closure. (In more ways than one: At least seven million children could be going hungry at home, without access to school lunches.)\n All in all, according to a November report by the UNICEF, children in Latin America and the Caribbean have lost on average four times more days of schooling compared with the rest of the world. Most students are now at risk of missing out on an entire school year. For younger children, most affected by the lack of socialization, it\u2019s an especially big blow. There simply aren\u2019t enough studies to measure the size of the educational catastrophe we\u2019re facing here.\n I wish I had an easy solution for this tragedy, for the sake of our children. (Hey! What about turning all the bars into schools? Just picture it: teachers instead of waiters, children at the tables. We could put milk in beer kegs!) But there\u2019s no straightforward fix. Though many scientific studies show that children don\u2019t appear to be exposed to higher risks of coronavirus infection in schools and that school staff, compared with the general adult population, aren\u2019t at a higher risk either, that depends on having community transmission rates under control and mitigation measures in place.\n But in Brazil, where the second wave has crashed on the top of the first one \u2014 on Jan. 7, the country reached the mark of 200,000 Covid-19 deaths \u2014 and schools often lack the basic infrastructure to institute public health measures, those conditions are clearly not present.\n Some governors and mayors recently announced their intention to open schools in February or March, no matter what. But teachers are now refusing to go back to in-person classes until they are vaccinated. The trouble is Brazil still doesn\u2019t have a solid national immunization plan. Judging from the chaotic, inchoate rollout so far, amid the appearance of two new variants of the virus, it could take months to vaccinate all school workers.\n But doing nothing is not an option. So here are three suggestions. First, we need \u2014 right away \u2014 to increase public school funding and put in place a comprehensive plan to reform school buildings. (Many Brazilian cities could actually set up open-air schools all year long; we live in a tropical country, after all.) Second, we need to give teachers and school staff early access to vaccination, once frontline health personnel and high-risk populations are vaccinated.\n And third, we need to do something especially courageous: We should call for the closure of all nonessential services until schools are safe enough to reopen. It might not be immediately popular \u2014 people may miss their foot baths to the point of anguish \u2014 but for the well-being and future of our country\u2019s children, it is essential.\n There is an alternative, of course. Kids will have to expropriate all bars. And beauty salons. And betting shops.",

        "title": "America's billionaires have grown $1.1 trillion richer during the pandemic",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Billionaires are minting money during the pandemic, even as millions of Americans join the ranks of the poor.\n US billionaires have collectively become $1.1 trillion -- nearly 40% -- richer since mid-March, according to a report published Tuesday by progressive groups Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness.\n In other words, not only have the uber-wealthy recovered their losses from the spring, many are faring much better than before. That's in large part because of the sizzling stock market. Elon Musk alone is about $155 billion richer, boosted by Tesla's skyrocketing market valuation.\n Forty-six people joined the ranks of billionaires since March 18, 2020, the week after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, according to the report.\n Clearly, the pandemic is worsening America's already troubling inequality crisis. The staggering gains at the top contrast sharply with the financial struggles of those at the bottom, many of whom are on the front lines of the pandemic and have lost their jobs or had wages cut.\n America's 660 billionaires now hold $4.1 trillion in wealth -- two thirds more than the amount held by the bottom 50% of the US population, the report found.\n More than 8 million Americans fell into poverty during the final six months of 2020, according to real-time estimates published by economists at the University of Chicago, University of Notre Dame and the Lab for Economic Opportunities.\n The US poverty rate declined during the first few months of the pandemic, in large part because of the federal government's stimulus checks. However, the poverty rate climbed 2.4 percentage points during the second half of the year -- nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s, the economists found.\n Some groups have suffered more than others. The poverty rate for Black Americans is 5.4 percentage points higher today than in June 2020, translating to 2.4 million people who have fallen into poverty, the economists found.\n For those with a high school education or less, the poverty rate has surged to 22.5%, compared to 17% in June.\n Florida, Mississippi, Arizona and North Carolina were among the states that suffered the largest increases in poverty rates. The state-level findings \"suggest that poverty rose more in states with less effective unemployment insurance systems,\" the economists said in the report.\n The wealth and poverty statistics provide further proof of America's K-shaped economic recovery.\n The stock market is at record highs, the housing market is booming and Big Tech is thriving. However, other industries including airlines, restaurants, hotels and movie theaters are still in disarray.\n Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden's newly confirmed Treasury secretary, has acknowledged this problem and suggested it's nothing new.\n \"Well before Covid-19 infected a single American, we were living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built on wealth while working families fell further and further behind,\" Yellen told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing last week.\n Biden and Yellen are calling for bold action from Congress to ease inequality. Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks, $350 billion in state and local aid and enhanced unemployment benefits. The White House is also expected to push for a multi-trillion infrastructure package that would be aimed at further boosting the economy -- and could be financed in part by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.\n The pandemic has been a boon to the housing market, with existing home sales hitting a 14-year high in 2020. Home prices, a major source of wealth, hit a record high.\n The stock market has played a significant role in the divide between rich and poor.\n Even though the US economy has not fully recovered from the pandemic, the S&P 500 is up by 72% from its low point in March. That V-shaped recovery reflects optimism about vaccines, trillions in relief provided by Washington and unprecedented steps from the Federal Reserve that have essentially forced investors to bet on stocks.\n Not surprisingly, surging stock prices are especially helpful to the wealthy because they have more skin in the game. As of early 2020, the wealthiest 10% of US households owned 87% of all stocks and mutual funds, according to the Federal Reserve. By contrast, millions of less affluent Americans can't feel the stock market boom.\n Tesla's (TSLA) skyrocketing share price has lifted Musk's wealth by more than 600%, according to the wealth report. Other big gainers include Amazon (AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, whose wealth has climbed by more than $68 billion during the pandemic. Facebook (FB) co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is about $37 billion more wealthy than in mid-March.\n Inequality isn't just an American problem.\n It will take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recoup their losses from the pandemic, according to Oxfam International's annual inequality report released Sunday. By contrast, it took just nine months for the world's top 1,000 billionaires to recover.",

And I believe the vast majority of Americans -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- share these values and want us to act as well,\" Biden said during a signing ceremony at the White House alongside Vice President Kamala Harris. \"We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives.\"\n He added that \"it's time to act now not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it.\"\n Biden also credited protests over the death of George Floyd as having \"stirred the conscious of tens of millions of Americans, and ... marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice.\"\n As part of Tuesday's executive actions, the President directed the Justice Department not to renew federal contracts with private prisons. Biden had campaigned on eliminating the federal government's use of private prisons.\n Biden established that it is the policy of his administration to condemn and denounce anti-Asian bias, specifically addressing anti-Asian bias in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The President will be working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice on the matter.\n Biden issued a memorandum to the Department of Housing and Urban Development he said will \"redress historical racism in federal housing policies.\" He also took steps on Tuesday to reaffirm the federal government's commitment to tribal sovereignty and consultation.\n The President indicated during the signing ceremony that while previous presidential administrations have had interest in addressing equity, his administration intends to integrate racial equity policy holistically across its domestic policy efforts.\n A senior administration official said on a call with reporters earlier Tuesday that cost implications of the move away from private prison was not a \"motivating factor.\"\n \"The motivating factor, however, was the fact that private prisons are not only encouraged profiteering off of human lives but more importantly, I've been shown by the Department of Justice inspector general's report to be subpar in terms of safety and security for those incarcerated,\" the official said.\n The housing memorandum will \"make clear we have to acknowledge the role that the federal government has played through much of the 20th century and implementing discriminatory housing policies across the United States from redlining to mortgage discrimination, to destructive federal highway construction to redress this history,\" the official said.\n Reporters were also told by the official that \"the President has asked (the Office of Management and Budget) to examine opportunities to embed racial equity in its work(.)\"\n Biden has specifically asked the office, which plays a role in crafting the administration's annual budget proposals, to evaluate opportunities to allocate funding \"more equitably to target groups who have been underserved or harmed by federal investments in the past\" in its annual budget submission, the official said.\n Tuesday's executive actions are the first among more Biden administration initiatives related to equity -- including supporting future legislation in Congress.\n An earlier draft of Tuesday's plans indicated that the President was going to issue an executive order creating a policing commission, something he promised he'd create if elected to office. It also indicated that Biden would sign an order to reinstate an Obama-era policy barring the transfer of military equipment to local police departments.\n White House domestic policy adviser Susan Rice indicated during a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon that policing and criminal justice reform initiatives will be addressed in the coming weeks.\n Biden's voting history in Congress on criminal justice and prison reform issues had an impact on his presidential campaign. And Tuesday's actions, coming less than a week into his presidency, seem to be an apparent attempt to correct what he has admitted was one of his shortcomings.\n \"You know I've been in this fight for a long time. It goes not just to voting rights. It goes to the criminal justice system,\" Biden said on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2019. \"I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried.\"\n Biden helped draft the 1994 crime bill, which set strict federal sentencing standards and which critics argue led to an era of mass incarceration.\n In a 1993 Senate floor speech speaking in favor of the crime bill, Biden warned of \"predators on our streets.\"\n \"We have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created,\" Biden said. \"They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,\" Biden continued. \"And it's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.\"\n Biden's vice president, who was once his 2020 presidential race opponent, said in 2019 that she believed the bill caused mass incarceration.\n Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris said she disagreed with Biden, who had said at the time that the crime bill \"did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n \"That crime bill -- that 1994 crime bill -- it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states. So, I disagree, sadly,\" Harris said.\n Biden also expressed unequivocal support, in both 1994 and in the years following, for the law's billions in funding to build state prisons, including in his home state of Delaware. He argued in 1994 that the law should include less money for prison construction than Republicans wanted to spend -- but he emphasized that he too wanted to spend billions.\n He was also a longtime proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure while serving as a senator, which critics have said would have made investigating police officers for misconduct more difficult.\n CNN's DJ Judd, Daniel Dale, Andrew Kaczynski and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.\n This story has been updated to include additional reporting.",

        "body_text": "Washington promoted Jennifer King to assistant running backs coach Tuesday, making her the first Black female assistant position coach in the NFL.\n She is the second woman in league history to be an assistant position coach after Tampa Bay\u2019s assistant defensive line coach Lori Locust. King spent the 2020 season as a full-year coaching intern under Ron Rivera and worked with running backs coach Randy Jordan.\n Rivera said King came to Washington eager for the opportunity and is deserving of the promotion.\n \u201cThe sky is truly the limit for her,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cShe got the chance to experience not only the in-season work that goes into being a full-time coach in this league but also the countless hours that are spent preparing in the offseason, as well.\n \u201cShe demonstrated all of the qualities that are needed to work full time on my staff. She is a hard worker, a great communicator and a quality person. Coach King is always eager to learn and has shown tremendous growth since starting here last season.\u201d\n King previously interned for Rivera with the Carolina Panthers and has also been an assistant at Dartmouth College and for the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football.\n \u201cI am very pleased to have coach King back to assist me full time in the running backs room,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cShe was extremely helpful last year in seeing the game from a different perspective, and she was a tremendous communicator in our room. I look forward to continuing to collaborate as we move forward in our program and as she moves forward in her coaching career.\u201d\n Washington\u2019s playoff game against the now- Super Bowl-bound Buccaneers was the first NFL playoff game to have a female coach on each sideline. Tampa Bay had two: Locust and assistant strength and conditioning coach Maral Javadifar, and coach Bruce Arians called women in coaching \u201cthe wave of the future.\u201d\n \u201cThis game, it\u2019s a tremendous game,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIt should be open to everybody in terms of opportunities to play, opportunities to coach or opportunities to lead the organization. I think that\u2019s an important message that the league is putting out there.\u201d\n ___\n More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

        "title": "Paul O\u2019Sullivan found people with his name on Facebook. Naturally, they formed a band.",
        "body_text": "When Paul O\u2019Sullivan spontaneously searched his own name on Facebook, a seemingly endless scroll of Paul O\u2019Sullivan profiles appeared.\n Out of curiosity \u2014 and perhaps a bit of boredom \u2014 O\u2019Sullivan, 33, sent friend requests to a handful of them.\n \u201cI wondered what my name twins were up to out in the world,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan, a music instructor who was born in Baltimore and lives in Eldersburg, Md.\n Some of them accepted the random request, and O\u2019Sullivan soon discovered that a few had more in common than just the name.\n \u201cTheir posts started showing up on my Facebook timeline,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cOne Paul O\u2019Sullivan posted a picture of his Fender jazz bass, another had a profile picture of him singing live, and another had a bucket list of accomplishments that completely piqued my curiosity.\u201d\n He decided to individually contact the three strangers with matching names, all of whom responded. Although they were admittedly skeptical at first, a bond was quickly forged.\n Beyond their shared names, a common affinity for music drew them together. O\u2019Sullivan got an idea: \u201cI thought, \u2018we should start a band.\u2019 It was the natural next step.\u201d\n First, O\u2019Sullivan introduced the other Paul O\u2019Sullivans to each other: Paul O\u2019Sullivan, 57, of Manchester, England, is a former college lecturer who now works in public health; Paul O\u2019Sullivan, 52, of Rotterdam, Netherlands, is a grief counselor and teacher; and Paul O\u2019Sullivan, 57, of Weatherly, Pa., is an antiques dealer and former publicist.\n To avoid confusion, the Paul O\u2019Sullivans started using their distinct geographic locations when referring to one another. Paul O\u2019Sullivan from Baltimore became Baltimore Paul, and so on.\n Baltimore Paul eventually pitched his idea for a cross-continental musical collaboration to his name twins, who immediately got on board. Of course, it didn\u2019t take long to decide on a name: The Paul O\u2019Sullivan Band.\n \u201cIn the beginning, I thought this guy was crazy, but good crazy,\u201d said Rotterdam Paul, during a Zoom interview with all four band members. \u201cBut we just dived in and it\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride, especially the last year.\u201d\n The four Paul O\u2019Sullivans originally connected and started making music together virtually in 2016, but the band only took off recently. Although they informally rehearsed together and became close friends over the years, they were each busy in their own lives and couldn\u2019t dedicate much time to the band.\n Then the pandemic hit, and with their newfound free time, the group spent the past several months recording an album titled \u201cInternet Famous: A Retrospective,\u201d composed of six cover songs and one original, released Dec. 30.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been social distancing since 2016,\u201d said Baltimore Paul. \u201cWe perfected the system of remote collaboration before it was even relevant.\u201d\n For the quartet of Paul O\u2019Sullivans, band practice became a welcome distraction from the pandemic.\n \u201cSo many doors had closed because of covid, and yet, Baltimore Paul had already opened this door for us, so it was so easy to walk through,\u201d said Pennsylvania Paul. \u201cFrom that, we sort of developed our ethos, which is: \u2018If it makes you smile, lean into it; if it makes you dance, embrace it; and if it does both, it\u2019s the Paul O\u2019Sullivan Band.\u201d\n Rotterdam Paul agreed: \u201cEvery day I would wake up to messages from them. It felt like a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n On top of their differing geographic locations, \u201cWe come from different generations,\u201d said Baltimore Paul. \u201cBut with us, it never mattered. Music really does bring people together.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all very exciting for me, being a gentleman of a certain age,\u201d said Manchester Paul, who is 57. \u201cWhen [Baltimore] Paul added me, it was just part of the wonder of the Internet.\u201d\n Meeting the other Pauls and making music with them, he said, has been a thrill.\n Their first single, \u201cNamesake,\u201d is about a long-distance relationship, much like their own. The opening line of the song is, \u201cWe\u2019ve grown so fond from across the pond.\u201d\n Baltimore Paul and Rotterdam Paul are on vocals and guitar, while Manchester Paul plays bass, and Pennsylvania Paul is on percussion.\n The group convenes regularly via Zoom and other platforms from their respective homes to write, organize and catch up. Because of the time lag on video calls, they are unable to record music simultaneously. Instead, they separately record their parts, in an assembly line of sorts, until the final track is produced.\n Despite being unable to rehearse and record together like traditional bands do, \u201cwhat we can do is create that bond and that understanding that lends itself to the ability to create music,\u201d said Pennsylvania Paul.\n While recording his part, \u201cI close my eyes and think we\u2019re in the studio playing together. Just trying to imagine that we are together is a good feeling,\u201d said Rotterdam Paul.\n Their complementary musical capabilities and character traits work well together, the Pauls said.\n \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be with these guys. Everybody has a different personality, and we all bring something different to the table,\u201d said Pennsylvania Paul. \u201cThe band is an amalgam of all of our skills, visions and joy.\u201d\n Given that the album was recorded remotely from four locations, \u201cI\u2019m so surprised by how cohesive it turned out,\u201d said Baltimore Paul. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny how easily it came together, when you trust in those serendipitous situations.\u201d\n The Pauls described their genre as \u201cadult pop\u201d and acoustic but said they are enthusiastic about dipping into new styles of music.\n \u201cWe\u2019re open to everything,\u201d said Rotterdam Paul. \u201cWe love to try out new things together.\u201d\n The four band mates have yet to meet in person, aside from Baltimore Paul and Pennsylvania Paul, who met for the first time in September. Baltimore Paul quarantined before driving three hours to Weatherly to surprise Pennsylvania Paul at his house.\n \u201cI was super nervous in the car outside of his house, but there was a strange calmness when we actually met,\u201d said Baltimore Paul. \u201cIt felt like we had known each other our whole lives.\u201d\n The Pauls also discovered that along with their shared name and love of music, they have a similar fashion sense. Naturally, Baltimore Paul and Pennsylvania Paul were wearing similar outfits when they met \u2014 a flannel shirt and jeans.\n Once the pandemic subsides, \u201chaving everyone together in the studio is the ultimate goal,\u201d said Baltimore Paul, adding that they have written 24 additional original songs together, which they plan to release in the future. \u201cMy idea is to do a four-city tour, where we do a concert in each person\u2019s hometown.\u201d\n But the band is about more than making music, the Pauls agreed. They said they\u2019re bonded as brothers for life.\n \u201cThere is something very difficult to put your finger on about the friendship that you develop with people that you share the same name with,\u201d Manchester Paul explained. \u201cI never thought it was a thing, but indeed, it is a very nice thing.\u201d\n Read more:\n Upset by veterans who stormed the Capitol, these vets decided to clean up trash the mob left on the streets of D.C.\n This man has given away 500 free pizzas.

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 26 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n (CNN) The scramble for vaccines is getting ugly. The European Union, facing a shortfall in supply,  is threatening to impose tighter export rules on vaccines.\n The EU said drugmaker AstraZeneca had \"surprisingly\" cut down the number of doses it intends to supply to the bloc. Top EU officials did not mince words criticizing the company.\n \"The European Union has pre-financed the development of the vaccine and its production and wants to see the return,\" the European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, said yesterday. The EU said AstraZeneca didn't provide sufficient explanations for the delays and is now demanding to know how many doses the company has produced, and who they've been sold to.\n The company said that production had been hampered by a manufacturing issue. \"While there is no scheduled delay to the start of shipments of our vaccine should we receive approval in Europe, initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,\" AstraZeneca said in a statement.\n The delays are having a real impact in countries across the bloc. The Italian government was forced to revise its Covid-19 vaccination plan because of reduced vaccine supplies from both Pfizer and AstraZeneca.\n Yet European countries and other rich nations are still on the winning side of the world's struggle to secure enough vaccines for everyone.\n While US President Joe Biden said yesterday that he expects America to soon be vaccinating 1.5 million people a day, there are countries that haven't yet been able to secure any doses at all.\n The vaccine rollout has shone a harsh light on global income disparities, and the Middle East is a microcosm of that problem. While oil-rich Gulf Arab nations were among the first in the world to receive a vaccine, war-torn countries such as Yemen and Syria must contend with vague timelines and complex distribution plans for the rollout, despite being among the worst affected by the virus.\n Delayed access to vaccines will likely make this inequality worse, because countries that manage to get most of their populations immunized will be able to reopen their economies, while those at the back of the line will be stuck in perpetual lockdowns.\n But there are some positive signs. New data from Israel show that only about 0.01% of 128,600 people who received two doses of Pfizer's vaccine tested positive for the coronavirus after their second shot -- and those patients had only a mild illness, according to preliminary data from an Israeli health care system.\n Send your questions here.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Rochelle Walensky and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith join Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta for a CNN Town Hall this Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET.\n People in the United Kingdom have been living under lockdown for the past three weeks, hoping their sacrifice would bring the country's latest coronavirus surge -- caused by the new, more contagious variant of the virus -- under control.\n But despite the harsh restrictions, case numbers are not dropping as fast as experts have hoped. Deaths continue to rise and public health experts are starting to warn people that the country will be in this battle for the long run. The government is now considering further restrictions on travel to and from the UK, and is set to make an announcement later today regarding the use of hotel quarantine on travelers, according to vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi\n China has been praised for its \"vaccine diplomacy,\" promising shots to developing countries and investing in vaccine candidates that do not require expensive cold storage to be effective. But as questions have been raised over the effectiveness of one of those vaccines, the country's state media has reacted aggressively, targeting not just critics but also other vaccines, in an apparent effort to tear down their reputation in the name of defending the Chinese shots, James Griffiths reports.\n Manaus, an isolated city at the core of the Brazilian rainforest, is witnessing its second coronavirus wave, a shock to the many who thought its first wave was so widespread that herd immunity must be the result. The healthcare system in the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Amazonas has now collapsed under pressure. This means waiting hours in line to buy an oxygen tank -- only to find there's none left. Or rushing from hospital to hospital with a sick spouse or parent -- only to find there are no beds available. Natalie Gall\u00f3n and Marcia Reverdosa report.\n Biden is set to reinstate coronavirus-related travel restrictions that Trump lifted.The Pentagon is weighing up deploying thousands of troops to help Biden reach his vaccination target.Tom Brady's dad has revealed his 'life and death' battle with Covid-19.Merck is stopping development of its Covid-19 vaccine candidates.New Zealand's borders may stay shut for most of the year.Google Maps will soon display Covid-19 vaccination sites, beginning in four states: Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n It's an all-out sprint to get Americans vaccinated. As you prepare to get your shot, here are 10 actions experts suggest doing -- and avoiding.\n DO: Get your vaccine when it's your turn.DON'T: Let disinformation on vaccines cloud your judgment.DO: Get vaccinated if you've already had Covid-19.DON'T: Get a shot if you currently have Covid-19 or have been exposed.DO: Get the shot even if you still have Covid-19 symptoms months later.DON'T: Get another type of vaccine within 14 days of the Covid-19 shot.DO: Tell vaccine staff about any allergies or past allergic reactions.DON'T: Drive away before your 15- to 30-minute wait is up.DO: Get your second shot of vaccine within the recommended time frame.DO: Continue wearing masks and practicing social distancing after your shots.\n \"If politics wants to change the findings of science, that's where you just say no. That line wasn't clear this past year, and that line has to be very clear going forward.\" --  Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC",

        "title": "Sarah Sanders announces run for Arkansas governor",
        "body_text": "When President Donald Trump announced that Sarah Sanders would be departing her job as White House press secretary in June 2019, he urged her to run for governor of Arkansas. \u201cShe would be fantastic,\u201d Trump tweeted at the time.\n Now, less than a week after Trump himself left the White House under the cloud of a second impeachment, Sanders announced in a nearly eight-minute video Monday that she\u2019s following his suggestion. Sanders, who endeared herself to Trump\u2019s base while combatively \u2014 and sometimes misleadingly \u2014 sparring with the press, is seen by many as an early favorite in the race to lead a heavily GOP state where Trump\u2019s role in the U.S. Capitol riot may not hurt her appeal.\n \u201cI took on the media, the radical left and their \u2018cancel culture,\u2019 and I won. As governor, I will be your voice, and never let them silence you,\u201d Sanders said in the announcement.\n Sanders, a 38-year-old Arkansas native and daughter of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), managed her father\u2019s unsuccessful presidential run in 2016 before joining Trump\u2019s campaign as senior communications adviser. She also served as a spokeswoman during Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign.\n At the White House, she first worked as the top deputy to Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s first press secretary, until he resigned in July 2017, when she assumed his role. She was the first working mother and only the third woman to serve as White House press secretary, as reported by the Associated Press.\n During her early days, some praised her calm demeanor in then-daily briefings with the press \u2014 a stark contrast to Spicer. But Sanders soon clashed with reporters, passionately defending Trump while confronting the press \u2014 even when the information she provided was, at times, false.\n One such instance earned a note in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report on Russian interference in the election. In May 2017, Sanders claimed that the White House had heard from \u201ccountless members of the FBI\u201d supporting Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director James B. Comey. She doubled down on the claim the next day, insisting that supportive emails and texts had flown in.\n In Mueller\u2019s report, though, she said under oath that the claim was a \u201cslip of the tongue.\u201d\n Despite Sanders\u2019s adversarial relationship with most reporters, some members of the White House press corps stood by her when comedian Michelle Wolf roasted her at the 2018 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, including with some jokes that appeared to bash Sanders\u2019s physical appearance.\n Sanders, who sat at a head table, stared blankly at Wolf, while other Republicans said they walked out of the room in support. Some journalists, like New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, praised Sanders\u2019s response, calling it \u201cimpressive.\u201d\n But as Sanders continued her passionate defenses of Trump, she became so controversial that two months later, she was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant where she was having dinner. Stephanie Wilkinson, the co-owner of the Red Hen in Lexington, Va., asked her to leave, noting that some gay employees at the restaurant were uncomfortable with serving her given her role backing Trump\u2019s policies, including barring transgender people from the military.\n Near the end of her tenure, after the release of the Mueller report, her once-daily news briefings were curtailed, giving way to long stretches of silence. Sanders, who had also become well-known for not answering emails or calls to her office seeking comment, sometimes held sessions with reporters on a White House driveway and often appeared on Fox News. She once went 94 days without a formal press briefing.\n Then, after 23 months on the job, she left in June 2019 and returned to Arkansas. Months after leaving her role, Sanders hinted that she planned to mount a political campaign.\n \u201cThere are two types of people who run for office,\u201d Sanders told the Times in November 2019. \u201cPeople that are called and people that just want to be a senator or governor. I feel like I\u2019ve been called.\u201d\n Her announcement on Monday thrusts her into a race to replace Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), who is term-limited and cannot seek reelection in 2022. Sanders will run against Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in the Republican primary. No Democrats have formally announced their candidacy.\n Although Trump\u2019s popularity has fallen to all-time low numbers following the Jan. 6 riots, the former president has remained popular in Arkansas.\n Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Hall of Fame voters pitch a shutout as character questions muddle Cooperstown debate",
        "body_text": "The National Baseball Hall of Fame voters, who hold the awesome power of bestowing immortality on the greatest players in the sport \u2014 or, if you prefer, who face the awful duty of determining how that power should be applied \u2014 pitched a collective shutout Tuesday, failing to send a single player to Cooperstown, N.Y.\n On a day when luminaries such as Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling found out they would have to wait at least another year to gain induction to the hall \u2014 each fell short, for the ninth year in a row, of the 75 percent vote threshold required for election \u2014 the sole winner, such as it was, was the so-called \u201ccharacter\u201d clause in the voting instructions that, more than statistics, decided this year\u2019s outcome.\n Schilling, a two-time strikeout champion and six-time all-star over a 20-year career, seemed poised to make the cut after slowly building support over the years among the 10-year members of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America who make up the electorate. However, Schilling, a vociferous right-wing provocateur and Twitter antagonist, appears to have been penalized by some voters for his political views and intolerance.\n Schilling was named on 285 of the 401 ballots cast \u2014 or 71.1 percent \u2014 leaving him 16 votes shy of enshrinement, slightly better than his 70 percent showing of a year ago. He has one more chance next year before falling off the writers\u2019 ballot.\n As for Bonds and Clemens \u2014 the premier hitter and pitcher of their generation, if not of all time \u2014 both have unassailable statistical cases, but both continue to fall short of election because of their association with performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds was chosen on 61.8 percent of ballots, Clemens on 61.6 percent \u2014 both slightly up from a year ago but still more than 50 votes shy of making the cut, with one last chance for both next year.\n This year\u2019s shutout brings to a halt an unprecedented expansion of the rolls of Cooperstown, with the writers electing 22 players between 2014 and 2020 \u2014 the most new entrants to the Hall of Fame in any seven-year span since the writers began voting in 1936 \u2014 including four each in 2015, 2018 and 2019.\n But this summer\u2019s induction, should Hall of Fame officials permit it to go forward, would still see four people enshrined: Derek Jeter and Larry Walker, who were elected by the writers in January 2020, and Ted Simmons and former union chief Marvin Miller, who were elected by the Modern Baseball Era Committee in December 2019. All were due to be inducted in July 2020 until the ceremony was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Further down the ballot, a handful of candidates made strong leaps that positioned them to make the cut in the future. The largest gain was made by third baseman Scott Rolen, who went from 35.3 percent a year ago, his third year on the ballot, to 52.9 percent this time. Others who enjoyed big increases were reliever Billy Wagner (46.4 percent in his sixth year on the ballot), first baseman Todd Helton (44.9 percent in his third year) and slugger Gary Sheffield (40.6 percent in his seventh year).\n Fourteen voters, the most in the history of the writers\u2019 vote, cast blank ballots this year \u2014 either as a protest or to indicate they felt none of the 25 candidates on the ballot was worthy.\n The Hall of Fame, in its instructions to voters, asks them to make their choices based on not only players\u2019 record and ability but also their \u201cintegrity, sportsmanship [and] character\u201d \u2014 words many voters have cited in refusing to choose steroid-tainted sluggers since the first of them, Mark McGwire in 2007, began appearing on the ballot.\n Schilling presented an altogether different calculus, with some voters acknowledging his career record \u2014 which includes 216 regular season wins, 3,116 strikeouts and a dazzling 11-2 record and 2.23 ERA in the postseason \u2014 was worthy of election but opting to leave him off their ballots because of his political views and social media behavior.\n Schilling has endorsed the lynching of journalists and was fired by ESPN in 2016 for mocking transgender people. More recently, he has voiced support for the perpetrators of the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. That was well after the deadline for voters to submit their ballots; however, in its wake at least one voter petitioned the Hall of Fame, unsuccessfully, to alter the ballot retroactively to a \u201cno\u201d vote for Schilling.\n \u201cCurt Schilling needs to know, or be reminded, there are consequences to what he says,\u201d Mark Faller, sports editor of the Arizona Republic, wrote in a column last month explaining his \u201cno\u201d vote for Schilling. \u201c \u2026 If he ever deserved this honor, he lost it by his own words and actions. He does not deserve to be on that podium in July.\u201d\n Other voters have pointed out the hypocrisy of applying the character clause to Schilling, Bonds, Clemens and others when the rolls of Cooperstown already include various scoundrels, womanizers and racists \u2014 as well as, almost certainly, steroid users who did not get caught.\n After years of steady gains among voters, Schilling\u2019s candidacy appeared to reach a crucial benchmark a year ago, when he was named on 278 of 397 ballots cast \u2014 or 70 percent. In the history of the writers\u2019 ballot, 20 of the 21 players who hit the 70 percent mark with additional years of eligibility eventually gained election. (The exception, Jim Bunning, would be voted in by the Veterans Committee.)\n In a letter to the Hall of Fame that he shared on his Facebook page following the release of the vote totals Tuesday, Schilling defended his record, both as a pitcher and as a citizen, and accused the media of distorting his image for the public with \u201chit pieces\u201d against him.\n \u201cMy love of this country has always been worn on my sleeve,\u201d he wrote. The writers who covered him as a player, he added, \u201cKNOW what they are claiming is untrue yet they quote, re-quote and link to one another story after story that began as lies and grew into bigger ones.\u201d\n Schilling also wrote that he is \u201cat peace\u201d with the notion he will not get into Cooperstown via the writers\u2019 ballot and asked that his name be withdrawn from next year\u2019s ballot.\n This year\u2019s shutout could lend more ammunition to critics who say the writers are the wrong group to adjudicate debates over character and integrity, let alone decide whose career body of work was and wasn\u2019t worthy of Cooperstown. Increasingly, those critics include many of the writers eligible to cast votes. (The Washington Post is among a handful of media outlets that do not permit their otherwise eligible employees to vote for the Hall of Fame.)\n In recent years, a handful of prominent baseball writers, including Buster Olney and Jeff Passan of ESPN and Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic, have decided to stop voting for the Hall of Fame or said they were considering stopping \u2014 out of frustration, as Rosenthal wrote, with \u201cthe inconsistencies we cannot avoid, the false equivalencies we create [and] the rationalizations that require leaps in logic.\u201d\n The period of reflection regarding the candidacies of Bonds, Clemens and Schilling is nearly expired, with all three facing a 10th and final year on the ballot.\n But for anyone wishing the character debate would simply go away, there is bad news: Among the players who will appear for the first time on next year\u2019s ballot are David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez, sluggers associated with steroids during their careers and whose candidacies all but ensure the character clause will be in play for at least another decade.",

        "title": "These high schoolers turned their tough experiences during the pandemic into powerful memoirs",
        "body_text": "(CNN) A teenager left to care for his family. One who found his faith, and another who watched his father relapse into addiction. They are the firsthand accounts of a group of New Jersey high school students living during the pandemic, brought together in one powerful memoir.\n The idea for the memoir came from Shawn Adler, an English teacher at Cliffside Park High School, who wanted to document what his students were going through -- both as a way for them to take ownership of their experiences and to share it with the world through creative writing.\n \"I was devastated to know that they were going through this, and many of them are going through this feeling alone.\" Adler said. \"You know, your first reaction as a teacher is always, 'What can I do? How can I help?'\"\n Adler, a former journalist, said his students were over the moon with the idea.\n \"I was expecting them to roll their eyes. I was expecting them to give me the teenage cynicism,\" he said. \"They were so immediately on board with the project, I was flabbergasted.\"\n The students' accounts are actually part of a second volume of stories, \"The Class of Covid-19: Second Wave,\" published by Adler, which came out this month. The first volume, \"The Class of Covid-19: Insights from the Inside,\" came out in June with contributions from 46 students. A deluxe edition with both volumes was released in January as well.\n After what Adler described in the book's introduction as a \"never-ending roller coaster due to COVID,\" the 24 memoirs in the second volume are a bit darker than the first.\n Adler said new students reached out to him wanting to share their experiences, so he spoke to the administration about publishing the second volume.\n \"I approached the administration and they were really on board and it became a club.\" Adler says he contacted all the new kids who were \"desperate to tell their stories\" and did the \"same thing again.\"\n In the second volume, 16-year-old Wilbert Alvarez writes he and the other five members of his immediate family caught Covid-19 at the same time.\n Wilbert explained that when his parents grew feeble, he had to take on their responsibilities.\n He \"had to think about the incoming bills, because they weren't working,\" he wrote. The food supply at home dwindled, and he had to make a trip to the grocery store with his sister, putting on two masks and \"all kinds of protective gear.\"\n \"There was truly no one left to care for us when we needed care the most,\" Wilbert wrote.\n While Wilbert dealt with the physical effects of the virus, Sofia Loiacono struggled with the mental and emotional effects.\n Loiacono said publishing the memoirs gave Sofia and her classmates a sense of relief.\n \"You see them brighten up, you see them sit up straighter, you see them speak more eloquently about their experiences,\" Loiacono said.\n Adler said the book encouraged students to control their own narrative after months of living through the pandemic.\n \"They kept feeling powerless,\" Adler said. \"And I thought, what an opportunity to share their stories and share their voices and to claim some of that power back from the universe.\"\n Student Julianna Baldwin said that's exactly how she felt when she contributed to the memoir.\n \"I was feeling helpless,\" the 16-year-old said. \"By me writing this book, it was giving me the potential to help even one person by sharing my story. And that filled me with the strength to keep going every day.\"\n Sixteen-year-old Nareg Kassardjian said writing about the impact Covid-19 had on his Christian faith was healing.\n \"No one ever asked, 'How do you feel about church being closed? Or how are you feeling?'\" Nareg said. The writing was \"like therapy,\" he said, and helped him appreciate going to church: \"You never know the true worth of something until you lose it.\"\n In the books is also a memoir from Benjamin Luderer, a beloved teacher and coach who died in March due to complications from Covid-19.\n The books can be purchased on Amazon, and according to Adler, 100% of the profits will go toward a scholarship fund for the students.",

        "title": "CDC finds scant spread of coronavirus in schools with precautions in place",
        "body_text": "Schools operating in person have seen scant transmission of the coronavirus, particularly when masks and distancing are employed, but some indoor athletics have led to infections and should be curtailed if schools want to operate safely, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in papers published Tuesday.\n The CDC team reviewed data from studies in the United States and abroad and found the experience in schools differed from nursing homes and high-density work sites where rapid spread has occurred.\n \u201cThe preponderance of available evidence from the fall school semester has been reassuring,\u201d wrote three CDC researchers in a viewpoint piece published online Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cThere has been little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.\u201d\n The review, which echoes the conclusions of other researchers, comes as many school districts continue to wrestle with whether and how to reopen schools and as President Biden makes a return to in-person learning one of his top pandemic-related priorities.\n A new CDC study, also published Tuesday, looked at 17 rural K-12 schools in Wisconsin and found just seven out of 191 coronavirus cases resulted from in-school transmission. Researchers noted that students and staff in these schools wore masks almost all the time.\n \u201cThe conclusion here is with proper prevention efforts .\u2009.\u2009. we can keep transmission in schools and educational settings quite low,\u201d said Margaret A. Honein, the lead author of the JAMA report. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that at the beginning of the year but the data has really accumulated.\u201d\n The CDC said communities should work to reduce overall levels of transmission to prevent school-based spread of the virus. That means policies such as restrictions on indoor dining at restaurants.\n Still, Honein said, even in places with high infection rates, there is no evidence that schools will transmit the virus at rates that are any higher than those seen in the general community. She said they can operate safely as long as precautions are employed.\n Specifically, the CDC recommends that schools require masks, allow for a distance of six feet between people and keep students in cohorts to limit the number of people who must quarantine in the case of an exposure. It also recommends screening tests to identify asymptomatic infected people, and increased air ventilation.\n \u201cWith good prevention, we can safely reopen and keep open more schools,\u201d said Honein, lead for the CDC State and Local Health Department Covid Task Force.\n There are differing views about exactly what is needed to reopen safely.\n \u201cSchools all over the country have very different levels of mitigation measures,\u201d said Leana Wen, a physician and public health professor at George Washington University. She said she hoped the CDC would release new guidelines specifying exactly what is needed. Wen also worried that parents see open schools as an invitation for other activities, which may not be as closely monitored and which are not essential to children in the same way. \u201cWe should not misunderstand schools being open to also mean kids getting together for play dates,\u201d she said.\n The CDC researchers said they were particularly concerned about indoor sports and other extracurricular activities that do not allow for distancing and mask use.\n Another new CDC report described two December high school wrestling tournaments in Florida where 30 percent of the 130 athletes, coaches and referees who participated were then diagnosed with the virus. The actual rates might be higher, the report noted, as fewer than half the participants were tested.\n After the tournaments, testing was conducted among the 95 people in close contact with the infected tournament participants, and found 43 percent of them tested positive. One person, an adult over age 50, died.\n Wrestling, the report noted, is an activity where distancing is not possible and wearing masks is not safe.\n \u201cThe bottom line for me is really prioritizing the in-person educational setting and making the hard choices both in communities and in schools about other activities that we value but might have to be postponed to not jeopardize our children\u2019s education,\u201d Honein said in an interview.\n To try to reopen schools, Biden has asked Congress for $130 billion to offset costs and has promised better guidance from his administration on how to do so safely. President Donald Trump also pushed schools to open, though provided little guidance, data collection or funding to help them.\n Biden says his goal is to have a majority of K-8 schools open within 100 days of taking office, though he has not said how he will calculate this metric, or whether hybrid systems, where students divide their time between learning in school and at home, would count.\n A survey of 13,597 school districts by MCH Strategic Data, cited by the CDC, found 17 percent of school districts were fully open for in-person instruction in the fall and 51 percent used a hybrid model, with 24 percent fully online.\n Little was known about the spread of the virus in schools when the pandemic shuttered virtually every classroom in America last spring. Over the summer and into the fall, administrators struggled to balance fears of the virus against the academic and emotional toll that online learning was taking on children.\n Some parents have demanded a return to classrooms, but others fear it, particularly parents of color whose communities have been ravaged by the pandemic.\n As the school year progressed, evidence emerged that virus transmission inside schools was low, giving some comfort. Yet at the same time, infection rates began to soar, increasing fears about the dangers.\n Teachers in many communities have lobbied strongly against going back, and some with strong unions have been able to slow or prevent a return. In Chicago, for instance, members of the Chicago Teachers Union are refusing orders to come back to buildings as the public schools attempt to resume in-person education.Chris Geovanis, a spokeswoman for the Chicago union, said Chicago Public Schools has failed to implement the safety measures recommended by the CDC. She said principals do not have proper protective equipment, hand sanitizer, bathroom soap or ventilation systems. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve asked for is enforceable safety standards to make sure all the mitigation that should be happening is actually happening,\u201d she said. The school district says it has followed all safety guidelines and made $100 million in health and safety investments ahead of reopening.\n The CDC review published Tuesday cited three domestic studies, including the Wisconsin research, and two from abroad.\n In Mississippi, a study among children found that attending gatherings and social functions outside the home and having people over increased risk of infection but attending school in person did not.\n A study in 11 North Carolina schools districts, with more than 90,000 students and staff, found within-school virus transmissions to be \u201cvery rare\u201d\u2014 just 32 infections acquired in school vs. 773 acquired in the community. The study found no cases of student-to-staff transmission.\n The researchers also looked at data from two international studies. A report from Europe found that schools were not increasing community spread. In Israel, however, there was a large outbreak in a high school last May. Researchers noted that in this case, classrooms were crowded, not everybody wore masks and an air-conditioning system recycled interior air in closed rooms.",

        "title": "Fairfax County should open schools  or stop vaccinating teachers",
        "body_text": "Rory Cooper is the parent of three Fairfax County elementary school students. He was an adviser to former congressman Eric Cantor (R-Va.).\n The Fairfax County school system demanded and then received high-priority placement for teachers and administrators to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. Those vaccines began a week ago, and, according to the Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Scott Brabrand, 5,000 teachers have received their first dose and an additional 22,000 teachers are registered to receive their first dose soon.\n And yet, having jumped to the front of the vaccine line, Brabrand, the FCPS School Board and the teachers union are delaying opening schools. That raises the question of why they have the priority placement to begin with, and whether these vaccinations should be immediately halted so that high-risk individuals or public servants who have been working outside of their homes for the entirety of the year have access.\n There is simply no common-sense explanation for vaccinating teachers ahead of other high-risk groups if they refuse to return to full-time in-person learning. The simple truth is that the Fairfax school system wants the benefits of heroism without taking a heroic action.\n At the Jan. 21 school board meeting, Fairfax Education Association President Kimberly Adams said she received her first vaccine dose on Jan. 14, two days ahead of the scheduled start for school personnel. She has said that her union would not support a return to full-time education even in the fall. The fall. As in September 2021. Nine months after she was vaccinated.\n The union says that all students must also be vaccinated. Never mind that no current vaccine has been approved for use on children under the age of 14. Adams also wants 14 days of zero community spread. Neither of these goals is likely to occur this calendar year. The excuses pile up faster than the half-inch of snow that typically shuts down school operations.\n Students are struggling. They have been locked out of schools for nearly a year now. Children with learning disabilities have had little to no support. Special-needs children were turned away from a hybrid return by the union. Kindergartners have never seen their schools. Return dates have been continually pushed back, usually the night before a return was scheduled, resulting in a few tears shed in our home (by the kids, too).\n Academically, students are struggling. The data shows that decisively. Emotionally, they\u2019re struggling. Sadly, the data also shows that decisively, and parents are seeing it. Real harm is being caused to them, and it\u2019s by the people meant to look out for them. And they want that harm to continue for another year.\n Typically, when the school opening debate is had, union allies line up to accuse parents of wanting teachers to get sick or wanting increased community spread. Or they selfishly accuse parents of wanting a day care not an education. These insulting and bad-faith arguments are not supported by science or medical, pediatric and pandemic experts who almost universally say schools should be open for public health purposes.\n Schools are indeed open all across this country five days a week. Teachers without vaccines in public schools elsewhere, or private schools right here in Fairfax County, are working every day with reasonable mitigation efforts and with very little negative consequence. A valid question is whether these teachers who have been in-person for months or the entire year have also been skipped in the vaccination line by the Fairfax teachers union.\n Last week, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced that his state is prepared to take all available legislative and legal action to get schools reopened in the next several weeks. He was, of course, attacked by unions in his own state. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Fairfax County Chairman Jeffrey McKay (D) continue to hide from this issue altogether and must hope that people simply forget that we even have a governor or county government.\n It bears repeating that Fairfax County schools are some of the best-funded schools in our nation. They have had a year to make plans and use their incredible resources to open schools. Instead they have done very little to that effect, leaning on their four-day-a-week schedule of laptop time. And this funding is at risk because taxpaying parents are voting with their feet and are either begging for entry to private schools or leaving the county altogether.\n The school board, under threat of recall by several parent groups, has shown itself to be completely unprepared and unwilling to execute their positions responsibly. Voters should sign recall petitions and remember their incompetence at the ballot box.\n Countless people with serious health risks may not see a vaccine for months. They were told to wait for the teachers. And now school administrators simply don\u2019t want to make good on the promise of their position in the vaccine line. It\u2019s time to open the schools full time or get new administrators. Really, we should do both.\n Read more:\n Letter to the editor: Fairfax County Public Schools get an F on adapting to covid this year\n Letter to the editor: Fairfax County Public Schools\u2019 online teaching needs adjusting\n Helaine Olen: It\u2019s time to admit it: Remote education is a failure\n Emily Oster: Schools are not spreading covid-19.

        "title": "San Francisco 49ers Increase Leeds United Ownership Stake",
        "body_text": "Two years after dipping their toe in English soccer, the N.F.L.\u2019s San Francisco 49ers have doubled down on their bet.\n The 49ers on Monday announced that they had increased their ownership stake in the Premier League club Leeds United to 37 percent from 15 percent, a move that further embeds American interests in the world\u2019s richest soccer league.\n Paraag Marathe, the 49ers executive who has held a seat on the Leeds United board since San Francisco\u2019s initial investment in 2018, will become vice chairman of Leeds United, whose majority owner will remain Andrea Radrizzani, the Italian entrepreneur. The 49ers and Leeds United did not provide financial details of the deal to increase the N.F.L. team\u2019s ownership stake, though it is likely to represent a significant premium on the amount the 49ers spent in 2018, when Leeds was still playing in England\u2019s second-tier Championship.\n In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in July, Radrizzani boasted that his initial investment in Leeds of 100 million pounds (about $140 million) had tripled in value. If the club remains in the Premier League, he predicted its valuation could double again in the next three years.\n The deal with the 49ers also ends speculation about potential new investment in Leeds. Over the past year, Radrizzani openly talked about selling off more of his ownership stake in Leeds, a team he is hoping to return to its former status as a major player in English soccer.\n Marathe, whose duties with the 49ers include oversight of the team\u2019s outside business ventures, told The New York Times in July of the 49ers\u2019 wish to increase their investment in Leeds, and to complete a deal as quickly as possible.\n While a deal is now done, it was not quick, smooth or simple, Marathe said, because of complications created by the coronavirus pandemic.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been doing deals my whole career, and it\u2019s always easier to have a meeting of the minds when the minds are actually physically next to each other, so that, first and foremost, made it very complicated,\u201d Marathe said in a video interview in which he was joined by Radrizzani.\n Radrizzani confirmed he had talked to other parties about investing in Leeds United, including the Qatari owners of Paris St.-Germain, the perennial French champion.\n The 49ers\u2019 new commitment to English soccer underlines the growing synergy and potential for growth that the owners of N.F.L. franchises see in English soccer. The Glazer family, which owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has controlled Manchester United since 2005; Arsenal is backed by the Los Angeles Rams owner E. Stanley Kroenke; and Fulham, which like Leeds United won promotion to return to the Premier League for this season, is owned by Shahid Khan, who also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars. Liverpool, the reigning Premier League champion, is controlled by Fenway Sports Group, owner of baseball\u2019s Boston Red Sox. Crystal Palace and most recently Burnley have also attracted American investment in recent years.\n \u201cI can\u2019t really speak for other American owners and what they\u2019re doing, but for us it\u2019s about synergy and partnership,\u201d Marathe said. \u201cWhatever sport it is, it\u2019s still operating under the same premise: You have media rights, you have ticket sales, you have commercial, hospitality and you have your players. Everything is the same.\u201d\n The 49ers\u2019 plan in increasing their stake, Marathe added, is to bring the team\u2019s N.F.L. experience to bear on Leeds\u2019s operations on and off the field, through shared proprietary analytics tools to best practices on management and staffing.\n Leeds, back in the Premier League after a 16-year absence marred by sporting and financial failures, has won plaudits for its swashbuckling, front-foot style of play under its Argentine coach, Marcelo Bielsa. But it remains some distance from recapturing the days when it was in the mix for the championship year after year.\n In its preparation for its return to the elite, Radrizzani said, Leeds spent the sixth-highest amount on securing new talent during the last off-season. That spending will continue, and be supported by the investment from the 49ers, Marathe said.\n \u201cIf we are able to stay in the Premier League, after two or three years I think this club could step up to be in the group of three or four clubs next to the big ones,\u201d Radrizzani said, picking out Leicester City, the unheralded team that went from relegation danger to Premier League champion in the space of a year in 2016, as a trajectory he would like to emulate. Since Leicester\u2019s title victory, its Thai owners have invested in new players, coaches and infrastructure to maintain the club\u2019s place in the upper reaches of the league.\n \u201cOur model, I think, is Leicester City,\u201d Radrizzani said. \u201cWe have shared this a lot internally. If there\u2019s a club I admire for what has been done in terms of football management, it\u2019s Leicester.\u201d\n Having completed the stake sale, Radrizzani acknowledged that he was now considering adding to his own portfolio, perhaps by buying other European soccer teams. The idea, he said, would be to find opportunities that would allow Leeds to develop players at smaller clubs, or to invest in larger ones that would allow him to develop their sporting and commercial models in concert with those at Leeds United.\n He said he would not consider, however, emulating Manchester City\u2019s model of multiple-club ownership, with teams spread across multiple continents. Radrizzani said his sole focus would be on Europe.\n The relationship between Radrizzani and Marathe has grown to the point that the 49ers executive has come to refer to the Italian as his \u201cbrother.\u201d Before the pandemic, Marathe was a frequent visitor to Leeds with Jed York, the 49ers\u2019 chief executive, and an early riser to watch its games from his home in California.\n Not being able to travel to Leeds\u2019s Elland Road stadium to witness the final weeks of the team\u2019s promotion to the Premier League did not dull Marathe and the 49ers\u2019 intent on following through with an expanded investment. Neither did the financial losses Leeds United has endured as a result of the pandemic, which Radrizzani estimated to be roughly 40 million pounds ($55 million).\n \u201cWas it a blip on the radar or is it a blip on the radar? Certainly,\u201d Marathe said of the pandemic\u2019s effects on sporting finances. \u201cDo I think sport is going to come roaring back in possibly a bigger way than pre-Covid? Absolutely. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d",

        "title": "Joe Biden Repeals Donald Trump\u2019s Transgender Military Ban",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden has repealed Donald Trump\u2019s 2019 guidance that banned transgender people from enlisting and serving in the military, part of a broader effort to undo the former president\u2019s transphobic and regressive policies.\n \u201cPresident Biden believes that gender identity should not be a bar to military service, and that America\u2019s strength is found in its diversity,\u201d reads a White House statement sent to reporters on Monday.\n \u201cThis question of how to enable all qualified Americans to serve in the military is easily answered by recognizing our core values. America is stronger, at home and around the world, when it is inclusive. The military is no exception,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAllowing all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform is better for the military and better for the country because an inclusive force is a more effective force.\u201d\n Biden\u00a0signed an executive order to repeal the ban\u00a0at a ceremony with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin \u2015 who said at his confirmation hearing last week that he supports the decision.\n \u201cI truly believe ... that if you\u2019re fit and you\u2019re qualified to serve and you can maintain the standards, you should be allowed to serve,\u201d Austin said at the time. \u201cAnd you can expect that I will support that throughout.\u201d\n The secretary will order the Pentagon to return to the 2016 policy enacted by former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, which allowed transgender Americans to serve openly in the military.\n Less than a year into his presidency, Trump announced in a series of tweets that he planned to ban transgender people from serving in the military in \u201cany capacity,\u201d citing \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d that he claimed comes with employing trans personnel.\n The controversial policy, implemented in April 2019, stated that transgender people were only allowed to enlist in the military under the sex they were assigned at birth. The policy effectively banned trans people from enlisting in the military, while forcing current trans service members back into the closet.\n \u201cI honestly feel incredibly light today. I hadn\u2019t realized how much this fight had weighed me down, how much it had made me resentful, both at home and at work,\u201d Brock Stone, an 11-year Navy veteran and transgender man who is one of several plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its ban on trans service members, said in an email to HuffPost.\n \u201cIt is certainly a relief knowing that the very highest levels of my leadership are no longer out to get me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that the \u2018coast is clear\u2019 so to speak to allow me and other trans folx breathing room to keep carving more progress for better equality.\u201d\n Nicolas Talbott, an aspiring trans service member who is a plaintiff in another lawsuit against Trump, also applauded Biden\u2019s repeal of the ban in a Monday statement to press.\n \u201cIt is my highest goal to serve my country in the U.S. military and I\u2019ve fought this ban because I know that I am qualified to serve,\u201d said Talbott.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m thrilled and relieved that I and other transgender Americans can now be evaluated solely on our ability to meet military standards. I look forward to becoming the best service member I can be.\u201d\n Three in five adults support allowing openly trans people to serve in the military, including a majority of military households and young Republicans, according to new research from The Trevor Project and Morning Consult.\n Biden is also expected to reinstate and create other LGBTQ protections in the coming months. He has pledged to reinstate a Title IX rule that protects transgender students\u2019 right to use the bathroom that best aligns with their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. Trump had repealed the Obama-era federal guideline, leaving states to make their own rules on the issue.\n \u201cEven before taking office, President Biden demonstrated that he values transgender Americans and recognizes that there is no place for discrimination in the federal government,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. \u201cThe new president has made clear his agenda for ensuring that transgender Americans are treated fairly and with respect. Today\u2019s action is one step forward and ensures that anyone who is willing to serve and is able to serve has that opportunity.\u201d\n Advocates told Reuters that they expect Biden will add the option of \u201cX\u201d as a gender marker on federal identification documents, such as passports. Biden also said during his presidential campaign that he plans to push through and sign the Equality Act, a civil rights law that gives federal protections to LGBTQ people in areas including employment, housing, credit, education and more.",

        "title": "Biden moving to nix Trump plan on opioid-treatment prescriptions",
        "body_text": "The Biden administration is preparing to halt a last-minute plan by the Trump administration to let more physicians prescribe an opioid-treatment drug, said three officials with knowledge of the pending announcement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plan.\n The Trump plan had been hailed by physicians as loosening requirements they said had slowed their response to the nation\u2019s worsening opioid crisis. Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden also criticized the prescribing rules and vowed to lift them if elected president. But some legal experts warned that the Department of Health and Human Services lacked the authority to issue guidelines that allowed physicians to avoid requirements mandated by Congress.\n \u201cUnfortunately, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder announced by the Trump administration in its last days had significant legal and clinical concerns,\u201d according to a draft announcement obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cThe Biden Administration will not issue the Guidelines previously announced.\u201d\n Under the Jan. 14 announcement, many physicians would have been exempted from the \u201cX\u201d waiver \u2014 a two-decade-old requirement, first mandated by Congress, to undergo a day\u2019s training before they could prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. The Trump administration sought to go around Congress\u2019s requirements by issuing new \u201cclinical guidelines\u201d that would have enabled doctors with a Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics prescribing license to avoid the training.\n The plan had also drawn fire from Elinore McCance-Katz, the Trump administration\u2019s assistant HHS secretary for mental health and substance use, who resigned Jan. 7 in the wake of the Capitol riots. Two officials said the Trump administration had rushed the plan after McCance-Katz\u2019s sudden departure by installing an acting replacement who greenlit the policy. One official said the administration had moved so quickly that it failed to get necessary clearance from the White House budget office.\n McCance-Katz had spent weeks attempting to block the plan, arguing that the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic had been fueled by overprescribing opioids, and that additional safeguards were important to ensure buprenorphine was not similarly overused.\n The people who made this decision don\u2019t treat opioid use disorder,\u201d she said in an interview with Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Weekly dated Monday, further framing the move as \u201cunfair\u201d to the Biden administration. To \u201cdo something like this at the 11th hour that could get doctors into trouble \u2014 it\u2019s heinous.\u201d\n But advocates expressed disappointment to learn the policy would not move forward.\n Kim Sue, medical director for the National Harm Reduction Coalition, said she is \u201cheartily dismayed and disheartened that something that could begin to save lives immediately is being held up.\u201d\n \u201cBuprenorphine is a simple, lifesaving medication that\u2019s currently locked up by the X waiver,\u201d said Sue, an addiction medicine physician, adding the medication is much safer than oxycodone, the opioid chiefly responsible for the overdose crisis in the United States.\n \u201cThere is no other medication in the country where you have to take an eight-hour training to prescribe it,\u201d Sue said.\n Kevin Roy, chief public policy officer for the advocacy group Shatterproof, said regardless of the legal and technical considerations, removing the barrier to more doctors prescribing buprenorphine is critical, especially after the sharp rise in opioid overdoses in 2020.\n \u201cThe weight of the evidence supports removing the X waiver,\u201d Roy said, \u201cand the weight of the evidence shows it will save lives.\u201d\n HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But one of the department officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the agency would continue to pursue other options to reduce requirements on doctors before they can prescribe the drug.\n \u201cPractice guidelines [that] have implications both clinically and legally for practitioners and patients should not be issued for political purposes,\u201d said another HHS official who spoke to The Post and who was involved in the decision to halt the guidelines. \u201cThe patient and provider community depends on us to take these issues as seriously as possible and design solutions, which are legally sound and clinically evidence-based.\u201d\n HHS leaders on Monday afternoon were still debating how to announce the reversal of the policy, said two of the officials, who added there was broad agreement it would be difficult to execute.",

But on Sunday, officials said they had received a new batch of the two-dose vaccine and sent 250,400 first doses and 428,100 second doses around the state.\n Nearly 1.3 million doses have been administered statewide, the vast majority being the first dose of a two-dose vaccine.\n Mr. Cuomo has said that at the current pace, it would be many months before even those people currently eligible for inoculation get both their doses.\n Experts fear people may let down their guard.\n \u201cI worry about the focus on vaccines, rather than what\u2019s happening with the virus,\u201d said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiologist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health.\n It\u2019s 30 Degrees.

        "title": "In-person learning during the pandemic is possible with the right precautions, CDC researchers say",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Many parents and caregivers remain worried about the safety of their children in schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, but experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that with the right mitigation measures, there is a path to low-risk, in-person learning.\n Experts have stressed the importance of in-person learning for students' development and access to essential services. On the other hand, Covid-19 case, hospitalization and death rates remain high across the nation.\n In an effort to strike the right balance, schools have adopted varying approaches that include in-person learning, online learning and a hybrid of the two.\n In a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, CDC researchers noted that the kind of spread seen in crowded offices and long-term care facilities has not been reported in schools. In-school transmission has occurred, but the researchers said there is little evidence that it contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.\n \"Committing today to policies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in communities and in schools will help ensure the future social and academic welfare of all students and their education,\" the researchers wrote in the JAMA paper.\n Two new studies from the CDC published Tuesday in agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report demonstrate that with the right precautions, children can return to school safely.\n In the first study, researchers looked at data on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, that conducted in-person learning last fall. They found lower Covid-19 case rates than in the community at large, and few cases of in-school transmission.\n Of 5,530 students and staff, 191 tested positive for Covid-19. The researchers found that Covid-19 case rates in schools were 37% lower than in the surrounding community.\n Contact tracing and investigation determined that seven of those 191 cases -- 3.7%, all among students -- were contracted in school. Three of the seven students who tested positive were from one elementary school class.\n The schools did not conduct routine Covid-19 screening, but they implemented mitigation measures.\n For example, students were each provided with three to five double- or triple-layer cloth masks. Masks were required in schools, and statewide, more than 92% of students of all age groups wore them.\n Cohorts of 11 to 20 students from the same grade level met for classes and lunch indoors, where students were often seated next to the same person. Cohorts were asked not to mix, and the researchers found no in-school transmission between different cohorts.\n Staff were told to mask, social distance and limit time in shared indoor spaces. If a student was out of school with Covid-19 symptoms, their siblings were also told to stay home.\n When a student or staff member tested positive for the virus, school officials used interviews to identify close contacts -- anyone who was within 6 feet of the person for longer than 15 minutes over the course of 24 hours. Those close contacts were required to quarantine at home, and if they developed symptoms during that time, officials investigated whether in-school spread was the cause.\n The team says their findings suggest that even with varying positivity rates in the community, students are not necessarily at increased risk for the virus if they attend in-person classes. In fact, they say that being in a monitored environment such as the classroom may increase adherence to public health measures.\n Extracurricular activities, such as indoor sports, may be another story, according to a separate CDC report published Tuesday.\n Two Florida high school wrestling matches became superspreader events in December when 54 of the 130 attendees -- wrestlers, coaches and referees -- were tested for Covid-19, and 38 were positive. Among 91 close contacts of infected people, 43% tested positive for the virus. One contact, who was over agef 50, died.\n It is not possible to maintain physical distancing in the high-contact sport, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against mask wearing while wrestling because it poses a choking hazard.\n After calculating the amount of time everyone involved had to quarantine and isolate, the researchers estimated there were 1,700 in-person school days lost due to the outbreak -- a number they say would likely have been higher if the outbreak had not occurred so close to the end of the semester.\n \"Outbreaks among athletes participating in high contact sports can impact in-person learning for all students and increase risk for secondary in-school and community transmission with potentially severe outcomes including death,\" the researchers wrote.",

        "title": "Meet the people paying $55 million each to fly to the space station",
        "body_text": "Two are grandfathers, the other has three young children. All three are extremely wealthy, with the means to pay the $55 million ticket price for an eight-day stay on the International Space Station. They are the first would-be spaceflight crew comprised entirely of private citizens in a mission to the station.\n Sometime early next year, if all goes according to plan, the trio \u2014 Larry Connor, the managing partner of the Connor Group, a real estate investment firm based in Ohio; Mark Pathy, the chief executive of Mavrik Corp., a Canadian investment firm; and Eytan Stibbe, a businessman and former Israeli Air Force fighter pilot \u2014 will lift off from the Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft for what is scheduled to be an eight-day stay on the International Space Station.\n Accompanying them will be Michael L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda, a former NASA astronaut who flew to space four times and is now a vice president of Axiom Space, the Houston-based company that is coordinating their trip to space. L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda is overseeing their training and will serve as the mission\u2019s commander.\n If it takes place as envisioned, the flight would mark a watershed moment in human space flight, one that according to Axiom, which announced the identities of the three paying passengers on Tuesday, will eventually make space more accessible and further erode the monopoly that governments have long held on space travel. The company, which is still finalizing the deal with NASA, is planning two flights per year and also is developing a space station of its own that NASA hopes may one day replace the International Space Station, the orbiting lab that has been in space for 22 years.\n \u201cThis is just the first of several Axiom Space crews whose private missions to the International Space Station will truly inaugurate an expansive future for humans in space \u2014 and make a meaningful difference in the world when they return home,\u201d Michael Suffredini, Axiom Space president and chief executive, said in a statement.\n Over the years, several wealthy private citizens have flown to the space station before \u2014 but on the Russian Soyuz craft because NASA forbade the practice on flights from U.S. soil. In 2019, NASA reversed its stance, saying the missions would help boost a growing commercial space industry as well as help NASA\u2019s bottom line. The space agency charges $35,000 a day per passenger for food, storage and communication during stays on board the orbiting laboratory \u2014 a total of more than $1 million for four people for eight days.\n \u201cBut it won\u2019t come with any Hilton or Marriott points,\u201d Jeff DeWit, NASA\u2019s former chief financial officer, said at the 2019 announcement of the policy change.\n Pathy, 51, who has three young children, has a lifelong passion for space but didn\u2019t think he would ever be able to go until a friend told him about the Axiom missions. His initial reaction was skeptical.\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it was completely real, and I\u2019d never heard of this company, Axiom,\u201d he said. \u201cI obviously was not going to blast off in a rocket if this was some sort of Mickey Mouse travel outfit. But the more I inquired and the more I spoke with them directly, the more I realized they were the real deal. It was really possible. And that moment where you think, \u2018Holy cow, this is something I could actually do,' it\u2019s a bit of a surreal moment.\u201d\n Flying private citizens to space is a goal that NASA has had for years. At the beginning of the space shuttle program, it envisioned offering seats to private citizens and started a \u201cSpaceflight Participant\u201d program. A couple of members of Congress flew first, Sens. Jake Garn (R-Utah) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), but then NASA selected a teacher \u2014 Christa McAuliffe, who taught history in Concord, N.H. Next, a journalist was to go, then perhaps an artist.\n The program ended, however, after the space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after takeoff, killing McAuliffe and the other astronauts on board. The agency decided spaceflight was too risky for ordinary citizens.\n In an op-ed in The Washington Post two days after the disaster, Michael Collins, who flew to the moon with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin aboard Apollo 11, seemed to take aim at NASA\u2019s efforts to send civilians to space as cavalier, warning that PR stunts can\u2019t overcome the punishing force of physics.\n \u201cI have been expecting something like this for 20 years,\u201d he wrote of the Challenger disaster, which took place on a cold morning 35 years ago Thursday. \u201cAnyone who has lived with large rocket engines understands that their awesome power is produced by machinery churning away at very high temperatures, pressures and velocities. A thin and fragile barrier separates combustion from explosion.\u201d\n In interviews with The Post, the crew of the Axiom flight said they were well aware of the risks and were taking the flight seriously. Within the ranks of the professional astronaut corps, there may very well be skepticism, if not outright objection, so their goal is to prove their merit through conviction and a humble dedication the endeavor deserves.\n \u201cThere will definitely be some resistance,\u201d said L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda, 62, who spent 20 years as a NASA astronaut and holds the record for the most spacewalks. \u201cI think it\u2019s our job to win them over. We can do that certainly by being as prepared and expert as possible. And so, my goal is to get those guys to the point where no stone is unturned. And when they get on board station, the crews are pleased, maybe pleasantly.\u201d\n That was his experience when in 2006, he flew on the Soyuz with Anousheh Ansari, who reportedly paid about $20 million for the experience. But at first, he was dubious, thinking she was a dilettante.\n \u201cI think the hesitancy was natural when you come from a background as a military pilot and then spend your whole career studying to want to be an astronaut, and then somebody kind of cuts the line, if you will,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a little hard to swallow.\u201d\n But what won him over was her \u201cconsummate professionalism\u201d and the fact that she wrote a blog from space. \u201cMillions of people were reading it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have cared less about what was going on in human spaceflight. And that idea of sharing the experience really hit home for me.\u201d\n Stibbe, 63, who flew combat missions for the Israeli Air Force and is the founding partner of an investment firm, is well aware of the risks, especially because he was close friends with Ilan Ramon, Israel\u2019s first astronaut, who died in 2003 when the space shuttle Columbia came apart over Texas on reentry. He serves now on the board of a foundation created in Ramon\u2019s honor. As for his flight, Stibbe said, \u201cObviously there\u2019s some fear, and this is definitely extreme. And then there are risks, and I\u2019m aware of the risks.\u201d\n Connor, 71, would become the second oldest person to go to space after John Glenn flew on the Shuttle at age 77. He said wanted to leave a good impression so that others might follow in his footsteps. \u201cWe have a vital responsibility as a first group of private astronauts to do this thing correctly so that we don\u2019t end up being the last group,\u201d he said.\n They embrace the challenge wide-eyed, they said, chastened by past disasters, aware of the risks, but bullish on the benefits. Private citizens in space would not only bring attention to the space program but allow them to do research on board the station, raise awareness of science and math activities in their communities, and give their already robust philanthropic efforts a cosmic boost.\n They are aware, too, that there are problems on Earth that need to be addressed and that spaceflight is viewed by much of the public as a superfluous indulgence, especially during a pandemic and an economic crisis. The crew members say they see the flight as an enhancement of their other philanthropic efforts.\n \u201cThere are a lot of issues \u2014 adversity, and in some regards, crises, here, not only in the U.S., but worldwide,\u201d Connor said. \u201cAnd those absolutely need to be a priority. But we cannot forget about the future. We cannot forget about having long-term visions \u2026 And hopefully this mission and the research we\u2019re going to do is going to be one small step on that journey.\u201d\n In space, he said he does \u201cnot want to be a spectator. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I want to do something of value and how that translates into research and experiments.\u201d\n Connor is collaborating with the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic on research projects. He also intends to teach lessons to students at Dayton Early College Academy, a K-12 charter school with 1,300 students, 75 percent of them from low-income families.\n Pathy is working with the Canadian Space Agency and the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital on health-related research projects. And Stibbe plans to conduct scientific research coordinated by the Ramon Foundation and the Israeli Space Agency.\n Their mission comes at a significant time for human spaceflight. Last year, SpaceX flew the first NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 \u2014 the first launch of humans into orbit by a private company, not a government. It flew another mission in November and is scheduled to fly more this year. Boeing also intends to fly NASA astronauts to the station this year.\n Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin are planning to fly paying customers to space, as well. Those missions are not intended to go into orbit but rather to the edge of space, coming back down after giving passengers a few minutes of weightlessness. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n Those trips, although still expensive, cost far less than trips to the space station. Virgin charged $250,000, although that price probably will go up in the short term. Blue Origin has not yet announced prices.\n Pathy and Connor traveled to Cape Canaveral last year to witness SpaceX\u2019s first launch of astronauts. It was the first time either of them had been to a rocket launch, and both said they were awestruck.\n \u201cYou feel that sound in your chest,\u201d Pathy said. \u201cAnd for me, especially, I\u2019m thinking that was going to be me in a few months. It was a really exciting and intense experience.\u201d",

        "title": "Washington Post editor Marty Baron announces his retirement",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Marty Baron, the editor who transformed the Washington Post into an international powerhouse and led the news organization to win 10 Pulitzer Prizes, is retiring next month.\n Baron, 66, said in an internal memo Tuesday morning that he feels \"ready to move on.\" His last day at the paper will be February 28.\n \"From the moment I arrived at The Post, I have sought to make an enduring contribution while giving back to a profession that has meant so much to me and that serves to safeguard democracy,\" Baron wrote. \"It has been my honor to work alongside hundreds of journalists who make The Post an indispensable institution.\"\n Baron also shared his plans in a virtual meeting with company executives and his managing and senior editors Tuesday morning. His retirement had been anticipated inside the Post for some time, and Baron had been in discussions about the exact timing with Fred Ryan, The Post's CEO.\n \"Although we have long known this day would come, it does not lessen the emotion we feel,\" Ryan wrote in his own memo Tuesday morning.\n \"Under Marty's eight years of newsroom leadership, The Washington Post has experienced a dramatic resurgence and has soared to new journalistic heights,\" Ryan wrote. \"As Executive Editor, he has significantly expanded our coverage areas, inspired great reporting, managed an awesome digital transformation and grown the number of readers and subscribers to unprecedented levels.\"\n Ryan pointed out that the Post employed 580 journalists when Baron arrived at the beginning of 2013. Later that same year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought the newspaper. Bezos retained Baron and gave him more money to work with.\n The Post's newsroom now exceeds 1,000 journalists and continues to grow. \"The newsroom of 2021 will be the biggest in history, an investment that signals overwhelming confidence in our prospects,\" Baron wrote. \"In sum, The Post has come a long way in a short time.\"\n Key to the Post's expansion was a digital subscription model fueled by scoops and other must-read stories.\n Both inside and outside the Post, Baron was credited with steadying the editorial ship through business model turbulence, political attacks and international crises.\n In 2014 and 2015, he demanded justice for the Post's Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, who was arrested by Iranian authorities and charged with espionage. Baron helped keep Rezaian's case in the news and worked for his release, which came in early 2016.\n In 2017, as President Trump bashed the Post and observers talked about a war between Trump and the media, Baron pushed back with a memorable turn of phrase: \"We're not at war, we're at work.\"\n A report by Harvard's Shorenstein Center said that Baron was \"widely considered to be one of the best editors working today.\"\n Baron arrived at The Post at the beginning of 2013 after twelve years running The Boston Globe.\n At The Globe, Baron's many accomplishments included oversight of a legendary expose of serial sexual abuse by priests within the Boston Archdiocese. Liev Schreiber played Baron in the ensuing 2015 film \"Spotlight,\" which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n \"Marty coming to The Globe was a great example of what a pair of fresh eyes can do,\" Globe reporter Sacha Pfeiffer said on \"Reliable Sources\" in 2015. \"There had been court files against priests sealed for years. And no one at The Globe had really questioned them or thought to unseal them. Marty showed up new to town and he asked, 'Why haven't we tried to seal them?' And he sent The Globe lawyers to court to do that. And he put the investigative team on the project. And we did it.\"\n Baron said he was motivated by reading a Globe column that said \"the truth may never be known\" about pedophile priests.\n \"When you say the truth may never be known, that should be a red flag to journalists to go after something and really find out what the truth is,\" Baron said.\n That spirit fueled his support of Washington Post reporters, as well. One of the paper's major investigations in recent years was based on a confidential trove of government documents. Named the Afghanistan Papers, the documents were only unsealed after a three-year legal battle by the Post.\n In a 2019 interview on \"Reliable Sources,\" Baron said \"it's absolutely central to our mission to do investigations, to hold government to account, to hold all-powerful individuals and powerful institutions to account. That's why we have a free press in this country.\"\n At the end of 2020, he announced that the Post was on the verge of \"full 24/7 coverage\" by adding news-gathering hubs in Asia and Europe.\n \"If you recall,\" Baron said, \"it wasn't that long ago that people were talking about news organizations like the Washington Post and the New York Times being on their deathbed. And here we are. We're growing, they're growing. There are enormous signs of success for news organizations like ours around the country.\"\n In his internal memo on Tuesday, Baron wrote, \"Please don't lose sight of how hard our gains as a commercial enterprise were to achieve. They would be easy to lose. In 2013, when our outlook was dire, we were given a second chance. We took it, engineering a turnaround with focus and creativity. Keep at it.\"\n He also reflected on some of the work that's unfinished. \"We aspire to greater breadth, depth and distinctiveness in our work,\" he wrote. \"We can improve how we practice our craft. We can do more and better in pursuing our digital destiny. We must cover all communities with deeper understanding. We need a wider diversity of life experiences and backgrounds represented in our newsroom and reflected in our coverage. On all these fronts we've made progress, but more is needed.\"\n The Post did not immediately announce a successor for Baron.\n Ryan said the search for a new executive editor \"will be a broad and inclusive one, considering both outstanding internal candidates as well as journalists at other publications with the vision and ability to build upon Marty's success.\"",

        "body_text": "Six people, including a pregnant woman and her fetus, died early Sunday in what Indianapolis authorities said was the largest mass casualty shooting in the city in more than a decade.\n Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers responded to a call about a shooting around 4 a.m. on the city\u2019s north side and found a boy who had been wounded. Following reports, they went to a nearby house, where they found five people who were dead. The boy was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive, authorities said. A suspect, whose identity was not released because they are a juvenile, was arrested Monday, police said.\n Police identified the victims as Kezzie and Raymond Childs, both 42; Elijah Childs,18; Rita Childs, 13; and Kiara Hawkins, 19, and her fetus.\n \u201cWhat we saw this morning was a different kind of evil,\u201d Police Chief Randal Taylor told reporters Sunday afternoon. \u201cWhat occurred this morning based on the evidence that\u2019s been gathered so far was a mass murder.\u201d\n Authorities said that they have determined the attack was \u201ctargeted\" but declined to provide details about a motive. Police said they do not think any other shooter was involved.\n The shooting was one of several overnight in Indianapolis and just days after officials announced a crime-reduction plan to combat a rise in violence, which they attributed to drugs and poverty. IMPD conducted a record number of criminal homicide investigations in 2020, at least 160, according to the Indianapolis Star. The previous high was 159 in 2018.\n The city, like others nationwide, experienced a surge in homicides and aggravated assaults last year, police spokesman Sgt. Shane Foley told The Washington Post. Police have already responded to 20 homicides this year, he said.\n FBI crime data indicated that killings rose nearly 21 percent nationwide in the first nine months of the year, The Post previously reported.\n At least five shootings overnight Sunday left seven people hospitalized, the Star reported. Since news surfaced of the morning shooting, police have responded to another, Foley said Sunday night.\n While investigators processed the crime scene Sunday, Taylor described to local reporters seeing the number of people shot in an alert before he knew the death count.\n \u201cI, myself, am heartbroken,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cfor the lives that have been taken too soon, for the young life that has forever been changed and for the life that never got a chance to start.\u201d\n Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett (D), also outraged, said he spoke with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and the FBI about the case, saying all entities would coordinate to identify and charge those behind the shooting or complicit in the crime. He said that anyone who aids a shooter or provides an illegally possessed gun will be brought to justice.\n \u201cI want those responsible to know that the full might of local, state and federal law enforcement are coming for them as I speak,\u201d Hogsett said.",

        "title": "Even with coronavirus vaccine distribution set to increase, upcoming months could be rough",
        "body_text": "(CNN) As the federal government promises more help against the coronavirus pandemic with better distribution of vaccines, the President is joining the chorus of officials reminding Americans they need to continue to wear face coverings and social distance for the rest of winter and spring.\n \"The brutal truth is it's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks, not vaccines, are the best defense against Covid-19,\" President Joe Biden said Tuesday while announcing the federal government would buy and distribute more vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer.\n Biden has pushed for 100 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of his presidency and for Americans to wear masks for that time.\n People are wrong to think the worst days of the pandemic are behind them, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n \"I think people, with all the talk about vaccines, you know, have started to look at this more in the rearview mirror,\" Gupta said. \"The percentage of people that think the worst is behind us and in front of us is half and half. Half the country thinks the worst is behind us (but) some of the worst days may be in front depending on the (coronavirus) variants.\"\n Health officials are \"extremely\" worried about the new coronavirus variants that have been detected in the United States and what they could mean over the coming months, one expert said.\n \"We've seen what happens in other countries that have actually had coronavirus under relatively good control, then these variants took over and they had explosive spread of the virus, and then overwhelmed hospitals,\" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday.\n Some countries are struggling with an increase in new cases. The number of cases worldwide since the pandemic began topped 100 million Tuesday. More than a quarter of those cases have been reported in the United States.\n How the new variants spread is a concern for health experts. Officials in Minnesota announced Monday they detected the P.1 variant of the virus in a traveler from Brazil. The variant is one of four being closely watched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and appears to be more easily transmissible. CDC officials have also said another variant -- called B.1.1.7 and first spotted in the United Kingdom -- has been detected in more than 20 states.\n \"If there is something more contagious among us, if we thought that going to the grocery store before was relatively safe, there's actually a higher likelihood of contracting coronavirus through those everyday activities,\" she said.\n \"Wearing an even better mask, reducing the number of times that we have to go out shopping, or in indoor crowded settings, all of that will be helpful,\" Wen added.\n The numbers are a far cry from where some officials hoped the United States would be by now, but Biden said Monday he is hopeful the country could soon be administering 1.5 million vaccines daily. That's about a 50% faster pace than the goal of a million doses per day that he's promised since before inauguration.\n Biden on Tuesday announced the government will soon increase vaccine distribution by 16% from 8.6 million doses to 10 million doses per week, He said the government is working to order 200 million more doses total from Moderna and Pfizer.\n Biden said he hopes to have most Americans vaccinated by late summer or early fall.\n States will get a three-week notice of how many doses to expect, he said.\n \"I think the three-week forecast will make the biggest difference,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha,  dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University. \"When I have been talking to state officials, they get basically no forecast whatsoever. ... (A) three-week forecast will make it much, much easier for states to make sure that they have places staffed and ready to go and give people vaccines.\"\n Across the country, health leaders and state officials have been working to enhance their vaccination strategies and boost the number of shots going into arms.\n CVS will begin offering on-site vaccinations at more than 270 locations across 11 states in February, Dr. David Fairchild, associate chief medical officer at CVS Health, said Monday.\n \"We're definitely prepared and want to play a large role in helping to get the vaccine out there,\" he added. \"Our internal goal is to have a capacity to perform 25 million shots a month or more.\"\n California is switching to a third-party system instead of counties and hospitals running their own vaccination deliveries, officials said.\n Officials from the state's health and human services agency and government operations agency said the new system will simplify eligibility, standardize information and data, and address the available supply of doses by streamlining the vaccination process.\n West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice debuted a new online pre-registration system Monday, which allows residents to pre-register to receive a vaccine. Since the system's launch Monday morning, more than 32,000 residents had scheduled a vaccine appointment, the governor said. That will work alongside an existing hotline that residents can call to pre-register.\n Illinois announced it was entering its next stage of vaccinations Monday, opening guidelines to people 65 and older and frontline essential workers including teachers, first responders and grocery workers. The governor added as more doses become available, more mass vaccination sites will open up.\n Chicago will target 15 \"high-need communities based on the City's COVID vulnerability index,\" the mayor's office said in a news release. The initiative will include \"strike teams\" that will reach \"those who may be disconnected from more traditional vaccine administration channels,\" it said.\n \"Our city is two-thirds people of color,\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a news briefing. \"Yet we are falling woefully behind in the number of people of color who've been vaccinated today.\"\n Lightfoot said that of the nearly 108,000 residents who have received their first vaccine dose, only 17% are Latino and about 15% are Black.\n Students in K-12 schools can go back to classrooms with the right mitigation strategies, according to a study published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n The study looked at more than 5,500 students and staff members at 17 schools in Wood County, Wisconsin.\n Staff were told to wear masks, social distance and limit time in shared indoor spaces. If a student was out of school with Covid-19 symptoms, their siblings also were told to stay home.\n Each student was provided with three to five double- or triple-layered cloth masks. Masks were required in schools and statewide, and more than 92% of students of all age groups wore them.\n A total of 191 people tested positive for the coronavirus. The researchers found that Covid-19 case rates in schools were 37% lower than in the surrounding community.\n Contact tracing and investigation determined that seven of those 191 cases were contracted in school. Three of the seven students who tested positive were from one elementary school class.\n The good news, Fauci told CNN in a separate interview Monday, is that current Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be effective against the new variants.\n \"The sobering news,\" he added, \"(is) as you get more and more replication, you can get more and more of evolution of mutants, which means you always got to be a step ahead of it.\"\n Moderna said Monday its vaccine created antibodies that neutralized Covid-19 variants first found in the United Kingdom and South Africa. There are concerns the vaccine may have a somewhat decreased efficacy against the strain first spotted in South Africa, and the company is working on a booster shot aimed at fighting it.\n But as Covid-19 evolves, it will be important to prove \"time and time again\" that vaccines provide protection against new strains, Moderna president Dr. Stephen Hoge said in a panel discussion Monday.\n \"Until we've got this thing sort of fully suppressed and in control, and people are broadly vaccinated or seropositive and protected against it, it's going to be an ongoing battle for the next couple of years,\" he said.\n Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is being tested in South Africa, the United States and Brazil, and those results could provide insight into how well it works against emerging variants, one of its developers said.\n \"If we see the efficacy results ... it'll give us insights not only into whether or not this vaccine candidate is effective, but it'll also give us insights into whether or not the variants that are circulating in South Africa might be a problem for vaccines,\" Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard Medical School professor, told CNN.\n Johnson & Johnson told investors Tuesday it expects to share further details on its Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine study results by early next week. Alex Gorsky, chief executive officer and chair of Johnson & Johnson's board of directors, said the company is \"hopeful\" efficacy and safety data from earlier trials is a \"good precursor\" to the kind of data in the larger population in its Phase 3 trial.\n CNN's Ray Sanchez, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Kristina Sgueglia, Lauren Mascarenhas, Chris Boyette, Taylor Romine, Gisela Crespo, Omar Jimenez, Amanda Sealy, Andrea Diaz, Leslie Perrot, Maggie Fox and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden continues push to put racial equity at the forefront",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Nearly a week into his administration, President Joe Biden is focused on creating a path toward equity after inheriting a deeply divided nation.\n After picking the most racially diverse Cabinet in US history, Biden jump-started his efforts by proposing a sweeping immigration overhaul, disbanding the 1776 commission and reversing a Trump-era ban on most transgender Americans joining the military.\n \"President Biden believes gender identity should not be a bar to military service and that America's strength is found in its diversity,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. \"America is stronger around the world when it is inclusive.\"\n On Tuesday, Biden signed a range of executive orders that could potentially help bridge the gap in homeownership between people of color and White people, strengthen the fight against bigotry faced by Asian Americans and ease the anxiety of families with incarcerated relatives.\n \"I firmly believe the nation is ready to change but government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day, today, tomorrow and every day,\" Biden said during his remarks before signing the orders on Tuesday afternoon.\n While previous administrations have had \"an interest in advancing justice and equity,\" a senior administration official told reporters earlier on Tuesday that \"never before has there been this whole of government approach\" in which every agency has been mandated to advance equity and be held accountable for it.\n The Biden administration intends to promote fair housing in a country where the cost of housing is continuously slipping out of reach for millions of people.\n On Tuesday, Biden signed a memorandum directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take steps to promote equitable housing politics, according to a senior administration official.\n Lisa Rice, president and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance, said every year about 4 million people face discrimination when they are trying to purchase or rent homes, or while getting home loans and insurance for their houses or apartments.\n But discrimination is not centered on those transactions, Rice says. \"There are systems in place that drive and perpetuate discrimination.\"\n \"We hoard resources in predominantly White communities. And then we starve predominantly Black communities of resources. We starve Native American and Latino communities of resources,\" Rice said.\n America's long history of housing and mortgage market discrimination practices such as redlining, the biased housing practice that stopped banks from providing mortgages in low-income, largely minority neighborhoods, has impacted generations of Black and Hispanic households, according to research by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n Researchers found that nearly two-thirds of the Black, Hispanic and Native American populations living in poverty reside in communities with poverty rates above 20% and are underrepresented in higher-income areas.\n Among those who own homes, Black people lag behind White homeowners. In the third quarter of 2020, nearly 76% of White households owned their homes compared with 46.4% of Black households and nearly 51% of Hispanic households, according to US Census data.\n The Covid-19 pandemic has also disproportionately hurt Black and Latino renters and homeowners, advocates and researchers say. When people lost their jobs due to the economic downturn forced by the pandemic, renters couldn't pay their rent and began living on the edge of eviction.\n Last week, Biden signed an executive action to extend the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium that is protecting millions of struggling renters from eviction until at least the end of March. The CDC's order first went into effect in September and was previously extended until January 31.\n Biden's push for housing equity comes after the Trump administration ended the Obama-era rule known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing in 2020. The rule was enacted in 2015 as a way to bolster the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which outlawed restrictions on selling or renting homes to people based on race.\n Since the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, racism and xenophobia against Asian Americans spread across the nation, from violent attacks to racist slurs or jokes.\n Biden is taking a stand against discrimination against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community with an executive order on Tuesday acknowledging the harm and directing the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing Covid-19 guidance to advance language access and sensitivity toward these communities, according to a senior administration official.\n \"It does send a signal to the Asian American community that we have an administration that cares about the community and wants to protect the community,\" said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC, which advocates for the civil and human rights of Asian Americans.\n Yang said rampant ignorance, misinformation and former President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Covid-19 led to anti-Asian sentiment.\n \"Unfortunately the pandemic was really two pandemics for the Asian American community,\" Yang said.\n Trump, some GOP lawmakers and administration officials used terms like \"the Chinese virus\" or \"the Wuhan virus,\" even after the World Health Organization and the CDC provided the official terminology for the virus in February. The WHO has advised not to use geographic locations in naming diseases because it creates a stigma.\n Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC was among the dozens of organizations that sent a letter to Congress in March asking them to take \"tangible steps to counter the hysteria around the novel coronavirus, such as passing a joint resolution denouncing the racism, xenophobia, and misinformation surrounding it.\" The US House of Representatives addressed it by passing a resolution in September.\n In response to the spike in incidents, Yang said his organization along with Hollaback!, an initiative aimed at combating harassment, have trained over 15,000 people in techniques to intervene and de-escalate if they witness an incident.\n Biden will seek to address mass incarceration and one of his first steps will be ending the use of private prisons, according to a senior administration official. The Obama administration moved to phase out the use of private prisons in 2016 but the decision was reversed by the Trump administration.\n According to a 2020 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, about 2.1 million adults were held in America's prisons and jails at the end of 2018. In federal prisons, Black people represent nearly 39% of all detainees, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons though they make up only about 13% of the US population.\n Several states already have passed legislation involving for-profit prisons. In 2019, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill to end the use of those facilities and privately run immigration detention facilities by 2028.\n Jail and prisons have struggled for years with crowded conditions and inadequate resources and they have not been spared by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Some of the country's largest Covid-19 outbreaks have been reported in correctional facilities. The Covid-19 mortality rate in state and federal prisons has been twice as high as in the general population after adjusting for sex, age and the race/ethnicity of those in prisons, according to an analysis by Kevin T. Schnepel, an assistant professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.\n A coalition of civil rights groups are urging Biden to create a White House office dedicated to leading federal efforts in advancing racial equality and confronting systemic racism in the country.\n The NAACP, National Urban League, UnidosUS, Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum; and Faith in Action are some of the organizations that are part of the coalition.\n In a memo sent in December, the coalition proposed the creation of an office that would be responsible for supporting federal agencies in their racial equity work, supporting the collection of racial data, fostering partnerships between federal agencies and civil society and training federal employees on racial equity.\n \"Even before 2020 exposed our pandemic of triple deadly disease and economic hardship and racial unrest, America was a nation that still had only begun to grapple with the legacy of White supremacy,\" said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \"Establishing a White House Office on Racial Equity and Inclusion is our best hope of nurturing that awakening and achieving our true potential.\"\n Members of the coalition met with Biden's transition team on January 12 to discuss their vision for the office and conversations with the administration are ongoing, said Elana Needle, director of the Racial Equity Anchor Collaborative.\n CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The Metropolitan Opera Hires Its First Chief Diversity Officer",
        "body_text": "Marcia Sells \u2014 a former dancer who became an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn and the dean of students at Harvard Law School \u2014 has been hired as the first chief diversity officer of the Metropolitan Opera, the largest performing arts institution in the United States.\n Her appointment, which the Met announced on Monday, is something of a corrective to the company\u2019s nearly 140-year history and a response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed the killing of George Floyd in 2020. It\u2019s also a conscious step toward inclusivity by a major player in an industry in which some Black singers, including Leontyne Price and Jessye Norman, have found stardom, but diversity has lagged in orchestras, staff and leadership.\n Since last summer, cultural institutions across the country have made changes as the Black Lives Matter movement drew scrutiny to racial inequities in virtually every corner of the arts world. The Met was no exception: The company announced plans to open next season with Terence Blanchard\u2019s \u201cFire Shut Up in My Bones,\u201d its first opera by a Black composer, directed by James Robinson and Camille A. Brown, who will become the first Black director to lead a production on the Met\u2019s main stage. It also named three composers of color \u2014 Valerie Coleman, Jessie Montgomery and Joel Thompson \u2014 to its commissioning program.\n But to make broader changes at the Met, an institution with a long payroll and a budget in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the Met is turning to Ms. Sells. As a member of the senior management team, she will report to Peter Gelb, the general manager. The human resources department will be brought under her direction, and her purview will be broad: the Met in its entirety, including the board.\n \u201cSometimes horrible events like the killing of George Floyd catalyze people, and they realize this is something we need to do \u2014 at the Met and across the arts,\u201d Ms. Sells said in an interview about her plans to make the Met a more inclusive company that values the diversity of its staff and the audiences it serves.\n Mr. Gelb described Ms. Sells as an \u201cideal\u201d candidate. \u201cNot only does she have a history of accomplishment, but she also has a knowledge of the performing arts, having been involved in them herself,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd she loves opera, which is definitely a plus.\u201d\n Ms. Sells began dancing as a 4-year-old in Cincinnati, an arts-rich city where she found herself both onstage and in the audience of the storied Music Hall, and where she saw a young Kathleen Battle sing as a student at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music.\n \u201cIt had been part of my growing up to experience art,\u201d she said.\n She later joined Arthur Mitchell\u2019s company, Dance Theater of Harlem, then remained in New York to attend Barnard College and Columbia Law School. Ms. Sells described herself as \u201can affirmative action baby,\u201d and said that as both a dancer and a law student she had encountered racism, both overt and insidious, that made her feel unwelcome.\n Ms. Sells recalled, for instance, a judge in the mid-1980s who told her that witnesses had to wait outside the courtroom. She said that she was actually an assistant district attorney, and he replied, \u201cWow, things have changed.\u201d\n Diversity has been at the fore of her work as an administrator \u2014 at places including Columbia, the N.B.A. and eventually Harvard Law, where she has been the dean of students since 2015. Her mandate at the Met won\u2019t be too far from that of Harvard, another institute often perceived as elite to the point of exclusivity.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you want to get it right,\u201d Ms. Sells said. \u201cThere are a lot of eyes on you, but it\u2019s a huge opportunity to show the way, as well as learn from other organizations that don\u2019t have as big a name, are not as well known, and help shine a light on that work and on them.\u201d\n She plans to start at the Met in late February. Among her early tasks will be to conceive a diversity, equity and inclusion plan that could be implemented across hiring, artistic planning and engagement; she will also examine structural inequities at the Met, and work with the marketing and development departments to broaden the company\u2019s audience and donor base.\n The Met has been shut down because of the pandemic since last March, and most of its workers have been furloughed without pay since April. It is facing a major labor dispute with its unions, as well as more than $150 million in lost revenue from the theater\u2019s closure. But Mr. Gelb said that the company hopes to receive assistance for diversity-related costs from foundations.\n What those costs are will become clearer as Ms. Sells settles into her new job. She said that she was ready, and motivated by the company\u2019s recent recognition \u201cof how structurally or historically the Met has not felt welcoming to people of color\u201d and the range of possibilities for change.\n \u201cI truly believe,\u201d Ms. Sells said, \u201cthat this is the Met\u2019s moment.\u201d",

        "body_text": "\u201cC\u201d is for cash.\n An agate gemstone recently discovered inside of volcanic rock could be worth more than $10,000 thanks to its uncanny resemblance to Cookie Monster from \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n The agate was recovered from the Rio Grande do Sul region of Brazil by gemologist Lucas Fassari, 33, in November 2020, according to Kennedy News and Media.\n Mike Bowers of California, who is the current owner of the sweet piece, posted a video of himself opening the unassuming rock on Jan. 16, which is backed by the Muppet\u2019s famous ditty, \u201c\u2019C\u2019 is for Cookie.\u201d\n The video begins with Bowers holding what looks to be a dull stone. But when he splits it open, the viewer is dazzled with blue quartz crystals topped by what looks like the wide eyes and a gaping smile of the beloved cookie-inhaling character.\n \u201cI think this is probably the most perfect Cookie Monster out there,\u201d Bowers told Kennedy News. \u201cI have seen others but here you have it complete on both sides.\u201d\n He added, \u201cThis is very unusual. There are a few famous agates out there: the owl, the scared face. There are many approximate ones but it is rare to find one so well defined like this.\u201d\n Bowers told the outlet that he was proposed over $10,000 \u201cby five different buyers\u201d for the agate.\n Although Bowers posted his video of the rock on Facebook over a week ago, Dr. Jacqueline Antonovich, a historian of medicine, gender and politics and assistant professor at Pennsylvania\u2019s Muhlenberg College, posted an image of it on Twitter over the weekend and her post went viral.\n Thanks to its popularity, a post of the rock finally made it to Cookie Monster himself, and he made his thoughts about the agate crystal clear on Twitter:\n \u201cMe no geologist,\u201d Cookie Monster said, \u201cbut me think dat rock look a lot like me ... \u201d",

        "title": "Air pollution is linked to an increased risk of irreversible sight loss, study finds",
        "body_text": "London (CNN) Increases in air pollution are linked to an increased risk of irreversible sight loss, according to a new study.\n Researchers from University College London (UCL) found that even low exposure to air pollution across England, Scotland and Wales appears to impact the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among people over 50 in high-income countries. AMD is linked to the loss of central vision -- needed for reading, performing fine detailed tasks and recognizing faces -- and the biggest risk factors for the disease are genetics, old age and smoking.\n Researchers found that people living in the most polluted areas were at least 8% more likely to report having the condition, in a study published Monday in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.\n The team studied data from 115,954 people aged between 40-69, who had participated in the UK Biobank, a large study of half a million people focusing on the medical diagnoses and biological measurements of participants.\n Using eye measurements and data from questionnaires, experts studied those who said they did and did not have macular degeneration, and then compared the results to the amount of pollutants estimated to be at their residential addresses.\n \"People who live in a more polluted area report macular degeneration more frequently,\" Paul Foster, a professor of glaucoma studies and ophthalmic epidemiology at UCL and senior author of the paper, told CNN.\n Foster said that the main pollutants linked to macular degeneration were particulate matter PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide and oxide nitrogen.\n PM2.5 is tiny particulate pollution that can move deep into the lungs when inhaled and enter the bloodstream. The particles, made up of dust, dirt, soot or smoke, originate from construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires, and can contain different chemicals. But most particles are a mix of pollutants from power plants, industrial and vehicle emissions.\n Nitrogen oxides refers to nitric oxide gas and nitrogen dioxide gas, as well as other gaseous oxides containing nitrogen. The main source of these gases in urban areas are motor vehicle exhausts, indoor gas stoves and kerosene heaters.\n Foster told CNN that the pollutants enter the body through the lungs, and seem to cause particular damage to the eyes because of high blood flow in the eye wall.\n \"It's people breathing the stuff in, and it going down into the lungs, being absorbed into the blood, carried round in the blood,\" he said.\n \"There's definitely a relationship between the more disadvantaged members of society and higher risk of getting this condition,\" he added.\n Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which says such deaths occur largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.\n WHO data shows that nine out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds guideline limits on high levels of pollutants.\n Chris Inglehearn, a professor of molecular ophthalmology at the University of Leeds said that the UCL research is similar to a 2019 study from Taiwan. \"Both show a link between air pollution and age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness in older people,\" he told the Science Media Centre.\n \"The profile of pollutants the two groups looked at is slightly different but the source is the same, combustion. Of course, correlation does not prove causation, but the fact that these two independent studies reach similar conclusions gives greater confidence that the link they make is real,\" Inglehearn, who was not involved in the UCL study, said.\n Inglehearn said such studies \"provide further evidence that links air pollution with detrimental impacts on human health.\"",

        "title": "Nationals are unhappy with changes to MASN broadcast team",
        "body_text": "The feud between the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles over the regional sports network that broadcasts their games has spread to a new front.\n Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, part-owned by both teams but controlled by the Orioles, announced Monday the team of talent set to be involved in Nationals telecasts this season. Longtime play-by-play man Bob Carpenter and color analyst F.P. Santangelo are returning. But not mentioned were pre- and postgame host Dan Kolko; pre- and postgame analyst Bo Porter; or Alex Chappell, who served as a dugout reporter for the past two seasons.\n Asked about the changes, the Nationals responded with a scathing statement.\n \u201cMASN has notified us that they are parting ways with Dan Kolko, Bo Porter and Alex Chappell,\u201d the team wrote. \u201cIn addition, MASN has cut Nats Xtra to just 15 minutes pre- and post-game. To say that we are incredibly disappointed and upset by MASN\u2019s decisions would be a gross understatement. To be clear \u2014 these decisions were made by MASN and against our wishes.\u201d\n According to a person familiar with the discussions, the Nationals had a chance to pay the salaries of the talent and keep them, but the team declined.\n The Nationals said they raised concerns with MASN and Major League Baseball about \u201cthe negative impact these decisions could have on our fans, especially now when content shared via broadcast and digital channels is vital for them to stay connected with our team.\u201d\n In its news release, MASN said pre- and postgame coverage would continue in its traditional 30-minute blocks. Carpenter and Santangelo could theoretically handle pre- and postgame duties if those shows originate from the ballpark. A MASN spokesman said no decisions about the logistics of the pre- and postgame shows had been made, but he reiterated that they would be 30 minutes long.\n Chappell tweeted Monday to confirm her departure from the network. Kolko, in a text message, wrote that his status had not been resolved: \u201cThe situation is fluid right now so I can\u2019t really comment but I love covering the Nats and being a part of the broadcast team.\u201d\n Kolko has been a longtime presence for Nationals fans, covering the team as a MASN blogger before switching to an on-air role in 2014. He spent five years as the Nationals\u2019 dugout reporter before becoming the host of the 30-minute pre- and postgame shows in 2019. Chappell, a McLean native, joined MASN before the 2019 season and was part of almost every regular season game broadcast over the past two years. Porter, a former Nationals coach, also came on in the spring of 2019 to share the pre- and postgame set with Kolko.\n Whatever the programming looks like this season, the MASN-centered dispute is just the latest in a years-long saga between the Orioles and Nationals. MASN was created when the Montreal Expos moved to D.C. in 2005. As payment to the Orioles for losing valuable geographic territory and fans to a new team, they maintained control of the network and the broadcast rights to Nationals games. For the past decade, MASN and the Nationals have been involved in a vicious legal dispute over the amount of rights fees the Nationals should receive.\n This past fall, a New York appeals court ruled the Nationals are owed around $100 million in missing rights fees from 2012 to 2016, though MASN has vowed to appeal.\n With the coronavirus pandemic affecting finances and consumers moving away from cable bundles, MASN has undertaken other cost-cutting moves ahead of the upcoming season. Last week, two Orioles broadcasters, Gary Thorne and Jim Hunter, announced their contracts were not renewed. MASN.com writer Byron Kerr, who regularly covered the minor leagues, tweeted Monday evening that he is no longer with the company. A handful of returning employees have had their salaries cut, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. The Athletic first reported last week that MASN was undergoing layoffs.\n Monday should have been a positive news day for MASN. The network announced it will launch a new app to allow cable customers in the seven-state MASN television area to stream live Nationals and Orioles games on their phones and tablets for the first time. The new app will bring more options to viewers, something many have craved, but it will not help cord-cutters watch games. To watch the live streams, viewers will need a cable subscription to authenticate the video.",

        "title": "Twitter Acquires Revue, a Newsletter Company",
        "body_text": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Twitter said on Tuesday that it had acquired an email newsletter service, Revue.\n The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, is part of Twitter\u2019s effort to compete with other social media companies that allow users to earn money from their followings, as the newsletter industry enjoys a spike in popularity.\n Twitter has moved aggressively over the past two months to acquire start-ups as it expands its offerings beyond its core timeline product. In December, it bought Squad, a social video company, and this month it acquired the social broadcasting service Breaker to create audio conversations on Twitter.\n After advertiser spending plummeted during the early weeks of the pandemic, investors put pressure on Twitter to develop revenue sources beyond ads. Its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, told analysts in July that Twitter was in \u201cvery, very early phases of exploring\u201d alternative revenue streams, including subscription products.\n By November, Twitter executives were discussing the purchase of Substack, a newsletter company that competes with Revue, The New York Times reported. A deal never emerged, and Hamish McKenzie, a Substack founder, said a sale to Twitter was \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d\n Revue was founded in the Netherlands in 2015 and has six employees. For now, it will continue to operate as an independent service, but Twitter said it planned to integrate Revue to \u201cwork seamlessly within Twitter.\u201d\n Newsletter writers typically offer a mix of paid and free options and earn money primarily through subscriptions. Platforms like Revue and Substack take a cut of those subscription dollars. But while Substack\u2019s cut is 10 percent, Revue\u2019s is 6 percent. Twitter said it would lower Revue\u2019s cut even further, to 5 percent in an attempt to attract new writers.\n \u201cTwitter is uniquely positioned to help organizations and writers grow their readership faster and at a much larger scale than anywhere else,\u201d Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter\u2019s head of product, said in a blog post announcing the deal. \u201cOur goal is to make it easy for them to connect with their subscribers, while also helping readers better discover writers and their content.\u201d\n Social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat allow their highest-profile users to earn income for creating popular content. But while these incentives can be highly lucrative and attract a dedicated base of content creators, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have traditionally not offered users cash for content.\n By giving users a way to earn money, Twitter aims to keep its users active on the platform and add to its revenue.",

        "title": "Leon Black To Step Down As Apollo CEO After Jeffrey Epstein Review",
        "body_text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black said on Monday he would relinquish his chief executive post at Apollo Global Management Inc following the buyout firm\u2019s independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n The review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in any way with Epstein\u2019s criminal activities. Black, the review found, paid Epstein bona fide fees for advice on tax and estate planning, and other related services.\n Nevertheless, Apollo said it would undertake efforts to strengthen its corporate governance to allow the board to oversee \u201call aspects\u201d of the buyout firm and delegate less of that work.\n Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan will take over as CEO, with Black remaining Apollo\u2019s chairman, the firm said.\n The sudden end to Black\u2019s management of Apollo, a New York-based firm he co-founded 31 years ago and turned into one of the world\u2019s largest private equity and credit investment groups, reflects the toll that revelations of his ties to Epstein took on the investment firm\u2019s business.\n Apollo executives had warned in October that some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo\u2019s funds as they awaited the review\u2019s findings.\n Apollo shares missed out on a stock market rally and are down 1% since the New York Times reported on Oct. 12 that Black paid at least $50 million to Epstein for advice and services, when most of his clients had deserted him. Shares of peers Blackstone Group Inc, KKR & Co Inc and Carlyle Group Inc are up 19%, 10% and 23% over that period, respectively.\n The conflicts committee of Apollo\u2019s board pursued the review with Black\u2019s support in October.

        "title": "Vaccine rollout stumbles as a 'Hunger Games' approach leaves states and counties to fend for themselves",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Eighty-year-old Belma Requejo of Los Angeles County is trapped in her home with her 83-year-old husband and two other elderly relatives.\n Meanwhile, Covid-19 has ravaged their densely populated section of Long Beach; just last week the disease claimed the life of a neighbor.\n \"I can't even walk in the park -- I'm afraid,\" Requejo said. \"We are surrounded by Covid.\"\n As Covid-19 continues its rampage across the country -- and as new variants pose the threat of increased transmissibility -- the urgent campaign to vaccinate Americans has been frustratingly sluggish.\n Earlier this month in Fort Myers, Florida, seniors spent a night lined up outside a local health office for the chance to get their coronavirus vaccine. In Phoenix, computer glitches sent health workers driving across the state to remote vaccination locations.\n Many states -- including New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Florida -- have had to cancel or delay thousands of vaccination appointments.\n Although the reasons for the holdups vary depending on the state and county, the primary causes boil down to two problems: a shortage of supply and the unpredictability of shipment sizes, say more than a dozen experts and health officials who spoke with CNN.\n Meanwhile, there is concern among state and local health officials that the supply crunch will leave people who have gotten one dose of the vaccine unable to get the second and final dose in time.\n Some chalk up the logistical nightmare to the lack of a central message from Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to inoculate Americans.\n \"It feels like the feds' plan stopped at the state borders, and the states expected the feds' plan to stop at people's arms,\" Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, chief clinical officer for Providence health system, which includes 51 hospitals, told CNN. \"I think having a federal plan would absolutely stop the kind of 'Hunger Games' approach to every individual state, every individual county scrambling for their own set of rules.\"\n President Joe Biden has said he intends to ramp up vaccinations in the coming weeks.\n Six weeks into the rollout, 23.5 million shots have been administered, according a tracker from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n The pace of vaccination has been accelerating. Until last week, the US was administering about 462,000 doses a day. That rose to nearly a million over the last week.\n On Tuesday, Biden's Covid coordinator, Jeff Zients, informed governors on a call that Covid-19 vaccine allocations for states would increase by 16% starting next week, according to a source with knowledge of the call.\n And the administration announced that while it remains committed, for now, to delivering 100 million doses in the first 100 days -- an average of 1 million a day -- it will boost weekly supply, increase transparency and purchase additional vaccine from the two companies with circulating vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna.\n The goal of the plan is to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by summer's end and achieve herd immunity, in which the percentage of the immunized population is so high that person-to-person transmission becomes unlikely.\n But vaccine expert Peter Hotez says to achieve herd immunity by summer, the US will need 3 million doses a day.\n Noting the dangerous new variants, Hotez said time is of the essence, and stressed that other vaccines in addition to the two versions in use need to quickly be authorized.\n \"The variant seems to be accelerating and is scaring the crap out of everyone, including me,\" said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n Both vaccine makers -- Pfizer and Moderna -- say they are on track to provide the federal government 200 million doses each by July 31, as outlined in their contracts.\n \"Production and releases are not linear and we have explained that we have been successfully scaling up our production yields over time,\" said a Moderna spokesperson.\n Still, the granular, day-to-day realities of getting vaccines into the arms of people has been a logistical nightmare for many providers across America.\n Officials in Louisiana say they could be vaccinating more people were it not for one major, overarching problem.\n \"We are simply limited by the supply we get,\" said Dr. Joseph Kanter, the state's top health officer and the lead physician with the state's department of health. \"There is simply much more demand than there is vaccine available. There are many more people eligible and who want the vaccine than there is vaccine we have to give.\"\n Inside Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the mass vaccination center could be inoculating up to 2,000 people a day. But on Monday, it had just 150 appointments.\n \"We're preserving the appointments for how many doses are available,\" Sarah Apatov, a volunteer who was administering doses, told CNN.\n Health officials in Georgia said they are pushing out the vaccine as quickly as possible. Dr. Lynn Paxton, Fulton County district health director, said her team has the capacity to vaccinate 50,000 people a week, but have had to settle for around 10,000.\n \"We have to be very judicious in how we schedule our appointments,\" she said. \"And the important thing I want everyone to know is that we are in no way hoarding these vaccine doses.\"\n Some officials told CNN that the size of the dose shipments they've received have been wildly out of step with expectations, crippling their efforts to adequately plan.\n \"The things that the federal government said it was going to do, which was to allocate vaccines to states and give them a sense of how many doses they would get based on their population size, that seems itself not to even play out the way that they said,\" said Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \"States to counties to facilities don't have predictability or visibility on the number of doses they're going to get, either like in a week or two out or even the next month.\"\n Compton-Phillips of Providence health said the planning challenges have forced hospitals to turn away even people who are over 65 with heart disease.\n \"We're saying, 'We're sorry, but we don't have a vaccine for you today and we're not really sure what our supply is going to be and not sure when we can give it to you,'\" she said. \"So, it's a really uncomfortable position to be in.\"\n Lori Tremmel Freeman, of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, calls the situation a \"world of uncertainty.\"\n \"This becomes just a tremendous issue when they're trying to plan mass vaccination clinics, drive-through clinics, scheduling for all these priority groups and ... really getting things rolling,\" she said.\n In Washington state, a surprise change of plans will likely force thousands of residents to find a new location to get their second dose.\n \"We had a clinic in downtown Seattle that's been running for the past couple of weeks doing over 2,200 immunizations a day,\" said Compton-Phillips of Providence. \"We heard last week that our allocation would be cut back by 90 percent so that they could take the same amount of vaccine that the state is getting and spread it out. ... How are we going to get everybody dose two?\"\n Some state officials are so frustrated with the supply shortage they're tapping into the second-dose reserves.\n Last week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis directed providers \"to use all the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine they have including the ones that were designated as second doses to use them as first doses this week.\" The directive applied to those ages 70 and up.\n \"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,\" Polis said at a January 19 news conference.\n Similarly, in Utah, officials will redesignate second doses for people who haven't shown up to get them within a week as first doses.\n In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Biden should order governments across the country to reassign second doses as first doses immediately.\n \"Start using them right now,\" he said on MSNBC, adding that sitting on them \"doesn't make sense.\"\n A former Trump administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to comment publicly, said states that want a more predictable cadence of supply can solve the problem by stockpiling the vaccine for three or four weeks.\n \"But I don't think states or local public health departments would like that either, because the goal is to get vaccine out as quickly as you can,\" the official said. \"So, in that environment where you are shipping doses out on the edges of them coming off the lines, there is just inherent uncertainty.\"\n CNN's Drew Griffin, Nelli Black, Scott Bronstein, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Benjamin Naughton and Casey Tolan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "D.C. police sent about 850 officers, nearly one-quarter of its force, to help rescue the U.S. Capitol from the mob that broke in Jan. 6, and the department estimates it cost the District $8.8\u00a0million to secure the downtown during the week the insurrection occurred.\n Acting police chief Robert J. Contee III, in his opening statement Tuesday before a closed session of the House Appropriations Committee, also said for the first time that a D.C. police officer who had been at the riot committed suicide in the days that followed.\n Contee identified the officer as Jeffery Smith. A department spokesman said Smith was a 12-year veteran assigned to patrol in the 2nd District, which includes the neighborhoods of Chevy Chase, Cleveland Park and Georgetown. The Post could not locate Smith\u2019s family Tuesday evening.\n Smith, who died Jan. 15, was the second officer who had been at the Capitol on Jan. 6 to take his life. Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood died Jan. 9. Five other people died in the assault, including Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick, who authorities said was injured during the riot, and a woman fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer inside the building.\n \u201cThe costs for this insurrection \u2014 both human and monetary \u2014 will be steep,\u201d Contee said in his remarks, a copy of which was provided by the D.C. police department.\n Contee \u2014 who described Jan. 6 as a \u201cdark day for our country\u201d \u2014 was one of several witnesses at Tuesday's briefing, the start of what is expected to be a long line of congressional inquiries into the failure to prevent breaches by hundreds of supporters of President Donald Trump trying to overturn an election he had lost.\n The acting chief of the Capitol Police apologized to lawmakers during Tuesday\u2019s briefing for \u201cfailings\u201d that allowed rioters to enter the Capitol, saying the department should have been better prepared for the attack.\n Contee sent D.C. officers to help overwhelmed Capitol officers retake control of the building. It took up to eight hours to clear the building and grounds, and by then Contee said 850 D.C. officers had been deployed to the Capitol and an additional 250 to the area around the federal complex.\n The chief cautioned that the $8.8 million cost is an estimate that is sure to change, and he said a more detailed financial accounting is forthcoming. He said police and prosecutors will be \u201cengaged for years\u201d investigating and trying insurgents.\n Contee said many aspects of local policing will have to be revisited to confront new threats of domestic terrorism, including training that at present \u201cneither anticipates nor prepares\u201d officers for \u201chours of hand-to-hand combat.\u201d\n The chief also said the D.C. police force\u2019s relationship with the myriad federal agencies in the District might be reexamined. \u201cThis assault on the Capitol has exposed weaknesses in the security of the most secure city in the country,\u201d Contee told lawmakers.\n He said federal and local agencies will now have to consider domestic terrorism as a serious threat, and \u201charden targets in the federal enclave.\u201d That, Contee said, could make other buildings in the District \u201cmore likely targets.\u201d",

        "title": "As Virus Grows Stealthier, Vaccine Makers Reconsider Battle Plans",
        "body_text": "As the coronavirus assumes contagious new forms around the world, two drug makers reported on Monday that their vaccines, while still effective, offer less protection against one variant and began revising plans to turn back an evolving pathogen that has killed more than two million people.\n The news from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech underscored a realization by scientists that the virus is changing more quickly than once thought, and may well continue to develop in ways that help it elude the vaccines being deployed worldwide.\n The announcements arrived even as President Biden banned travel to the United States from South Africa beginning on Saturday, in hopes of stanching the spread of one variant. And Merck, a leading drug company, on Monday abandoned two experimental coronavirus vaccines altogether, saying they did not produce a strong enough immune response against the original version of the virus.\n Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech both said their vaccines were effective against new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa. But they are slightly less protective against the variant in South Africa, which may be more adept at dodging antibodies in the bloodstream.\n The vaccines are the only ones authorized for emergency use in the United States.\n As a precaution, Moderna has begun developing a new form of its vaccine that could be used as a booster shot against the variant in South Africa. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it today to be ahead of the curve, should we need to,\u201d Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna\u2019s chief medical officer, said in an interview. \u201cI think of it as an insurance policy.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if we need it, and I hope we don\u2019t,\u201d he added.\n Moderna said it also planned to begin testing whether giving patients a third shot of its original vaccine as a booster could help fend off newly emerging forms of the virus.\n Dr. Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech, said in an interview on Monday that his company was talking to regulators around the world about what types of clinical trials and safety reviews would be required to authorize a new version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that would be better able to head off the variant in South Africa.\n Studies showing decreased levels of antibodies against a new variant do not mean a vaccine is proportionately less effective, Dr. Sahin said.\n BioNTech could develop a newly adjusted vaccine against the variants in about six weeks, he said. The Food and Drug Administration has not commented on what its policy will be for authorizing vaccines that have been updated to work better against new variants.\n But some scientists said that the adjusted vaccines should not have to go through the same level of scrutiny, including extensive clinical trials, that the original versions did. The influenza vaccine is updated each year to account for new strains without an extensive approval process.\n \u201cThe whole point of this is a rapid response to an emerging situation,\u201d said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.\n Dr. Sahin said a similar booster shot eventually might be necessary to stop Covid-19. The vaccine\u2019s reduced efficacy may also mean that more people would need to get the shots before the population achieves herd immunity.\n Scientists had predicted that the coronavirus would evolve and might acquire new mutations that would thwart vaccines, but few researchers expected it to happen so soon. Part of the problem is the sheer ubiquity of the pathogen.\n There have been nearly 100 million cases worldwide since the pandemic began, and each new infection gives the coronavirus more chances to mutate. Its uncontrolled spread has fueled the development of new forms that challenge human hosts in various ways.\n \u201cThe more people infected, the more likely that we will see new variants,\u201d said Dr. Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York. \u201cIf we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.\u201d\n Several variants have emerged with mutations that worry scientists. A form first detected in Britain is up to 50 percent more contagious than the virus identified in China a year ago, and researchers have begun to think that it may also be slightly more deadly.\n Researchers in South Africa identified another variant after doctors there discovered a jump in Covid-19 cases in October. They alerted the World Health Organization in early December that the variant seemed to have mutations that might make the virus less susceptible to vaccines.\n A variant found in Brazil has many of the mutations seen in the South African form, but genetic evidence suggests that the two variants evolved independently. Preliminary studies in the laboratory had hinted that those viruses may have some degree of resistance to the immunity that people develop after recovering from the infection or being inoculated with the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.\n The variant identified in Britain has been found in at least 20 states in the United States. The version found in South Africa has not been reported in this country, but on Monday health officials in Minnesota announced that they had documented the first case of infection with the Brazilian variant.\n It is far from certain that these are the only worrying variants out there. Few countries, including the United States, have invested in the kind of genetic surveillance needed to detect emerging variants. Britain leads the world in these efforts, sequencing of about 10 percent of its virus samples.\n The United States has analyzed less than 1 percent of its samples; officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this month that they expect to swiftly ramp up those efforts.\n Researchers at Moderna examined blood samples from eight people who had received two doses of the vaccine, and two monkeys that had been immunized. Neutralizing antibodies \u2014 the type that can disable the virus \u2014 were just as effective against the variant identified in Britain as they were against the original form of the virus.\n But with the variant circulating in South Africa, there was a sixfold reduction in the antibodies\u2019 effectiveness. Even so, the company said, those antibodies \u201cremain above levels that are expected to be protective.\u201d\n The results have not been published or peer-reviewed, but were posted online at BioRxiv. Moderna collaborated on the study with the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n Dr. Zaks said that the new version of the Moderna vaccine, aimed at the South African variant, could be used if needed as a booster one year after people received the original vaccine.\n The need for such a booster may be determined by blood tests to measure antibody levels or by watching the population of vaccinated people to see if they begin falling ill from the new variant.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have data on the Brazilian variant,\u201d Dr. Zaks said. \u201cOur expectation is that if anything it should be close to the South African one. That\u2019s the one with the most overlap.\u201d New forms of the virus will continue to emerge, he said, \u201cand we\u2019ll continue to evaluate them.\u201d\n Noting that Moderna took 42 days to produce the original vaccine, he said the company could make a new one \u201chopefully a little faster this time, but not much.\u201d\n One reason the current vaccine remains effective is a \u201ccushion effect,\u201d meaning it provokes such a powerful immune response that it will remain highly protective even with some drop in antibody strength, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, and President Biden\u2019s adviser on the coronavirus, said at a news briefing on Friday.\n Experts also cautioned against assuming that a decrease in neutralizing ability meant the vaccines were powerless against the new variants. Neutralizing antibodies are just one component of the body\u2019s immune defense, noted Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.\n \u201cIn real life, there\u2019s also T cells and memory B cells and non-neutralizing antibodies and all these other effectors that are going to be induced by the vaccine,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said. Neutralizing power is \u201cvery important, but it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s going to protect someone.\u201d\n So long as the authorized vaccines continue to work against the variants, the challenge will be to inoculate as many people as possible and to prevent the coronavirus from evolving into more impervious forms. \u201cThat for me is still the highest priority,\u201d said Dr. Sahin, of BioNTech.\n Then, he said, perhaps six to nine months later, people could be given a boost that was customized for the variant.\n The pace of the vaccine rollout in the United States, at least, may be picking up. Dr. Fauci predicted on Sunday that two million inoculations daily might soon be possible.\n But there are many countries where no one has been immunized. With richer countries buying up doses early, some populations may have to wait till 2022 at the earliest to gain access to any vaccines.\n In theory, new variants emerging in other parts of the world could render the virus resistant to the vaccines, Dr. Nussenzweig said, and they would inevitably spread. It is therefore in everyone\u2019s interest to immunize the world as quickly as possible, he added: \u201cWe can\u2019t hermetically seal ourselves from the rest of the world.\u201d\n Hoping to contain the new variants, the administration has upheld bans on travel by noncitizens into the United States from Europe and Brazil. President Biden will ban travel by noncitizens from South Africa starting Saturday. But that variant may already be in the United States, researchers said.\n The mRNA technology used in both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines allows them to be created and reformulated much faster than vaccines made with more traditional methods.\n \u201cThis is the beauty of the mRNA vaccines \u2014 they\u2019re very versatile,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said. But a new formulation may not even be necessary, she added. A third dose of the current vaccine may be enough to boost levels of antibodies.\n Dr. Zaks said that discussions with regulators about what would be required to bring a new version of the vaccine to the public were just starting.\n \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d he said.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) A federal judge's action Tuesday preventing President Joe Biden's 100-day pause in deportations demonstrated the land mines that await the new administration in the nation's courts.\n The short-term order by the Texas-based judge could also force a confrontation up to the US Supreme Court, where the Biden legal team already faces hard choices over how aggressively to press new legal positions before the nine justices -- six of whom are conservatives, with three appointed by former President Donald Trump.\n US District Judge Drew Tipton, also a Trump appointee, sided on Tuesday with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump loyalist who has challenged Biden's temporary suspension of deportations.\n The nationwide scope of Tipton's order further intensifies debate over broad-scale actions against the executive branch imposed by a lone judge, which were the bane of the Trump administration.\n \"These nationwide injunctions have frustrated presidential policy for most of the President's term with no clear end in sight,\" then-Attorney General William Barr declared in a 2019 speech.\n Trump Justice Department lawyers routinely were able to convince the Supreme Court to lift those injunctions, although that sometimes took months. The conservative Supreme Court majority may not be as sympathetic to Biden's ventures as it was to Trump's.\n All told, Tuesday's court action against an administration barely a week old reveals how tough it might be to advance a new agenda on immigration or any domestic policy if hit with lawsuits before judges who became increasingly right-wing during the Trump tenure.\n As Biden promotes new programs and encounters legal objections, there is no escaping that they will be resolved by life-tenured judges, 30% of whom were named by Trump.\n The pause on deportations, announced immediately after Biden's inauguration, reflects the desire to dismantle Trump's anti-immigrant practices. Biden also halted construction on the wall at the southern border.\n Department of Homeland Security officials said the 100-day hold on deportations would allow the administration to review current practices and to ensure \"a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety.\"\n The moratorium, which began last Friday -- the day that Paxton sued -- excludes some categories of individuals, including those who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, and have waived rights to remain in the US.\n Paxton, who led a failed lawsuit at the Supreme Court contesting Biden's election victory over Trump, contended that the 100-day suspension violated federal procedural requirements and breached a pact the Trump administration had made with Texas just before Trump left office. It dictated that the Department of Homeland Security would consult with the state before changing certain immigration practices.\n It is not clear whether such recent agreements made with various states could be legally enforced. Tipton said he would need more time and additional legal briefing to review the question as he set the 14-day temporary restraining order.\n But crucially, Tipton agreed with Texas that it appeared the suspension violated the Administrative Procedure Act's safeguards against \"arbitrary and capricious\" executive action.\n The January 20 memorandum \"not only fails to consider potential policies more limited in scope and time, but it also fails to provide any concrete, reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations,\" Tipton wrote.\n Tipton said Texas had shown it could be hurt by the policy because of the millions of dollars it puts toward social services and other state benefits for undocumented immigrants.\n Regarding his imposition of a nationwide order, he wrote that the \"100-day pause plainly affects national immigration policy, which demands uniformity.\"\n Federal judges often shudder at the suggestion that they would ideologically align with the presidents who appointed them, and Chief Justice John Roberts famously answered Trump's disparagement of an \"Obama judge\" with this admonition: \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n Regardless of Roberts' declaration, the fact remains that Biden may find a skeptical judiciary.\n Trump filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution's Russell Wheeler -- in addition to the three new Supreme Court justices.",

        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Cici's, a restaurant chain best known for its pizza buffets, has filed for bankruptcy.\n In a court filing late Monday, Cici's blamed its Chapter 11 filing on the \"unpredictable and unprecedented scale\" of the pandemic, which decimated its bottom line and customer demand because it relies heavily on its dining rooms.\n The Texas-based company has more than 300 locations in 26 states \u2014 a sharp decrease from the roughly 650 restaurants it owned about a decade ago. Cici's dropped \"pizza\" from its name in 2015 and expanded its menu to focus on its unlimited soup, salad and dessert options. The company was bought by Arlon, a food and agriculture investment firm, a year later.\n Unlike other pizza chains, Cici's hasn't benefited from delivery. The company said that the at home dining trend \"poses significant challenges\" to its buffet model and admitted it \"must work harder and more creatively\" to differentiate itself from competitors.\n Cici's has between $50 million to $100 million in liabilities. The chain came to an agreement in December for its primary lender, D&G Investors, to purchase the company and its $82 million in debt.\n The pandemic has decimated the restaurant industry. Restrictions on indoor dining and the challenging economics for making money from delivery or take out have forced a number of chains to file for bankruptcy in recent months, including Sizzler USA, Friendly's, California Pizza Kitchen and Vapiano.",

        "title": "Rick Pitino, Who Pushed to Delay College Basketball Season, Tested Positive for the Coronavirus",
        "body_text": "Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame basketball coach now at Iona College, said he had tested positive for the coronavirus this month, 10 days after getting his first shot of a two-dose vaccine.\n Pitino, 68, told reporters on Tuesday that he had felt some symptoms during his illness, but is feeling better now and still plans to get the second vaccine shot.\n He said on \u201cThe Michael Kay Show\u201d that he believed he contracted the virus from his players, and that he tested positive on Jan. 16.\n \u201cI was vaccinated, and unfortunately it takes two weeks to probably kick in where you have 50 percent immunity, so unfortunately it didn\u2019t work totally with me and we move on,\u201d he said on a videoconference with reporters.\n \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m out of quarantine,\u201d he added. \u201cI was very lucky. I didn\u2019t have the severe symptoms that many people have had and I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n He told The New York Times on Tuesday night that he has since tested negative for the virus several times.\n Pitino\u2019s experience is the latest in a string of setbacks related to the pandemic that the coach and his team have endured since he took the job last March at Iona, a small Catholic college in New Rochelle, N.Y.\n Pitino, the only coach to win N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball championships at two schools (Kentucky and Louisville), has said he hopes to coach at Iona for the next five to seven years and retire there.\n Pitino came to Iona with the baggage of multiple scandals that occurred on his watch at Louisville, where he was ousted in 2017 amid an F.B.I. investigation in which two assistant coaches under Pitino were accused of funneling money from the university\u2019s apparel sponsor, Adidas, to high school recruits. Pitino has long said that he did not know about the scheme, or another involving a staff member soliciting prostitutes and strippers for players and recruits.\n After Pitino was fired, he spent two seasons coaching professionally in Greece before being hired at Iona, where his first season has been upended by the virus.\n The men\u2019s basketball team has suspended activities three times this season for separate coronavirus issues. It has not played since a Dec. 23 home win over Coppin State. The Gaels (5-3, 3-1 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference) aren\u2019t scheduled to play again until a conference game Feb. 3 against Manhattan \u2014 a 42-day break between games.\n Pitino estimated that half of his team has had the virus this season, and said that some of his players have recently shown symptoms.\n He said he quarantined for 10 days in an apartment on campus after he tested positive earlier this month.\n \u201cI did not want to give it to my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI was living the life of a monk. The TV doesn\u2019t have many channels, so I did a lot of reading. I watched a lot of basketball, believe it or not, on my phone. So there wasn\u2019t much to do for 10 days, but it\u2019s over. I\u2019m out.\u201d\n Before the season began in November, Pitino said he supported delaying the season to set up an N.C.A.A. tournament in May, rather than in late March and early April.\n \u201cI\u2019m a little bit of a political animal \u2014 I follow the science of it all, and that\u2019s why I tried to move it back to May Madness for the health of everybody involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought the vaccine would come out maybe a week or two later than it\u2019s actually come out, so that\u2019s good news. It\u2019s frustrating, but I knew it would be.\u201d\n The pauses at Iona and elsewhere have had effects throughout the conference, much like the problems seen throughout the sport.\n Saint Peter\u2019s was scheduled to visit Iona for a pair of league games Jan. 15-16, but those games were put on hold after Iona went into its third pause of the season.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, you just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Saint Peter\u2019s coach Shaheen Holloway, whose team didn\u2019t play a game between Jan. 3 and Jan. 22 because of the Iona postponements. \u201cSometimes you prepare all week for one team and then they throw you another team. We were out 20 days, and knock on wood, we haven\u2019t had a positive test yet, so being out 20 days kind of knocked our rhythm off, kind of messed us up just game-planning-wise. So I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for teams like Iona and Monmouth and Siena that have had long pauses. There\u2019s no way to prepare for it.\u201d\n Monmouth didn\u2019t play its first game of the season until Dec. 15 because of positive virus tests among the team. The program announced another pause last week.\n Siena did not begin its season until Jan. 3 and has now played eight games.\n Pitino said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d that some of his players are symptomatic as students get set to return to campus Feb. 1.\n \u201cWe are very blessed compared to the 400,000 deaths and all the families that have suffered with not even being able to have funerals,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cSo my heart breaks for those people, and certainly with the vaccine coming out and maybe by this summer we\u2019ll have some good news.\u201d",

McKay (D-At Large), who co-sponsored the policy with Supervisors Dalia A. Palchik (D-Providence) and John W. Foust (D-Dranesville). \u201cImmigration enforcement is done by others.\u201d\n The policy builds on a step taken by the county police department last summer that bars officers from asking about or disclosing a person\u2019s immigration status or giving information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that can be used to locate someone targeted for deportation.\n County officials said anxieties over deportation have kept some residents from seeking county services meant to help those who have been affected by the pandemic.\n Nearly 58,000 Fairfax residents have been infected by the coronavirus, a third of them Latino, according to the county health department. Meanwhile, office custodians, restaurant employees and construction workers \u2014 many of whom are undocumented \u2014 have been put out of work by the economic downturn triggered by state pandemic restrictions.\n \u201cThere are folks in our community who are fearful and they are not willing to come forward and ask for help, because they think they\u2019re going to put themselves in jeopardy,\u201d said Supervisor Rodney L. Lusk (D-Lee).\n Supervisor Pat Herrity (R-Springfield) cast the sole dissenting vote. He said his opposition was based on a portion of the policy that allows county employees to accept nongovernment identifications while providing services, which Herrity called a potential liability risk to the county.\n Immigrant advocates, who pushed for the new policy in response to more-aggressive immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump, lauded the county board\u2019s action.\n \u201cFor four years, we have marched, spoken out and stood up for our rights as immigrants, and now we can finally breathe easier,\u201d Luis Aguilar, Virginia state director of the CASA immigrant advocacy group, said in a statement.",

        "source": "washpost",
        "title": "Governors\u2019 shutdowns did not cause the pandemic jobs crisis",
        "body_text": "The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 416,000 Americans and recently pulled the U.S. economic recovery into reverse. Some states have shut down again to get a handle on surging caseloads. And critics have blamed those states\u2019 governors, typically Democrats, for job losses.\n But pandemic-related economic research shows the shutdowns aren\u2019t killing jobs; the virus is.\n In the first outbreaks last spring, people stayed home to avoid contracting the deadly novel coronavirus, regardless of what their governor said.\n Indiana University economists Sumedha Gupta, Kosali Simon and Coady Wing reviewed more than 60 pandemic and social-distancing studies for a review article forthcoming in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity. With the input of those economists and other experts, we\u2019ve reviewed the basic data and some of the strongest research. Four facts emerged from the spring shutdowns.\n If stay-at-home orders poisoned an otherwise healthy economy, business should have crumpled the moment they kicked in. But cellphone activity data analyzed by Gupta, Simon and Wing show a different trend: People started to stay home well before states imposed shutdowns.\n In the chaotic early days of the pandemic, most people didn\u2019t wait for official stay-at-home orders, Simon said. In every state, they stopped going to work around the weekend of March 14, as uncertainty soared, stock markets collapsed and the World Health Organization officially declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.\n Typically, economic data is measured in months, quarters and years. But when dealing with a pandemic that spreads so fast that it creates an exponential curve of runaway devastation, economists needed to measure changes in a matter of days. To do so, they harnessed a new generation of indicators based on cellphone activity and other alternative data sets from the private sector.\n \u201cMost of the economic damage we\u2019ve seen is produced by people\u2019s reaction to the virus,\u201d Wing said. \u201cSocial distancing policies mattered, too, but they were layered on top of a major change in personal behavior.\u201d\n Business collapsed so quickly in mid-March that it\u2019s tough to disentangle correlation and causation. But several high-profile teams of economists, armed with that high-frequency data and sophisticated statistical methods, arrived at similar conclusions.\n In one such study, economists Chad Syverson and Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business used anonymized cellphone tracking data to compare traffic at businesses in shutdown areas with similar businesses in the same metro area (really, commuting zone) that weren\u2019t shut down.\n Business fell by more than half (53 percent) regardless of whether a place shut down, as people everywhere were trying not to leave their homes. In shutdown areas, activity fell another 7 percent, meaning shutdowns caused less than an eighth of the drop in business.\n \u201cIf pandemic concern or fear leads both to people staying home and policymakers imposing lockdowns, then the fear is the true driving force,\u201d Syverson said. \u201cEconomic declines and lockdowns happen to be correlated because they\u2019re pushed by the same thing, even though one isn\u2019t necessarily causing the other.\u201d\n Goolsbee and Syverson found that business activity declined even more in areas with more covid-19 deaths, which emphasizes the role that the fear of the virus played in keeping people at home. (Goolsbee chaired President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers during the Great Recession before returning to the University of Chicago.)\n One other piece of supporting evidence? The economists found that businesses that drew the largest crowds before the pandemic were the same ones that saw the sharpest declines, relative to their size. That indicates consumers were spooked by the virus and sought out stores they knew were likely to have few customers. That trend was especially pronounced in areas with worse coronavirus outbreaks.\n If the shutdowns had been the major obstacle to business activity, consumer spending built up during the shutdown period would have been unleashed in a torrent of pent-up demand when the shutdown was lifted.\n Instead, Goolsbee and Syverson found, economic activity returned about 5 percent faster in places that lifted their shutdowns compared with those areas not shut down.\n When business didn\u2019t return appreciably faster in areas that lifted their shutdowns, it was clear that shutdowns couldn\u2019t be the primary reason people were staying away from businesses, Goolsbee said.\n The Washington Post often hears from readers who blame job losses on Democratic governors who have often imposed shutdowns when coronavirus cases surge. If Democrats are really responsible for job losses, we would expect to see employment fall off the cliff in blue states while employment in red states sail on untouched. But even the simplest analysis shows job losses don\u2019t depend solely on the governor\u2019s party. Some red states struggled; some blue states thrived.\n Gupta notes that readers are oversimplifying when they equate \u201cDemocrat\u201d and \u201cshut down.\u201d A large majority of Republican-led states also shut down. But a trend emerges in the chart below. Red states, on average, have recovered slightly faster than blue states.\n Ohio State University economist Bruce Weinberg warns that charts like this can obscure an obvious truth: \u201cThe states that have Democratic governors differ in many ways from the states that have Republican governors.\u201d\n For example, Republican states tend to have lower population density, and states with lower population density have added jobs more rapidly. To tease apart that correlation, compare the jobs recovery in counties of similar population density within red and blue states.\n When we looked at job losses by the governor\u2019s party, rural and suburban areas of red and blue states lost jobs and began to recover at almost exactly the same pace, regardless of which party was in charge. It was only the densest counties in states with Republican governors that saw slightly faster recoveries than those with Democratic governors. To take two extreme examples, compare the Ohio county containing Cincinnati, which has seen almost a complete recovery from the crisis under Republican Mike DeWine, to the boroughs of New York City. Under Democrat Andrew M. Cuomo, the five boroughs are still missing about 1 in 7 jobs lost in the crisis, Labor Department data shows.\n Economists are reluctant to attribute the gap entirely to additional rounds of shutdowns in the densest urban areas, such as the counties containing New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. They caution that some of the largest cities in Democratic-led states were hit harder and faster by the virus, and may host more workers and industries that are vulnerable to the pandemic.\n For example, New York City was hit so hard with the coronavirus last spring and it remains so incredibly dense, with tens of thousands of people living in apartment buildings on small city blocks, that even when the shutdown eased, people tended not to go out.\n (We\u2019re looking at jobs here \u2014 indicators such as the unemployment and labor-force participation rates show a smaller gap between states led by Republican or Democratic governors.)\n When we step back, the most striking thing about this chart is that, as the first wave of shutdown research would predict, there\u2019s little difference in employment between red and blue states despite some variation in policy. After all, regardless of politics, American states all had one enormous thing in common in 2020: the coronavirus.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) A federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the Biden administration's pause on deportations Tuesday, delivering a blow to one of the administration's first immigration actions.\n The early defeat, even if temporary, demonstrates the limits of President Joe Biden's executive actions, which are expected to be challenged in court.\n Tuesday's order stems from a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenging the 100-day pause on deportations, which took effect Friday. The complaint cited in part an agreement signed between the Department of Homeland Security and Texas in the waning days of the Trump presidency that required the department to consult the state before changing or modifying policies.\n Judge Drew Tipton of the Southern District of Texas, however, said the temporary restraining order was appropriate under the Administrative Procedure Act. Tipton blocked the Biden administration from executing its deportation pause for 14 days.\n Tipton, appointed by President Donald Trump, also found that Texas could be harmed if the moratorium were to continue. \"In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the threat of injury to Texas outweighs any potential harm to Defendants and the public interest is served and protected by the issuance of this TRO,\" he wrote.\n The moratorium has only been in place for five days.\n The White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment on the ruling.\n Paxton applauded the ruling, saying in a statement: \"The Court's decision to stop the Biden Administration from casting aside congressionally enacted immigration laws is a much-needed remedy for DHS's unlawful action. A near-complete suspension of deportations would only serve to endanger Texans and undermine federal law.\"\n Biden's first days in office have been marked by the release of his ambitious immigration agenda, but the ruling has whiplashed immigration attorneys, who just days earlier were trying to make sense of the new memo.\n \"In a word: unbelievable. Despite the limited nature of the TRO grant (a two week pause of the pause), the decision is breathtakingly wrong,\" said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney based in North Carolina and the American Immigration Lawyers Association first vice president.\n The Biden moratorium covers most deportations but excludes individuals who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, have waived rights to remain in the US or who've been determined removable by the acting director, according to an agency memo.\n Just as swiftly as the new memo took effect, so came a legal challenge from Paxton.\n The Republican led an attempt to void Biden's Electoral College victory last month and will be a constant presence in federal court attempting to block the Biden administration's policies on immigration.\n During the Trump administration, Paxton also led a lawsuit challenging the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. The case is ongoing. He is also at the head of the latest lawsuit at the Supreme Court challenging the Affordable Care Act.\n The case over the deportation pause has moved quickly.\n On Monday, Tipton asked the Biden administration to clarify its moratorium after Texas submitted a Fox News report to the court that cited an internal email instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to \"release them all, immediately.\"\n The Justice Department submitted the correspondence, which originated in the Houston field office, on Monday afternoon. An official appears to notify the workforce about the moratorium announced the previous day, telling them to \"stop all removals\" as of midnight, but that email is later followed by another official calling for the directive to be retracted immediately.\n \"Please direct your supervisors to follow the memorandum issued. Operational guidance is being developed and will be issued in the coming days,\" the email stated, adding: \"Any questions on removals, releases, and/or arrests that we cannot determine fit squarely into the directive will be forwarded up through me to HQ for further discussion and decisions.\"\n The Justice Department also told the court that some undocumented immigrants with removal orders had been released from custody, but as part of separate litigation relating to Covid-19. DHS has discretion in who it releases, the Justice Department added.\n \"There are going to be times that the Department of Homeland Security uses its discretion in manners that Texas disagrees... Texas has different views about immigration policy than the current administration,\" said DOJ attorney Adam Kirschner.\n The Justice Department is likely to appeal the ruling.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

        "title": "Nobody Feels Like A Winner In American Politics Right Now",
        "body_text": "Only 12% of Americans feel like their political \u201cside\u201d has been winning more often than losing on the issues that matter, a HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted earlier this month finds. Another 38% say they\u2019re losing more often, with the rest unsure or saying things have been about even.\n Republicans, newly shorn of the White House and Senate, are the least optimistic \u2015 just 12% say they feel they\u2019re generally on the winning side, with 47% saying they\u2019re mostly losing. But Democrats\u2019 views are sunnier only in comparison, with 21% saying they think their side is mostly winning, and 28% saying that they\u2019re more often losing.\n The partisan divide does mark a modest shift since a late December survey, in which Democratic voters were more likely to feel like they were losing than that they were winning, while Republican voters were about evenly split.\u00a0 (That survey, unlike the current one, included only registered voters.)\n There\u2019s a broad sense of public pessimism about the state of the U.S. government, and about the U.S. itself, the latest survey finds. Just 37% describe the system of government in the country as \u201cbasically sound,\u201d and requiring at most some improvement. Another 52% say it\u2019s, at best, \u201cnot too sound.\u201d\n Younger Americans are especially unconvinced that the government is in decent shape: Just 29% of those under age 30 say the system is basically sound, compared with 48% of those 65 and older. Those without college degrees are also less likely than those who hold them to view the system as sound.\n Only a third of Americans say they have a good or very great deal of trust and confidence in the wisdom of the American people to make political decisions, with 55% saying they don\u2019t have very much trust, or that they have none at all.\n Other polls, while not directly comparable, add some historical context. They suggest that although public disenchantment isn\u2019t brand new, it\u2019s also not an immovable fixture of the political landscape.\n Three 1980s surveys, conducted by the Roper Organization and the Opinion Research Corporation, found anywhere between two-thirds and 83% of Americans expressing belief in the basic soundness of the U.S. government; a 2017 Monmouth University survey, by contrast, put that number at about one-half. More recently, Pew Research found that Americans\u2019 trust in their own political wisdom, after remaining positive throughout the late 1990s and as far as 2007, had sunk to negative levels by 2015 and stayed there.\n Another recent historical shift has involved rising levels of partisan antipathy, as well as more sharply drawn distinctions between the two parties.\n In the latest HuffPost/YouGov poll, 48% of Americans say they think there\u2019s a lot of difference between Democrats and Republicans, with 26% saying there\u2019s some difference, and just 15% that there\u2019s little or no difference. Forty percent of Americans say they view politics as a struggle between right and wrong, while an effectively identical 41% say they don\u2019t think about politics this way.\n Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the biggest divides on these questions are not by party, but by people\u2019s level of interest and attention in politics. Among those who say they follow what\u2019s happening in government and public affairs \u201cmost of the time,\u201d two-thirds see a lot of difference between the parties, and 52% see politics as a struggle between right and wrong. Among those who follow current events, at most, \u201cnow and then,\u201d those numbers are just 39% and 25%, respectively.\n The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 14-18 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov\u2019s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available here.\n Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 26 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n (CNN) President Joe Biden had it right last week in his inaugural address, when he anticipated how his effort to bridge America's catastrophic political divides would go down in the tumult of post-Trump Washington.\n Biden's dream of recreating an idealized era when lawmakers and presidents worked across partisan lines to benefit everyone is popular with voters -- but nearly impossible to implement.\n Even moderate Republicans people like Utah's Sen. Mitt Romney and Maine's Sen. Susan Collins are worried about the size and speed of Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan. Other Republicans, who are intimidated by Donald Trump's hold on their party base or have future presidential ambitions, are already accusing the President of forgetting his idealistic aspirations.\n \"President Biden sounded a lot of notes of unity in his inaugural address. But unfortunately when he got back to the White House, he implemented a bunch of far-left policies,\" Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton told Fox News last week.\n The disingenuous logic of such arguments is that if Biden actually carries out  the policies on which he campaigned (rejoining the Paris climate accord or  investigating police violence, for example) he will be a hypocrite on unity -- because Republicans disagree with him. Donald Trump's looming impeachment trial is not doing much for the mood between parties either.\n But Biden's naive-sounding hopes for compromise and cooperation are often misunderstood. The President does not believe in some pie in the sky world where bitter rivals drop their differences. He just thinks the disagreements should not spark endless political warfare. In a news conference on Monday, Biden defined unity as simply the absence of \"vitriol\" and personal attacks from politics.\n It still seems a bit of a long shot in bitter Washington. But it's hard to argue that it wouldn't be better for everyone.\n Democratic House impeachment managers were led through the Capitol on Monday to deliver an article of impeachment against Trump.\n By now, it's a familiar scene for most Americans -- just over a year ago, Democratic impeachment managers did the same thing ahead of the former President's first impeachment trial.\n In his first speech since Trump left office, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pointedly called for more global cooperation, multilateralism and free trade following years of trade tensions with the previous US administration.\n \"We should reject the outdated Cold War and zero-sum game mentality, adhere to mutual respect and accommodation, and enhance political trust through strategic communication,\" Xi told a (virtual) gathering of global elites at the World Economic Forum's Davos event. \"It is important that we stick to the cooperation concept based on mutual benefit, say no to narrow-minded, selfish beggar-thy-neighbor policies, and stop the unilateral practice of keeping advantages in development all to oneself.\"\n If only some countries would \"abandon ideological prejudice\" (the West's nagging of China on human rights comes to mind) a path of peaceful coexistence and \"win-win cooperation\" awaits, he added.\n But while Biden spent the weekend phoning world leaders to assure them America is back, he is in no hurry to reconcile with China, and especially not on Xi's terms.\n A few hours after Xi spoke, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki threw cold water on the idea of \"win-win.\" \"We're in a serious competition with China, strategic competition with China is the defining feature of the 21st century. China's engaged in conduct that hurts American workers, blunts our technological edge and threatens our alliances and our influence in international organizations,\" Psaki told reporters at the White House's daily press briefing.\n \"What we've seen over the last few years is that China's growing more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad and Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity and values in significant ways that require a new US approach. ... We want to approach this with some strategic patience,\" she said.",

        "title": "The GameStop saga is captivating Wall Street \u2014 for good reason",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\n London (CNN Business) The meteoric rise in GameStop's stock, as traders congregating on Reddit and Discord take on short sellers and hedge funds, is hard to look away from. It's the closest thing Wall Street has to David vs. Goliath.\n What's happening: Shares of GameStop (GME), a legacy company whose stores are often located in struggling malls, have soared dramatically over the past two sessions as day traders push the stock with growing fervor. The stock, which closed out 2020 at $18.84 per share, finished the day at $76.79 after trading was halted multiple times due to volatility. At one point, it climbed to nearly $160, a record high.\n You read that correctly. GameStop, which is expected to lose money this year and next, has more than quadrupled in value in under a month because it's effectively become a meme stock. Since the beginning of 2020, it's jumped more than 1,100%, outpacing even Tesla's gains. Shares are up another 20% in premarket trading.\n Investors on social media had been arguing that GameStop was seriously undervalued and cheered earlier this month when the company added Chewy founder Ryan Cohen, who has been pushing a digital overhaul, to its board. Now, the focus is on momentum, as small investors hope the hype can help the stock keep rising.\n It's evident, however, that the saga has grown into much more than an argument over the future of a video game retailer, or the merits of different trading approaches. As no-fee apps like Robinhood democratize access to financial markets, some are reading it as a generational fight between the old and new guard of the investing world.\n Users on Reddit cheered when veteran short seller Citron Research said it would stop commenting on the stock, citing harassment from GameStop's backers. Melvin Capital Management, which bet against GameStop's rise, has had to accept an infusion of cash after suffering steep losses, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n \"As someone who started trading stocks in the late '90s in college, I would always remember watching when the small retail trading groups would get crushed by hedge funds and savvy short-sellers,\" Oanda analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients this week. \"What happened with GameStop's stock is a reminder of how times are changing.\"\n David certainly now has Goliath's attention.\n \"Starts opening r/WSB with my usual morning tabs,\" market strategist Michael Antonelli of R.W. Baird tweeted Monday, referring to the Reddit message board where much of the GameStop action has been coordinated.\n Traders on such platforms have been plugging other stocks with major results, too. BlackBerry shares, another fan favorite, are up more than 170% in 2021. They jumped 28% on Monday alone.\n Big picture: The wisdom of such trading decisions is certainly debatable. After all, it's near impossible to argue that GameStop's value has actually increased exponentially in a matter of weeks. Some gains are also attributable to a so-called \"short squeeze,\" as those who bet against the stock rush to buy in so they can cover some of their losses.\n But once the GameStop dust settles, expect Wall Street's asset managers to watch where the retail trading hive mind wanders next. Clearly, it can have an impact.\n Lawmakers confirmed Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary on Monday, making her the first woman in American history to hold the position.\n Now, she's tasked with shepherding President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package through Congress. And with former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial set to begin in the Senate in just two weeks, there's pressure to act fast.\n That could be a problem, given opposition to parts of the package from Democrats and Republicans.\n The latest: Members of both parties expressed reservations about spending so much money on a Sunday call with Brian Deese, head of the National Economic Council, multiple aides told my CNN colleagues.\n \"It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope,\" Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said in a statement.\n While lawmakers acknowledge more money for testing and vaccines is essential, billions in state and local funding, $1,400 stimulus checks and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour are proving more controversial.\n Conversations in the coming days will test Biden's commitment to promoting bipartisanship.\n Biden and Yellen are angling to get members of both parties on board. But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Sunday that Democrats would use a procedural tactic to pass major parts of the measure if Republicans don't budge. Biden didn't rule the method out on Monday.\n Investor insight: With Democrats in control of both houses of Congress and the White House, investors have been banking on the swift passage of additional stimulus measures. As the battle lines are drawn, some are getting nervous.\n Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's remarks that a bill could take four to six weeks to pass were a wake-up call.\n \"[This] seemed to remind markets of the underlying risks to a market trading at the highs,\" he said in a note to clients Tuesday.\n Delays over delivering vaccines from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) in Europe are a harsh reminder that successful vaccination campaigns remain dependent on output from the private sector.\n The latest: AstraZeneca has informed EU leaders that it will not be able to deliver as many doses of its vaccine as promised, putting government rollout plans at risk. The news comes after Pfizer delivered fewer doses of its vaccine than expected last week.\n Government leaders in Europe are furious, claiming the holdups will have serious consequences.\n \"The European Union wants the ordered and pre-financed doses to be delivered as soon as possible,\" EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a statement. \"And we want our contract to be fully fulfilled.\"\n Big picture: The full consequences of the delays will become apparent in the coming weeks. Pfizer said it will resume deliveries as scheduled this week after upgrading its plant in Belgium so it can churn out more doses; problems at AstraZeneca, which pointed to lower-than-expected yield at a European site, are believed to be more severe.\n The situation highlights how fragile vaccine supply chains are as they get up to speed, and underscores the risks to estimates from economists and investors about when life will return to normal.\n \"We will have more of these ups and downs until we get to a stable process,\" Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, told me.\n 3M (MMM), Alaska Air (ALK), American Express (AXP), GE (GE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Lockheed Martin (LMT), UBS, Verizon (VZ) and Xerox (XRX) report earnings before US markets open. Capital One, Microsoft (MSFT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Texas Instruments (TXN) follow after the close.\n Also today: US consumer confidence data for January posts at 10 a.m. ET.\n Coming tomorrow: A massive earnings week continues with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA).",

        "title": "Senate Confirms Antony Blinken As 71st Secretary Of State",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Antony Blinken as America\u2019s top diplomat, tasked with carrying out President Joe Biden\u2019s commitment to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine that weakened international alliances.\n Senators voted 78-22 to approve Blinken, a longtime Biden confidant, as the nation\u2019s 71st secretary of state, succeeding Mike Pompeo. The position is the most senior Cabinet position, with the secretary fourth in the line of presidential succession.\n Blinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. He has pledged to be a leading force in the administration\u2019s bid to reframe the U.S. relationship with the rest of the world after four years in which President Donald Trump questioned longtime alliances. He is expected to start work on Wednesday after being sworn in, according to State Department officials.\n \u201cAmerican leadership still matters,\u201d Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his Jan. 19 confirmation hearing. \u201cThe reality is, the world simply does not organize itself. When we\u2019re not engaged, when we\u2019re not leading, then one of two things is likely to happen. Either some other country tries to take our place, but not in a way that\u2019s likely to advance our interests and values, or maybe just as bad, no one does and then you have chaos.\u201d\n Blinken vowed that the Biden administration would approach the world with both humility and confidence, saying \u201cwe have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad.\u201d\n Despite promising renewed American leadership and an emphasis on shoring up strained ties with allies in Europe and Asia, Blinken told lawmakers that he agreed with many of Trump\u2019s foreign policy initiatives. He backed the so-called Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, and a tough stance on China over human rights and its assertiveness in the South China Sea.\n He did, however, signal that the Biden administration is interested in bringing Iran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew in 2018.\n Trump\u2019s secretaries of state nominees met with significant opposition from Democrats. Trump\u2019s first nominee for the job, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, was approved by a 56 to 43 vote and served only 13 months before Trump fired him in tweet. His successor, Pompeo, was confirmed in a 57-42 vote.\n Opposition to Blinken centered on Iran policy and concerns among conservatives that he will abandon Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran.\n Blinken inherits a deeply demoralized and depleted career workforce at the State Department. Neither Tillerson nor Pompeo offered strong resistance to the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to gut the agency, which were thwarted only by congressional intervention.\n Although the department escaped proposed cuts of more than 30% of its budget for three consecutive years, it has seen a significant number of departures from its senior and rising mid-level ranks, Many diplomats opted to retire or leave the foreign service given limited prospects for advancement under an administration that they believed didn\u2019t value their expertise.\n A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School and a longtime Democratic foreign policy presence, Blinken has aligned himself with numerous former senior national security officials who have called for a major reinvestment in American diplomacy and renewed emphasis on global engagement.\n Blinken served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration before becoming staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chair of the panel. In the early years of the Obama administration, Blinken returned to the NSC and was then-Vice President Biden\u2019s national security adviser before he moved to the State Department to serve as deputy to Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now serving as special envoy for climate change.",

        "title": "Biden chief of staff: President wants schools open but US must 'make the investments' needed to safely return",
        "body_text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden wants schools to reopen but believes Congress must make the necessary investments to safely return to in-person learning, his chief of staff Ron Klain said Tuesday, on the heels of several school districts' last-minute canceled re-openings and a government study indicating teaching kids in person is possible with the right precautions.\n \"I'll give you a word: Money,\" Klain told CNN's Erin Burnett when asked why he thought some public schools across the country are still closed in places where private schools are open. \"That's why the President of the United States sent a plan into Congress, even before he took office, to make the investments you need to make the schools safe.\"\n Klain referenced a study published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which researchers looked at data on 17 K-12 schools in rural Wood County, Wisconsin, which conducted in-person learning last fall. They found lower Covid-19 case rates than in the community at large, and few cases of in-school transmission. Cohorts of 11 to 20 students from the same grade level met for classes and lunch indoors, where students were often seated next to the same person.\n \"Students in very small pods, classes of about 11 or 12, distanced, in a rural area -- they can go to school safely, and governors who made those investments,\" Klain said, adding that \"in other states, we haven't seen those kinds of investments.\"\n \"President Biden has sent a plan to Congress that will make sure that a majority of our schools can be open within 100 days,\" he continued. \"We need Congress to pass that plan so we can do the kinds of things you need to do so that the schools can be safe, so the teachers can be safe, so the students can be safe -- sadly, it costs money.\"\n Klain also defended the Biden administration's ambitious goal to vaccinate 1 million people per day in his first 100 days in office, even after criticism from some observers who say the administration isn't being ambitious enough.\n \"We've been here seven days, we've ramped up capacity higher than it's ever been. We're moving into the states faster with more certainty and clarity,\" he said. \"But there are just some limitations on this process -- the President has been very honest, we're inheriting a system that was built with limited capacity.\"\n He added, \"We are asking the drug makers to dial that up, there's only so fast they can increase that. So we are ramping this up, as you said, capacity up starting next week and the week after. We hope capacity will go up even more in March.\"\n When pressed on Biden's comments Monday that he expects that the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day -- raising the bar by roughly 500,000 more daily vaccinations -- and whether daily vaccinations could be increased further, Klain pointed to where vaccine efforts had been previously.\n \"Our goal is to hit a million, 100 days out of 100 -- no country in the history of the world has ever done that, never happened before, so that's a pretty ambitious goal,\" he said. \"Obviously the President is pushing us to see if we can do better than that -- we hope we can do better than that. But if we hit that 100 million shots in the first 100 days, that will be something that no one has ever done before.\"\n Klain added, \"No one is going to limit shots, we're going to get as many shots into as many arms as we can. We think 100 million shots in 100 days is an ambitious goal. If we can do better than that, of course we will.\"\n CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas and Zachary B. Wolf contributed to this report.",

        "title": "After Trump's Execution Spree, Criminal Justice Leaders Urge Biden To End Death Penalty",
        "body_text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s final week in office, the federal government executed three prisoners on death row. By the time President Joe Biden was inaugurated, the Trump administration had overseen a record 13 executions in seven months, a killing spree unparalleled in modern U.S. history.\n Now, a coalition of prosecutors and attorneys general is calling on Biden to immediately end the federal death penalty, calling it \u201can assault on human dignity and an affront to American values.\u201d\n In a letter sent on Monday, nearly 100 criminal justice leaders implored Biden to commute the sentences of everyone on federal death row and to instruct federal prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in future cases.\n \u201cThe death penalty is an archaic and failed institution that is rooted in racism and too often punishes the innocent,\u201d said Miriam Krinsky, executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution and a former federal prosecutor who organized the letter. \u201cThe previous administration\u2019s cruel and ruthless killing spree undermined the already-fragile trust in the justice system and revealed that a simple pause on executions is not nearly enough.\u201d\n The Trump administration restarted federal executions last summer \u2014 in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 after a 17-year hiatus in the practice.\n Among those executed by the federal government was Lisa Montgomery, a mentally ill woman who was sexually tortured as a child; Dustin Higgs, who maintained his innocence up until his death; and Corey Johnson, who had an intellectual disability.\u00a0Both Higgs and Johnson were recovering from COVID-19 at the time of their deaths.\n The letter, which was signed by a number of U.S. attorneys and former Department of Justice officials, warns that the death penalty is tainted by racial bias and exists in tension with the constitutional ban against cruel and unusual punishment and the guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.\n \u201cWe also now know that we have not executed the worst of the worst, but often instead put to death the unluckiest of the unlucky \u2014 the impoverished, the poorly represented, and the most broken,\u201d the letter reads.\n \u201cTime and again, we have executed individuals with long histories of debilitating mental illness, childhoods marred by unspeakable physical and mental abuse, and intellectual disabilities that have prevented them from leading independent adult lives. We have executed individuals with trial lawyers so derelict in their duties and obligations that they never bothered to uncover long histories of illness and trauma. We have also likely executed the innocent.\u201d\n There are 49 people left on federal death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n During his presidential campaign, Biden pledged to eliminate the federal death penalty, noting that \u201cwe cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every time.\u201d But he has not elaborated on his plans for the people on death row.\n Federal executions take place at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, which houses the only federal death chamber in the U.S.\u00a0The letter also asks Biden to order that the death chamber be taken apart so it is never used again.\n \u201cWe ask you to not only support federal legislative efforts to end capital\u00a0punishment, but to take all steps in your power to disassemble the machinery of death and ensure future presidents cannot execute the dozens of people on federal death row at will,\u201d the letter says. \u201c[K]eeping intact the death chamber at Terre Haute leaves the stage still set for unspeakable cruelty that says more about us as a society than it does about those we execute.\u201d\n More than 35 members of Congress have also signed a letter asking Biden to commute the sentences of the remaining people on death row.\n Read criminal justice leaders\u2019 full letter below.",

        "title": "Judge Bars Biden From Enforcing 100-day Deportation Ban",
        "body_text": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday barred the U.S. government from enforcing a 100-day deportation moratorium that is a key immigration priority of President Joe Biden.\n U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton issued a temporary restraining order sought by Texas, which sued on Friday against a Department of Homeland Security memo that instructed immigration agencies to pause most deportations.\n Tipton\u2019s order is an early blow to the Biden administration, which has proposed far-reaching changes sought by immigration advocates, including a plan to legalize an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Biden promised during his campaign to pause most deportations for 100 days.\n The order represents a victory for Texas\u2019 Republican leaders, who often sued to stop programs enacted by Biden\u2019s Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. It also showed that just as Democratic-led states and immigration groups fought former President Donald Trump over immigration in court, often successfully, so too will Republicans with Biden in office.\n David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security secretary, signed a memo on Biden\u2019s first day directing immigration authorities to focus on national security and public safety threats as well as anyone apprehended entering the U.S. illegally after Nov. 1. That was a reversal from Trump administration policy that made anyone in the U.S. illegally a priority for deportation.\n The 100-day moratorium went into effect Friday and applied to almost anyone who entered the U.S. without authorization before November.\n Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that the moratorium violated federal law as well as an agreement Texas signed with the Department of Homeland Security late in the Trump administration. That agreement required Homeland Security to consult with Texas and other states before taking any action to \u201creduce, redirect, reprioritize, relax, or in any way modify immigration enforcement.\u201d\n The Biden administration argued in court filings that the agreement is unenforceable because \u201can outgoing administration cannot contract away that power for an incoming administration.\u201d Paxton\u2019s office, meanwhile, submitted a Fox News opinion article as evidence that \u201crefusal to remove illegal aliens is directly leading to the immediate release of additional illegal aliens in Texas.\u201d\n Paxton has championed conservative and far-right causes in court, including a failed lawsuit seeking to overturn Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, as he himself faces an FBI investigation over accusations by top former aides that he abused his office at the service of a donor.",

        "body_text": "(CNN) The day after President Joe Biden's inauguration, a large number of National Guard troops protecting the US Capitol moved to a nearby parking garage to rest. Outrage quickly grew among lawmakers over the situation.\n As CNN reported Friday, miscommunication and confusion surrounded the incident and it remains unclear how, exactly, the decision to move the Guard members came about.\n Republican and Democratic lawmakers have called for investigations into who was responsible for the initial decision.\n Thursday evening, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted out an image of the Guard members in the garage and asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, \"Why are American troops who are tasked with keeping security at the Capitol being forced to sleep in a parking lot?\"\n On Monday evening, McCarthy went further on Fox News, claiming Pelosi removed the Guard members.\n After criticizing Pelosi's opposition to the use of federal forces during last summer's riots and protests, McCarthy claimed that \"after the inaugural, when these National Guard -- these men and women defending us sitting in the Capitol, she was kicking them out into the winter.\"\n According to CNN's reporting, multiple groups including the Capitol Police, National Guard, and the Senate Rules Committee have denied blame for the event, showing a significant breakdown of communication. But none of the different accusations from these groups place blame of making the decision on Pelosi. You can read CNN's reporting here.\n Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, told CNN on Tuesday, \"The Speaker's Office had no role in or knowledge of this matter until news reports emerged,\" adding that McCarthy's staff \"were briefed at the same time as our office was.\"\n On Thursday evening, when McCarthy first tweeted asking Pelosi and Schumer why the Guard members were quartered in the garage, his spokesperson Michele Exner told CNN that \"both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer oversee and ultimately are responsible for the Capitol's administrative matters.\"\n McCarthy's office did not return CNN's request for comment on the minority leader's new claim that Pelosi personally kicked the National Guard out of the Capitol.",

        "title": "Crying may help with pandemic stress, especially if you do it around another person",
        "body_text": "My husband and I were talking about experiences we have missed out on during the pandemic, such as having hospital visitors when our second son was born, when I surprised us both by bursting into tears. Once I started crying, I couldn\u2019t stop. I sobbed and heaved for at least 20 minutes, as built-up stress and grief flooded out of me. Afterward, I felt a sense of peace, as if some of the weight of this pandemic had been eased \u2014 at least in the moments and days that followed.\n Many of us have suffered over the past year, in ways both large and small. We\u2019re more isolated than ever, while also taking on new responsibilities, such as remote schooling or working from home without child care. We may be grieving a death or mourning the postponement of a wedding. During these extraordinary times, stress and sadness can accumulate within us, especially if we suppress our negative feelings.\n After my sobbing session, I wondered: Could crying be a way to help us cope and release some of that stress? And if so, is it a good idea to make ourselves cry?\n There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflexive tears and psychic tears. Basal tears and reflexive tears keep your eyes healthy by lubricating them and ridding them of harmful irritants, respectively. The tears from crying are psychic tears, which Gauri Khurana, a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist in New York, defines as \u201ctears that are expelled during an emotional state.\u201d\n Certain theories about emotional tears have existed for centuries, such as the popular beliefs that crying removes toxins from the body and always leads to a feeling of catharsis, or emotional release, says Lauren Bylsma, an assistant professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pittsburgh who researches crying and emotional functioning.\n But research about crying is limited, she says, partly due to the difficulty of mimicking emotional situations in a lab and the ethical concerns of studying crying in more natural situations.\n Thus far, the idea that crying provides a physical detox or flushes toxins out of the body  isn\u2019t backed by solid evidence, Bylsma says. And although catharsis can sometimes occur with crying, it\u00a0doesn\u2019t necessarily happen all the time.\n \u201cIt seems that crying occurs just .\u2009.\u2009. after the peak of the emotional experience, and crying is associated with this return to homeostasis,\u201d she says. \u201cCrying might help aid that stress recovery process, but it may be that it\u2019s only under certain circumstances, depending on the context in which the person cries.\u201d There are other, more important factors that play a role in how people feel after crying, she adds, such as the social support they receive.\n Another popular theory about emotional crying that has not been proved by research \u00a0is that holding back your tears, or not crying despite experiencing grief, is unhealthy.\n There is some preliminary evidence suggesting that when people \u201cdeliberately suppress their tears and hold it in, that there can be some negative effects of that, both psychologically and potentially physically,\u201d Bylsma says. You might experience a headache by holding in stress, or you might feel less connected with others if you don\u2019t share your needs.\n Furthermore, \u201cemotional restraint with suffering can then also translate into emotional restraint with joy and happiness,\u201d says Jennifer Henry, director of the Counseling Center at Maryville University, because being able to cry is a way to acknowledge your feelings.\n But Bylsma adds that it\u2019s important to understand that there are significant differences in people\u2019s tendencies to cry. You \u201cmight not have the urge to cry, and that\u2019s not necessarily unhealthy,\u201d she says. Nor is it necessarily harmful to suppress crying when it might have unwelcome consequences, such as \u201cif you\u2019re crying at work\u00a0and it impacts your work performance or it\u2019s an inappropriate situation.\u201d\n There\u2019s a lot of variability in how you might experience benefits from crying, Bylsma says, but one key factor is social context: You\u2019re more likely to experience benefits if you cry around supportive individuals.\n \u201cCrying and opening up really is a social cue to show vulnerability and to show that something\u2019s not right in a way that can\u2019t be expressed with words,\u201d Khurana says. Crying tells others and ourselves that we might need help or  feel overwhelmed \u2014 emotions that are all too common during this pandemic.\n The amount of social connection and support fostered through crying varies by culture and who you cry around, Henry says. For example, crying in front of your\u00a0best friend might evoke more\u00a0comfort than crying around a co-worker. But, she adds, the \u201csocial bonding, the eliciting support and connection\u201d of crying is powerful.\n Whether you cry with someone else or by yourself, shedding tears can also help you \u201cconfront the things that are bothering you and face them and emotionally process them,\u201d Bylsma says. \u201cYou might reach a new cognitive understanding .\u2009.\u2009. by spending that time focusing on it, because crying is something that\u2019s very attention-getting for the individual and for others around you.\u201d\n In this way, crying can be  a signal \u201cto stop and take care of ourselves and to address that\u00a0emotion\u201d by dealing with underlying issues or stressors, says\u00a0Roseann Capanna-Hodge, a\u00a0Connecticut-based psychologist\u00a0and integrative mental health expert.\n Beyond receiving support from others and gaining a deeper understanding of what may be troubling you, crying is also a form of expression. \u201cEmotional expression is healthy in general and something that we want to encourage to help people cope with the feelings they\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Bylsma says.\n Because crying can elicit some social and emotional benefits, is it healthy to make yourself cry? There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all answer, Bylsma says.\n \u201cIt depends on how you\u2019re making yourself cry and what your purpose is in doing it,\u201d Henry adds. \u201cIf you feel like there\u2019s unresolved sadness or something that you really, really need to get out,\u201d she says, there could be some value in \u201ctrying to tap into the emotion that might create the crying.\u201d\n But Bylsma says you shouldn\u2019t be concerned if you can\u2019t cry, especially now. Some people may experience a \u201ctraumatic chronic stress reaction, where they might be feeling numbness\u201d and have trouble being in touch with their emotions because of everything going on, she says.\n Rather than forcing yourself to cry out of the blue, each of the experts recommends allowing yourself to cry \u2014 and even eliciting a crying session \u2014 if you feel stress or emotion building up. \u201cIf a person feels the urge to cry, and feels they need to get out their emotions, they should do it in whatever context will be most helpful, whether it be alone or with someone else or on a Zoom call,\u201d Bylsma says.\n \u201cThe first reaction people have most of the time when we feel the tears starting to come is we try to stop it,\u201d Capanna-Hodge says. \u201cStop trying to put the brakes on it. Let it happen, and give it the time that it needs.\u201d\n To set up for a healthy cry, find a safe, comfortable place for yourself or with someone whom you trust; Bylsma recommends seeking out whomever you generally feel close to and share other kinds of emotional reactions with.\n You can elicit crying by listening to a song that triggers emotion, watching a sad movie, talking with your therapist or simply telling a friend you need to cry. Pay attention to your thoughts, feelings and sensations. When you prompt a good cry, \u201cyour subconscious allows you to release things that may have held you back,\u201d Capanna-Hodge says.\n Crying can look different for everyone. Your cry might consist of a few tears or a half-hour of sobbing. It will also depend on what you\u2019re experiencing, whether it\u2019s a job loss or a stressful week working on the front lines. But if you\u2019re crying consistently over a few weeks or don\u2019t know why you\u2019re crying, it may be a sign to  find a therapist who can  help you determine what\u2019s going on and provide support, Henry says.\n You also can offer a comfortable, supportive space for your family and friends to cry. You don\u2019t need to have a solution; it\u2019s just important to be there with them. Doing so, Khurana says, often allows \u201cthe blossoming of love and just caring in a way that wasn\u2019t there before.\u201d",

        "title": "Biden Sets in Motion Plan to Ban New Oil and Gas Leases on Federal Land",
        "body_text": "[Live: follow our coverage of the Biden Administration]\n WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden on Wednesday will direct federal agencies to determine how expansive a ban on new oil and gas leasing on federal land should be, part of a suite of executive orders that will effectively launch his agenda to combat climate change, two people with knowledge of the president\u2019s plans said Monday.\n An eventual ban on new drilling leases would fulfill a campaign promise that infuriated the oil industry and became a central theme in the fight for the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, where the natural gas extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has become big business.\n The move is the most prominent of several that Mr. Biden will announce Wednesday, the two people said. The president also will direct the government to conserve 30 percent of all federal land and water by 2030, create a task force to assemble a governmentwide action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, issue a memorandum elevating climate change to a national security priority. Mr. Biden will also create several new commissions and positions within the government focused on environmental justice and environmentally friendly job creation, including one to help displaced coal communities.\n The programs and proclamations are supposed to signal that climate change is back on the government agenda, bigger than ever. What they will not deliver, at least yet, is a steep and rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n \u201cCan this administration do a lot on its own? Yes,\u201d said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cif the standard, though, is atmospheric stabilization, I\u2019m skeptical the administration can do anything near enough administratively.\u201d\n That will require legislation, Mr. Adler said, \u201cespecially if a premium is put on getting emissions reductions as soon as possible.\u201d\n A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the orders, and two people close to the administration noted that final decisions on them were still being refined.\n The likelihood that Congress can pass vast parts of Mr. Biden\u2019s $2 trillion climate change agenda is only slightly greater now that Democrats hold the slimmest possible majority in a 50-50 Senate. There is little hope of passing a carbon tax or other mechanism to put a price on greenhouse gas pollution, which would push cost-conscious corporations to emit less.\n Without legislation, the administration will have to rely on the regulatory process to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and smokestacks and improve vehicle fuel efficiency, but that takes time too. It cannot be done by executive order.\n \u201cThe tons of carbon pollution in the air is what matters in the end,\u201d said Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University and co-chairman of a group that delivered climate policy blueprints to the Biden administration.\n Mr. Profeta said the orders on Wednesday did represent an important first step.\n \u201cThe Biden administration can do quite a bit to start to put the country on the right trajectory with its own authorities,\u201d Mr. Profeta said. Wednesday, he said, \u201cstarts the process.\u201d\n The expected clampdown on new oil and gas leases goes further than Mr. Biden\u2019s actions on Inauguration Day, which halted the Interior Department and other agencies\u2019 authority to issue drilling leases or permits for 60 days while the administration reviewed the legal and policy implications of the current federal minerals leasing program.\n The new policy will call on agencies to consider how much federal land and waters should be preserved from mining and drilling or set aside for renewable energy production, according to the two people familiar with that order, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the policy publicly.\n Fossil fuel extraction on public lands and waters accounts for almost a quarter of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and Mr. Biden campaigned on ending new drilling as a key to tackling climate change.\n Much of the environmental community applauded the plan, though some said Mr. Biden is not going far enough.\n \u201cIt\u2019s vital that President Biden permanently ban all new fossil fuel extraction, including fracking, on federal lands and waters,\u201d said Mitch Jones, policy director for Food & Water Watch, an environmental group.\n Throughout the campaign the left wing of Democratic Party pressed Mr. Biden to call for a national ban on fracking, including on private land, where most fracking is done. He refused, but the oil and gas industry remained skeptical. His move on Inauguration Day brought condemnation from the sector and some landowners.\n \u201cYour order is a direct attack on our economy, sovereignty, and our right to self-determination,\u201d the Ute Indian Tribe in Utah wrote to the Interior Department in a letter released by the American Petroleum Institute.\n The climate task force that Mr. Biden is expected to create will devise a plan for what administration officials like to call a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach to climate change, and will focus on two main areas: environmental justice and job creation.\n It will call for every agency to take climate change into consideration in government decisions, from federal procurement to financial regulations to lawsuit settlements, experts said.\n It also will create a number of councils and committees to try to ensure that poor and minority communities as well as Americans who live in coal country see the economic benefits of clean energy policies.\n Mr. Biden also is expected to revive and strengthen an Obama-era presidential memorandum in 2016 elevating climate change to a national security priority and requiring intelligence agencies to incorporate climate change into their analyses of national security threats. It was quickly revoked by the Trump administration.\n Alice Hill, who oversaw climate planning for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that direction from the president is necessary because the senior policymakers who request that analysis, and the intelligence officials who prepare it, often don\u2019t have experience thinking about climate risks.\n \u201cWhen I was in the White House, rarely were climate change risks discussed,\u201d Ms. Hill said.\n She and others said Mr. Biden needed to go further, potentially by converting the memorandum into an executive order that has more authority to direct agencies to take steps like setting strategies and policies to deal with climate-related threats.\n \u201cThe climate reality of today is higher temperatures, stronger storms, more destructive wildfires, sea-level rise, acidifying oceans and extended drought,\u201d said Sherri Goodman, a deputy under secretary of defense for environmental security under Obama and now a senior fellow at the Wilson Center\u2019s Environmental Change and Security Program.\n \u201cWe need a climate security plan for America that climate-proofs American infrastructure and puts climate and clean energy innovation front and center,\u201d she said.",

        "title": "Did Liz Cheney risk everything to impeach Trump?",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Less than two weeks removed from her vote to impeach then President Trump, Wyoming Rep, Liz Cheney (R) faces an effort to oust her from party leadership in Washington, a series of censure motions in the state and a primary challenger from a prominent conservative state legislator. Heck, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is even headed to Wyoming to campaign against her.\n So, how much trouble is Cheney in? I reached out to Nick Reynolds, a political reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune, for that answer -- and more!\n Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n On the other hand, Cheney has amassed an incredible amount of power in a very short amount of time, which has had some huge benefits for Wyoming. In the last four years, she has not faced a serious primary challenge and for the most part, has been a pretty effective voice for Wyoming interests even while serving in the minority.\n Being in Congress isn't just about passing bills, but about the details of your amendments, your ability to grease the wheels with federal agencies, and your ability to work with the other party. Power comes in handy there, and I think people recognize that.\n But some of her positions do conflict with the interests of the state's conservative establishment, including her occasional pushes back against former President Donald Trump, who is incredibly popular here. That, as we've seen in recent weeks, has resulted in quite a lot of blowback from the conservative base.\n It's a pretty unusual development given some of her past positions that have conflicted with Trump. Her criticism of the former president for his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria barely moved the needle here, and she was a very early critic of Trump when she came out against his decision to withdraw from NATO in 2017.\n At the same time, she's also voted with Trump very closely throughout her career, and has supported key initiatives he pushed for, including funding for the border wall. Beyond her foreign policy stances, her conservative credentials have never really been in question.\n But the perception of her being an outsider was a persistent one in that first campaign, and wasn't helped by some of the gaffes she made on the campaign trail -- including improperly applying for a resident fishing license. When I inherited my desk when I started here, I found a \"Cheney for Virginia\" bumper sticker in the top drawer of my desk scattered among the rest of the political memorabilia from past campaigns reporters have collected over the years.\n It was a legitimate campaign issue then, and people still use it against her, even though she's owned property in Teton County for the better part of a decade. For what it's worth, it certainly didn't hurt Foster Friess when he ran for governor in 2018: it's a pretty open fact that he splits his time between his properties in Jackson Hole and Scottsdale, Arizona, and I rarely heard that brought up on the campaign trail then.\n Enzi, up to that point, had followed the traditional progression of federal candidates follow in Wyoming politics. Like his predecessor, Al Simpson, Enzi had earned his stripes. He was a mayor for a while, served some time in the Wyoming Legislature, and had a proven record as a policymaker in Wyoming.\n It was also a different time. Enzi's first campaign was probably the first time we had serious money coming in from out-of-state, but in 2014, politics here was still extremely local. The city of Milwaukee has more residents than Wyoming, meaning to be successful, you needed deep-seated relationships with community leaders in small towns all across the state. Not everybody can do that.\n Cheney didn't make those mistakes in 2016. Most importantly, she also had a lot of money to back her up, helping her to defeat people like Leland Christensen (a long-time state legislator who currently works for Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming) and Tim Stubson, a Casper attorney who served close to a decade in the Wyoming legislature. The fact that there has been no serious primary challenge the last few years says a lot. But of course, not many people can match her fundraising capability... something I wrote about for the Star-Tribune the weekend after her vote.\n At the same time, a large number of very influential people in Wyoming politics -- attorneys, former governors, you name it -- have risen to support her as well. Shortly after her impeachment vote, former Wyoming Governors Matt Mead (a Republican) and Mike Sullivan (a Democrat) signed onto on op-ed in the Star-Tribune supporting her efforts to push back against Trump's attempts to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Petroleum Association of Wyoming, one of the state's most powerful industry groups in the state, has also put out a statement supporting her on Monday, saying Cheney's voice \"carries tremendous weight for all of Wyoming\" in Congress. For a state with just three representatives in Washington, that's a big deal.\n As far as a consensus as to why she did it, I really can't say. There is open speculation that she is considering a higher office -- something she denied as a motivation for her vote when talking to the Wyoming press corps the day of the vote. And from what I've seen from Washington DC, it seems like the conference remains rather divided on what its future is. Given Trump's performance here, Cheney is probably very well aware that her vote would have caused some of this blowback -- something I think is worth remembering when she called her vote a \"vote of conscience.\" You don't make a decision like that lightly.\n After two consecutive defeats for a seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives, Bouchard later rode that reputation to a narrow victory in one of the state's few gerrymandered Republican districts in 2016 and, this year, scored a massive, 30-point victory over one of the best-funded Democratic state house campaigns in Wyoming history.\n Whether the people who dislike Cheney are simply a vocal minority or a sign of a credible grassroots effort to replace her remains to be seen. In Cheney's crowded 2016 primary election, the standard bearer of the Wyoming GOP's conservative wing at the time, Darin Smith (who is also floating a primary challenge, per Wyoming Public Radio), only managed about 15% of the vote, and in this year's Republican primaries, the winner of the Wyoming GOP's straw poll, Bryan Miller, barely broke 10% of the electorate in a Senate primary loss to Lummis.\n But there is some potential for growth. If you look at the state's six-way 2018 Republican primary for governor, eventual winner Mark Gordon won with only about one-third of the total vote, while the two runners-up --  Friess and current Wyoming Republican Party National Committeewoman Harriet Hageman -- combined for nearly 48% of the vote. Both of those candidates were much more conservative than Gordon.\n The best chance for the party's right wing lies with them being able to produce a single, credible candidate with a strong ability to fundraise. Bouchard has sought to use the Internet and conservative media outlets to raise his own profile nationally and expand that donor base in an effort to even the odds.\n However, it's really hard to say whether the 2018 primary elections really inform how many voters would go against Cheney. She still has a very conservative voting record, and still has two years to prove her credentials against a Democratic trifecta in the Oval, the House and the Senate.\n Wyoming also has very loose restrictions on voter registration, leading to a large amount of crossover voting in those primary races as well. While it wasn't significant enough to impact the final result in Gordon's favor in 2018, a contentious enough election could compel some more liberal-minded Wyoming voters to stay in the Republican Party and support Cheney in 2022.\n And the dynamics of each campaign are completely different from one another. But we'll see. In the past few years, we've also seen candidates like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Lauren Boebert come out of nowhere to upend more establishment campaigns in their districts. It'd be na\u00efve for anyone to say it couldn't happen here.",

        "title": "Biden wasting no time naming officials to reverse Trump's immigration policies",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security, largely hollowed out over the last four years, is moving with urgency to staff agencies with people who had front row seats to the hardline immigration limits rolled out under former President Donald Trump, in order to rescind them.\n The department -- the third largest in the US government -- was closely tied to Trump's immigration actions and will continue to play a critical role in the coming months and years as those policies are reversed. Over recent days, the department has started to hire staff with extensive backgrounds in immigrant rights, immigration law and refugee resettlement.\n \"It will have a substantial difference in the ability of the department to execute because people understand what's going on,\" said Peter Boogaard, communications director at FWD.us and a DHS official under President Barack Obama. \"The Trump administration weaponized the immigration system for four years. There's a clear understanding for many of these folks going back in what's at stake here.\"\n Ashley Tabaddor, for example, will serve at US Citizenship and Immigration Services as its top lawyer after nearly 16 years as an immigration judge and holding various positions at the Justice Department before that.\n During the Trump administration, Tabaddor, in her capacity as the president of the immigration judges' union, was outspoken about the impact of Trump's policies -- like imposing case quotas, reversing rulings and curtailing judges' ability to exercise discretion in some cases -- on judges and immigrants.\n President Joe Biden's administration has begun taking steps to shift the tone -- from restricting immigration to welcoming immigrants -- in its first few days. Shortly after taking office, Biden released a slew of immigration executive actions and orders, including reversing the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, halting border wall construction and placing a 100-day pause on deportations.\n Over the weekend, White House officials previewed more actions on the horizon, including creating a family reunification task force, addressing legal immigration and outlining a holistic approach to regional migration.\n If confirmed, Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick for Homeland Security secretary, will be among those leading the charge. The Cuban-born Mayorkas was among Biden's earliest announced nominees and would be the first Latino and immigrant to serve at the helm of the department.\n \"The principles of homeland and security have been tremendously important in shaping my life. My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism and to provide me with the security, opportunity and pride that American citizenship brings to each of us,\" Mayorkas told lawmakers last week, drawing on his own immigrant background.\n The Senate Homeland Security Committee will vote on Mayorkas' nomination on Tuesday. If he receives approval from the committee and then the Senate, Mayorkas will be flanked with staffers well versed in the abundant policy changes of the last four years.\n David Shahoulian, who worked at DHS under the Obama administration, is assistant secretary for border security and immigration. Shahoulian also served as Democratic chief counsel of the House Judiciary Committee -- one of the key committees that obtained documents from the Trump administration about the controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy that resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant families.\n He's joined by Adam Hunter, who serves as deputy assistant secretary on immigration for DHS. Hunter comes from the Refugee Council USA, a coalition of 29 nongovernmental agencies focused on refugee protection. Biden has committed to raising the ceiling for how many refugees can come to the US after years of historic lows.\n Angela Kelley, who has an extensive background in immigration policy, is joining as senior counselor on immigration.\n Early on, the makeup of the Biden-Harris transition team reviewing DHS signaled the incoming administration's awareness of those actions, with Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, as the team lead. Jaddou is rumored to be filling the role of director at that agency.\n \"The Biden immigration team is stocked with seasoned professionals who understand the nuances of immigration enforcement,\" said John Sandweg, who served at DHS under Obama.\n Sharmistha Das, who worked for then-Sen. Kamala Harris, is the deputy general counsel for DHS. Her name has since appeared on a document delaying a Trump regulation that would bar asylum seekers from countries with disease outbreaks.\n Other familiar names in immigration circles, like Tyler Moran and Esther Olavarria, have also come to fill top roles. Moran, who also served under Obama and as senior policy adviser to then-Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, is now special assistant to the President for immigration for the Domestic Policy Council and playing a critical role in the administration's immigration legislative push.\n During the US Conference of Mayors winter meeting Saturday, Olavarria and Moran previewed upcoming immigration actions. Olavarria cited a future executive order that would rescind Trump proclamations that had largely barred the admission of low-income immigrants.\n \"These are policies that ignored the decades -- and centuries, actually -- of contributions that immigrants have made to our economy, to our society, to our culture,\" Olavarria said. \"We'd rescind those policies and return to a country that welcomes immigrants and acknowledges their contributions.\"\n Another executive action would present a new vision for migration, like providing funding to address root causes of migration and standing up a refugee admissions program for Central Americans, according to Olavarria, who also nodded to actions that would put in place a \"fair but efficient asylum program\" on the US-Mexico border and restore the US refugee admissions program.\n Moran stressed, however, that while Biden can make inroads on immigration policy through executive authority, it's still necessary to pass legislation.\n \"The President does have a lot of authority to fix the immigration system in a number of different ways,\" Moran said. \"But what really the President cannot do is provide permanent status to people, and we've made so many runs at this but we really have to get it done to make sure that people are on a path to citizenship.\"",

        "body_text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) China wants to lead the global recovery from the pandemic and become more influential on the world stage than ever before. It might just have the momentum \u2014 and the confidence \u2014 to pull that plan off.\n The world's second largest economy shrugged off much of the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, and its ability to keep growing while the world crashed into recession could mean its GDP exceeds that of the United States later this decade, years earlier than expected.\n \"China emerged from the Covid-19 shock earlier than the rest of the world and authorities are already planning for the long term,\" wrote Fran\u00e7oise Huang, senior economist for Asia-Pacific at Euler Hermes, in a report last week titled, \"The world is moving East, fast.\"\n China just outpaced the United States in attracting foreign direct investment for the first time. And as 2020 was drawing to a close, it signed a trade agreement with the European Union with the aim of boosting growth and giving European companies greater access to its 1.4 billion consumers. Now, Beijing is starting the new year without one of its most aggressive political adversaries, former US President Donald Trump, breathing down its neck.\n President Xi Jinping has already made it clear that he sees China taking pole position in the coming year and beyond.\n And he touted China's ability to propel the global economy by injecting \"more momentum into growth.\"\n China will \"leverage its big-market advantages and the potential of domestic demand to provide more opportunities for cooperation between countries and the global economic recovery,\" Xi said.\n But a host of geopolitical challenges \u2014 including clashes over Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region \u2014 have exacerbated tensions with the West and may stymie efforts to foster multilateral cooperation.\n \"[Xi] is squandering China's global influence through increasingly provocative actions in Xinjiang, in Hong Kong, in the South China Sea, and with respect to Taiwan,\" Reinsch told CNN Business. \"These actions are unacceptable to democracies, and I think we will continue to see them pulling away from China despite its attractiveness as a market,\" he added.\n All told, harsh quarantine measures and additional actions intended to spur growth \u2014 the country also funded major infrastructure projects and offered cash handouts to citizens \u2014 helped China's economy expand 2.3% in 2020 while much of the world was mired in recession.\n \"In and out of lockdown ahead of everybody else, the Chinese economy powered ahead while much of the world was struggling to maintain balance,\" wrote Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC, in a report last week.\n Given China's rapid growth over the last few decades, many economists were already predicting that it would overtake the United States some time after 2030. But the country's ability to weather the pandemic is accelerating that trend.\n \"The skilful management of the pandemic and the hits to long term growth in the West mean that China's relative economic performance has improved,\" researchers at the Centre for Economics and Business wrote in a December report. They now expect China to over take the United States five years earlier than previously forecast.\n Chinese state media \u2014 often seen as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials \u2014 has been touting the country's economic success. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, on Sunday seized on the report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development that showed China receiving more foreign direct investment than the United States last year.\n \"China has faced the US-initiated trade war and the country's strategic containment against China. But China has generally withstood the test,\" The Global Time's editorial board wrote. \"These all add to the outside world's confidence in China.\"\n The investment trend will likely flip back as the United States and Europe recover, according to Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian studies at American Enterprise Institute.\n \"[Foreign] companies will be squeezed out over time by Chinese competitors and China's panoply of anti-competitive practices,\" he said. \"Still, given China's scale and ambition it is a formidable competitor to the US.\"\n China isn't without its challenges.\n Economists stress that there are still threats to the country's future growth. The International Monetary Fund said in December that China's recovery has relied heavily on government support, while private spending hasn't kept up. Others note that a slew of bankruptcies and loan defaults at state-run firms have strained debt markets.\n \"The policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic, while effective in the short-run, is pushing more resources to inefficient state firms and will add to China's debt burden,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research report last week.\n Debt woes have followed China for years, casting a shadow over economic policy.\n On Monday, a policymaker at the People's Bank of China expressed concern during a speech in Beijing that local governments were setting overly aggressive GDP targets. That heightened the risk of accumulating debt, given the relative ease with which the economy can be juiced by borrowing more money, said the official, Ma Jun.\n Ma even suggested that Beijing should abandon nationwide GDP goals, and instead prioritize employment and controlling inflation.\n There's another potential drag on China's growth in the years ahead. It has generally been trying to reduce its reliance on the West in recent years. (China's leading chipmaker, SMIC has been hobbled by recent US restrictions on its business, for example.)\n That's related to a bigger concern for China. While President Joe Biden might strike a more nuanced tone with Beijing than Trump, they don't expect him to completely unwind the trade war, nor abandon efforts to reassert the United States as the world leader on economics and trade.\n Biden \"has prioritized combatting Covid and restoring growth to our economy, but he is at heart a multilateralist,\" said Reinsch of CSIS. \"Once he has made progress on his domestic goals, he will turn his attention to global trade issues as well.\"\n \u2014 Laura He contributed to this report.",

My first pregnancy ended in miscarriage, and I can completely relate to your experience.\n Some of what you are experiencing might be triggered by hormonal changes. Your body needs time to adjust to what you have been through. Contact your doctor, describe your depression and exhaustion, and ask for advice regarding possible treatments, including antidepressant medication. Ask for a referral to a mental health professional.\n It is vital that you continue to take care of your body with good nutrition, light exercise and sleep as you heal.\n Ask your most supportive friend or family member to call you every day at 5 p.m. (or on whatever schedule works for both of you) for the next three weeks. Even if you don\u2019t pick up the phone, knowing that someone is checking in will help.\n You and your partner are bound to experience this loss differently, because the loss of a pregnancy has a physical, hormonal and emotional component for the pregnant woman that her partner cannot experience in the same way.\n Your partner is hurting, too, and may be extremely worried about you, so he doesn\u2019t want to burden you further by expressing his own feelings of loss. This makes both of you feel even more alone.\n Take time every day to hold hands, make eye contact and show deliberate compassion toward each other. Consider ways to memorialize this loss in a way that feels right for both of you.\n There are many online support groups for families experiencing the loss of a child through miscarriage. Mymiscarriagematters.org offers one-on-one supportive mentoring with a volunteer, as well as daily \u201clive chats\u201d on its website and through a Facebook group. The organization has a separate group for men.\n Absolutely Frustrated & Distraught: The best thing for you to do right now would be to take some of the helping energy you are expending on your boyfriend and apply it to yourself. Start attending Al-Anon meetings (virtually) through al-anon.org. Read up on codependency.\n Instead of applying all of your efforts toward helping and healing him, focus on dealing with what might be ailing you. When you understand your own motivations, your presence in this relationship will come into sharper focus. You can then make decisions about your own life, versus trying to control his.\n Innie and a Fan in Longmont: I\u2019m an \u201cinnie\u201d with loudmouth overtones.

        "title": "$200,000 Settlement for Texas Man Pepper-Sprayed While Recording Son\u2019s Traffic Stop",
        "body_text": "A city in Texas has agreed to a $200,000 settlement of a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations and police brutality brought by a man who was pepper-sprayed twice while recording his son during a traffic stop over the summer.\n The city of Keller, which is about 30 miles northwest of Dallas, announced on Sunday that it was \u201cpleased\u201d with the agreement, which still needs to be signed by all parties and filed with the court.\n The city will pay $5,000 toward the settlement, with the remainder to be paid by the Texas Municipal League Intergovernmental Risk Pool, with whom the city of Keller has an insurance policy, the city said.\n The man who sued, Marco Puente, 39, was happy with the settlement, according to one of his lawyers, Scott H. Palmer. \u201cA quick result is obviously worth it to him, to move on and get this past him,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that Mr. Puente has \u201caccomplished his goals of holding them accountable and shedding a spotlight on police brutality.\u201d\n After the Aug. 15 episode, one of the two officers named in the lawsuit was demoted. In addition, Chief Brad Fortune of the Keller Police Department announced several policy changes including providing more frequent reports of police activity to local lawmakers and requiring supervisors to review body and dashboard camera footage recorded by officers.\n Robert J. Davis, a lawyer for the two officers named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n The federal lawsuit, filed last month in the Northern District of Texas, accused the officers of excessive force as well as unlawful arrest and retaliatory arrest.\n The suit also accused one of the officers of racially profiling Mr. Puente\u2019s 22-year-old son, Dillon. The Puentes are Hispanic, and the city of Keller is 87 percent white, according to census figures.\n After the suit was filed, Marco Puente said in an interview that even though he grew up in Keller and had family there, he and his son shared a feeling that \u201cevery time you see a cop, it\u2019s: Is this cop going to pull us over? Are they going to target us? Do they know who we are?\u201d\n In August, Mr. Puente and his son were driving in separate cars on their way to a relative\u2019s house. Dillon was pulled over by Blake Shimanek, who was a sergeant at the time, for making an improper wide right turn, according to the lawsuit.\n Footage from Officer Shimanek\u2019s body camera shows Dillon being asked to step out of the car and then quickly handcuffed. The footage shows his father recording the encounter with his smartphone from his truck, and Officer Shimanek yelling that Mr. Puente was obstructing the roadway and threatening him with arrest.\n When a second officer, Ankit Tomer, arrived, Officer Shimanek directed him to arrest Mr. Puente.\n A photo included in the lawsuit shows Officer Shimanek putting Mr. Puente in a headlock. Mr. Puente was then pepper-sprayed, according to video footage, with Officer Tomer removing Mr. Puente\u2019s sunglasses before spraying him a second time.\n After being sprayed, handcuffed and placed in a patrol car, Mr. Puente repeatedly asked, to no avail, for help, according to the lawsuit. He asked for the irritant to be wiped from his eyes, and said he had trouble breathing, it said.\n After pulling into the sally port of the jail, Officer Tomer stopped the car and got out. Later, when the officer opened the car door again, Mr. Puente could be heard screaming, \u201cI\u2019m begging you man, please!\u201d\n At the jail, Mr. Puente sat for seven minutes pleading for help as Officer Tomer \u201cstood outside the vehicle having a casual conversation with other officers,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Those seven minutes \u201camounted to pure torture,\u201d it said.\n Mr. Puente was charged with resisting arrest and interference with public duties, Mr. Palmer, his lawyer, said. He was released the night he was arrested, and the charges were later dropped.\n Dillon Puente was arrested and taken to jail on charges of making an improper wide right turn. He was later released after paying a fine, Mr. Palmer said.\n On Sept. 8, Chief Fortune said evidence supported the allegation that Officer Shimanek had arrested Marco Puente for offenses he did not commit. Officer Shimanek was demoted to officer from his previous rank of sergeant with the opportunity to reapply to the position after one year.\n Officer Tomer was not disciplined.",

        "title": "45 Senate Republicans Vote To Dismiss Trump's Impeachment Trial",
        "body_text": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and 44 other Republicans voted on Tuesday to dismiss the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump over the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol earlier this month.\n Only five Republicans voted with every Democrat to table Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s effort to stop the trial before it even got started. The GOP senator argued that holding such a trial of a former president was not constitutional, even though there is precedent for the Senate trying former government officials.\n The Senate ultimately rejected Paul\u2019s motion by a vote of 55-45. The trial is formally scheduled to begin on Feb. 9 when House impeachment managers will present their arguments before the upper chamber.\n Paul said Tuesday\u2019s vote was indicative of the lack of support among Republicans for Trump\u2019s conviction, calling that effort \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d Conviction requires the backing of two-thirds of the Senate, an unlikely scenario at this point.\n \u201cIf you voted that it was unconstitutional, then how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?\u201d Paul said to reporters afterward.\n However, some GOP senators said they viewed Paul\u2019s motion as separate from a decision on whether to convict the former president. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who recently announced that he won\u2019t be seeking another term in 2022, called the two issues \u201ctotally different.\u201d\n \u201cI have the same position Mitch McConnell has,\u201d Portman said of Paul\u2019s motion, echoing concerns about constitutionality.\n McConnell previously said that Trump \u201cprovoked\u201d the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, which led to the deaths of five people. And he let it be known to his members that he was open to voting to convict Trump, pledging to \u201clisten to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\u201d\n But in the days since the attack, rank-and-file GOP opposition to Trump\u2019s impeachment trial seems to have hardened. Republicans invited in a law professor to their weekly caucus lunch on Tuesday, prior to the vote on Paul\u2019s motion, to discuss why he believed holding an impeachment trial for a former president was unconstitutional.\n Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), one of the five Republicans who voted with Democrats against Paul\u2019s motion, wasn\u2019t swayed.\n \u201cMy review of it has led me to conclude it is constitutional in recognizing impeachment is not solely about removing a president. It is also a matter of political consequence,\u201d Murkowski told HuffPost.\n GOP Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania also voted against Paul\u2019s motion.\n The dismissal vote took place just three weeks after a violent mob ransacked the Capitol and rummaged through the desks of the very same senators who were seated in the chamber and sworn in as impeachment trial jurors on Tuesday.\n Democrats pledged to hold a timely but fair trial in which Trump would have his chance to present a defense.\n \u201cFormer President Trump committed in the view of many, including myself, the gravest offense ever committed by a president of the United States. The Senate will conduct a trial of the former president, and senators will render judgment on his conduct,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor.",

        "title": "Biden Presses Putin On Navalny In First Call With Russian Leader",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden had his first call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, raising concerns about the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny while pressing the Russian president on his nation\u2019s involvement in a massive cyberespionage campaign and bounties on American troops in Afghanistan, two senior administration officials said.\n Biden has looked to establish a sharp break from the warm rhetoric often displayed toward Putin by his predecessor, Donald Trump. But the new president also looked to preserve room for diplomacy, telling the Russian leader that the two nations should finalize a five-year extension of an arms control treaty before it expires early next month, according to the officials, who were familiar with the call but not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n Unlike his immediate predecessors, Biden has not held out hope for a \u201creset\u201d in relations with Russia but has instead indicated he wants to manage differences with the former Cold War foe without necessarily resolving them or improving ties. And, with a heavy domestic agenda and looming decisions needed on Iran and China, a direct confrontation with Russia is not something he seeks.\n Moscow reached out last week to request the call, according to the officials. Biden agreed but wanted first to prepare with his staff and speak with European allies, including the leaders of the Britain, France and Germany.\n And on Tuesday before his call with Putin, Biden spoke to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, pledging the United States\u2019 commitment to the decades-old alliance founded as a bulwark against Russian aggression.\n Biden told Putin that his administration was assessing the SolarWinds breach and the press allegations that Russia offered the Taliban bounties to kill American troops in Afghanistan. Biden said the United States is willing to defend itself and will take action, which could include further sanctions, to ensure that Moscow does not act with impunity, according to the administration officials.\n A readout of the call from the Kremlin was not immediately available.\n The call came as Putin considers the aftermath of pro-Navalny protests that took place in more than 100 Russian cities over the weekend. Biden\u2019s team has already reacted strongly to the crackdown on the protests, in which more than 3,700 people were arrested across Russia, including more than 1,400 in Moscow. More protests are planned for the coming weekend.\n Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and Putin\u2019s fiercest critic, was arrested Jan. 17 as he returned to Russia from Germany, where he had spent nearly five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Biden has previously condemned the use of chemical weapons.\n Russian authorities deny the accusations.\n Trump was long enamored of Putin and sought his approval, frequently casting doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 elections, including when he stood next to Putin at their 2018 summit in Helsinki. He also downplayed Russia\u2019s involvement in the hack of federal government agencies last year and the allegations that Russia offered the Taliban bounties.\n Despite this conciliatory approach, his administration toed a tough line against Moscow, imposing sanctions on the country, Russian companies and business leaders for issues ranging from Ukraine to energy supplies and attacks on dissidents.\n Biden, in his call with Putin, broke sharply with Trump by declaring that he knew that Russia attempted to interfere with both the 2016 and 2020 elections. But he also stressed the need to extend New START, the last remaining U.S.-Russia arms control treaty, which is due to expire in early February. U.S. officials have expressed confidence in reaching a deal, which would provide transparency into each nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n Biden on Monday told reporters he hoped the U.S. and Russia could cooperate in areas where both see benefit.\n \u201cI find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it\u2019s Navalny, whether it\u2019s SolarWinds or reports of bounties on heads of Americans in Afghanistan,\u201d Biden said.\n Biden\u2019s approach has met with approval from some former U.S. diplomats who have dealt with Russia and are looking forward to seeing how Biden\u2019s team, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his nominee to be the No. 3 at the State Department, Victoria Nuland, delineates the contours of Russia policy.\n Nuland, who held the Europe portfolio at the State Department in President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, is reviled by Putin and his aides in particular for her support of pro-Western politicians in Ukraine. She and Sullivan are said to share opinions about how to deal with Moscow, taking a tough line on human rights and Russia\u2019s intentions in eastern and central Europe while keeping an open channel to the Kremlin on other matters.\n But their starting position is complicated, they say, particularly given Putin\u2019s experience in dealing with Trump, who frequently undercut his own administration\u2019s hawkish stance on Russia by privately trying to cozy up to the Russian leader. Trump also was frequently ill-prepared for foreign leader calls, ignoring warnings from staff, limiting those who could listen on the calls and, especially after calls with Putin, telling very few aides what was discussed.\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard but it\u2019s doable,\u201d said Daniel Fried, a U.S. ambassador to Poland and assistant secretary of state for European affairs in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to figure this out on the fly, but it\u2019s important to pursue New START without hesitation and push back on the Navalny arrest and other issues without guilt.\u201d\n \u201cThey need to do both and not let Putin tell them he won\u2019t accept New START unless they drop Navalny, SolarWinds or Afghanistan,\u201d said Fried, who is now with the Atlantic Council. \u201cYou have to push back and you can\u2019t let Putin set the terms.\u201d",

        "title": "Unions May Complicate Biden\u2019s School Plans",
        "body_text": "The Chicago Teachers Union said on Sunday that a majority of its members had voted to authorize a strike if the nation\u2019s third-largest school district sought to force teachers back into school buildings.\n Chicago Public Schools said it would delay the teachers\u2019 return, originally scheduled for today, by two days for \u201congoing\u201d discussions. Students are still due back on Feb. 1.\n Teachers unions are flexing their muscles nationwide. This weekend in Montclair, N.J., an affluent suburb of New York City, the union also delayed a planned reopening of schools. And in Bellevue, Wash., district officials sought an injunction against the union after teachers, concerned about safety, refused to participate in in-person instruction.\n These actions may complicate President Biden\u2019s plan to reopen schools in his first 100 days in office. He has vowed to throw the strength of the federal government behind an effort to \u201creopen school doors as quickly as possible.\u201d But our colleague Dana Goldstein reports that the return to normality may be anything but speedy.\n About half of American students are still learning virtually. Teachers are uncertain about when they will be vaccinated, and their unions are fighting efforts to return their members to crowded hallways. But some school administrators, mayors and parents feel increased urgency to get children back into classrooms, especially those who are struggling academically and emotionally.\n Biden has ordered federal agencies to create national school reopening guidelines, and support virus tracing and data collection. The White House is also pushing a stimulus package that would provide $130 billion to schools for costs such as virus testing, upgrading ventilation systems and hiring staff.\n But teachers and unions are still leery, and administrators have begun to say what was previously unthinkable: that schools may not operate normally for the 2021-22 school year. Labor leaders are seeking to tamp down Biden\u2019s expectations, and seek measures that would address teachers\u2019 anxiety about in-person school.\n Biden\u2019s pledge is \u201can arbitrary and a political statement, not a pedagogical statement or a science or health statement,\u201d said Kenzo Shibata, a high school teacher and official with the Chicago Teachers Union. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of faith in me.\u201d\n Since school buildings in and around Las Vegas closed in March, 18 students have died by suicide, compared with nine last year, according to Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent. Now, the district, the nation\u2019s fifth largest, is scrambling to bring children back to classrooms.\n \u201cThis story isn\u2019t about the \u2018pro-reopening\u2019 movement,\u201d tweeted Erica Green, our colleague who covers education policy for The Times. \u201cThis story isn\u2019t about \u2018anti-union\u2019 sentiment. This story is about how the pandemic has tested the resilience of this generation\u2019s children like never before.\u201d\n This month, the Clark County school board gave the green light to phase in the return of some elementary school grades and groups of struggling students, even as greater Las Vegas continues to post huge numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths.\n Adolescent suicide during the pandemic cannot conclusively be linked to school closures. National data on suicides in 2020 have yet to be compiled and, even in normal circumstances, suicides are impulsive, unpredictable and difficult to ascribe to specific causes.\n But the pandemic has created conditions unlike anything mental health professionals have seen before, making causation that much more difficult to determine. The parents of a 14-year-old boy in Maryland who killed himself in October described how their son \u201cgave up\u201d after his district decided not to return in the fall. In December, an 11-year-old boy in Sacramento shot himself during his Zoom class. And the father of a teenager in Maine attributed his son\u2019s suicide to the isolation of the pandemic.\n Schools \u201care the nexus of adolescent life,\u201d said Suzie Button, the senior clinical director for high school programming at the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit based in New York that works on suicide prevention.\n \u201cAnd in times like this, young people are sometimes the canaries in the coal mine.\u201d\n Money has been tight for many families during the pandemic, and it can be expensive to buy produce. But most teenagers in the United States do not eat enough fruits and vegetables, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our colleague Christina Caron offered some tips and suggestions for thinking through a diet change.",

The country has 65 active cases, 1,934 confirmed cases in all, and 25 deaths.",

        "title": "Global tally of confirmed coronavirus cases surpasses 100 million",
        "body_text": "(CNN) The world has now surpassed 100 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus. It's a figure that seemed almost unimaginable 12 months ago, when the first case had only just been confirmed on US soil.\n A year later, the pandemic shows little sign of loosening its stranglehold on billions of people's everyday lives. Cases continue to rise sharply in some parts of the world, and every day the losses mount, as more people lose loved ones to Covid-19, lose a business or lose their livelihood.\n On January 15, the official global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpassed 2 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n While the 2 million figure is horrifying, experts say the real death toll is likely much higher. Only confirmed Covid-19 deaths are included in the tally, which means that people who die without a firm diagnosis may not be included.\n Similarly, many people will have been infected with the coronavirus without having a positive test to confirm it. In the early stages of the pandemic fewer tests were available, and testing remains inadequate in many countries now.\n Nonetheless, with a world population of some 7.67 billion, according to the latest World Bank figures, the global case tally suggests that about one in every 76 people has now had the virus.\n Despite countries imposing measures ranging from travel bans to school closures to full national lockdowns, the coronavirus has continued its inexorable spread, reaching every continent by December and leaving a trail of financial hardship, struggling hospitals and heartbreak in its wake.\n The world passed the threshold of 1 million confirmed cases on April 2, and 10 million on June 28, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n It took until November 7 for the world to register 50 million confirmed cases. Since then, the trend has accelerated sharply. The 90 million case mark was passed less than three weeks ago, on January 10.\n Almost a quarter of the 100 million cases reported so far have occurred in the United States, data from Johns Hopkins University shows. And more than 400,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US, a tragic milestone reached on the last full day of Donald Trump's presidency.\n The second-worst affected country in terms of overall case numbers, India, accounts for just over one-tenth of the global confirmed cases. There have been more than 152,000 deaths there, according to Johns Hopkins.\n Brazil has reported more than 8.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and 217,000 deaths, the second highest death toll after the United States.\n Excess mortality figures released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, indicate that around 297,500 more deaths occurred in the EU between March and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2016 to 2019.\n As governments around the world seek to limit further spread of the virus, the emergence of new, more infectious variants is causing great concern to scientists.\n One such variant was first detected in southeast England late last year; another has been detected in South Africa and two more in Brazil. A variation has also been seen in the US state of California that may or may not be driving renewed spread there.\n The B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain has now been found in at least 60 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this month it could worsen the spread of the pandemic.\n Scientists have been racing to see whether the changes in the virus will make it as susceptible to available treatments and vaccines, amid fears that the mutations will allow them to evade some of the immunity induced by vaccination.\n Research released this week provided some reassuring evidence that despite those mutations, people vaccinated against Covid-19 will be protected against the emerging new variants.\n Mass Covid-19 vaccination programs seem to offer the fastest path out of the pandemic -- but countries' access to vaccine supply and the capacity to distribute and administer jabs varies greatly.\n Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the US, Denmark and the UK have led the way in the rate of doses administered per 100 people, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. But some countries have yet to start rolling out inoculations.\n In the US, President Joe Biden has set a target of administering 100 million doses of vaccine in his first 100 days in office. More than 17.5 million doses had been administered across the country as of Thursday, a day after he was sworn in.\n Infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said that despite challenges with the distribution and administration of vaccines, the US \"can and should\" vaccinate 70-85% of US adults by the end of summer, which could mean a semblance of normality by the fall.\n In the UK, the government aims to give everyone in the most vulnerable groups at least a first dose by mid-February, and to have vaccinated all adults by the fall.\n Meanwhile, all those globally who are not vaccinated must continue to rely on the social distancing, hygiene and mask-wearing measures that have become all too familiar since Covid-19 arrived on the scene.\n No one knows how many tens of millions more people worldwide will be infected with the coronavirus -- or how many millions more will die -- before this pandemic is brought under control.\n According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 500 million people, or one third of the world's population at the time, became infected during the 1918 influenza pandemic. That virus caused at least 50 million deaths, of which about 675,000 were in the United States, the CDC says.\n In 2021, hopes remain high that science and modern medicine can prevail against Covid-19 with a fraction of that death toll.\n CNN's Byron Manley and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Schumer navigates landmines from the left and the right as he assumes top Senate job",
        "body_text": "(CNN) It hasn't even been a week since Chuck Schumer assumed his long-sought goal of becoming Senate majority leader.\n But he's already been in a staring contest with Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, over the future of the institution.\n He faces outright opposition from Republicans over President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, including a $1.9 trillion plan to take on the coronavirus pandemic.\n And he must keep his party unified despite a divisive debate over whether it's worthwhile to try to even work with Republicans.\n Schumer has to overcome bad blood from years of fierce battles with the very Republicans he's sought to defeat but whose support he now needs.\n \"What this campaign taught me about Chuck Schumer is that he will say or do anything in order to win,\" Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins told CNN after winning a hard-fought campaign against Schumer-backed groups in 2020. \"It was a deceitful, despicable campaign that he ran.\"\n After serving four decades in Congress, the 70-year-old Brooklynite has now met his moment. He is in charge of muscling through legislation in a chamber split 50-50, confirming Biden's appointments, overseeing the first impeachment trial of a former president, and shaping the debate over the Senate's filibuster, which now grants Republicans significant power over major legislation.\n His fortune reversed in early January, when Schumer witnessed Democrats win two seats in Georgia to take back the Senate. Then within three weeks, a mob assaulted the US Capitol, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting it and Biden was inaugurated. Minutes after he was declared Senate majority leader, Schumer exhaled on the floor, smiled, and said, \"I need to catch my breath, so much is happening.\"\n Since becoming Democratic leader in 2017, Schumer has served only as a minority leader, keeping his caucus together against the proposals of Trump and McConnell.\n But serving in the minority is far different than the majority. Schumer will have to piece together a coalition from a diverse caucus to push legislation through the slow-moving chamber.\n Schumer, who has cut bipartisan deals in the past, will have to showcase those deal-cutting bonafides while keeping at bay restless liberals. The Democratic leader himself may face a challenge from the left in 2022 from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 31-year-old democratic socialist phenom.\n \"He's a very ideological guy in many ways but he's also a creature of the Senate in his own way,\" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who once cut a major 2013 immigration deal with Schumer but was on the receiving end of a barrage of attacks from Schumer-backed groups during his 2020 reelection race. \"He's going to have to somehow deal with the energy of the left and create space for Biden to put some points on the board.\"\n It took Democrats a decade to take back Washington, and Schumer knows that the next two years could be his first and last in his powerful position. In 2014, he bemoaned the health care focused push of the early Obama years as a blown opportunity, arguing Democrats should've first boosted the economy.\n In 2021, the economic and health crises are so great that Democrats want to address both at the same time. Schumer has called the country's twin threats the worst in 75 and 100 years, respectively.\n Schumer has to keep his entire Democratic caucus in line, while trying to appeal to about a dozen Republican senators, to pass massive legislation responding to both crises.\n But crucial rank-and-file Republicans have already dismissed Biden's plan. Collins has questioned why such a huge response is necessary, after Congress just passed a $900 billion bill in December.\n Collins, a crucial vote on most legislation, has broader concerns about working with the Senate Democratic leader.\n Last week, Collins told CNN it's \"absolutely true\" that she would struggle to personally trust Schumer as she works to pass bills in the Senate over the next two years. She said at the time that the New York Democrat had not reached out to her or talked to her on the floor since the campaign. She said there were other Democrats, including Biden, whom she could trust.\n Collins is particularly frustrated with Schumer over the attack ads from the Senate Majority PAC, a Schumer-aligned Super PAC, including a TV ad that said she \"pocketed\" $1.4 million from the drug and insurance industry while showing her reaching into her purse.\n \"What bothered me the most about the type of campaign Chuck ran against me is that he attacked my integrity,\" Collins told CNN. \"He actually ran an ad that called me corrupt and made it look like I was pocketing campaign contributions.\"\n \"I remember the old Senate, where that just never would have been done,\" she added.\n Schumer's office declined to comment for this article.\n In 2004, Schumer had a choice: run for governor or stay in the Senate. The future Democratic leader, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, offered him a seat on the powerful Finance Committee and to chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in the 2006 elections. He took the deal, giving him a national fundraising platform, the power to recruit new members and oversight over taxes, trade deals, health programs and Wall Street.\n Phil Singer, a former spokesman for Schumer, told CNN that the New York senator was attracted to the legislative scope of the Senate.\n \"If you want to get something done meaningfully, that's going to affect people's lives in the long term, the Senate is the best place to do it,\" said Singer, paraphrasing Schumer from a conversation they had at the time.\n Schumer's hard-charging campaign tactics at the DSCC in 2006 and 2008, and round-the-clock efforts to put his party in power since then, has hurt his relationship with Republicans. McConnell has not forgotten that Schumer's Senate Democrats' campaign-arm bashed him for supporting lax regulations and then bailing out Wall Street a dozen years ago.\n The Trump era has not brought Schumer and Republicans, who he has long viewed as anti-government, any closer, as old allies from across the aisle retired and Schumer's relationship with McConnell soured. The Schumer-McConnell relationship hit a new low in 2017, after Schumer voted against the nomination of McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, to be Secretary of Transportation.\n The two talked sparingly during the Trump years and bashed each other publicly on the floor. Many senators hope the frosty relationship will thaw.\n \"I think he's talking to Mitch, which we hope that will continue,\" said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I'm optimistic. He's a consensus builder, not a dictator.\"\n But Schumer's tireless campaigning has endeared himself to the Democratic caucus, and kept it united.\n \"He has held us together the last four years despite having senators that go from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin,\" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, referring to the most liberal and conservative senators who caucus with Democrats. \"It is harder in the majority.\"\n After Democrats failed to take the House and White House in 2016, Schumer expanded his leadership group to include both Sanders and Manchin. He held a Senate Democratic retreat in Manchin's West Virginia to figure out Trump's appeal, and pledged that Democrats and the Republican President could work on an infrastructure project together.\n But by the end of Trump's term, after daily denunciations of Trump's conduct and the attack on the Capitol, Schumer said the President \"should not hold office one day longer,\" calling for his removal either by trial or invoking the 25th Amendment, neither of which have ever been done before.\n Still, some on the left warily view Schumer as too close to Wall Street. Republicans from Trump to Graham have needled the Senate Democratic Leader as Ocasio-Cortez continues to weigh a potential run against him in 2022. Schumer, while dealing with his fragile majority, is trying to maintain his appearances with groups back home, holding regular Zoom calls even while fielding phone calls from Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n \"I think he's very capable, smart, hard-working, tenacious. I've found him to be honest,\" Graham told CNN. \"He's got a problem. He's majority leader with a primary challenge looming over his shoulder.\"\n Schumer's more immediate problem is managing his own caucus, which is divided over whether to eliminate the filibuster, the minority party's main tool to block or slow down bills. Most Democrats want to get rid of it in order to pass much bolder legislation without requiring Republican support.\n Manchin, who is leading a group to find the \"moderate middle,\" wants to keep the 60-vote threshold.\n \"Chuck's a realist, he understands the numbers,\" said Manchin. \"Anybody pushing from the left, the numbers aren't there. We'll go center-left sometime, we'll go center sometime, maybe even center-right some time.\"\n But others, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, want to eliminate it, pointing out that Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama's agenda and Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland with the filibuster. The Republicans erased the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations, after the Democrats had previously eliminated it for other judicial nominees, but that high bar is still in place for legislation.\n McConnell tried to get Schumer to agree to protect the filibuster in exchange for agreeing to rules that will give Democrats their committee gavels.\n \"He wants a veto over every action that the majority will take,\" said Warren. \"Mitch McConnell is fine with getting rid of the filibuster for a United States Supreme Court nominee for a lifetime appointment but he's not OK getting rid of the filibuster for unemployment relief for families that are out of work because of Covid-19?\"\n After Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema both publicly defended the filibuster, ensuring it would be preserved at least for now, McConnell agreed to a power-sharing deal with Schumer. McConnell said that \"no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation.\"\n But it still could. On Monday, Schumer told reporters, \"All I can tell you is we are not letting McConnell dictate how the Senate operates. He is minority leader.\"",

        "body_text": "It\u2019s January 2020 and \u201ccoronavirus\u201d is not yet even a meme. I\u2019m just out of a yearlong relationship and come February, I\u2019m doing what I do best: going on so-so dates and occasionally getting oral sex from random guys from Tinder. I\u2019m back on the scene, ready to return to the familiar groove of online dating.\n But soon, it\u2019s March. Life is put on pause. Panic sets in. A deadly virus has rendered us housebound, and less severe but still worth noting, my dating life has been majorly disrupted. We can\u2019t see our closest friends or family, so a date with a stranger is completely out of the question.\n The loneliness crept in fast. Normally I could fill the void by seeing friends, going out, or even connecting with a hookup from my past, but not now. For a few short weeks, I consider getting back with my ex. I power through that, knowing it would be a decision borne out of fear and scarcity-thinking more than out of genuine regret we broke up.\n So, I stay single and on the apps.\n I start thinking maybe, just maybe, this might mean more available men are on there. Maybe, just maybe, they might even want to be in a relationship. If anything can get a man in Los Angeles to finally be emotionally available, surely it must be a global pandemic.\n Oh, how wrong I was. I was shocked to find that everything was, for the most part, exactly the same as before. But now, with more bad jokes in their bios about having plenty of toilet paper and promising they don\u2019t have the coronavirus even though there was no way they could possibly know that \u2015 this was way before tests were widely available.\n I swipe left endlessly (that\u2019s the \u201cno thank-you\u201d direction), but eventually find some people to swipe right on. When we match, I am shocked to find that most of the initial conversation is still something to the effect of, \u201cCome over.\u201d\n When they\u2019re not saying that, they\u2019re not saying anything at all. We might exchange our hellos and have some obligatory small talk for a few minutes, but I am almost always left on read, especially if I initiate speaking on the phone or video chatting.\n I swiped through Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc., for months and months, only to be met with the same results \u2015 men either not communicating at all, or just trying to hook up. As if I\u2019m going to risk my health for what is sure to be a mediocre experience at best.\n The guys I do speak to are bored, want a companion, want to flirt and exchange nudes, but don\u2019t want to be in a relationship. In other words, nothing has changed. The apps are still exactly the same, except I\u2019m not getting laid as a consolation prize for men\u2019s inability to commit.\n Somehow, eventually, I do meet someone. Sort of. We FaceTime a few times a week and get along really well. But he doesn\u2019t want a relationship. Knowing that \u201ccasual\u201d dating just can\u2019t really exist in this moment in time, I end it.\n Around July to August, my horniness has peaked to levels never before seen. I convinced myself briefly that instead of being in a relationship, I was down to find a COVID-safe hookup buddy who\u2019d be willing to keep it casual \u2015 but also exclusive.\n Yet, of course, anything with the word \u201cexclusive\u201d in it sets off a giant alarm in most noncommittal men\u2019s ears.\n I was going through withdrawals. But I\u2019ve gone long periods of time without sex before, so what was I really withdrawing from? What was I craving, other than sex? Other than a relationship? I think it was simply the notion of dating.\n In the past, even in the bleakest, most sexless periods of my life when the dating pool felt like nothing but a pit of despair, there was still some flirting here and there. Still a crush to occasionally think about. There was still that small ray of hope that said, \u201cWho knows, maybe someone will pop up soon who I wasn\u2019t expecting. Maybe I\u2019ll meet them at a bar tonight, or at a party next week.\u201d\n With the pandemic, that little ray of maybe vanished. I had to face a new reality: Even if I want to date, I can\u2019t.\n The reality is, meeting someone you have a genuine connection with is rare. For them to also be available and ready for a relationship makes it even rarer. In all my years of going through it \u2015 nearly a decade of online dating \u2015 this kind of connection happened only a handful of times. Only once did it lead to an actual relationship.\n Everything I was doing in the months and years in between was senseless flirting and dating just to do it for the sake of it. That\u2019s not all bad, mind you. It has led to some solid hookups, funny stories and interesting friendships.\n However, I\u2019m at a point in my life now where I don\u2019t care for any of that anymore. This pandemic has made clear to me that my time is precious. What I want is that rare thing that doesn\u2019t come around often, and for the first time in all my years of casual dating, I must confront that truth with myself, instead of being distracted with filler dates and trying to make something happen with the occasional guy who comes close to being what I want (but isn\u2019t all the way there).\n I have to actually be completely alone without the diversions. Like, really alone, and not alone but with a new message from some dude on an app. I have to savor being truly, fully single.\n In doing so, I\u2019ve tapped into a part of me that was missing for a long time. I\u2019m more dedicated to my work, more playful with myself and better at taking care of myself. I\u2019ve had an extra spring in my step acknowledging that I finally really do feel like an independent woman. I\u2019ve been getting to know me even better and enjoying my own company. I\u2019m not lonely or sad or even all that horny anymore (shockingly).\n Now it\u2019s 2021 and let me tell you, I am thriving being single now more than I ever have when I was single and swiping. Losing the hope of meeting someone has been freeing, as has being honest with myself about what I desire.\n I\u2019m living day by day, knowing there\u2019s going to be love eventually. Just not now. For the first time ever, I\u2019m being patient and appreciating its benefits.\n Do you have a compelling personal story you\u2019d like to see published on HuffPost?\u00a0Find out what we\u2019re looking for\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0send us a pitch!\n A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus\nIs it safe to see people who have gotten the coronavirus vaccine?\nWhat it means if your partner tests positive for COVID-19 but you don\u2019t.\nHow worried should you be about the new strains of coronavirus?\nThe unexpected challenges of co-parenting during a pandemic.\u00a0\n19 things we took for granted pre-pandemic but now miss.\u00a0\nFind all that and more on our coronavirus hub page.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs COVID-19 cases rise, it\u2019s more important than ever to remain connected and informed.

        "body_text": "WELLINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) \u2014 New Zealand on Monday confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in the community in months in a 56-year-old woman, but said close contacts of the recently returned traveler had so far tested negative.\n The woman, who returned to New Zealand on Dec. 30, had tested positive for the South African strain of the virus after leaving a two-week mandatory quarantine where she had twice tested negative, COVID-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said.\n No other community cases had been reported since the woman\u2019s case was disclosed on Sunday and authorities said the source of the infection was probably a fellow returnee at the quarantine facility.\n Authorities were looking at whether the virus was spreading through the ventilation and air conditioning systems in these facilities, Hipkins said.\n New Zealand Health Chief Ashley Bloomfield said 15 people had been identified as close contacts of the woman and were being contacted.\n However, her closest contacts, her husband and hairdresser, had tested negative, which was encouraging.\n Confirmation of the case led Australia to immediately suspend a travel bubble with New Zealand for 72 hours.\n Anyone arriving from New Zealand since Jan. 14 will need to isolate and stay home until they test negative for COVID-19. Anyone arriving in the next 72 hours will have to go straight into hotel quarantine.\n \u201cThis will be done out of an abundance of caution whilst more is learned about the event and the case,\u201d Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt said late on Monday.\n He said the case was of concern because of the transmissibility of the South African variant and because the woman had been in the community.\n New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, informed her of the move on Monday afternoon.\n \u201cI advised him that we have confidence in our systems and processes, but it is Australia\u2019s decision as to how they manage their borders,\u201d Ardern told TVNZ.\n New Zealand, one of the most successful developed nations in controlling the spread of the pandemic, last recorded a community coronavirus transmission in November, according to the Health Ministry website.\n A tough lockdown and geographical isolation helped the country of 5 million virtually eliminate the novel coronavirus within its borders.\n New Zealand has had only 1,927 confirmed cases. But with the pandemic raging globally, more people are returning with infections, including the new variants, raising concerns the virus may spread in the community again.\n The woman, who lives in Northland on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, quarantined on arrival in a managed isolation facility in Auckland where several highly virulent COVID-19 cases have been recorded in quarantine facilities in recent weeks.\n Bloomfield said the South African variant may be more transmissible but there was not yet enough research available.\n (Reporting by Praveen Menon; Additional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne; Editing by Richard Pullin and Sam Holmes)\n A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus\nIs it safe to see people who have gotten the coronavirus vaccine?\nWhat it means if your partner tests positive for COVID-19 but you don\u2019t.\nHow worried should you be about the new strains of coronavirus?\nThe unexpected challenges of co-parenting during a pandemic.\u00a0\n19 things we took for granted pre-pandemic but now miss.\u00a0\nFind all that and more on our coronavirus hub page.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs COVID-19 cases rise, it\u2019s more important than ever to remain connected and informed.

        "title": "Opinion: Why is it so hard to deprogram Trumpian conspiracy theorists?",
        "body_text": "For the past four years, the United States was governed by a conspiracy theorist in chief. Whether by retweeting QAnon accounts from the Oval Office or painting himself as the victim of shadowy \u201cdeep state\u201d plots at rallies, President Donald Trump injected the toxin of baseless conspiratorial thinking straight into America\u2019s political bloodstream. On Jan. 6, America saw how far that venom had spread, as a ragtag group of militias, racist extremists and flag-waving disciples of Trumpism stormed the Capitol.\n The insurrectionists were unified by their support for Trump. But many of them shared another crucial trait: They were conspiracy theorists. And while hundreds of people stormed the Capitol, there are millions of Americans who share their views. There is no doubt: The United States has a serious problem with pathological political delusions.\n So, do we have any hope of deprogramming the millions of Americans who are devoted to dangerous lunacy? Don\u2019t hold your breath.\n Psychologists and political scientists have been interested in conspiracy theories for decades, but their research has taken on new urgency. And what is clear from their findings is this: Once people have gone far enough down the rabbit hole of conspiratorial thinking, it can be nearly impossible to get them back out.\n There are a few reasons conspiracy theories are so \u201csticky\u201d once they\u2019re in someone\u2019s head. First, conspiracy theorists are far more likely to have a Manichaean worldview, meaning they interpret everything as a battle between good and evil. That makes it harder for dispassionate evidence-based arguments to break through. (For QAnon believers, Trump is the central superhero in an epic saga to vanquish a shadowy cabal.)\n Second, those who seek to debunk conspiracy theories are precisely the people that true believers distrust. If someone believes the media is controlled by sinister but unseen puppet masters, fact checks from CNN will never convince them they\u2019re wrong.\n For the past four years, those who have worked hardest to dispel QAnon believers of their fantasies are the very people that \u201cAnons\u201d trust least: anti-Trump academics like me, news outlets such as The Post and politicians who they believe to be co-opted by the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler have documented the risks of a backfire effect, in which correcting misperceptions actually ends up entrenching them. In the world of conspiratorial thinking, the harder the pushback, the greater the proof that a coverup is afoot.\n Third, these organized mass delusions are designed to resist debunking. When Armageddon fails to materialize on a precise date predicted by a cult leader, believers often chalk it up to miscalculation and simply pick a new date. The same is often true for conspiracy theories. When Trump failed to fulfill the QAnon prophecy of arresting Joe Biden and staying in power, some believers began suggesting that Biden was secretly in on the plan. No matter what happens, there\u2019s always another explanation.\n Chris French, a professor who heads the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London, recently told me that conspiracy theorists often even believe mutually contradictory claims. For example, those who believe that Princess Diana faked her own death often simultaneously believe that she was killed by the government. \u201cThey can\u2019t both be true,\u201d French said.\n But while political science and psychology have effectively demonstrated the cognitive biases that cause such deranged beliefs to stick, there\u2019s a crucial dimension that isn\u2019t getting enough attention. Conspiracy theories, for too many people, are fun. That\u2019s particularly true because groups such as QAnon have developed into robust online communities in which believers forge digital friendships. Our mental image of tinfoil-hat-wearing loners isolated in dark basements is outdated. Modern conspiracy movements such as QAnon, are thriving in church groups and yoga classes. They\u2019re social. And that means that deprogramming is that much harder.\n In 1995, Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam wrote an essay called \u201cBowling Alone,\u201d in which he argued that Americans were becoming atomized. Bowling leagues were disappearing even as more people were bowling. And that reflected a deeper fracturing of American society.\n Today, with the rise of social media, one can be alone but feel part of a group \u2014 and some of those groups are glued together by unhinged beliefs. Bowling alone has been replaced by tweeting together \u2014 a cardboard cutout for real social interaction, but one that has a seductive allure to millions of people. Many of the fanatics who stormed the Capitol were neither poor nor social misfits, but rather had found a digital community to augment or replace their offline one.\n We can no longer pretend that conspiracy theorists are beneath our attention. They\u2019ve shown they have tremendous capacity to inflict damage on society. Bringing the deluded people who populate Trump\u2019s political base back to reality will be difficult. But to find the right antidote, we need to at least accurately diagnose who has taken the poison. And that means acknowledging that those who sympathize with the Capitol insurrectionists are not far-off lunatics. Some, most likely, are your neighbors.\n And, given the staying power of conspiratorial thinking, they aren\u2019t likely to change their minds anytime soon.\n Read more:\n Dana Milbank: Trump is gone, but Marjorie Taylor Greene is keeping up the cult\n Paul Waldman: QAnon is mortally wounded. But the right\u2019s conspiracy theories will never die.\n Max Boot: Republicans are becoming the QAnon Party\n The Post\u2019s View: QAnon is a menace. Ignoring it isn\u2019t an option.",

        "title": "Men\u2019s Wear Has an Emo Moment",
        "body_text": "Anybody in recovery could tell you that, for dealing with negative emotions, food or alcohol or drug addiction, there is a familiar and handy acronym known as HALT. The letters stand for a cluster of triggering feelings manageable if you can just tick through and address an inventory of basic human needs.\n One year into the pandemic, the whole strung-out world could probably use some form of H.A.L.T., not least designers charged with producing a vision of a future whose shape is impossible to discern. Thus, it was fascinating to learn from a variety of them how they\u2019d coped with the long months of isolation \u2014 of being, in one form or another, Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired.\n Rick Owens spent what he called this \u201cvery, very dark\u201d time at home in Paris contemplating masculine aggression, principally his own. Paul Smith passed 18 weeks alone in a souvenir-cluttered office at his London headquarters, where normally scores of people are employed, musing on the mods, the rockers, the hippies, the shifting fads and tumultuous events he has witnessed through five decades in fashion. V\u00e9ronique Nichanian, the designer of Herm\u00e8s men\u2019s wear, found herself using the therapeutic powers of color to steady her through the jagged rhythms of serial lockdowns.\n Effectively grounded after years of ceaseless global travel, Virgil Abloh, the Louis Vuitton men\u2019s wear designer, turned his consciousness inward to compose a kind of anchoring autobiographical mixtape spliced together from the varied pieces of a multi-hyphenated identity.\n Jonathan Anderson, shuttling on the Eurostar between London and Paris to produce two separate collections \u2014 one for his own label, JW Anderson, and another for Loewe \u2014 managed the stress of constant Covid-19 testing and risky travel by musing on root vegetables, handicrafts and George Ohr, the visionary American ceramist known as the \u201cMad Potter of Biloxi.\u201d\n And they all cranked. What emerged from a week of collections experienced largely through video (although, as he did last season, Mr. Anderson trumped all things digital by producing fantastically conceptualized analog books) was a powerful sense of hive mind, of creative people as unalike as can be imagined unified by a belief in the power of making.\n Sure, there were the usual narrative conceits, the designer references and citations that can often seem plucked from some cultural go-bag (most absurdly, perhaps, at Louis Vuitton, where the theme of Mr. Abloh\u2019s sixth collection was \u201cTourist vs. Purist\u201d and the title of the show was \u201cEbonics\u2019\u2019). What stood out, though, was not the predictable mood-board cockamamie but emblematic images.\n At Mr. Abloh\u2019s Vuitton show, for instance, there was the indelible vision of a model kitted out like some intergalactic cowpoke in a brightly patterned and quilted skirt suit adorned with a large cloth rose. On his head was a 10-gallon hat so wide brimmed it would make the average Stetson look like a beanie. Feet shod in embroidered steel-toed boots, he had beside him a quilted silver logo suitcase that made you want immediately to book a ticket to anywhere just for the thrill of wheeling it through an airport.\n At the JW Anderson collection, delivered as a series of posters photographed by Juergen Teller, Mr. Anderson\u2019s continuing explorations of shape, proportion, texture and the crafts coalesced in the image of a pale starveling dressed in trousers whose widely flanged legs lent him a resemblance to a Watteau jester as reimagined by Braque.\n Covering the model\u2019s top half was a shaggy vest of brightly dyed shearling; encasing his feet was a pair of blunt-toed loafers adorned with the Brobdingnagian buckles Mr. Anderson refers to as shoe jewelry.\n \u201cI like the idea of humor in clothing,\u201d Mr. Anderson said on a Zoom call, referring to the halved peaches he had printed on T-shirts and the bulbous cloth radishes he appended to sweaters and hoodies. Of the crocheted vegetables deployed throughout the collection, he said: \u201cI spent a lot of the last year thinking about people making and doing.\u201d\n Though the intense, almost meditative repose that arises out of the repetition of familiar gestures is not lost on those who have knitted or sewed or baked their way through the pandemic, it is not something one automatically associates with a designer as ostensibly hard-edge as Rick Owens.\n Yet, at various points during Mr. Owens\u2019s show \u2014 filmed outside a Fascist-era war memorial on the Lido near Venice, where he spends his summers \u2014 the masked designer can be seen arranging and rearranging the models\u2019 clothes before they exit with an intensity of focus that draws the eye away from everything else going on. There is not much about the designer\u2019s gestures to suggest anything resembling masculine aggression. If anything, they seem maternal.\n In all likelihood it is the softness beneath the kinky, zippered bodysuits of leather; the quilted and hooded cashmere carapaces; the slashed overcoats and cow-skin platform boots made with the hairy side facing out that gives Mr. Owens\u2019s ideas their tensile strength.\n He may create clothes capable of spooking you with their Sweeney Todd aura or look of flensed anatomies. But there is usually just enough revealed flesh to remind you of how nature goofed when evolving the human body as soft and furless and more vulnerable than we like to believe.\n Indomitable sunniness serves as a form of armor for V\u00e9ronique Nichanian and Paul Smith, two designers seasoned by years of survival in a business that makes short work of anyone lacking a tough hide. Optimism is what each designer spoke about over the phone before their collections were shown last week, utilized as a strategy.\n \u201cI wanted to look past the moment\u201d and to anticipate the spirit of what comes next, Ms. Nichanian of Herm\u00e8s said, invoking such a time with bright colors that to her symbolize hope.\n Reunited for a second time with the theater director Cyril Teste, Ms. Nichanian staged a version of a live show in some antechambers and around an interior staircase at the Mobilier National, a storehouse of state-owned furniture on the outskirts of Paris.\n Though a sectioned split-screen format provided multiple angles from which to view the clothes, it was hardly necessary. It is always clear in advance that whatever Ms. Nichanian produces will have a restraint it takes an assured hand to deliver and that, even when the stuff is as staid or workmanlike as the saddle-stitched parkas, piped blousons and elevated work wear she showed this time around, that is probably not a bad thing at a house where the watchword is continuity, not experimentation.\n Paul Smith, too, fell back on experiences accumulated over a half-century in the business to deliver a collection that shrewdly amalgamated elements from his own back pages, including suits that might have been designed for the Kray twins, mohair knits, high-waist mod trousers, plaid chore coats and dusterswell adapted for the post-office world. He explained his process with a common-sensical perspective that echoed the wisdom of H.A.L.T.\n \u201cI was here in my office alone,\u201d the designer said by telephone from London. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not going to museums or traveling, but I do have all these things around me in this room full of bicycles and books and stuff I\u2019ve accumulated over the years.\u2019\u201d Sooner or later we will be released again into the wider world, he concluded.\n After doing an emotional check-in, he decided there were worse ways to cope than by rummaging around in memory\u2019s familiar landscapes until then.",

        "body_text": "CBS has placed two top TV executives on leave after a report detailing accusations that they had created a hostile work environment, including making disparaging remarks about female and Black employees.\n The executives, Peter Dunn, the president of CBS television stations, and David Friend, the senior vice president of news for TV stations, were placed on administrative leave pending the results of a third-party investigation, the company said in a statement on Monday.\n \u201cCBS is committed to a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace where all voices are heard, claims are investigated and appropriate action is taken where necessary,\u201d according to the statement. CBS declined further comment.\n The suspensions came after The Los Angeles Times published a report on Sunday in which employees accused the executives of \u201cbullying female managers and blocking efforts to hire and retain Black journalists.\u201d\n The newspaper reported that Mr. Dunn frequently denigrated a Black news anchor at KYW, the CBS station in Philadelphia, calling him \u201cjust a jive guy\u201d and that at least four current and former female CBS executives said they had been bullied by Mr. Dunn between 2017 and 2019.\n Mr. Dunn declined to comment to The Los Angeles Times about the allegations made against him.\n The newspaper\u2019s report also said several Black journalists had either left their positions at the Philadelphia station or were blocked by Mr. Dunn or Mr. Friend from being hired.\n In a statement to The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Friend said that he and CBS stations had a strong track record of hiring and supporting women and journalists of color. \u201cThese comments I may have made about our employees or prospective hires were only based on performance or qualifications \u2014 not about anyone\u2019s race or gender,\u201d Mr. Friend said.\n In recent years, CBS has faced numerous scandals over the treatment of its employees, including at the highest levels of the company. Its longtime chief executive, Les Moonves, was forced out in 2018 after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct.\n On Sunday, officials from the National Association of Black Journalists met with CBS officials and called for both Mr. Dunn and Mr. Friend to be fired.\n The association said that the issues detailed in The Times\u2019s investigation were not confined to one station, and that it had heard from several CBS employees across the country.",

        "title": "Kobe Bryant wasn't just an NBA star. He was an ambassador for all sports, right up to his death",
        "body_text": "(CNN) NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who died last year at age 41, will likely be best known for his gifts with the roundball. He was one of the best to take the court and one of basketball's greatest ambassadors, heralding the men's and women's game at its youth, college, pro and international levels.\n Yet the Los Angeles Lakers luminary was multifaceted -- serving as a writer, producer, spokesman, philanthropist, mentor and #girldad. The Black Mamba appreciated greatness in all its forms -- and saw sport as transformative.\n He believed, like Nelson Mandela whom he quoted in an Instagram post in 2014, that \"sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers.\"\n This belief permeated the mission at Mamba Sports Academy, to which Bryant, daughter Gianna and seven others were en route when their helicopter crashed a year ago in the Santa Monica Mountains in Calabasas, California.\n Here's a look at the times he directed his considerable light on the world's other sporting pastimes.\n Sharia Washington, one of Bryant's two sisters, played volleyball for Temple, with a sportswriter declaring in 1997 that she was \"every bit the athlete Kobe is\" (and she was able to dunk before her little brother!). Bryant's oldest child, Natalia, followed in her aunt's footsteps so, of course, he loved the game.\n An enormous fan of the international game, Bryant spent time as a child in Italy, where he learned to play soccer and love AC Milan, one of the country's most storied teams.\n Game recognize game, as they say, so it should surprise no one that his social media is littered with references to the sport's best players and teams, including the US Women's National Team, the men's Brazilian, German and Italian teams and stars Lionel Messi, Megan Rapinoe, Mia Hamm and Ronaldinho. He even once gave a shout-out to Clint Dempsey after the American slotted one off the post to open scoring against Ghana in the 2014 World Cup.\n Bryant joined Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Olympics (the city was selected for the 2028 Games instead) and appeared with fellow gold medalist Michael Phelps at the Golden Goggles to give yet a third gold medalist, Katie Ledecky, the 2017 female swimmer of the year award. He's also been a stalwart for parasports.\n \"The lesson I cherish the most is how important it is to love what you do,\" Bryant, freshly retired from the NBA, told Special Olympians in a 2016 video message. \"If you love what you do and it's making you happy, all the hard work and perseverance will pay off. When you know you're truly giving it your all, there's no greater feeling in the world.\"\n Bryant returned to the United States when he was 13. After middle school, he played ball at Lower Merion High School, outside of Philadelphia, before heading straight to the pros. The City of Brotherly Love was anything but when Bryant returned in the Lakers' purple and gold. Philadelphians regularly booed their hometown prodigy, but Bryant always remained true to his Eagles.\n He also spoke with reverence for stars like Tom Brady, Richard Sherman and Ray Lewis, who, like Bryant, fought to restore his image following criminal allegations away from the field of play. During a 2012 national championship matchup, Bryant showed his love for the college game, applauding Alabama's AJ McCarron and Barrett Jones after a midgame scuffle.\n Bryant showed more GOAT-on-GOAT love with snaps alongside Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams, who he described as \"top of the line for me\" when it came to tennis players.\n Bryant often had the next generation on his mind, and Williams served as a muse for one of his literary creations, \"Legacy and the Queen,\" about a 12-year-old tennis player who must win a tournament to keep an orphanage open.\n \"I want kids to learn by reading our novels, and in our latest book, our main character has to learn to use her passion for tennis to rise above those around her and shine,\" the father of four said of the book.\n OK, OK, Bryant didn't talk about auto racing so much. This header is more an excuse to include his \"Mamba on the track!\" post, featuring the Lakers shooting guard, during a trip to the town of Maranello, Italy, flying by in a canary-yellow Ferrari.\n Bryant enjoyed combat sports, and he regularly lauded mixed martial arts stars, including Ronda Rousey and Junior dos Santos, as well as boxing's Muhammad Ali and Floyd Mayweather.\n One fighter, however, stood above the rest: the inimitable Bruce Lee. Not only did Mamba tell a Chinese newspaper in 2017 that the famed martial artist's Jeet Kune Do philosophy helped him learn the importance of being able to adapt and react, but Nike has released multiple Bruce Lee editions of Bryant's line of sneakers.\n \"Bruce Lee was always one of my muses growing up,\" Bryant told the newspaper. \"I've read everything he's ever written; I've watched every film he's ever been in, and I've watched pretty much every interview he's ever done.\"\n He grew up a Yankees fan, but Bryant said he always had love for the Dodgers. He once joined then-Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp, President Bill Clinton and Olympic gold medalist sprinter Allyson Felix for a roundtable about the importance of children playing sports.\n A regular at Los Angeles Kings games, Bryant applauded the team after it twice in three seasons hung championship banners from the Staples Center rafters, where Bryant's teams hung five.\n Many National Hockey League players lamented his death, including superstar Alex Ovechkin. New Jersey Devils defenseman P.K. Subban, one of a few dozen Black players in the NHL, revealed after Bryant's death that the baller had served as a mentor.\n Hardly a shocker that when Bryant brought up snowboarding, he focused on the sport's greatest, Shaun White.\n Bryant and Lakers teammate Pau Gasol once owned an interest in a horse, Siempre Mio -- Spanish for \"Always Mine.\" While that is a little-known factoid, better known is that Bryant took inspiration from the best, including the best of the best: Secretariat.\n \"I was like a wild horse that had the potential to become Secretariat, but who was just too f**king wild. So part of that was (Lakers coach Phil Jackson) trying to tame me,\" he once said.\n During \"Dancing With the Stars,\" Bryant backed actor and singer Zendaya, using the hashtags #differentanimalsamebeast and #beastmode, which he typically reserved for athletes he admired.\n More importantly, this provides an opportunity to tidily end the story with a clip of a 12-year-old Kobe Bean popping and locking to a Vanilla Ice classic circa 1990.",

        "title": "I witnessed the rise of Nazism firsthand. We must act now to protect American democracy",
        "body_text": "Dr. Irene Butter is a Holocaust survivor. She came to the United States in 1945. Since the late 1980s, Dr. Butter has been teaching students about the Holocaust. Her memoir, \"Shores Beyond Shores,\" details that journey. She is a co-founder of the Raoul Wallenberg Medal and Lecture series at the University of Michigan, and one of the founders of Zeitouna, an Arab-Jewish women's dialogue group in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n (CNN) I am a survivor of the Holocaust and a proud American. I first landed on the shores of this country in Baltimore Harbor on December 25, 1945, under a brittle blue, clear sky. My lifeboat was lowered from a Liberty ship into the watery space between ice floes and I stepped onto the land that welcomed me.\n I was a 15-year-old refugee with a sixth-grade education, broken English, no money and a small knapsack of belongings. America allowed me to receive an education, build a career, a family, and a new life -- away from the Nazis.\n Just as America was there for me and people like me, we must now be there for America. Ours is the land of opportunity. We must now rebuild and protect it against the current fascism that threatens it.\n I was born in Berlin in 1930, a Jewish girl who grew up in Nazi-occupied Europe. My childhood was quite idyllic: I had loving, funny parents and grandparents, and a beautiful, music-filled home. I was three years old when the Nazis came to power and began targeting the Jews, step by step.\n Early on, Jews were forbidden from owning or working in banks under Nazi race laws, and my father lost his job. He left for Holland in search of one, as well as to escape Hitler. My family -- me, my mom and older brother -- were able to follow not long after. We settled in Amsterdam.\n In 1940, the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands and the persecution of Jews escalated. We were eventually deported in cattle cars to Camp Westerbork in eastern Holland, and ultimately to the infamous Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp in Germany.\n Having barely survived hunger, forced labor, beatings, disease and cold at Bergen-Belsen, my family was included in a prisoner exchange. We were among the limited number of Jews to be traded for German civilians and boarded a train bound for Switzerland.\n On January 23, 1945, my father died on the train from malnutrition and a brutal beating by the Nazis. He had gotten his family to freedom. My mother and brother were so ill that they were hospitalized immediately upon arrival in Switzerland. However, the Swiss would not let me stay with my family. So, at age 14, I was separated from them for the first time in my life and sent to a refugee camp in Algeria, North Africa.\n A year later, I landed in America, and eventually was reunited with my brother and mother. Up until that moment on Baltimore's shores, my journey had been by command and not by choice. My parents hadn't chosen to move to Amsterdam -- they were forced to. We didn't choose to be sent to the concentration camps -- we were forced to. I didn't choose to live in Algeria alone as a refugee -- I was forced to.\n But finally, in America, I had choices and could exercise my free will. There were no restrictions. No yellow stars on clothing. No men with guns stopping people to see papers. Only opportunity.\n Now, 75 years later, I see something I never imagined: echoes of the Nazis and their regime. What happened in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, was an attempted coup of our government and an unraveling of the democracy that protects all of our rights. I saw a T-shirt with the words \"Camp Auschwitz,\" as well as other anti-Semitic symbols and slogans used by the rioters.\n Decades earlier, I heard an interview on the radio with Auschwitz survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who said, \"If you were in the camps, if you smelled the air and heard the silence of the dead, then it's your duty to be a witness and tell the stories.\" It took me 40 years to start talking, and I am not finished yet.\n The disinformation, distortion and denial of human rights and democracy that resulted in the Holocaust must not happen again. We must speak truth to fascism. The United Nations and UNESCO were founded in 1945, the same year as my liberation, in the wake of the Holocaust. Today, the UN and UNESCO educate the contemporary world about this history and how to recognize threats to democracy when they occur. Their work helps to establish an accurate historical record and encourages witnesses and others to speak out and teach truth.\n The massive, violent assault on our Capitol is an awakening for us that our American democracy is vulnerable and needs protection. Democratic institutions need to be strengthened and government officials held responsible and accountable.\n Four years ago, we could not have guessed that rioters with Nazi symbols would break into the Capitol to subvert a fairly elected president. None of us can afford to be a bystander to history. We all must confront racism and hatred when we see it. We must establish a record, encourage witnesses and others to speak out, and teach truth. Each of us can and must make a difference.\n To me, education is the quintessential endeavor to combat the threat of fascism. The crisis in our country today brings opportunities for positive change. Each of us has the opportunity to make a choice:\n to be a survivor defined by the life we make for ourselves, and not a victim defined only by the harm done to us;to refuse to be enemies, seeking our common humanity;to never be a bystander to injustice, standing up for others even if we do not know them;to fill the world with love and hope, not hate and division.\n As I share my history through my book, and in schools across the country, I am overcome with gratitude and amazement at students' wisdom and curiosity. Young people are hungry to learn how to stand up against hatred, bullying, oppression and discrimination. They are wise, strong and ready.\n Let's stand with these students and continue to educate and involve them -- and allow them to educate us. They will one day be the leaders of this democracy. Let's build a better America and a better world, together.",

        "body_text": "Announcement from Managing Editors Cameron Barr, Tracy Grant, Kat Downs Mulder, and Krissah Thompson:\n The Washington Post is thrilled to announce its 2021 Summer Intern Class. This will be the 58th summer that The Post has welcomed college juniors, seniors and graduate students into the newsroom to work alongside some of the world\u2019s best journalists. Over the years, many of those interns have stayed at The Post and gone on to become Pulitzer Prize winners \u2013 and in the case of 1964 intern Leonard Downie, to become executive editor.\n The interns will work as reporters, photographers, videographers, graphic reporters, designers, editorial writers, multiplatform editors, social media editors and audio producers. They represent 22 colleges and universities from as far away as California and as nearby as Maryland.\n Two interns have been named Bradlee Fellows, in recognition of the courage and integrity that legendary Washington Post Executive Editor Benjamin C. Bradlee instilled in his newsroom. Founded in 2018, the Bradlee Fellows program is funded by a gift from Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward and his wife, journalist Elsa Walsh.\n For the first time this year, The Post has teamed with Military Veterans in Journalism to create a fellowship for a veteran who is pursuing a career in journalism. The fellow will receive the same introduction to the newsroom as the interns.\n It is our hope that The Washington Post summer interns will be able to work with their colleagues in the newsroom this summer. But we are prepared to be flexible and hope to offer a more robust internship experience in 2021 than our pandemic-limited program of 2020. Here are The Washington Post 2021 summer interns:\n \u00b7 Annabel Aguiara, a senior at Indiana University, will be a reporting intern in Features.\n \u00b7 Caroline Anders, a senior at Indiana University, will be a reporting intern on the General Assignment news desk.\n \u00b7 Nicole Asbury, a senior at the University of Kansas, is a Bradlee Fellow and will be a reporting intern in Metro.\n \u00b7 Michael Blackshire, a graduate student at Western Kentucky University, will intern in Photo.\n \u00b7 Ella Brockway, a senior at Northwestern University, will be a Multiplatform editing intern in Sports.\n \u00b7 Adrienne Dunn, a senior at Arizona State University, will be a Multiplatform intern.\n \u00b7 Karina Elwood, a senior at the University of Florida, will be a reporting intern in Metro.\n \u00b7 Jessica Eng, a senior at Harvard College, will intern in Design and Graphics.\n \u00b7 Andrew Golden, a senior at Northwestern University, will be a reporting intern in Sports.\n \u00b7 Hadley Green, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina, will intern in Video.\n \u00b7 Emely Hernandez, a senior at the University of Central Florida, will be a reporting intern in Sports.\n \u00b7 Jasmine Hilton, a senior at Ohio State University, will be a reporting intern in Metro.\n \u00b7 Yasmeen Khalifa, a senior at the University of Texas, will intern in Audience.\n \u00b7 Stephanie Lai, a junior at Columbia University, will be a reporting intern in Metro.\n \u00b7 Zachary Levitt, a senior at Middlebury College, will intern in Graphics.\n \u00b7 Ramishah Maruf, a senior at the University of North Carolina, will intern in Opinions.\n \u00b7 Lauren Mitchell, a senior at North Carolina A&T University, will intern in Emerging News Products.\n \u00b7 Natachi Onwuamaegbu, a senior at Stanford University, will be a reporting intern in Features.\n \u00b7 Maria Paul, a senior at the University of Notre Dame, will be a reporting intern on the General Assignment desk.\n \u00b7 Daniel Rosenzweig-Ziff, a senior at Northwestern University, will be a reporting intern in Metro.\n \u00b7 Tristen Rouse, a graduate student at the University of Missouri, will be an editing intern in Photo.\n \u00b7 Brandon Standley, a senior at the University of North Carolina, will be a Multiplatform intern.\n \u00b7 David Suggs, a senior at the University of Maryland, will be a reporting intern in National.\n \u00b7 Kori Suzuki, a senior at Macalester College, will intern in Audio.\n \u00b7 Talia Trackim, a senior at Syracuse University, will intern in Design.\n \u00b7 Christopher Vazquez, a senior at Northwestern University, will intern in Video.\n \u00b7 Natalie Walters, a senior at Arizona State University, will be a reporting intern in Business.\n \u00b7 Allison Weis, a senior at Syracuse University, will be a Multiplatform intern in Opinions.\n \u00b7 Samantha Westfall, a senior at Yale University, is a Bradlee Fellow and will be a reporting intern in Foreign.\n \u00b7 Max Hauptman, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, will be The Post\u2019s first Military Veterans in Journalism fellow.

        "title": "WHO team in Wuhan to begin long-delayed coronavirus investigation after clearing quarantine",
        "body_text": "Hong Kong (CNN) A team of World Health Organization (WHO) investigators is preparing to leave quarantine in the Chinese city of Wuhan and begin a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Members of the 13-person international team will finish their two-week quarantine in the next 24 hours, stepping out into a city that was once the center of the global outbreak but is now, a year on, largely returned to normal. Scrutiny of the team's work will be immense, as they navigate what is likely to be a political minefield in uncovering how the virus that brought much of the world to a halt first emerged.\n \"The eyes of the world are focused on this, the opinions of the world are focused on this,\" Dutch virologist and team member Marion Koopmans told CNN Wednesday morning, as she prepared for a final round of meetings before leaving her quarantine hotel.\n \"We are aware of it, there is no way around that. That's why we really try to keep focused, we are scientists, we are not politicians, we are trying to really look at this from the scientific perspective.\"\n Part of that involves abandoning all preconceived notions about how the virus evolved and spread, to look at what the evidence says, and go from there, Koopmans said. The team has spent the past two weeks in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists, \"discussing what we know, what we don't know.\"\n Demand for answers will be great, especially after the investigation itself was delayed several times, but Koopmans cautioned patience.\n \"I think we really have to manage expectations, if you look at some of the earlier quests for the origins of outbreaks, they have taken years to complete,\" she said. \"The early and relatively easy studies have been done, have already been published.\"\n An earlier report by a WHO team in China, published in February 2020, found that \"key knowledge gaps remain\" about the virus, though it endorsed previous findings that the virus appeared to have originated in animals, with the likely first outbreak at a seafood market in Wuhan.\n While the WHO team will be attempting to ignore the political element to their work, doing so may be difficult.\n Last week, the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said that both WHO and China could have acted faster and more forcefully to contain the start of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n Several countries, most vocally the United States and Australia, have accused Beijing of downplaying the outbreak's severity during its early stages, and preventing an effective response until it was too late. In particular, officials in Wuhan have been accused of silencing whistleblowers and concealing evidence of the virus transmitting between humans, in a replay of the 2003 SARS epidemic.\n WHO itself also came under immense pressure, with then-US President Donald Trump saying last year that it was a \"puppet\" of China, and pulling Washington's funding for the organization. Soon after his inauguration, President Joe Biden reversed that order.\n As China has got the pandemic under control domestically, in stark contrast to the ongoing chaos in the US and much of Europe, Beijing has begun to push back forcefully on any accusations of blame, advancing alternate -- and unfounded -- theories about the origin of the pandemic, including conspiracies about a US military germ lab.\n In Geneva last week, the head of the US delegation to WHO called on China to allow the team in Wuhan access to \"care givers, former patients and lab workers,\" and to share all scientific studies into animal, human and environmental samples taken from a market in Wuhan, Reuters reported.\n \"We have a solemn duty to ensure that this critical investigation is credible and is conducted objectively and transparently,\" US representative Garrett Grigsby said, sparking a rebuke from China's delegation, which accused him of \"political pressure.\"\n A year on from when Wuhan entered lockdown, after the city has been repeatedly scrubbed and sanitized to wipe out any trace of the virus, there is skepticism over just how much the team of investigators will be able to uncover.\n \"It's very challenging for anybody to find out the cause of this,\" said Jin Dongyan, a virology professor at the University of Hong Kong. \"It would be very difficult now to obtain any first line evidence to investigate the origin of the SARS-COV-2 and the index cases of Covid-19. It's really challenging. And I doubt these international experts can find anything. I'm not very optimistic.\"\n To what extent the Chinese authorities are willing to cooperate is unclear, particularly as even senior health officials have begun to question whether the virus originated in Wuhan, advancing the \"multiple origins\" theory that was first put out by the country's propaganda organs in an apparent attempt to deflect blame over the initial handling of the pandemic.\n Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that whether the WHO teams' trip would be successful \"depends a lot on how much the government is willing to be cooperative and accommodating in terms of sharing the research, allow them to have access to places of interest, talking to people they want to speak with.\"\n \"The main problem is that this issue itself has been so politicized, makes it really difficult to conduct independent, transparent, thorough investigation,\" Huang said, adding that \"the international society should also maybe lower their expectations, have a more realistic understanding of what this trip entails, especially given that they plan to wrap up the study in a few months, really we should not expect something magical.\"",

She would be the first Black person to appear on a U.S. note.\n \u201cIt\u2019s important that our notes ... reflect the history and diversity of our country, and Harriet Tubman\u2019s image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that,\u201d Psaki said.\u00a0\u201cSo we\u2019re exploring ways to speed up that effort.\u201d\n Trump\u2019s administration had stalled those plans and said in 2019 that it would not be able to unveil a design featuring Tubman by 2020. A spokesperson for Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, said at the time that they were still on track to release the redesigned $20 bill by 2030, but she would not confirm that it would still feature Tubman.\n Democratic lawmakers slammed Trump and Mnuchin for not being transparent about the redesign.\u00a0Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) accused Mnuchin of allowing \u201cTrump\u2019s racism and misogyny to prevent him from carrying out the will of the people.\u201d\n Many suspected Trump did not want to see President Andrew Jackson removed from the bill, as he\u2019s often cited the 1829-1837 president as a hero and inspiration to him. Trump had a portrait of Jackson, a slave owner, prominently featured in the Oval Office throughout his single term.\n Biden\u2019s treasury secretary nominee, Janet Yellen, who would oversee plans for the Tubman note, advanced in the Senate last week and requires just one more vote to be confirmed. She is slated to be the first woman to hold the job.\n CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly said Tubman would be the first woman to appear on a U.S. note.",

Yet the Sacramento area has just 11.9 percent intensive care unit capacity, and was allowed to exit the strict order more than a week ago.\n Although The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday that officials in the region were feeling hopeful that the order would be lifted soon, the state\u2019s department of public health reported on Sunday that the Bay Area wasn\u2019t eligible to have restrictions loosened based on its projections.\n [See how full hospital intensive care units are near you.]\n Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to make an announcement about lifting some restrictions in the state on Monday.\n The Associated Press reported that Mr. Newsom\u2019s administration has refused to disclose key data that would help explain the difference in approaches between the Bay Area and Sacramento.\n In any case, the state hinted in a news release on Sunday that Sacramento may be required to re-enter the stay-at-home order, which would force many businesses to shut back down. (We can expect to get an update from state officials in coming days.)\n And even after President Biden unveiled what experts have long said is a desperately needed national strategy for finally controlling the pandemic, there are still major hurdles in the vaccine rollout, which in California has contributed to continuing chaos, in which vaccine eligibility rules have been implemented differently county by county.\n As CalMatters reported, the state quietly rolled out a promised clearinghouse website to help people find vaccination appointments. But it\u2019s still a work in progress.\n [Track the vaccine rollout in California and other states.]\n Read more:\n If you missed it, Mr. Becerra was tapped to join the Biden administration to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. [The New York Times]\n If you missed it, I talked with Mr. Brown last year about why we should all be paying more attention to the Doomsday Clock. [The New York Times]\n And if you missed it, here\u2019s why climate change means California will be increasingly whipsawed between weather extremes.

        "title": "Primaries for North Carolina's 2022 US Senate seat are already heating up as another Democrat gets in",
        "body_text": "Washington (CNN) North Carolina state Sen. Jeff Jackson announced his 2022 bid for Senate on Tuesday, setting up a divisive Democratic primary for the open seat that will be pivotal to the party's future control of the Senate.\n Jackson launched his \"100-county campaign\" in a video with his wife Marisa and his young sons, who are seen packing their bags in preparation for the months-long contest.\n He talked about a \"North Carolina agenda\" that addresses the pandemic, the unemployed, the opioid crisis, a lack of rural broadband and housing, health care and criminal justice racial disparities. Jackson also nodded to the state's 2020 election, in which Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and military veteran, lost his race against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis by less than two points after his sex scandal.\n \"We cannot go through another election like the one we just had,\" Marisa said.\n \"That was miserable,\" added Jackson, as one of his kids piles toys into a suitcase. \"You deserve better.\"\n Jackson is a 38-year-old former prosecutor, and a captain in the Army National Guard who served in Afghanistan. Republicans and a Democratic opponent, former state senator Erica Smith, have already tried to label him an echo of Cunningham.\n Smith, a Black woman who lost to Cunningham in the last Senate Democratic primary, tweeted on Tuesday, \"We cannot continue to go back to the SAME playbook & expect different results.\"\n \"It is time for a new kind of politics & a new kind of leadership. Together, we can bring about the change we need,\" she said, adding the hashtags \"WinWithBlackWomen\" and \"EmbraceTheBase.\"\n In 2019, Jackson flew to meet with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and pitched a grassroots campaign for Senate, including \"100 town halls in 100 days,\" according to a recording of a talk Jackson gave at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte obtained by National Review. Jackson said he was told he would instead have to spend months in a \"windowless basement raising money\" to buy attack ads against Tillis.\n Jackson's announcement video showed he still plans on an in-person campaign strategy. But GOP Senate candidate Mark Walker, a former congressman, referred to that article on Tuesday, sarcastically congratulating Jackson for \"deciding the 'windowless basement' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted him in for 2020 is now appealing for 2022.\"\n Many candidates are expected to run for the seat left open by Republican Sen. Richard Burr's coming retirement. Among others, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native and the President's daughter-in-law, is reportedly considering a Senate campaign.",

        "body_text": "An entire season of the\u00a0Food Network\u2019s \u201cWorst Cooks in America\u201d has been scrubbed from streaming services after its winner was charged with allegedly killing a toddler.\n The competition series\u2019 Season 20, which debuted in June last year, is no longer available on streaming platforms including Discovery+ (Discovery Inc.\u2019s new service), Hulu, YouTube and the Food Network\u2019s website, Deadline\u00a0reported.\n The Food Network did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n Last Tuesday, Season 20 winner Ariel Robinson, 29, and her husband, Jerry Robinson, 34, were arrested and charged with homicide by child abuse, according to press releases from the Simpsonville, South Carolina,\u00a0police department.\n According to their arrest warrants, sent by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the Robinsons are accused of inflicting a \u201cseries of blunt force injuries\u201d on a 3-year-old in their care, identified as Victoria Rose Smith. Police found Victoria unresponsive at her home, and she later died at the hospital.\n Victoria, who spent most of her life in foster care, had been adopted by the Robinson family, local NBC affiliate WYFF News 4 reported.\n \u201cWhen she entered a room, all eyes were on her, because she demanded it and she was a cutie,\u201d said Tiffany Huggins, who was a foster parent to Victoria for 10 months, until right before the Robinsons adopted her.\n \u201cShe was just a natural,\u201d Huggins told WYFF. \u201cShe had the best personality and I\u2019m not just saying that \u2019cause I was her momma, but she was just our light. She was a beautiful child, inside and out.\u201d\n Ariel Robinson, a former middle school teacher and local comedian, told WYFF in August that the $25,000 grand prize she won on the Food Network would help her family, which had recently adopted three children \u2014 including Victoria.\n \u201cI just know that the Lord had his hands on me and he had a purpose for me to go on there,\u201d she told the news station. \u201cHe knew we were going through this adoption, we really could use the money, and he just let everything work out for our good.\u201d\n TMZ\u00a0obtained footage of one of Robinson\u2019s standup routines in which she talked about a social worker coming to her home to make sure she was a fit parent for adoption. In the routine, she described how two of her sons were being rambunctious when the social worker came by and joked that she should\u2019ve locked them in cages.\n When the boys continued to act up,\u00a0Robinson joked that she yelled, \u201cShut up before I come in there and punch in your throat!\u201d",

        "title": "Republicans still have one big card to play this year",
        "body_text": "(CNN) There's no question that Republicans are\u00a0not in a good spot politically at the moment.\n Not only are they out of power in the White House, the Senate and the House, they are in the early stages of a civil war between pro-Trump forces and the establishment wing of the party that is going to get much, much uglier.\n But before you start writing the political obituary for the Republican Party in Washington, you need to consider this oft-ignored but critically important card that the GOP still has in hand: The Republican Party will control the bulk of the redistricting processes in the country.\n Wrote David Wasserman, The Cook Political Report's House editor, in his big look at the state of redistricting on Tuesday:\n \"Republicans may not be as dominant as they were in 2011 when they redrew nearly five times as many congressional seats as Democrats. But they still hold far more raw power. They fared well in 2020's state legislative elections and maintained control of several huge prizes: Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which are collectively poised to gain six seats from the Census.\"\n (Remember that following the census every decade, all state legislative and congressional lines are redrawn based on population gains and losses.)\n While the 2020 election wound up being a\u00a0very\u00a0mixed one for Republicans -- particularly once they lost both Georgia US Senate seats -- the down-ballot races for House and state legislatures were actually a major bright spot.\n Despite significant vulnerabilities, Republicans didn't lose their majorities in a single state legislative chamber, while they retook control from Democrats in two: the New Hampshire House and Senate.\n According to Wasserman, that means Republicans will have the final say in 188 House seats, while Democrats will be in total control of the lines in just 73 seats. (Another 45 seats will be under divided control between the two parties and 122 will see their lines drawn by independent or bipartisan commissions.)\n That's a 115-seat line-drawing edge for Republicans. And that's why the party has at least some reason for optimism heading into the next two years.",

        "title": "After 17 Years Underground, A Swarm Of Cicadas Is Set To Descend On America",
        "body_text": "A legion of cicadas that have spent nearly two decades underground are predicted to emerge and fly across 15 states this spring and summer.\n Formally known as periodical cicadas, or Magicicada, the insects spend 13 to 17 years beneath the ground in a slow period of maturation during which time they feed on the roots of plants and trees.\n Eventually the juvenile cicadas \u2015 known as nymphs \u2015 grow to adulthood and leave the soil in large groups before mating and dying, usually three to four weeks after their emergence.\n Scientists have dubbed the regularly occurring cicada populations \u201cbroods,\u201d and according to a 2020 interview with Michigan State University entomologist Gary Parsons, \u201cnearly every year somewhere in the eastern U.S., a brood will be emerging.\u201d\n \u201cThe 17-year broods seem to occur mostly in the northern U.S. and 13-year broods emerge more to the south,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIn some years, both a 13- and 17-year brood will emerge, but not in the same location. In some years, no cicadas will emerge.\u201d\n Brood X, which last emerged in 2004, is the name of the group that is expected to rise this year, and entomologists expect to spot the cicadas across Delaware, Georgia, Illinois,\u00a0Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia.\n In an interview with Newsweek, Michael J. Raupp, emeritus professor of entomology at the University of Maryland, said that between Georgia and New York there would \u201csurely be trillions emerging\u201d as part of a \u201cstrange survival strategy\u201d to overwhelm potential predators and ensure that the brood will rise again in another 17 years \u2014 in 2038.\n Despite their extreme numbers, the insects themselves are harmless, and Raupp described their once-every-two-decades emergence as a \u201ca wonderful opportunity for millions of people to witness and enjoy a remarkable biological phenomenon in their own backyard that happens nowhere else on the planet.\u201d",

        "body_text": "(CNN) Law enforcement agents are on a manhunt for two inmates who escaped an Arizona prison Saturday night.\n The two men used a large air conditioning unit as a ram to break into a closet and steal tools used for their escape, officials said.\n Law enforcement officials said during a news conference Monday that they continue to search for John Charpiot and David Harmon after their escape from the state prison in Florence.\n \"We still have a significant fugitive apprehension effort manhunt going on. The efforts are concentrated in multiple different areas,\" Colonel Heston Silbert, the director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said during a news conference Monday.\n The state of Arizona and the US Marshals Service are offering a total of up to $70,000 in rewards for information leading to their capture.\n Silbert said the department has concerns the inmates are still in the area, possibly holed up in a nearby home, and is asking residents to stay vigilant so they can recapture the men.\n \"If you as a resident in the area of the prison have noticed a neighbor hasn't been around, or if you've noticed a coworker hasn't come to work for a period of time,\" Silbert said. \"If it's something that's out of the norm, we would ask you to please call.\"\n Silbert said multiple law enforcement agencies are assisting with the search, with agents \"on foot, out in the desert, going house to house\" and search dogs combing the area for clues to their whereabouts.\n Charpiot is a convicted sex offender who was sentenced to 35 years in prison, while Harmon was serving a 100-year sentence for kidnapping and burglary following a long list of past criminal convictions, a news release from the Arizona Department of Corrections Rehabilitation & Reentry said.\n \"They've already shown and demonstrated that they'll commit a violent act while they've escaped,\" Silbert warned. \"That's a genuine concern of ours. We are concerned about the community. As far as we're concerned, they're both dangerous felons on the run.\"",

        "title": "Goya board silences its CEO after he tells Fox News the election was rigged",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Goya's board of directors had enough of CEO Robert Unanue's public comments in support of former President Donald Trump and his unfounded claims of voter fraud. On Friday, it voted to muzzle him.\n The board of the privately held Latino food company voted to censure Unanue, following his most recent controversial remarks that questioned the legitimacy of the November election, according to a person familiar with the board's actions, who spoke to CNN on the condition that their name not be used.\n Unanue will no longer be allowed to speak to the media without the board's permission, the source said. The decision was first reported by the New York Post Monday evening.\n The source said this is a \"full stop\" on Unanue speaking to the press, not only about politics, but also about the company itself.\n A majority of Goya shareholders favor removing Unanue altogether but have been prevented from doing so by the dynamics of the family-controlled company, according to the source.\n \"The company has never been political or politicized,\" said the source. \"He's gone from bad CEO to CEO that has imperiled the future of the company and endangered the lives of some of the shareholders,\" the source said in reference to some Unanue family members having allegedly received threats because of the CEO's comments.\n \"His statements are insulting and dangerous,\" said the source.\n Unanue spoke to the New York Post after the board's action but did not directly discuss his censure or the ban on speaking to the media. He confirmed he would no longer be speaking publicly about politics or religion.\n \"Independently, I've made the decision to lower the temperature and walk away from speaking about politics and religion,\" he told the Post. \"I realize it's important because of the diverse views of the company and our market.\"\n On inauguration day, shortly after President Trump made his farewell remarks, Unanue appeared on Fox Business' morning show and told anchor Maria Bartiromo that there was a \"war coming\" and that President Joe Biden's election was \"unverified.\"\n \"They accomplished what they set out to do, which was get President Trump out of the way,\" he said. \"I think this is mission accomplished, by the unions, the partnership, the conglomerate of social media, big tech, big media and big government. ... There is a war coming, now that the president is leaving today, they're still coming after the United States, the working class.\"\n Those comments did not get as much attention as his July remarks praising President Trump, likely because of all the other news surrounding the inauguration. But it was apparently enough for the Goya board to take action. Many board members were already upset with Unanue's previous public comments on politics, and about the company's performance under his leadership, according to the source who spoke with CNN.\n Unanue set off the controversy in July when, appearing at a White House event, he said, \"We are all truly blessed ... to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. We have an incredible builder, and we pray. We pray for our leadership, our president.\"\n Unanue and Goya said at the time that he was at the White House to announce the donation of millions of cans of Goya products to food banks.\n But his praise of Trump sparked a backlash from a number of leading Hispanic politicians, including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Obama cabinet member Julian Castro. Some other people on social media called for a boycott.\n That in turn prompted a so-called \"buy-cott\" by Trump supporters, including Ivanka Trump, who urged the president's backers to buy Goya products.\n In December, Unanue told a conservative radio show host that Ocasio-Cortez was the company's \"employee of the month,\" claiming that the congresswoman's July tweets had in fact boosted sales. But the CNN source disputed that the controversy has been good for the company, and Goya's sales figures are not publicly disclosed.\n \"It's hard to really say [the controversy hurt sales] but sales growth is less than it was pre-him speaking at the Rose Garden,\" said the source.\n Goya did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.  The company, founded in 1936 by Don Prudencio Unanue and his wife, Carolina, now has more than 4,000 employees in 26 facilities throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Spain, according to the company's web site.",

        "title": "Portland mayor tells police he pepper-sprayed a man who harassed him over mask policies",
        "body_text": "(CNN) Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler told police Sunday night that he used pepper spray on a man who had been harassing him about Covid-19 mask policies outside of a restaurant.\n \"He had no face mask on and got within a foot or two of my face while he was videoing me,\" Wheeler said in a voluntary statement to the Portland Police Bureau.\n Police do not know the identity of the man who was sprayed and have so far received no complaints, they said. When asked about the rumored incident during a news conference Monday, Wheeler said, \"I can tell you there was an incident, I filed a police report, and that's all I can tell you right now.\"\n The mayor's office told CNN Monday evening that Wheeler does not have any further comment to make.\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises restaurant-goers to sit outdoors, at least 6 feet apart from other groups and wear masks whenever patrons are not eating or drinking, according to guidance last updated January 6.\n In the statement to police, Wheeler said he was approached on Sunday outside the Hillsdale McMenamin's pub by a man he did not recognize. The man said he had been photographing the mayor while he was in the restaurant's tent and accused the mayor of being in the restaurant without a mask against Covid-19 policies, Wheeler said in the statement.\n The man appeared to be recording him with a cell phone, Wheeler said, adding that he told the man people are allowed to temporarily remove a mask for eating and drinking at a restaurant, the statement said.\n Wheeler said the man followed him to his car.\n \"I became imminently concerned for my personal safety, as I had recently been physically accosted in a similar situation,\" Wheeler said. The mayor says he first gave a verbal warning that he was prepared to use the pepper spray, and then sprayed the man in the eyes.\n Wheeler was confronted earlier this month at a restaurant by a group of people shouting obscenities, and \"one member of the group started swatting at the Mayor and made physical contact with him.\"\n The police report said Wheeler was with former Portland Mayor Sam Adams at the time, who confirmed the incident to an officer. Adams did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\n Adams attempted to video record the encounter, but only was able to capture the audio, which is consistent with both Wheeler and Adam's story, the police report said.\n Wheeler and Adams both say Wheeler tossed a water bottle toward the man so he could wash out his eyes but did not remain at the scene. Shortly afterward, a staffer to the mayor called police to initiate the report.",

        "body_text": "President Biden is poised to impose a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leasing Wednesday, according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan was still being finalized. The move will deliver on one of Biden\u2019s boldest climate campaign pledges but will encounter stiff resistance from the fossil fuel industry.\n The White House has prepared documents that would pause new oil and gas auctions on federal land and water as the new administration reviews the program, these people said. The moratorium would not affect existing leases, meaning drilling would continue on public land in the West as well as in the Gulf of Mexico.\n The memo remains a draft subject to final approval, said one person close to the White House who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it had not been formally announced. Administration officials had considered imposing a moratorium on new federal coal leasing as well, but one of the people briefed on the plan said officials are leaning against that option.\n Biden plans to outline steps Wednesday aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and elevating the role of science in federal decision-making. Other new policies include protecting 30 percent of federal land and water by the end of the decade and identifying climate change as a national security priority.\n Asked about the matter, the White House and the Interior Department declined to comment.\n During the campaign, Biden pledged to ban \u201cnew oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,\u201d without specifying exactly what such a ban would entail.\n Fossil fuel leasing on federal and tribal land accounts for nearly a quarter of the country\u2019s annual carbon output. The drilling program also generated nearly $8.1 billion in tax revenue for the federal, state, local and tribal governments last year, according to the Interior Department\u2019s Office of Natural Resources Revenue.\n Environmentalists say the pause will allow the new administration to assess whether taxpayers are being adequately compensated for the minerals extracted from land they own.\n \u201cBy pausing the broken leasing system and halting the giveaways to oil and gas executives, President Biden has an opportunity to meaningfully fix the leasing system for the first time in nearly four decades with solutions that work for the public and which incorporate ambitious conservation, taxpayer fairness, and climate goals,\u201d Jenny Rowland-Shea, senior policy analyst for public land at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, wrote in an email. \u201cWe can make sure our public lands and coasts are preserved, accessible and beneficial to everyone \u2014 not abused by oil and gas corporations.\u201d\n But oil and gas groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, counter that freezing new leasing will deprive state and local governments, as well as the U.S. Treasury, of needed revenue. Last week, the industry criticized the Interior Department when it dictated that any new leases or permits issued during the next 60 days needed the approval of a top-ranking Biden appointee before they could be finalized.\n API President Mike Sommers said that move alone will damage domestic energy producers while benefiting those abroad.\n \u201cRestricting development on federal lands and waters is nothing more than an \u2018import more oil\u2019 policy,\u201d Sommers said. \u201cEnergy demand will continue to rise \u2014 especially as the economy recovers \u2014 and we can choose to produce that energy here in the United States or rely on foreign countries hostile to American interests.\u201d\n About 22 percent of U.S. oil production and 12 percent of natural gas production takes place on federal land and water, according to API.\n A moratorium would have contrasting effects on different oil-producing regions, hamstringing drillers in New Mexico, where the federal government controls huge swaths of land, while leaving those producing on state or private land across the border in Texas unscathed.\n \u201cIt feels a little bit unfair,\u201d said Raye Miller, head of a small nine-well oil-producing operation called Regeneration Energy in southeastern New Mexico. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned with the direction things are headed.\u201d\n But drilling on public land will continue even with a moratorium on new leasing, because industry operators hold plenty of undeveloped leases in their portfolios. Only about half of the nearly 20,000 applications to drill approved between 2014 and 2019 are in use, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. More than 13 million acres of land leased for oil and gas were not producing during fiscal 2019.\n While the oil and gas lobby gears up for a fight, environmental advocates are sustaining pressure on Biden to keep his commitment to end leasing and permitting on federal acreage. Among them is Oceana, a marine conservation group, which is set to release a report Tuesday detailing how reversing the Trump administration\u2019s plan to open up nearly all U.S. coastal water to drilling would prevent more than 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n Activists have been pleased with Biden\u2019s quick climate actions. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m excited about the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Diane Hoskins, a campaign director at Oceana.\n An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of tax revenue generated by federal oil and gas drilling last fiscal year. It was nearly $8.1 billion, not $11.7 billion. This report has been updated.",

        "title": "Bomani Jones thrives where race and sports collide. Can he be a star at ESPN?",
        "body_text": "\u201cWhat do you think,\u201d Bomani Jones was asking, \u201cis the biggest impediment to race relations in America?\u201d\n It was a heavy question for a caller to pose on afternoon sports talk radio. But this was last summer, amid the tension of a national reckoning around racism, and a noose had been found in the stall of Black NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace. Originally called a hate crime by NASCAR, the FBI had determined the rope was not malicious.\n The show\u2019s host, Will Cain, who has since left for Fox News, had declared the episode a setback to race relations in the United States. That got the attention of Jones, who called into his colleague\u2019s show and asked his question.\n Cain answered: tribalism. Jones pressed on.\n \u201cIf I were to ask you [the same question] in 1865 ... would you have said the whole thing about tribalism?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cYes, at a deeper philosophical level,\u201d Cain replied. \u201cBut the more immediate biggest impediment at that point would have been the institution of slavery.\u201d\n But this, Jones explained, was a fundamental misunderstanding of racism.\n \u201cThe issue is ... White people not treating Black people as being of equal levels of humanity,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe problem I have is when you say that what happened with Bubba Wallace is going to be an impediment to race relations \u2014 nah, man. Those people rolling on Speedway Boulevard before that race with those [Confederate] flags flying, those are an impediment to race relations.\u201d\n As protests gripped the country, commentators across the media were trying to explain them in the context of American history. Few did that more ably, in this moment and others, than Jones, across ESPN, on CNN and in a story about amateurism for Vanity Fair edited by author Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n It didn\u2019t go unnoticed. He received calls from ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro and other executives thanking him for his work \u2014 a stark departure from earlier in 2020, when his future at ESPN appeared in question. His afternoon TV show was canceled. Two friends and fellow prominent Black voices, Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, had left ESPN after becoming targets of its conservative critics, including President Donald Trump, and as the network rededicated itself to being apolitical.\n But now protests were forcing the network to confront racism. And the conversation with Cain, Jones thought, proved both his value to the network and its value to him. \u201cThat got around, and it was on a topic that I think had some importance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd me having that exchange with him on ESPN gave it a visibility. That probably doesn\u2019t happen if it\u2019s on a different platform, on a different network.\u201d\n Seven months later, though, Jones finds himself wondering again about his place in a company undergoing seismic changes to its business model. ESPN has staked its future on live sports, and its programming decisions reflect that. After years of the proliferation of debate shows, there is more \u201cSportsCenter\u201d on ESPN these days; gambling content is ascendant; former athletes are in more demand on TV than journalists.\n There have been more high-profile exits, too, including another outspoken friend of Jones\u2019s, radio and TV host Dan Le Batard. ESPN announced 300 layoffs in November, the largest round in the company\u2019s history, amid shrinking cable fees and a pandemic. And in a post-Trump world, it\u2019s easy to envision the entire sports industry preaching the bridge-building, kumbaya potential of sports.\n Today, Jones appears on a handful of ESPN shows, but all he\u2019s anchored to, for now, is a podcast.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 for this entire industry, not just ESPN,\u201d Jones said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the paradigm is going to be for guys on television talking about sports if you\u2019re not Stephen A. Smith.\u201d\n Dressed in a gray T-shirt and black track pants, Jones was strolling through Harlem, where he lives, past closed restaurants and people shedding layers on an unseasonably warm afternoon. He hasn\u2019t left his house much since the coronavirus arrived. \u201cI\u2019ve been diligent on this covid s---,\u201d he said.\n Jones was born in Atlanta and grew up in Houston, where his parents were professors at Prairie View A&M. Both were active in the civil rights movement. Jones learned his love of sports from his father, mostly watching Braves games, though his fandom lapsed after an iteration of the team preached the sanctity of playing the game \u201cthe right way\u201d \u2014 often code for the \u201cWhite way.\u201d \u201cIt was everything I don\u2019t stand for,\u201d he said.\n Jones earned a master\u2019s degree in politics, economics and business from Claremont but flunked out of a doctoral program and pivoted to writing. One of his first pieces was for ESPN\u2019s Page 2 in 2004, about the racist undertones of a saga involving a top high school football recruit accused of statutory rape. He hosted a local radio show in North Carolina and then one for Sirius before earning a regular gig on ESPN\u2019s debate show \u201cAround the Horn.\u201d\n In 2013, he was hired full-time at ESPN as a co-host of \u201cHighly Questionable,\u201d alongside Le Batard, and he later hosted a national radio show for ESPN. He earned a reputation for his commentary on how race intersects with sports.\n Coates recalled watching Jones on ESPN and marveling at how fast he spoke. \u201cMy prejudice is to overlook people who talk fast, but you listen to him and there\u2019s actually brilliance behind it,\u201d Coates said. \u201cThe world is waiting for you to catch up to Bomani.\u201d\n His commentary about Colin Kaepernick was particularly valuable, Coates said, after the quarterback was criticized for settling his collusion case with the NFL. \u201cBomani was sympathetic not just to Kaepernick\u2019s protest but to why he might not be acting like y\u2019all think he should,\u201d Coates said.\n Jones\u2019s biggest break was supposed to be \u201cHigh Noon,\u201d a talk show he co-hosted with his friend Pablo Torre, which debuted in 2018. The two were paid more than $3 million combined per year for the show, according to a person familiar with their salaries, and Jones moved from Miami to New York. In addition to sports news of the day, \u201cHigh Noon\u201d tackled issues of race and politics, including whether top Black athletes should exclusively attend historically Black colleges.\n Over the life of the show, though, two things changed at ESPN. President John Skipper was replaced by Pitaro, who declared ESPN would extricate itself from the Trump-fueled culture wars and prioritize relationships with leagues such as the NFL. And cable subscribers continued to dwindle while the cost of sports rights continued to grow, increasing economic pressure on the network. \u201cHigh Noon\u201d became a luxury the network didn\u2019t want to pay for.\n After two years, ESPN canceled the show, publicly blaming its ratings, which were not great but also not disastrous. It was \u201ca smart and nuanced show,\u201d the company said at the time. \u201cUnfortunately, not enough people agreed with us.\u201d\n The cancellation was difficult for Jones. He had viewed the show as a natural progression of his career \u2014 writer, radio host, TV star. But he believes he and Torre never exuded the same camaraderie of the hosts of the long-running \u201cPardon the Interruption,\u201d Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon. \u201cThe show wasn\u2019t canceled because of what we talked about,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI don\u2019t think our friendship carried over to the screen.\u201d\n After the cancellation, Jones re-signed with ESPN. No longer the host of a show, he took a pay cut.\n In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing, as athletes, teams and leagues joined a national reckoning over racism, ESPN rushed to cover the protests. It showcased the work of the Undefeated, a vertical that covers race, and aired multiple specials dedicated to the topic. Inside the network, some employees felt a sense of whiplash. When Disney, ESPN\u2019s parent company, announced it would partner with Kaepernick (and Hill) to create a series of shows, one ESPN staffer said, \u201cIt was like Voldemort and we could say his name again.\u201d\n Jones was suddenly in demand, too, getting more calls for TV appearances, and his impromptu debate with Cain won headlines around the Internet. On his podcast, which gained listeners over the summer, he led vital conversations about race. After NBA players engaged in a political strike over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin, Jones wondered aloud whether LeBron James, an older player with lucrative ties to corporate America, was the right person to lead the protest movement.\n He also led perhaps less vital but equally illustrative conversations, such as when he discussed the time years ago that Mike Tirico, a prominent sportscaster for NBC, said he wasn\u2019t Black. (Tirico has since said he is mixed race.) Asked why the segment was important, Jones laughed.\n \u201cBecause it\u2019s hilarious!\u201d he said. \u201cFor White people in America, race only comes up to them when you\u2019re talking about something bad about somebody else. People get in conversation, they whisper, \u2018He was Black.\u2019 They lower their voice because they feel like they\u2019re saying a bad word. Well, this ain\u2019t a bad word to me.\u201d\n There were some at ESPN who felt stifled by Pitaro\u2019s directive to keep political discussions off the network. Le Batard once questioned on the air why it was okay to talk about Trump and racism only if someone such as James talked about it first, which earned him a face-to-face meeting with Pitaro in New York.\n Jones said he hasn\u2019t felt restricted by ESPN\u2019s guardrails. \u201cDan is a hell raiser, right?\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s not the role I think I play in the ecosystem.\u201d\n Still, by the fall, with sports back in full swing, Jones said the appreciation calls had dried up. \u201cI don\u2019t think that that moment ushered in some new revolution of what ESPN was doing as much as it\u2019s going to prove to be a moment in time,\u201d he said.\n Walking toward Central Park, Jones looked around and said, \u201cThey ain\u2019t gentrified Harlem just yet.\u201d In the park, he settled on a rock formation, where he sat for an hour, talking about how ESPN\u2019s future intersects with his own. \u201cI used to host a TV show. Now I don\u2019t host a TV show,\u201d he said. \u201cI ain\u2019t the first person to be here. Stephen A. Smith has been in this position, before his return to the top.\u201d\n Smith signed a contract last year that pays him around $8 million per year, according to the New York Post. He\u2019s the undisputed face of ESPN, his bombastic punditry ubiquitous across every ESPN platform.\n Jones is confronting his future at a moment when making that leap to network tentpole is more important than ever. The biggest stars in sports media can command bigger and bigger salaries, like Smith or Skip Bayless of Fox Sports, or they can strike out on their own like Le Batard, who is launching his own media company, Meadowlark, with Skipper. Jones\u2019s path is less clear. He has expressed interest in replacing Le Batard as full-time host of \u201cHighly Questionable,\u201d but ESPN opted to maintain a rotating cast of hosts, including Torre, for now. (Some inside ESPN wonder whether that time block is destined to eventually become another \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d anyway.)\n What else there is, Jones isn\u2019t sure. There could be a show on streaming service ESPN Plus \u2014 maybe something like Bill Maher does on HBO, with a monologue and a panel \u2014 but the content vision for the platform is unclear beyond live sports. He could also try to strike out on his own, possibly with Le Batard. Jones, who is under contract with ESPN until 2022, has been approached by Meadowlark, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, but it\u2019s too early to know what he might do or make with the venture.\n Michael Smith, who now co-hosts a show on NBC\u2019s streaming service, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure ESPN expressed the proper and deserved amount of value to him. He\u2019s singular. There\u2019s no one better at sports commentary on that network or anywhere else.\u201d\n ESPN has its own calculations to make about the purpose of its daytime lineup. Is the goal to drive ad revenue or to funnel viewers to the live sports that air most nights? Or is the goal to make league partners happy in service of current and future rights deals? ESPN airs a daily afternoon NBA show that often doesn\u2019t rate as well as \u201cSportsCenter.\u201d But regardless of how many people watch it, it buys goodwill with the NBA, which ESPN pays billions to broadcast its games.\n All of these questions are more acute with cable revenue still shrinking. As one former ESPN executive put it: \u201cIf you\u2019re not on \u2018SportsCenter,\u2019 [morning show] \u2018First Take\u2019 or \u2018PTI,\u2019 you don\u2019t have any job security at ESPN.\u201d\n Pitaro, in an interview, said he valued Jones. He recalled attending a Super Bowl with some friends a few years ago, when he was a Disney executive. At a pregame party, Pitaro\u2019s friends only wanted to talk to Jones. \u201cI remember thinking then there was more we could do with Bomani,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2019High Noon\u2019 didn\u2019t work, and I\u2019m sad about that. With his versatility, I think his future is bright here.\u201d\n Jones hopes that\u2019s true. \u201cESPN is still the number one place in the game to be if what you want to do is talk about sports,\u201d he said. But he also knows the industry is changing, even faster than he thought it would. A few years ago, he had dinner with Torre and told him there were only one or two contracts left for them at the money they were making, doing the jobs they were doing.\n \u201cNo matter what happens, there\u2019s always going to be somebody like \u2018The Wire\u2019 was for HBO,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018The Wire\u2019 didn\u2019t get great ratings, but they wanted to say they had \u2018The Wire.\u2019 It looked good on the masthead. ESPN\u2019s going to have people like that. I just don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d",

        "body_text": "(CNN) A gorilla at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in California has recovered from Covid-19 after receiving monoclonal antibody therapy and other treatments.\n Winston, an elderly silverback gorilla, and eight other gorilla troop members tested positive for the virus earlier this month after showing symptoms of \"mild coughing, congestion, nasal discharge and intermittent lethargy,\" the zoo said. The gorillas were suspected to have been infected by an asymptomatic staff member.\n Due to concerns over Winston's age and underlying medical conditions, veterinarians performed a diagnostic examination and were able to confirm he had pneumonia and heart disease, San Diego Zoo Safari Park said in a news release.\n From a supply not permitted for human use, Winston received monoclonal antibody therapy, heart medications and antibiotics.\n \"Treatment with these synthetic versions of the body's natural defenses is thought to be effective in diminishing effects from the virus,\" the zoo said in its news release. \"The veterinary team who treated Winston believe the antibodies may have contributed to his ability to overcome the virus.\"\n Monoclonal antibody treatments that are used to treat humans have been shown to reduce viral load and lower a person's risk of hospitalization and even death. Unlike a vaccine that takes a few weeks to work, antibody treatments work right away.\n With the help of veterinarians, wildlife care professionals and specialists, the entire troop is on track to make a full recovery.\n \"San Diego Zoo Global is relieved to announce that the eight-member troop is eating, drinking, interacting and on their way to a full recovery,\" the release read.\n San Diego Zoo veterinarians have been working with specialists from around the world to secure a limited supply of vaccinations that are intended only for use on animals. Zoo officials have already begun to identify candidates for the spike protein vaccine at the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park.\n San Diego Zoo Global said it \"will continue to share what it has learned about curbing zoonotic disease transmission, biosecurity protocols in managed care and field settings, and the implications to ensuring optimal health outcomes for humans and wildlife globally.\"",

        "body_text": "Jan 25 (Reuters) \u2014 Drugmaker Merck & Co on Monday said it will end development of its two COVID-19 vaccines, and will focus pandemic research on treatments, with initial efficacy data on an experimental oral antiviral expected by the end of March.\n Merck said in a statement it will record a pretax discontinuation charge in the fourth quarter for vaccine candidate V591, which it acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience, and V590, developed with nonprofit research organization IAVI.\n In early trials, both vaccines generated immune responses that were inferior to those seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19 as well as those reported for other COVID-19 vaccines, the company said.\n Merck was late to join the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 2 million people and continues to surge in many parts of the world including the United States.\n U.S. regulators in December authorized COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna Inc and partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, and tens of millions of doses of both have so far been administered globally. Rivals Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc and others are also racing to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect against the virus.\n Merck said it will focus COVID-19 research and manufacturing efforts on two investigational medicines: MK-7110 and MK-4482, which it now calls molnupiravir.\n Molnupiravir, which is being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Bio, is an oral antiviral being studied in both hospital and outpatient settings. Merck said a phase 2/3 trial of the drug is set to finish in May, but initial efficacy results are due in the first quarter and will be made public if clinically meaningful.\n Merck said results from a phase 3 study of MK-7110, an immune modulator being studied as a treatment for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, are expected in the first quarter. In December, the company announced a deal to supply MK-7110 to the U.S. government for up to about $356 million.\n (Reporting By Deena Beasley Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus\nIs it safe to see people who have gotten the coronavirus vaccine?\nWhat it means if your partner tests positive for COVID-19 but you don\u2019t.\nHow worried should you be about the new strains of coronavirus?\nThe unexpected challenges of co-parenting during a pandemic.\u00a0\n19 things we took for granted pre-pandemic but now miss.\u00a0\nFind all that and more on our coronavirus hub page.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs COVID-19 cases rise, it\u2019s more important than ever to remain connected and informed.

        "title": "US Capitol officers debating no-confidence vote for leaders in charge during Capitol riots",
        "body_text": "(CNN) US Capitol Police officers are in preliminary discussions over holding a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders who were working on the day when Donald Trump supporters led an insurrection into the building, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n The vote would target acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman, who was promoted into the agency's top job following the resignation of Steven Sund after the insurrection. At least four additional chiefs may be targeted as part of any no-confidence vote, the three sources said.\n News of the discussion comes as Pittman spoke to congressional members during a closed-door briefing Tuesday, where she said the \"department failed to meet its own high standards\" on January 6, adding that police \"knew there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target.\"\n One source told CNN that Pittman was the operational chief that day and \"never took control of the radio or commanded officers what to do in any way shape or form.\"\n One Capitol police source said stewards from the USCP Labor Committee, the union representing rank-and-file officers, visited section roll calls to take the temperature of officers on the potential no-confidence vote.\n Another source within the department says a no-confidence vote was likely forthcoming for senior leadership. \"The rank-and-file of this department has no faith in any of our chiefs, especially the ones in that were here on January 6th,\" the source told CNN.\n A Capitol Police spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.\n Union President Gus Papathanasiou told CNN that no vote is underway. \"Officers have been calling for a vote of no confidence since January 6th,\" Papathanasiou said. \"At this time we have not initiated a vote of no confidence. Doesn't mean we can't think about it. There's a big difference.\"\n LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Biden presidency and Trump impeachment trial\n Officers have told CNN that they felt abandoned and betrayed by the department's leadership.\n Prior to her appointment, Pittman had served as head of intelligence operations since October 2019. In that role, Pittman was responsible for the safety and security of the US Capitol, congressional members, congressional staff and Capitol visitors, including detecting any threat and preventing it. On the day of the insurrection, she was second in command of the US Capitol Police force.\n In her prepared remarks Tuesday, Pittman outlined the department's failure to act on intelligence that pointed to a likelihood of violence.\n \"We knew that militia groups and White supremacists organizations would be attending. We also knew that some of these participants were intending to bring firearms and other weapons to the event. We knew that there was a strong potential for violence and that Congress was the target,\" she said.\n The department responded to the threat by canceling days off for some officers and putting civil disturbance teams on standby. The SWAT team was available to wade into the crowd to make arrests, though officers told CNN that was not possible because of how badly officers were outnumbered that day.\n Officers also described to CNN a hasty attempt to get helmets into the hands of officers before the event, without clear instruction on when to use them and where to store them.\n Pittman said the department had adopted a new perimeter around the Capitol based on \"instructions it received from the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms.\" But officers have told CNN, and videos indicate, that the bike-rack-type fencing used that day created a danger because it provide no security and can be easily weaponized by violent protesters.\n \"The department prepared in order to meet these challenges, but we did not do enough,\" she said.\n Pittman also acknowledged that two pipe bombs and a van with explosives had forced police to divert officers just as the main body of protesters was arriving at the Capitol.\n Officers told CNN they believe the assault on the Capitol was timed to the bombs being found and was coordinated between insurrectionists on the east and west fronts of the building. The lack of any quick backup left officers stranded in thin lines attempting to keep a crowd of thousands from entering. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The stock market is at peak dumb: Etsy soars because Elon Musk tweets about it",
        "body_text": "New York (CNN Business) Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person on the planet, but he's apparently still happy to shop on handmade craft site Etsy. And in a sign of just how much influence Musk has on social media, shares of Etsy (ETSY) soared nearly 10% in premarket trading Tuesday just because he said he's a fan.\n \"I kinda love Etsy,\" Musk tweeted, adding in a follow up tweet that he bought a wool Marvin the Martian helmet (the alien from the Bugs Bunny cartoons) for his dog -- fitting as Musk, of course, wants to one day go to Mars with his other company, SpaceX.\n The stock pulled back later in the day though. It opened 8% higher but was down 2% by afternoon.\n Still, given there was no other company news from Etsy Tuesday morning, it seems safe to say that Musk's tweet was the primary catalyst for the stock's premarket surge.\n That, of course, is ridiculous. It's also yet another example of the increasingly short-term nature of the stock market, one where algorithms can drive prices and individual investors using services like Robinhood are eager to make a quick buck.\n Recently, shares of companies that many professional investors are shorting -- because they expect the stocks to go down since the companies are struggling or overvalued -- are instead surging thanks to support from traders on a popular Reddit board. GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Macy's (M) and AMC (AMC) are just a few examples.\n But Etsy is nothing like these companies in that it's thriving, in part due to strong demand for masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts are forecasting that Etsy's sales nearly doubled in 2020 and that earnings per share soared more than 175%.\n Musk's tweet put a bigger spotlight on Etsy, though, and it isn't the first time he's sparked a big move in an asset that isn't Tesla. The price of digital currency dogecoin popped late last month when he touted it on Twitter.\n Still, it's a bit ironic that Etsy is benefiting from Musk's endorsement. Although Tesla was finally added to the S&P 500 in December, many on Wall Street were surprised when Tesla was snubbed for the index in September. The company that was added back then instead of Tesla? Etsy.",

Originally written in 1993 for an abortive Steven Spielberg project, and only now resuscitated under the direction of writer John Lee Hancock (\u201cThe Highwaymen\u201d), it boasts a sterling main cast \u2014 Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, Jared Leto \u2014 as well as open-endedness that is simultaneously pleasurable and a bit unsettling, in both the good and bad senses of that word.\n Washington plays Joe \u201cDeke\u201d Deacon, a sheriff\u2019s deputy in the boondocks north of Los Angeles, from where he was drummed out of the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s department five years ago, after an unspecified breakdown. The details of his past only unspool gradually, in flashback, at the same time as the circumstances of a new case Deke serendipitously becomes caught up in. That\u2019s because the new case isn\u2019t exactly new, at least not for Deke, who was once a considered a kind of brilliant detective-savant. He speaks to corpses, sometimes literally, and they \u201ctalk\u201d back to him, figuratively speaking. Characters refer to him as \u201cKojak\u201d and \u201cColumbo,\u201d less in awe than in sarcasm. (Google the names, kids, if they don\u2019t mean anything.)\n While on a routine errand to Los Angeles from his exile up north, Deke gets wind of several recent murders of young women that remind him of the case that precipitated his collapse: a triple-murder that led to an obsession that led to a heart attack and divorce. His slick, hotshot replacement, Malek\u2019s Jim Baxter, isn\u2019t so arrogant that he won\u2019t accept help from Deke, who demonstrates his prowess, right off the bat, at a gruesome crime scene to which Jim invites him.\n Together, Deke and Jim begin to make some headway \u2014 and connections \u2014 in a case that seems to involve, by the time the film gets rolling, at least seven victims, including a female jogger who has gone missing and is presumed dead. There are two losers brought in for questioning: a guy (Frederick Koehler) with a rap sheet \u2014 or a KSO, for \u201cknown sex offender,\u201d in the police lingo that is sprinkled throughout the script for flavor \u2014 and Leto\u2019s seemingly squeaky clean yet creepy prime suspect, who keeps a police scanner in his apartment and has a hobbyist\u2019s sick fascination with murder and its methods, on the perp and the police sides.\n \u201cThe Little Things\u201d \u2014 whose title refers to the seemingly insignificant details that can break a case or drive a cop crazy \u2014 isn\u2019t a traditional whodunit. \u201cWe got something,\u201d Deke tells Jim. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n And neither, perhaps, will you.\n That equivocation is what\u2019s unsatisfying and satisfying about the film, whose true subject isn\u2019t ever catching the guy, but, in a sense, letting Deke \u2014 and, eventually, Jim too \u2014 off the hook for the unknown somethings that life is full of, and not just for cops working cold cases.\n In that sense, there\u2019s a single word that sums up the film. It comes courtesy of a forensic police scientist whose job, as he describes it to Deke, involving the analysis of fingerprints, bite marks, blood, etc., is to make the cops \u201clook good\u201d in court. It\u2019s a word that no sleepless detective \u2014 and possibly few filmgoers, except those who revel in the sweet, murky, strong black coffee that comes with lack of closure \u2014 ever wants to hear: inconclusive.\n R.\u2009At area theaters and on HBO Max. Contains violence, disturbing images, strong language and full nudity. 127 minutes.",

        "body_text": "My grandparents had a 20-foot-long, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d-style camper that they would drive from snowy Wisconsin to sunny Florida. When I told my grandfather about my pipe dream to take the van on a graduation road trip, he smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d By the time I graduated college, both the camper and my grandpa were gone. Instead, I drove all over the East Coast in his \u201999 Toyota \u2014 his sunglasses and spare change still in the cup holders. As I started my journey, I gripped the weathered steering wheel and smiled. It felt like he and I were driving. \u2014 Angie Newman\n We took a course at Barnard about the birds of New York. Before a quiz, I made a GarageBand track with bird names and Audubon recordings. \u201cBlue jay.\u201d \u201cTufted titmouse.\u201d I wrote, then rewrote, an email to Lhana: \u201cIn case this helps you study for the quiz!\u201d She didn\u2019t respond. But after we took the quiz on a windy day in Jamaica Bay, she sat next to me on the bus to Manhattan and said thanks. Years later, I proposed to her while playing the bird songs over speakers in an empty theater. When she said yes, my heart soared. \u2014 Madeline Taylor\n I last saw Ajay on our two-year anniversary; it will be our third before I see him next. During the pandemic, I have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be with him in real life. Some nights, I ask him to stay with me until morning. I place my phone next to my pillow as if he\u2019s there next to me and listen to him shuffle against the blankets. Then, I close my eyes and fill in the blanks: his arms looped around me, my legs braided gently into his. It reminds my body of the warmth it has forgotten. \u2014 Katherine Hu\n They deemed her unadoptable because she was scared of everything. But lying on the cold shelter floor that January day, she cracked open my guarded heart. A week later, I brought home my shaggy little bear and called her Stevie. She\u2019s still scared of many things: the garbage truck, men in uniform, loud children. But she has developed a fondness for just as many others: barbecue chicken, snuggles on the couch, walks in the park.

        "title": "Supreme Court ends lawsuits alleging that Trump illegally profited from business interests",
        "body_text": "The Supreme Court on Monday put an end to lawsuits alleging that President Donald Trump violated a constitutional anti-corruption prohibition by profiting from his business empire while in office.\n The justices, without comment or noted dissent, declined to hear Trump\u2019s request to consider lower-court orders that said lawsuits could go forward, agreeing with those on both sides of the issue that the cases became moot with Trump no longer in office.\n The justices also vacated the lower-court judgments in the cases, one of which was filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.\n It means there is no definitive answer after years of legal wrangling over the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which prohibit presidents and others from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without congressional approval.\n The question has rarely been presented because presidents rarely maintain active business interests in office, as Trump did. Much of the litigation turned on his interest in the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, near the White House, which became a magnet for foreign dignitaries and others doing business with the government during his term in office.\n The litigation was consumed with questions about who had the right to bring such a suit and legal questions without precedent.\n \u201cWe are proud that because of our case, a court ruled on the meaning of \u2018emoluments\u2019 for the first time in American history, finding that the Constitution prohibits federal officials from accepting almost anything of value from foreign or domestic governments,\u201d D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) said in a joint statement.\n They added: \u201cHistory will note that at every step of this case, President Trump and political appointees at the Department of Justice went to extreme lengths to prevent us from uncovering the true extent of his corruption. He attempted to short-circuit the rules of legal procedure to have our case dismissed and avoid discovery into his finances, arguing that the law did not apply to him.\u201d\n Their case was one of three testing for the first time the Constitution\u2019s ban on the country\u2019s leaders engaging in private business relationships with foreign governments.\n The Supreme Court declined in October to take up a case brought by Democratic members of Congress, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). The lawmakers had appealed a D.C. Circuit ruling that blocked individual members of Congress from trying to enforce the foreign emoluments clause.\n In a third case in New York, brought by the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) on behalf of Trump\u2019s hospitality industry competitors, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit said a lower-court judge had improperly thrown out the case in late 2017.\n The lawsuit alleged that Trump was illegally profiting from his hotels and restaurants in New York and D.C.. The full appeals court declined to rehear the case this summer, and Trump asked the high court to intervene.\n \u201cThis important litigation made the American people aware for four years of the pervasive corruption that came from a president maintaining a global business and taking benefits and payments from foreign and domestic governments,\u201d CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement Monday. \u201cOnly Trump losing the presidency and leaving office ended these corrupt constitutional violations and stopped these groundbreaking lawsuits.\u201d",

        "title": "Rudy Giuliani Sued by Dominion Voting Systems Over False Election Claims",
        "body_text": "Dominion Voting Systems filed a defamation lawsuit on Monday against Rudolph W. Giuliani, the lawyer for Donald J. Trump and former mayor of New York City who played a key role in the former president\u2019s monthslong effort to subvert the 2020 election.\n The 107-page lawsuit, filed in the Federal District Court in Washington, accuses Mr. Giuliani of carrying out \u201ca viral disinformation campaign about Dominion\u201d made up of \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d allegations, in part to enrich himself through legal fees and his podcast.\n The suit seeks damages of more than $1.3 billion and is based on more than 50 statements Mr. Giuliani made at legislative hearings, on Twitter, on his podcast and in the conservative news media, where he spun a fictitious narrative of a plot by one of the biggest voting machine manufacturers in the country to flip votes to President Biden.\n Mr. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers and confidants, has faced continuing fallout for his highly visible efforts to reverse the election outcome. This month, the chairman of the New York State Senate\u2019s judiciary committee formally requested that the state court system strip Mr. Giuliani of his law license.\n In a statement released by text message late Monday morning, Mr. Giuliani said that the lawsuit amounted to intimidation and that he was contemplating a countersuit.\n \u201cDominion\u2019s defamation lawsuit for $1.3B will allow me to investigate their history, finances, and practices fully and completely,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThe amount being asked for is, quite obviously, intended to frighten people of faint heart. It is another act of intimidation by the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech, as well as the ability of lawyers to defend their clients vigorously. As such, we will investigate a countersuit against them for violating these Constitutional rights.\u201d\n On his radio show on Monday afternoon, Mr. Giuliani seemed to welcome a trial.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice fight, a real fight, and by fight, I don\u2019t mean, don\u2019t mean any words of violence,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cI fight in the courtroom, you know? That\u2019s what I always mean when I talk about fight. We fight in the courtroom. We fight in the debate hall. I got a pretty good record in court. And I\u2019m a damn good investigator.\u201d\n Taken together with a lawsuit the company filed this month against Sidney Powell, another lawyer who was allied with Mr. Trump, the suit represents a point-by-point rebuke of one of the more outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding last year\u2019s election. The president\u2019s allies had contended that the voting machine company \u2014 which was also used in states during Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election, has been tested by government agencies, and was used in states Mr. Trump carried in 2020 \u2014 was somehow involved in a rigged election, partly as a result of ties to a long-deceased Venezuelan dictator.\n \u201cDominion was not founded in Venezuela to fix elections for Hugo Cha\u0301vez,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIt was founded in 2002 in John Poulos\u2019s basement in Toronto to help blind people vote on paper ballots.\u201d The suit later adds that the headquarters for the company\u2019s United States subsidiary is in Denver.\n Laying out a timeline of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments about Dominion on Twitter, his podcast and Fox News, the company notes that Mr. Giuliani avoided mentioning Dominion in court, where he could have faced legal ramifications for falsehoods. \u201cNotably, not a single one of the three complaints signed and filed by Giuliani and other attorneys for the Trump Campaign in the Pennsylvania action contained any allegations about Dominion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n The lawsuit also links Mr. Giuliani\u2019s false statements about Dominion to the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, noting that he mentioned the company in his speech at a rally for Mr. Trump before the attack, as well as numerous times on social media as the Capitol was breached.\n \u201cHaving been deceived by Giuliani and his allies into thinking that they were not criminals \u2014 but patriots \u2018Defend[ing] the Republic\u2019 from Dominion and its co-conspirators \u2014 they then bragged about their involvement in the crime on social media,\u201d the suit states.\n Thomas A. Clare, a lawyer representing Dominion, said that the riot had not factored into the decision to sue Mr. Giuliani, but that it did show just how seriously Mr. Trump\u2019s followers had taken the falsehoods told about the election.\n \u201cFrom a defamation law perspective, it just demonstrates the depth to which these statements sink in to people,\u201d Mr. Clare said in an interview. \u201cThat people don\u2019t just read them and tune them out. It goes to the core of their belief system, which puts them in a position to take action in the real world.\u201d\n John Poulos, the chief executive officer of Dominion, said that his company had taken legal action against Mr. Giuliani both to correct the record about Dominion and restore trust in American electoral systems.\n \u201cNot only have these lies damaged the good name of my company,\u201d Mr. Poulos said of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s false claims, \u201cbut they also undermined trust in American democratic institutions, drowning out the remarkable work of elections officials and workers, who ensured a transparent and secure election. The thousands of hand recounts and audits that proved machines counted accurately continue to be overshadowed by disinformation.\u201d\n Dominion is a major manufacturer of voting machine equipment in the United States, second only to Election Systems & Software. Different models of Dominion machines were used in more than two dozen states \u2014 red, blue and battleground \u2014 during the 2020 election.\n The company had previously warned Mr. Giuliani, sending a letter in late December that told him to preserve all records of his claims and stop making false statements, and warned that legal action was imminent. But Mr. Giuliani continued with his false claims of fraud, even arguing on Twitter days after receiving the letter that \u201cphony Dominion voting machines\u201d needed to be investigated.\n As recently as last week, Mr. Giuliani was on his New York City-based radio show saying that \u201cso long as you have Dominion, there is clear and present danger\u201d that election results could be rigged. He added that he had \u201cboxes of evidence to support his claims.\u201d\n Dominion has indicated that it plans to file more lawsuits. The suit against Mr. Giuliani says he acted with other prominent conservatives and news networks, including Mike Lindell, Lou Dobbs, Fox News, Fox Business, Newsmax and One America News Network.\n Mr. Clare, Dominion\u2019s lawyer, left open the possibility of litigation against Mr. Trump.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not ruling anybody out,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this lawsuit against the president\u2019s lawyer moves one step closer to the former president and understanding what his role was and wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n The threats from Dominion have prompted some conciliatory responses from conservative news outlets hoping to avoid a legal battle. This month, the American Thinker, a conservative website, posted an apologetic note saying that its reports about Dominion \u201care completely false and have no basis in fact\u201d and that \u201cit was wrong for us to publish these false statements.\u201d\n Mr. Giuliani was one of the main public faces of the effort to reverse the election results, with Mr. Trump rarely appearing in public and preferring to send out broadsides on Twitter against the democratic process.\n Dominion argues that Mr. Giuliani profited significantly from his false claims, noting that he \u201creportedly demanded $20,000 per day\u201d for his legal services to Mr. Trump and \u201ccashed in by hosting a podcast where he exploited election falsehoods to market gold coins, supplements, cigars and protection from \u2018cyberthieves.\u2019\u201d\n The lawsuit notes just how quickly and widely the lies and false narratives had spread leading up to the riot at the Capitol. \u201cOver a three-hour period on December 21, 2020, the terms \u2018dominion\u2019 and \u2018fraud\u2019 were tweeted out together by more than 2,200 users with over 8.75 million total followers,\u201d the suit says.\n The reach of the disinformation about the company brought countless threats of violence against employees, the suit claims. One employee received text messages stating: \u201cWe are already watching you. Come clean and you will live.\u201d A voice mail message to customer support said, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing back the firing squad.\u201d\n Because of these threats, Dominion has spent $565,000 on personal security, according to the lawsuit. The company claimed to have incurred $1.17 million in total expenses relating to the disinformation campaign after the election.\n \u201cGiuliani\u2019s statements,\u201d the suit states, \u201cwere calculated to \u2014 and did in fact \u2014 provoke outrage and cause Dominion enormous harm.\u201d",

        "title": "How Parler Reveals the Alarming Trajectory of Political Violence",
        "body_text": "Since the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol in Washington, right-wing extremists on social media continue to glorify violence, draw new adherents and forge fresh plans for mayhem. This ominous activity presents an urgent threat to the security and social cohesion of the United States.\n But there is another, less obvious takeaway: Experts know \u2014 or can know \u2014 an enormous amount about the nature and evolution of the threat.\n Data sleuths have combed through a 70 terabyte cache of data from Parler, the now-defunct social media platform popular among the far right. Researchers have archived and mapped millions of these ethically hacked posts, wrangled by an anonymous, purportedly Austria-based hacker. The haul \u2014 potentially bigger than the WikiLeaks data dump of the Afghan War logs and the Democratic National Committee leak, combined \u2014 includes valuable evidence and planning of further attacks, mixed in with the private data of individuals who committed no crimes (along with quite a bit of pornography). The early takeaways are terrifying: According to at least one preliminary analysis, the frequency of hashtags on Parler referencing hanging or killing duly elected members of Congress more than doubled after the November elections.\n Until the nation reckons with the self-inflicted wounds stemming from an under-regulated, unreformed social media information architecture, President Biden\u2019s calls for healing and national unity won\u2019t produce substantial, lasting results. The new administration needs a long-term plan to confront the escalating threat, as far-right insurgents migrate from one platform to the next.\n The Parler hack is the place to start. It indicates that moderation of violent, racist, anti-democratic content will increasingly lead to migration of that same hateful content. For instance, the deplatforming of Parler triggered a virtual stampede to similar forums like Gab and Rumble. Analysts have already documented Parler groups re-forming and spreading evermore hateful content on Telegram and a host of smaller platforms.\n As the Parler case study also showed, deplatforming also disappears valuable data. But extremists don\u2019t just vanish \u2014 they tumble into \u201csmaller and smaller rabbit holes,\u201d in the words of researcher Peter Singer. Those rabbit holes make up a large, growing and uncontrollable far-right media universe.\n Since a number of large tech companies stopped supporting Parler, it was resurrected in a new form \u2014 a landing page that promised a full return \u2014 on the same web hosting service that provides a platform for The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi message board. The move suggests that even if big tech giants get rid of toxic content, smaller companies will step in as safe havens.\n That could change. There are mounting calls in Congress for investigations into the role played by Parler and other social media platforms in the siege in Washington. Inaction risks the very real possibility that countries like Russia may offer themselves as a web hosting alternative for violent anti-democratic factions inside the United States: Parler has reportedly engaged in business dealings with Russian-owned tech firms.\n Deplatforming, then, must be coupled with better, faster and more comprehensive data collection and analysis. Facebook, Twitter and others must also be more transparent about preserving evidence of account takedowns, so disinformation researchers can put the pieces together for a public thirsty for accountability from Silicon Valley.\n While the tech industry must take more assertive action on moderation, policymakers must also acknowledge that the self-policing model adopted by Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon and others is broken. All sides would be better served by the adoption \u2014 and vigorous enforcement \u2014 of legal norms for online content moderation, incitement and expectations of privacy.\n In the long run, this shift will also help Silicon Valley firms manage competing expectations from major global markets, which have often instituted much more aggressive government oversight. The question for the United States is whether the future of the internet runs toward Europe\u2019s community-oriented version or Beijing\u2019s authoritarian-empowerment model.\n The threats to national security posed by this information disorder demand more open collaboration between policymakers, the tech industry and the research community. Together, they must accept the fact that the internet ecosystem of right-wing extremism is vast, and that the risk of its exponential expansion on the dark web is substantial.\n Nearly a decade ago, former C.I.A. director Leon Panetta\u2019s warning of a \u201ccyber-Pearl Harbor\u201d evoked images of a Russian, Chinese or Al Qaeda-led attack on American infrastructure. But few imagined that American democracy could be taken out by what is effectively a virtual suicide bomb, driven by millions of U.S. citizens exercising their First Amendment rights.\n The future of American democracy depends on our defusing that bomb \u2014 together.",

        "title": "Coronavirus updates: As variants spread, countries pursue new round of travel restrictions",
        "body_text": "Governments around the world \u2014 including those of the United States, Britain and New Zealand \u2014 are moving to impose stricter travel limitations in a bid to slow the spread of new coronavirus variants that experts warn are more contagious.\n President Biden confirmed Monday that he would extend a ban on travelers from Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 26 other European countries. Visitors from South Africa will be banned from entering the United States starting Saturday.\n New Zealand, which has been lauded for its handling of the pandemic, may keep its borders closed to visitors for \u201cmuch of this year,\u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.\n The new U.S. restrictions come as several countries reconsider eased travel polices amid worry over virus variants that can make people sicker, spread faster and, in some cases, compromise the effectiveness of vaccines.\n \u201cWith the pandemic worsening and more contagious variants spreading, this isn\u2019t the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,\u201d White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said during a news briefing Monday.\n Total cases in the United States top nearly 25.3 million and death tolls are inching toward 422,000 since the start of the pandemic, according to Washington Post data.\n The new travel policy is better than restrictions posed under former president Donald Trump because the list of countries is more expansive and testing is a factor, but it\u2019s still \u201cless than excellent,\u201d Tom Russo, professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, said in an interview.\n Testing is imperfect and much of the quarantining still relies on an honor system instead of a controlled site, as countries such as New Zealand and Australia have done, he said.\n \u201cThis travel ban is helpful in that it\u2019ll decrease the likelihood of variants entering the country, but it\u2019s leaky,\u201d Russo said, adding that the exception for family members to enter could be trouble. \u201cThis is better than nothing, but it\u2019s not the most rigorous policy. It\u2019s a middle-of-the road policy.\u201d\n Countries that have been more stringent about who they allow to cross their borders are now trying to cope with a new variant.\n Australia suspended its travel bubble with New Zealand on Monday for at least three days after a woman in Auckland was determined to have contracted the South African coronavirus variant. The woman had been in quarantine at an Auckland hotel, where officials think she may have contracted the virus from another quarantining person.\n New Zealand\u2019s prime minister said Tuesday that the country\u2019s borders would probably stay closed to foreign visitors for the duration of the year, citing concerns about the global vaccination rollout.\n \u201cThe rest of the world simply poses too great a risk to our health and our economy to take a risk at this stage,\u201d Ardern said at a news conference in Wellington.\n Britain, meanwhile, is set to announce Tuesday whether it will channel some new arrivals into quarantine hotels as it runs a high-stakes, real-world vaccine experiment in a bid to extend the time between doses to stretch its reserve.\n The country also announced Tuesday that it will lend its genomic expertise and capacity in tracking new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes covid-19. The program, called the New Variant Assessment Platform, will help other countries identify changes in the virus while giving early warnings of new mutations that could be a threat to Britain.\n Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement that the pandemic has shown the importance of maintaining not only the health of Britons and their neighbors, \u201cbut the health of people across the world.\u201d\n \u201cOur New Variant Assessment Platform will help us better understand this virus and how it spreads and will also boost global capacity to understand coronavirus so we\u2019re all better prepared for whatever lies ahead,\u201d he said.\n The push to help other countries combat the virus and its variants comes in the wake of Washington Post reporting that only 29 of the world\u2019s poorest countries have started coronavirus vaccinations. The startling revelation has health experts worried, as further spread of the virus can leave room for more variants to emerge, which could render vaccines less effective.\n Despite fears about vaccine rollouts in some countries, the International Monetary Fund is projecting growth for the global economy in 2021.\n The financial institution\u2019s revised 2021 forecast is driven by hopes of coronavirus vaccinations, it said in its most recent World Economic Outlook.\n In the January update, the organization projects that the global economy will grow 5.5 percent in 2021 \u2014 up 0.3 percentage point from October, credited to \u201cexpectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of activity later in the year\u201d \u2014 and 4.2 percent in 2022. For the United States, the IMF projects growth in 2021 of 5.1 percent and 2.5 percent for 2022.\n That expectation of recovery comes after a pandemic-induced collapse of the global economy during 2020, which the IMF listed as disproportionately affecting women, youths, impoverished people and contract and temporary workers. The update expects global growth contraction in 2020 to have dipped 3.5 percent, nearly 1 percentage point higher than what October\u2019s forecast projected, thanks to stronger-than-expected momentum in the second half of the year.\n \u201cAlthough recent vaccine approvals have raised hopes of a turnaround in the pandemic later this year, renewed waves and new variants of the virus pose concerns for the outlook,\u201d the report reads.\n As the vaccines bring hope of financial growth, countries across the globe are still monitoring how to best control the spread of covid-19 and its emerging variants.\n The European Union proposed a new round of travel restrictions Monday.\n Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a Twitter post that new variants spreading across member nations have influenced the new round of restrictions.\n \u201cWe need to keep safe & discourage non-essential travel,\u201d she wrote. \u201c \u2026 In parallel, we propose stronger requirements for international travellers into the EU: testing, quarantines and a future common European Passenger Locator Form.\u201d\n Germany is considering major restrictions on international air travel, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Tuesday.\n \u201cThe danger posed by numerous virus mutations forces us to consider drastic measures. That includes significantly stricter border checks, especially at borders with high-risk areas, but also reducing air travel to Germany to almost zero, as Israel is currently doing,\u201d Seehofer told the German newspaper Bild.\n Sign up for our coronavirus newsletter | Mapping the spread of the coronavirus: Across the U.S. | Worldwide | Vaccine tracker | Variants: What you need to know",

        "body_text": "(CNN) The US is once again the shark attack capital of the world in 2020. Thanks, Florida!\n Last year, the US reported 33 unprovoked shark attacks, accounting for about 58% of the total number of unprovoked shark attacks that occurred worldwide, according to the Yearly World Shark Attack Summary from the International Shark Attack File (ISAF).\n This is a decrease from 2019, when 64% of the global unprovoked bites occurred in the US.\n ISAF categorizes shark attacks by first deciding if they were provoked or unprovoked.\n \"Unprovoked attacks are defined as incidents in which an attack on a live human occurs in the shark's natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark,\" ISAF said.\n \"Provoked attacks occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way. These include instances when divers are bitten after harassing or trying to touch sharks, bites on spearfishers, bites on people attempting to feed sharks, bites occurring while unhooking or removing a shark from a fishing net and so forth.\"\n ISAF said it investigated 129 alleged shark-human interactions worldwide in 2020 -- 57 were unprovoked shark bites on humans, and 39 were provoked bites.\n Of the 33 unprovoked shark attacks in the US, 16 of them were in Florida. The state's 16 cases represent 28% of unprovoked bites worldwide.\n \"For decades, Florida has topped global charts in the number of shark bites, and this trend continued in 2020,\" ISAF said in its summary. \"However, the state saw a significant drop from its most recent five-year annual average of 30 incidents.\"\n Eight of the shark bites in Florida, or 50% of the state's total in 2020, occurred in Volusia County, according to the ISAF.\n ISAF said that while the incidence of bites both in the US and globally have been declining over time, \"2020's numbers represent a more drastic drop than would be expected.\"\n Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark research program, said that Covid-19's impact was something he and his colleagues speculated about back in March.\n According to Naylor, the pandemic hasn't necessarily caused a drop in cases -- but it has impacted researchers' ability to follow-up and confirm cases when they are reported.\n \"We typically talk to emergency room doctors and nurses to create our reports,\" Naylor said. \"However, they've been so overwhelmed with the Covid-19 response that they haven't always had time to talk to a bunch of scientists that are asking detailed questions about a shark attack.\"\n Based on its research in the last year, ISAF said the \"observed drop in shark bite incidents may have been caused by the widespread quarantines, closed beaches and minimized vacation travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n There were 13 shark-related fatalities this year, 10 of which were confirmed to be unprovoked, ISAF said in its Yearly Worldwide Shark Attack Summary.\n \"This number is above the annual global average of four unprovoked fatalities per year,\" ISAF wrote.\n But, \"despite 2020's spike in fatalities, long-term trends show a decreasing number of annual fatalities. Year-to-year variability in oceanographic, socioeconomic and meteorological conditions significantly influences the local abundance of sharks and humans in the water.\"\n Of the global fatalities, Australia saw \"a higher incidence of fatal bites than normal in 2020,\" ISAF said. The country had six confirmed fatal shark attacks.\n \"Australians are not naive when it comes to the inherent dangers of surfing and swimming,\" Naylor said. \"So I was surprised that the number was as high as it was this year.\"\n Meanwhile, in the US, there were three confirmed fatal shark attacks last year. This is an increase from 2019, when there weren't any confirmed cases in the US.\n The three fatal attacks happened in Hawaii, California and Maine. Although Florida is usually home to most of the unprovoked attacks, the state didn't have any confirmed fatalities last year.\n Most bites --  61% of the total cases in 2020 -- were related to surfing and board sports, ISAF said.\n But don't worry: \"Short-term trends still show both fatal and non-fatal bites to be decreasing,\" ISAF said.\n \"The total number of unprovoked shark bites worldwide is extremely low, given the number of people participating in aquatic recreation each year.\"\n Should you find yourself in the sea, ISAF said there are many ways to avoid a shark attack.\n ISAF encourages people \"avoid being in the water during darkness or twilight hours when sharks are most active and have a competitive sensory advantage.\"\n The organization also urges people to not enter the water if they are bleeding, because \"a shark's olfactory ability is acute.\"\n Shiny jewelry can also attract sharks, as \"the reflected light resembles the sheen of fish scales.\"\n ISAF also encouraged people to avoid wearing bright swimwear or dive gear, because \"any high contrast color apparel or gear used by a human in the water is especially visible to sharks.\"",

        "title": "Big Internet outages hit the East Coast, causing issues for Verizon, Zoom, Slack, Gmail",
        "body_text": "People across the East Coast were having trouble accessing core Internet services Tuesday morning, just as they were logging on for work and school.\n Users reported trouble loading Gmail, Slack and Zoom \u2014 apps that have become necessities to keep work-from-home life running smoothly during the coronavirus pandemic. Downdetector, which tracks reports of outages, showed widespread issues with Verizon, Google, Zoom, YouTube, Slack, Amazon Web Services and others Tuesday just before noon.\n The issue seemed to be stemming from problems with the Verizon Fios Internet service, though the company did not quickly confirm issues. Verizon\u2019s customer support team said on Twitter on Tuesday that a fiber had been cut in Brooklyn, which could possibly account for some of the issues. The support account on Twitter quickly became inundated with customers asking why their Internet was slow and bumpy.\n Internet speeds and access started gradually coming back to normal performance after about an hour of the outages. Many services were back to operating as usual by midafternoon.\n Many people took to Twitter to point out issues with their Verizon Fios service. Amazon Web Services\u2019 status page showed its service, which provides computing power to large swaths of the Internet, was experiencing an issue with an external provider. On its status page, it said that it is \u201cinvestigating connectivity issues with an internet provider, mainly affecting the East Coast of the United States, outside of the AWS Network.\u201d Slack and Google said there were no issues with their own services.\n Slack confirmed on its status page that the issues seemed to be isolated to the East Coast. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of and monitoring an internet service issue that could impact East Coast users\u2019 internet connection and ability to use Slack,\u201d the notice reads.\n Verizon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n It\u2019s tough to know how unusual the cause of the outage was until Verizon releases any information, said Lisa Pierce, vice president of research at Gartner, though she doubt the cut cable in Brooklyn was entirely to blame.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense that it would cause this big a ripple,\u201d she said.\n The outage shows the need for backup plans for businesses and schools relying so heavily on it, Pierce said. It also calls into question whether its time for Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to get more involved about minimum standards for Internet service, she said.\n Jessica Rosenworcel, the acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission, said on Twitter that the agency was working to figure out what was going on with the outage.\n \u201cWe have seen reports of internet-related outages on the East Coast, making it difficult for people to work remotely and go to school online,\u201d she tweeted.\n Internet traffic volume to Verizon dropped by about 12 percent globally during the hour-long outage, according to data from Kentik, a firm that monitors network traffic online. The Internet will never work perfectly 100 percent of the time, Kentik\u2019s director of Internet analysis Doug Madory said.\n \u201cIts almost like a living organism that has a hiccup now and then, and the flu sometimes,\u201d he said.\n The outage disrupted school districts\u2019 online teaching programs, which have become essential in the past year.\n In Northern Virginia, the outages wreaked havoc in online classrooms, bringing the virtual school day to a standstill. In Alexandria City Public Schools, which serves 16,000 and is currently offering online-only instruction, many teachers could not dial into Zoom to lead their Tuesday afternoon classes.\n And in Fairfax County Public Schools, whose 186,000 students make it the largest school system in the state, students were unable to log into virtual lessons, according to a tweet from the school division. Like neighboring Alexandria, Fairfax is pursuing 100 percent remote learning.\n \u201cFCPS is aware that many people in our region are experiencing internet outages,\u201d the school\u2019s Twitter account wrote. \u201cWe will provide updates as we know more.\u201d\n Prince William County Public Schools in Virginia tweeted just after noon Tuesday that it is \u201caware of Internet connection problems with Verizon FIOS impacting students and staff.\u201d\n Hannah Natanson contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "(CNN Business) Two of TikTok's rivals in the United States are joining forces at a time when TikTok itself now appears to be here to stay.\n On Tuesday, Clash announced it was acquiring Byte, a short-form video app launched by a cofounder of Vine, the beloved six-second video app owned and shut down by Twitter.\n Terms of the Byte deal were not disclosed.\n It's just the latest example of M&A activity and strategy shifts among TikTok rivals after a roller coaster year. TikTok appeared to be on the cusp of getting banned in the US, where it counts 100 million users, only to outlast the Trump administration, which had been pushing to shut it down in the country because its parent company is based in China.\n Dubsmash, another TikTok competitor with a similar algorithmic feed serving up entertaining videos, was acquired last month by Reddit. Meanwhile, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, which launched a TikTok clone called Reels days after then President Donald Trump said he would ban TikTok, recently admitted \"TikTok is ahead.\" He also hinted at a need for Instagram to simplify or consolidate its video product offerings.\n Clash was one of the many competitors that seemed poised to benefit from TikTok's troubles. Like TikTok, Clash lets users upload short videos set to music and offers an algorithmic feed serving up content it thinks you'd like. Byte offers a similar experience, except with hidden follower counts and likes.\n As headlines swirled about a potential TikTok ban, social media creators quickly started posting about Clash as they tried to find ways to fill a potential TikTok void. The app, which officially launched in August, saw 100,000 new downloads in just three days. To date, Clash said it's had more than 500,000 downloads.\n But with Trump now out of office, TikTok's future in the US looks less uncertain.\n The Byte app will \"continue to have the same great in-app experience\" Clash said, but it will add new ways to monetize and other features. Clash said it's working on ways for its creators to earn money directly on the platform, including from viral videos and top fans giving payments on a regular basis, which it hopes will help it stand out in a crowded market.\n The competition for social media creators is fierce. TikTok has established a fund that will top $1 billion to pay its stars, while Snapchat is giving away $1 million a day to the people who create the most entertaining videos for its Spotlight short-form video feature.",
