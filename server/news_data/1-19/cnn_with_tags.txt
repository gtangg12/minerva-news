        "title": "Biden calls for racial justice in inaugural speech as civil rights leaders demand action ",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden called for racial justice and unity in America on Wednesday, acknowledging that the nation has been deeply divided by political forces and systemic racism.\n Biden, in his inaugural speech, denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the nation needs to be repaired and healed.\n \"A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,\" Biden said. \"The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\"\n The inauguration came exactly two weeks after White rioters stormed the US Capitol in their refusal to accept former President Donald Trump's loss. Biden also is assuming the presidency on the heels of Black Lives Matter protests last year that sparked a national reckoning on racism.\n The frustrations on both sides of this political divide have been exacerbated by a Covid-19 pandemic that has killed people of color at higher rates and Trump's attempts to undermine the integrity of the election.\n Black leaders say they are counting on Biden to unify the country and enact policies that address the disparities Black people face in housing, education, jobs, health care and voter suppression.\n They also want Biden to undo the harm caused by Trump with his offensive rhetoric toward people of color and refusal to address police brutality in the Black community.\n \"Racial equity requires more than individuals in positions. It requires a set of clear outcomes,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNN. Biden \"has an obligation to reverse what happened in the last four years. And it's very doable.\"\n Biden, he said, needs to end economic insecurity in communities of color and the \"predatory\" police treatment of Black people, ensure equitable Covid-19 vaccine access, and remove social media platforms that spread hate.\n According to a CNN poll, 16% of Democrats believe that racial injustice is the most important problem facing the country right now while 65% say it is the coronavirus.\n Conversely, only 1% of Republicans say racial injustice is the most important issue with 32% choosing political divisions, 30% the economy, and 25% coronavirus.\n Some civil rights leaders say they are confident Biden will keep every promise he made during his speech Wednesday.\n Richard \"Mouse\" Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP and a lifelong friend of Biden's, said Biden earned the trust of Black people in Wilmington, Delaware, when he was a New Castle County councilor in the early 1970s who wasn't afraid to go into the community and discuss their concerns.\n \"He brought love and respect and care for our community,\" Smith said.\n Wilmington's Black community was pleased with Biden's controversial Crime Bill of 1994 because it helped rid their neighborhoods of drugs, crime and slum houses, Smith said.\n Smith said he believes Biden will lead the policy change that Black people need for equal education, jobs, environmental justice and housing equity.\n \"He has the ability to heal the country if people want the country to be healed,\" Smith said. \"He can be a game changer and put evil and racism down.\"\n Biden's inaugural speech on Wednesday reflected the same \"urgency of the moment\" with race relations as former President John F. Kennedy's speech in June 1963, said CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali. That month, JFK addressed Americans about the need to affirm civil rights for all.\n Naftali said Biden joins a small group of US presidents that acknowledged civil rights as a moral issue. Notably, former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and Kennedy were advocates for racial equality.\n \"The country is begging for a pivot on racial justice issues,\" Naftali said. \"The conversation has been started and the promise has been made and now it's time to watch how that unfolds.\"\n Maurice Mitchell, an organizer for the Movement for Black Lives and national director of the Working Families Party, said Biden is indebted to Black voters because they turned out in droves to elect him.\n Mitchell said he wants to see a \"governing agenda\" that makes investment in the Black community a priority. Racial justice, Covid-19 relief, climate justice and economic recovery are critical needs of Black Americans right now, he said.\n \"We think it's clear that the folks who delivered the defeat of Donald Trump should be first when it comes to honoring the agenda,\" Mitchell said. \"The Biden and Harris administration have an opportunity to strike a new posture when it comes to the Black agenda as it relates to Black political power.\"\n Biden's inauguration took place two days after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday which honors the legacy of the civil rights icon who died in 1968.\n King's son, Martin Luther King III, told CNN on Monday that he believes Biden and his administration should lead the country in bringing people together, and address the Covid-19 pandemic, police brutality and misconduct as well as climate change.\n \"We're going to see a new air brought in,\" he said. \"We will do better, we are much better than the behavior that we've seen exhibited over the last few days.\"\n Other Black activists also demanded a concrete plan from Biden.\n The Rev. Michael W. Waters, a civil rights activist and author of \"Something in the Water: A 21st Century Civil Rights Odyssey,\" called for a \"purposeful redirecting of resources\" to uplift marginalized and oppressed communities.\n \"Millions of people still voted for Donald Trump and real threats exist to our vision of democracy,\" Waters said. \"Biden and Harris must embrace a radical platform of equity to redeem the soul of this nation.\"\n CNN's Jennifer Agiesta contributed.",

        "title": "Joe Biden grieves Covid victims on eve of his inauguration: 'To heal, we must remember'",
        "body_text": "One of the great tragedies of the past year, as some 400,000 Americans lost their lives to Covid-19, was not only that many victims died alone -- their loved ones robbed of the chance to say goodbye -- but that the pain of that loss was whitewashed by a President who chose to minimize and deny it.\n In a somber ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial on Tuesday night that was his first stop in Washington, President-elect Joe Biden signaled that honoring that grief and the terrible toll of the last year would be at the very heart of his administration. Elected because of his empathy and his compassion for Americans, who are suffering through a confluence of crises that have created a time of great uncertainty, Biden spoke just a few words as the sun set over the National Mall, casting a rosy glow in the twilight.\n The President-elect told Americans he shared in their grief -- with his own understanding deepened by the loss of his first wife and daughter in a car accident as a young man and the loss of his son Beau to cancer at the age of 46.\n \"It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation,\" Biden said in brief remarks before 400 lights were illuminated along the edges of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, marking the more than 400,000 Americans who have died from Covid-19.\n He and his wife, Jill Biden, watched in silence, alongside Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, as the reflections of the lights glimmered in the water. Hundreds of towns, cities and communities across the country joined in the tribute, lighting up buildings from the Empire State Building in New York to the Space Needle in Seattle. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, delivered the invocation and gospel singer Yolanda Adams performed \"Hallelujah\" after Biden spoke.\n Harris spoke briefly at the memorial, noting that \"for many months, we have grieved by ourselves. Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together.\"\n \"Though we may be physically separated, we, the American people, are united in spirit and my abiding hope, my abiding prayer, is that we emerge from this ordeal with a new wisdom: to cherish simple moments, to imagine new possibilities and to open our hearts just a little bit more to one another,\" Harris said.\n The President-elect arrived in Washington, DC, on Tuesday for the start of his inaugural ceremonies at a dark moment in American history, preparing to take his oath of office as the US passes 400,000 coronavirus deaths and is more divided than at any time since the Civil War.\n As he departed for the nation's capital earlier in the day, Biden gave an emotional farewell to his home state of Delaware, his voice breaking at times as he thanked the state's residents for believing in him and standing with him throughout his career.\n \"I'll always be a proud son of the state of Delaware,\" Biden said at the Delaware National Guard headquarters in New Castle County. \"Excuse the emotion,\" he said, tears streaming down his face, \"but when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart and the hearts of all of us -- all the Bidens. We love you all. You've been there for us in the good and the bad.\"\n He gave a moving tribute to his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46, stating that he had hoped to see his son become president one day.\n \"We should be introducing him as president,\" he said.\n The President-elect also noted the historical arc of his career witnessing the civil rights struggle as well as signs of progress in the United States. He said he came home to Wilmington, Delaware, from law school after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated -- inspired by the turmoil to become a public defender. In 2009, he made the journey to Washington with Barack Obama, who became the nation's first Black president. And he is returning to Washington, DC, this week \"to meet a Black woman of South Asian descent, to be sworn in as President and vice president of the United States. That's America,\" he said Tuesday.\n The nation's continuing struggles for equality and racial justice also drew Biden into the 2020 presidential race. He has said he decided to seek the highest office after watching President Donald Trump's dismissive handling of the deadly White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he said there were \"very fine people on both sides.\"\n Now intent on healing a deeply fractured country, Biden's task has never seemed more daunting after Trump incited a riot with his lies that the presidential election was stolen, which led an armed mob to storm the Capitol on January 6 and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the mob was \"provoked\" by Trump, in a remarkable final rebuke of the President after four years in which Republicans have often stayed silent in the face of the President's misdeeds.\n \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"They were provoked by the President and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.\"\n But McConnell noted that democracy had prevailed, even in the face of violent threats, and that Congress carried out its duties by certifying the election: \"We'll have a safe and successful inaugural right here on the very front of the Capitol,\" he said.\n McConnell argued that the November election \"did not hand any side a mandate for sweeping ideological change,\" given the closely divided Senate and House. But he said Republicans would seek common ground with Democrats as Biden takes office: \"We are to pursue bipartisan agreement everywhere we can, and check and balance one another, respectfully, where we must.\"\n Biden had hoped to infuse his arrival in Washington with a nostalgic twist by riding the rails from his home in Delaware, but that was deemed too much of a security risk at a time when the nation is facing threats from within. Instead the President-elect will arrive in a capital city Tuesday that has been transformed into a fortress with more than 20,000 National Guard troops securing the streets and protecting buildings that symbolize the enduring history of democracy in this country, which has seemed very much in peril in recent weeks.\n CNN's Pentagon team reported Tuesday afternoon that 12 National Guard members have been removed from inauguration duty as federal authorities vet those who are stationed in Washington, DC, to secure the ceremonies. Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson told CNN that two of the individuals were flagged due to \"inappropriate\" comments and texts, while another 10 were removed for questionable behavior found during the vetting. Col. Michael Dugas, provost marshal of the National Guard Bureau, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday that at least 17,000 members have been vetted so far.\n With the twice-impeached Trump still prowling the White House -- fuming about his election grievances and upcoming trial in the US Senate as he prepares to leave for Palm Beach, Florida, before the new President is sworn in Wednesday -- Biden hopes to shift the nation's attention to his agenda for halting the Covid-19 pandemic, accelerating the troubled vaccine rollout and rebuilding a struggling economy that has left millions unemployed.\n The President-elect has been working on the inauguration speech that he will deliver at the US Capitol on Wednesday, which will mark the beginning of his effort to unite the country after four dark and tumultuous years under Trump, who is skipping the ceremony.\n The Covid-19 pandemic had already forced organizers to reimagine the day's ceremonies, including the traditional swearing-in of the new president on the West Front of the Capitol. Those plans were complicated by the January 6 siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters, who shattered glass and ravaged the historic building, forcing the Secret Service to keep plans in flux to ensure that traditional transfer of power will transpire peacefully and safely. In that unnerving environment, the military has been intensely vetting the National Guard troops to make sure there are no bad actors who would do harm during this week's ceremonies.\n With Trump's decision to duck out of Washington Wednesday morning to fly to Florida, he has dispensed with both with the traditional welcome of the incoming President and first lady at the North Portico and the joint ride over to the Capitol for the ceremony.\n Instead, Trump took the unusual step of asking staff to arrange a sendoff of his own at Joint Base Andrews, suggesting that he'd like to see a red carpet, a Color Guard and a 21-gun-salute.\n On Wednesday, Biden will attend church at St. Matthews in Washington, DC, with all four top congressional leaders from both parties. The President-elect will also lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joined by former President Barack Obama and and first lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush, and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n CNN's Barbara Starr, Oren Liebermann and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden's State Department pick reaches out for GOP allies as he promises policy shifts",
        "body_text": "Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick to lead the State Department, indicated to Congress Tuesday that he plans to emphatically redirect the trajectory of US foreign policy after four years of the Trump administration, rebuilding and reengaging alliances to confront transnational threats ranging from Russia and North Korea to climate change.\n Blinken made especially clear in his Tuesday confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that if confirmed, he aims to reengage with Congress in a bipartisan fashion, an implicit criticism of his predecessor's combative relationship with some lawmakers.\n Blinken offered praise for some GOP lawmakers, agreed with their assessments of Iran, Taiwan and Beijing's obfuscation about the Covid-19 pandemic and endorsed President Donald Trump's belief that the US needs to take a tough line on China.\n \"I also believe that President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China. I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, and I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy,\" Blinken said.\n Blinken was equally measured about the Trump administration's Middle East policy.\n Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the US embassy to the city. Both moves were controversial, as both Israelis and Palestinians claim the holy city as their capital. The status of Jerusalem is such a thorny issue that international consensus was to leave discussion about it to the end of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Previous negotiations had included the idea that each side would claim a different part of the city as its capital.\n Asked if he recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Blinken said, \"Yes.\" And asked if the US embassy would remain in Jerusalem, Blinken again said, \"Yes.\"\n And he praised the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and Gulf and other Muslim nations.\n But he indicated that he believes the Trump administration policies may have helped push Israelis and Palestinians farther from a peace deal than they have been in decades. He stressed that a \"two-state solution, however distant it may appear, is still the best and probably the only way to truly assure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state and of course to give the Palestinians the state to which they are entitled.\"\n \"The challenge, of course, is how to move forward on that at a time when ... it seems more distant than it's ever been, at least since Oslo,\" Blinken said. Blinken said he hopes the Abraham Accords create progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. \"I hope that might, also might create a greater sense of confidence and security in Israel as it considers its relationship with the Palestinians,\" Blinken said, \"because whether we like or not, whether they like or not, it's not just going away.\"\n Lawmakers raised concerns about Iran, Taiwan, Cuba, Turkey, Russia, the Covid-19 pandemic and other issues in a hearing that some lawmakers attended virtually. Many of the questions touched on areas in which the Trump administration has taken a slew of significant 11th hour decisions -- policy steps that it did not appear to have the political will to take until it was leaving and wouldn't have to bear the consequences, steps that are widely seen as an effort to complicate matters for the incoming Biden team.\n Blinken reiterated Biden's commitment to Taiwan but made clear the incoming administration would reexamine Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's last-minute move to loosen the rules governing how US officials engage with their Taiwanese counterparts.\n \"As you know, some regulations were promulgated by the outgoing secretary state we're going to take a hard look at those pursuant to the Taiwan Assurance Act, and we will, we will look at that,\" Blinken said. \"But the commitment to Taiwan is something that we hold to very strongly.\"\n Blinken threaded a similar needle on Cuba. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio asked whether a Biden administration would keep in place a recent policy that forbids financial transactions with any Cuban business that has ties to a massive, military-controlled holding company. Rubio strongly supported Trump's move to undo the Obama administration's opening of relations with Cuba.\n \"In terms of the objectives that you cite, that makes very good sense to me,\" Blinken said. \"I think the question is, and I don't know enough to, to form a full judgment as to whether it is in fact, achieving those objectives and are there any other costs or consequences that we might want to look at.\"\n And asked about Trump's acting defense secretary suddenly announcing plans to drawdown forces in Afghanistan in November, Blinken said that \"the President-elect wants to make sure that even as we pull back our forces that we retain the capacity to deal with any reemergence.\" He made clear that the Biden team hasn't been given much visibility on the agreement Pompeo and the Trump administration negotiated with the Taliban, which nevertheless has continued to wreak violence on Afghans.\n The Biden team will \"look closely at what's been negotiated there ... to understand fully what commitments were made and not made by the Taliban,\" Blinken said. He added, \"I don't believe any agreement is sustainable without protecting gains by women and girls over the last 20 years.\"\n Blinken also expressed deep concern about Pompeo's January 10 move to designate Yemen's Houthis as a terrorist organization, a step that many say will result in even greater levels of starvation and humanitarian suffering, and harm efforts to reach a peace agreement.\n \"My concern, my deep concern about the designation that was made, is that at least on its surface it seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Houthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table, while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it,\" Blinken said.\n The Biden administration will \"immediately review the policy to make sure that what we are doing is not impeding the provision of humanitarian assistance even under these difficult circumstances,\" Blinken said. And he confirmed that the Biden administration will end support for Saudi-led campaign in Yemen.\n \"The Houthis bear significant responsibility for what's happened in Yemen, but the way the campaign has been conducted has also contributed significantly to that situation and so our support should end,\" he said.\n Blinken is one of several national security nominees to appear before Senate confirmation hearings Tuesday the day before Biden's swearing in -- a signal of the new President's desire to ensure there are no national security gaps after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters and amid ongoing concerns about extremist violence.\n Lawmakers on both sides asked about the most concerning major external threats to the US, with several mentioning strong concern about Iran. Trump left the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration and instituted a maximum pressure campaign. As the President leaves office, Iran is closer to gaining a nuclear weapon than it was when he entered.\n Blinken made clear the Biden administration feels the world was safer with the nuclear deal in place.\n \"President-elect Biden is committed to the proposition that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon,\" Blinken said. \"And we share, I know, that goal across this committee, an Iran with a nuclear weapon or on the threshold of having one with the capacity to build one on short order would be in Iran that is even more dangerous than it already is.\"\n \"In my judgment, the JCPOA for whatever its limitations, was succeeding on its own terms in blocking Iran's pathways to producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon on short order,\" Blinken said.\n China was another major focus of concern. Lawmakers pointed to Beijing's move to crush democracy in Hong Kong, its predatory lending practices, industrial espionage, and its press to tout its authoritarian model of governance as a more stable alternative to democracy. More than one lawmaker got Blinken's agreement that China is engaged in genocide of its Uyghur Muslim population.\n \"As we look at China, there is no doubt that it poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the United States, in terms of our interests the interest of the American people,\" Blinken said. \"There are, as I see it, rising adversarial aspects to the relationship. Certainly, competitive ones, and still some cooperative ones, when it is in our mutual interest.\"\n \"I think, as we're thinking about how to deal with China, I think this is reflected in the work that the committee has done, we have to start by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness,\" Blinken said, using the opportunity to gently point to contrasts with the Trump administration.\n A Biden administration would start by \"not denigrating our allies,\" Blinken said, \"leading international institutions, not pulling back and ceding,\" standing up for human rights and democracy, and making \"investments as necessary in our military.\"\n Blinken indicated Biden will chart a different course on Russia as well, pushing to renew negotiations on the New START nuclear arms treaty, which expires in weeks. And he took a swipe at President Vladimir Putin, who ordered that his leading critic -- Alexey Navalny -- be jailed on his return to Russia on Sunday.\n It's extraordinary, Blinken said, \"how frightened Putin seems to be of one man. I think that speaks volumes.\" While the massive cyber hack of government agencies widely attributed to Moscow didn't come up in questioning, Blinken said that committee members, particularly Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, \"have been very prescient when it comes to the challenge posed to us by Russia, there's a lot to be discussed and talked about there but this is very high on the agenda for an incoming administration.\"\n Biden will continue some policies, Blinken said, including continuing \"to support the arming and training of Ukraine's military, the continued provision to Ukraine of lethal defensive assistance, and indeed, of the training program as well,\" Blinken said. \"I very much agree with you that this has actually been a real, a real success.\"\n Blinken outlined three priorities in his opening remarks -- the first being to breathe life into a State Department hollowed out after four years of the Trump administration and undermined by Trump's attack on American democracy.\n Blinken also emphasized the need to revitalize American diplomacy after international distrust and disgust engendered by Trump's policies. He also discussed Biden's desire to restore the administration's traditional foreign policy partnership with Congress, where lawmakers often complained of being shut out and ignored by Pompeo.\n And where Pompeo stressed \"swagger,\" Blinken told lawmakers that \"humility and confidence should be the flip sides of America's leadership coin.\"\n \"Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad,\" Blinken said in prepared remarks. \"But we'll also act with confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good.\"\n Blinken highlighted transnational challenges that will require international partnerships, from defeating the Covid-19 pandemic to dealing with China; standing up for human rights; reaffirming the value and strength of democratic governance; countering threats from Iran, Russia and North Korea; and taking on \"the existential threat posed by climate change.\"\n The 58-year-old also struck a personal note in his remarks at the top of the hearing, introducing himself to the public and the committee, where he once worked for six years and senators know him well. The father of two described his pride in his family's history of service, saying he sees it as \"payment on the debt our family owes to the nation that gave us refuge and extraordinary opportunities across generations.\"\n This story has been updated with additional details Tuesday.\n CNN's Nicky Robertson and Nicholas Neville contributed to this report",

        "body_text": "A US Army soldier was arrested Tuesday on terrorism charges after federal prosecutors said he allegedly attempted to assist ISIS' efforts to plan attacks on targets in New York City and on US soldiers in the Middle East.\n Cole Bridges, a 20-year-old private, allegedly made the attempts while communicating with someone he believed to be associated with the terror group, prosecutors said. He has been charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and one count of attempting to murder US military service members, both of which carry up to 20 years in prison.\n Bridges, who is from Stow, Ohio, was arrested in Georgia, where he was based at Fort Stewart. He is set to have a court hearing on Thursday.\n CNN is attempting to reach Bridges' attorney for comment.\n An Army spokesperson said such a crime would be a betrayal.\n \"The Army is tasked with the duty and responsibility to protect our Nation from its adversaries, and Soldiers make incredible sacrifices in service to that cause. When any Soldier attempts to provide sensitive or classified information to an adversary, it is a betrayal of the oath they swore to the United States and the duty owed to their fellow Soldiers,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n \"This Soldier's recent arrest was the result of a joint investigation between the Army and the FBI, and the Army will continue to work closely with Federal authorities in this case,\" the spokesperson continued.\n Prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint that in October, Stewart began communicating with an FBI covert employee online who was posing as an ISIS supporter in contact with ISIS fighters in the Middle East. Prosecutors allege Bridges gave training and guidance to purported ISIS fighters, as well as advice about possible targets in New York City, such as the 9/11 Memorial.\n Bridges also allegedly gave the FBI employee portions of a US Army training manual and \"guidance about military combat tactics, for use by ISIS,\" the release said.\n Prosecutors said that in December, Bridges began supplying the covert FBI employee with \"instructions for the purported ISIS fighters on how to attack U.S. forces in the Middle East,\" including diagramming specific military maneuvers to help ISIS fighters \"maximize the lethality of attacks on US troops,\" which included advice on fortifying an ISIS encampment by wiring certain buildings with explosives to kill American troops, according to the release.\n \"As alleged, Cole Bridges betrayed the oath he swore to defend the United States by attempting to provide ISIS with tactical military advice to ambush and kill his fellow service members,\" Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss said in the release.\n \"Our troops risk their lives for our country, but they should never face such peril at the hands of one of their own,\" Strauss said.\n This story has been updated with comments from an Army spokesperson.\n CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden's defense secretary pick pledges to uphold 'principle of civilian control of the military' ",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for defense secretary, retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, pledged on Tuesday that he will \"uphold the principle of civilian control of the military\" if confirmed to the post.\n The vow comes as Austin must overcome objections from some lawmakers about allowing a recently retired general to assume the top civilian post at the Pentagon. Austin would be the first African American to run the department, but to win confirmation he will first need to be granted a waiver from a law requiring a secretary to wait seven years from active-duty service before taking the job.\n Biden's defense secretary pick addressed those concerns directly at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, saying, \"If confirmed, I will carry out the mission of the Department of Defense, always with the goal to deter war and ensure our nation's security, and I will uphold the principle of civilian control of the military, as intended.\"\n Austin, who retired in 2016, has been reaching out to top House and Senate lawmakers who will have to agree to pass legislation to grant the waiver, something granted only twice before in history, including for James Mattis to run President Donald Trump's Pentagon in 2017.\n \"I understand and respect the reservations some of you have expressed about having another recently retired general at the head of the Department of Defense,\" he said during the hearing. \"The safety and security of our democracy demands competent civilian control of our armed forces, the subordination of military power to the civil.\"\n Austin went on to say, \"I spent my entire life committed to that principle. In war and in peace I implemented the policies of civilians elected and appointed over me, leaders like Secretary (Leon) Panetta. I know that being a member of the president's Cabinet -- a political appointee -- requires a different perspective and unique duties from a career in uniform.\"\n The hearing comes as congressional Democratic leaders are pressing for quick confirmation of Biden's Cabinet and other key administration officials. That timeline may be complicated, however, by the fact that the Senate will soon have to begin an impeachment trial after the House voted to impeach Trump in his final days in office for inciting a deadly siege on the US Capitol after a joint session had convened to affirm Biden's Electoral College victory.\n Another hurdle that could slow down the confirmation process for Austin is that he will, in effect, have to win two votes: one from both chambers of Congress to grant the waiver, and another from the Senate to confirm him for the position. The House is set to vote on Thursday on the waiver.\n During his Tuesday hearing, Austin pledged to fight to rid the Department of Defense of \"racists and extremists.\"\n \"We also owe our people a working environment free of discrimination, hate and harassment. If confirmed, I will fight hard to stamp out sexual assault and to rid our ranks of racists and extremists.\"\n \"The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies,\" said Austin. \"But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.\"\n Austin will no longer testify before the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, as the planned hearing \"to discuss civilian control of the military\" has been canceled in favor of a closed-door meeting with lawmakers, according to a panel aide.\n The reason for the change, the aide told CNN on Tuesday, was that the House Armed Services Committee will not be formed for the new Congress in time.\n \"The committee cannot formally organize until leadership from both the majority and minority have named the full list of members. It has become clear that full committee membership will not be finalized before Thursday's scheduled hearing to discuss civilian control of the military with the Secretary-designate Lloyd Austin,\" committee aide Monica Matoush said Tuesday. \"As such, we cannot yet convene our committee organization meeting or formally conduct committee business like a hearing. Once members have been named and the committee has been organized, we will proceed.\"\n The closed meeting with House lawmakers could help expedite Austin's nomination but also risks alienating those who wanted to hear him testify before voting on the waiver.\n Austin has told Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat who's the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, that he is willing to answer questions and testify publicly about the waiver to reassure lawmakers about his belief in civilian control.\n Smith has consistently voiced support for Austin but also said he would like to hear him testify.\n CNN's Michael Conte contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden calls for racial justice in inaugural speech as civil rights leaders demand action ",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden called for racial justice and unity in America on Wednesday, acknowledging that the nation has been deeply divided by political forces and systemic racism.\n Biden, in his inaugural speech, denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the nation needs to be repaired and healed.\n \"A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,\" Biden said. \"The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\"\n The inauguration came exactly two weeks after White rioters stormed the US Capitol in their refusal to accept former President Donald Trump's loss. Biden also is assuming the presidency on the heels of Black Lives Matter protests last year that sparked a national reckoning on racism.\n The frustrations on both sides of this political divide have been exacerbated by a Covid-19 pandemic that has killed people of color at higher rates and Trump's attempts to undermine the integrity of the election.\n Black leaders say they are counting on Biden to unify the country and enact policies that address the disparities Black people face in housing, education, jobs, health care and voter suppression.\n They also want Biden to undo the harm caused by Trump with his offensive rhetoric toward people of color and refusal to address police brutality in the Black community.\n \"Racial equity requires more than individuals in positions. It requires a set of clear outcomes,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNN. Biden \"has an obligation to reverse what happened in the last four years. And it's very doable.\"\n Biden, he said, needs to end economic insecurity in communities of color and the \"predatory\" police treatment of Black people, ensure equitable Covid-19 vaccine access, and remove social media platforms that spread hate.\n According to a CNN poll, 16% of Democrats believe that racial injustice is the most important problem facing the country right now while 65% say it is the coronavirus.\n Conversely, only 1% of Republicans say racial injustice is the most important issue with 32% choosing political divisions, 30% the economy, and 25% coronavirus.\n Some civil rights leaders say they are confident Biden will keep every promise he made during his speech Wednesday.\n Richard \"Mouse\" Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP and a lifelong friend of Biden's, said Biden earned the trust of Black people in Wilmington, Delaware, when he was a New Castle County councilor in the early 1970s who wasn't afraid to go into the community and discuss their concerns.\n \"He brought love and respect and care for our community,\" Smith said.\n Wilmington's Black community was pleased with Biden's controversial Crime Bill of 1994 because it helped rid their neighborhoods of drugs, crime and slum houses, Smith said.\n Smith said he believes Biden will lead the policy change that Black people need for equal education, jobs, environmental justice and housing equity.\n \"He has the ability to heal the country if people want the country to be healed,\" Smith said. \"He can be a game changer and put evil and racism down.\"\n Biden's inaugural speech on Wednesday reflected the same \"urgency of the moment\" with race relations as former President John F. Kennedy's speech in June 1963, said CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali. That month, JFK addressed Americans about the need to affirm civil rights for all.\n Naftali said Biden joins a small group of US presidents that acknowledged civil rights as a moral issue. Notably, former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and Kennedy were advocates for racial equality.\n \"The country is begging for a pivot on racial justice issues,\" Naftali said. \"The conversation has been started and the promise has been made and now it's time to watch how that unfolds.\"\n Maurice Mitchell, an organizer for the Movement for Black Lives and national director of the Working Families Party, said Biden is indebted to Black voters because they turned out in droves to elect him.\n Mitchell said he wants to see a \"governing agenda\" that makes investment in the Black community a priority. Racial justice, Covid-19 relief, climate justice and economic recovery are critical needs of Black Americans right now, he said.\n \"We think it's clear that the folks who delivered the defeat of Donald Trump should be first when it comes to honoring the agenda,\" Mitchell said. \"The Biden and Harris administration have an opportunity to strike a new posture when it comes to the Black agenda as it relates to Black political power.\"\n Biden's inauguration took place two days after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday which honors the legacy of the civil rights icon who died in 1968.\n King's son, Martin Luther King III, told CNN on Monday that he believes Biden and his administration should lead the country in bringing people together, and address the Covid-19 pandemic, police brutality and misconduct as well as climate change.\n \"We're going to see a new air brought in,\" he said. \"We will do better, we are much better than the behavior that we've seen exhibited over the last few days.\"\n Other Black activists also demanded a concrete plan from Biden.\n The Rev. Michael W. Waters, a civil rights activist and author of \"Something in the Water: A 21st Century Civil Rights Odyssey,\" called for a \"purposeful redirecting of resources\" to uplift marginalized and oppressed communities.\n \"Millions of people still voted for Donald Trump and real threats exist to our vision of democracy,\" Waters said. \"Biden and Harris must embrace a radical platform of equity to redeem the soul of this nation.\"\n CNN's Jennifer Agiesta contributed.",

        "title": "Netflix crosses 200 million subscribers milestone",
        "body_text": "Netflix \u2014 which was founded in 1997 as a rental company that sent you DVDs in the mail \u2014 crossed a major milestone on Tuesday, further solidifying itself as one of the most influential companies in Hollywood.\n The streaming service said it now has more than 200 million subscribers globally, after adding 8.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2020, beating its own expectations.\n Netflix's fourth quarter profit in 2020 was $542 million, down from $587 million in the year-earlier quarter. Its revenue jumped 21%, to $6.6 billion. The company's stock jumped as much as 12% in after-hours trading following the company's earnings.\n \"2020 was an incredibly difficult year with extraordinary loss for so many families, new restrictions that none of us have ever had to live with before and great uncertainty,\" the company said on Tuesday. \"We're enormously grateful that in these uniquely challenging times we've been able to provide our members around the world with a source of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business.\"\n Netflix reported that for the full year 2020, the company brought in 37 million new subscribers, a 31% jump from the year before. But another of its announcements may have helped boost Netflix's stock on Tuesday: The company said it is \"very close to being sustainably [free cash flow] positive.\"\n \"For the full year 2021, we currently anticipate free cash flow will be around break even,\" the company said. \"We believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.\" This is good news for investors who have worried about the company's debt, content spending and overall growth going forward.\n Netflix added that as it generates excess cash, it intends to \"maintain $10 billion to $15 billion in gross debt\" but will \"explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks\" as it's done in prior years.\n Netflix (NFLX) also addressed another concerning aspect of its business: rising competition.\n 2020 was a significant year for streaming, with the launches of new streaming services like NBCUniversal's Peacock, Discovery+ and HBO Max from CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia. Not to mention, the huge leap Disney+ made by notching more than 80 million subscribers.\n As the longtime king of the streaming world, Netflix seems unfazed by the proliferation of rivals.\n \"It's a great time to be a consumer of entertainment. There are a wealth of options ranging from linear TV to video gaming to user generated content,\" the company said. \"Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment. This past year is a testament to this approach.\"\n The company even went out of its way to say that even though Disney+ had a \"massive first year,\" Netflix still \"recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history.\"",

        "title": "Finally I can unclench my jaw and exhale",
        "body_text": "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \"OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.\" Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nI can finally feel myself beginning to unclench my jaw, drop my shoulders, and exhale.\n The past four years have felt like a lifetime. That 2016 satirical newspaper front page imagining how bad a Donald Trump presidency would be? It radically underestimated things. The Boston Globe predicted mass deportations, riots in the streets, markets sinking in a trade war, and US soldiers refusing orders to kill ISIS families.\n We got the deportations and riots plus migrant children ripped from their parents' arms and put in cages, possibly never to see their mothers and fathers again; the end of asylum as we knew it; a catastrophic drop in refugee resettlements; the xenophobic ban on travel from several majority-Muslim countries.\n The markets didn't crash because of a trade war; instead, job losses reached their highest since the Great Depression thanks to the Trump administration's stunning mishandling of a global pandemic that in less than a year has killed more than 400,000 Americans.\n US soldiers weren't ordered to murder the family members of ISIS militants; instead, the President pardoned convicted war criminals, including four Blackwater mercenaries who were found guilty in federal court for their role in the massacre of 14 unarmed civilians in Baghdad, including two little boys.\n Riots in the street? Worse -- Trump brought us an insurrection at the US Capitol. And then, having reinstated the federal death penalty in 2019 after a nearly two-decade pause, he spent his final weeks in office on a killing spree, executing a staggering number of federal death row inmates -- in all, 13 in six months; the most on any president's watch in 120 years -- just because he could.\n Americans who care about human rights and basic decency found our psyches and our souls pummeled by this barrage of unfathomable cruelty and wrongdoing -- in a near-constant state of emotional distress, vacillating from fear to rage to despair. Then we saw the President lie endlessly and simply refuse to take responsibility for any bad act or mistake. It was crazy-making to be told, again and again, that what you saw with your own eyes wasn't  happening.\n Donald Trump kept many of us agitated and insecure as no president in living memory had. He released torrents of tweets -- with their random capitalizations and exclamation points -- instead of making policy statements or addressing the nation in the careful (and edited) ways of normal presidents.\n He presided over a revolving roster of senior level advisors and Cabinet members of varying levels of competence and capability. But he also surrounded himself with grifters, criminals, toadies, quacks  and a number of men who seemed pulled straight out of a bad mob movie, each less qualified to serve than the last, and better described as \"characters\" in his \"show\" than legitimate professionals.\n He seemed to make significant decisions based on what he saw on Fox News, or under the advisement of his eldest daughter and her husband, both or whom he named as official presidential advisors despite their complete lack of experience in politics, and the fact that both have spent most of their adult lives working only for their own families.\n Remember when the President's lawyer and fixer paid off a porn star to cover up the President's alleged affair, and then went to federal prison for fraud and campaign finance violations, scandals that were quickly eclipsed by other, worse scandals in the Trump administration ... and then rapidly forgotten?\n It often all felt unreal, and it would have all been very funny if Trump hadn't also had all the power America gives to its executive, including the nuclear codes.\n So many Americans are living with a kind of collective trauma after this presidency.  And we have no idea when or whether the echo of Trump will fade  -- we have already seen the damage and, on Jan. 6 in particular, the real danger he has injected into our country.\n But while the psychological, cultural, and political ramifications of his administration will linger, the man himself is out of the White House -- and so is his entire unfunny clown show. That brings a lot of relief, and the chance to begin a national recovery.\n I was not a Biden supporter in the Democratic primary; frankly, he was pretty far down my list of ideal candidates. But with Biden as the president-elect and Kamala Harris as the incoming vice president, I'm surprised at how enthusiastic I feel.\n They are promising to swiftly undo many of the worst of Trump's acts, from increasing refugee resettlement and repairing our asylum program to lifting deadly and misogynist rules that make it harder for women in developing nations to get contraception and basic reproductive health care.\n On a more basic level, they won't be evil and embarrassing buffoons making a mockery of America on the international stage and damaging all that is good about our nation here at home.\n Joe Biden does not have extraordinary magical powers or radical ambitions; he will not revolutionize the nation overnight, and he couldn't even if he wanted to. But as his inauguration gets closer by the minute, an unfamiliar feeling grows ever larger: Hope.\n With Biden and Harris in the White House, we will see restoration, and then we can press forward for progress and betterment -- a much more gratifying position to be in than in a defensive crouch, trying to fend off the very worst attacks.\n The news out of the White House will be slower, and almost certainly more boring. Adults will be in charge again -- too late for so many, but hopefully in time to speed up a vaccine roll-out and save thousands of lives. Simple values like honesty, accountability, decency and empathy will return.\n America under Biden will be a place where progressives can push for what we want, and achieve some of what we need. It will be a place where all Americans are valued, not just those who voted for our new  president. It will be a place where we can fight in forward motion.\n This feeling -- hope -- is a sweet and powerful thing.",

Kelly Loeffler -- is close to being finalized, a league spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday.\n The news of the sale was first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n Loeffler, who lost to Rev. Raphael Warnock in the historic Georgia senatorial runoff earlier this month, is a Republican who previously caused controversy in the WNBA by saying she doesn't support the Black Lives Matter movement. She also called for the depoliticization of professional sports.\n Warnock is scheduled to be sworn in as a US senator on Wednesday.\n \"As it relates to the Atlanta Dream, we understand a sale of the franchise is close to being finalized,\" a WNBA spokesperson told CNN in an email. \"Once the sale negotiation is concluded, additional information will be provided.\"\n The Atlanta Dream did not have a comment, according to a team spokesperson. CNN has also reached out to Loeffler's representatives, but has not heard back.\n Last summer Dream players released a unified signed statement -- over Loeffler's objection -- saying they supported the Black Lives Matter movement.\n Despite pressure to sell her share in the team, Loeffler has refused to do so in the past, which emboldened WNBA players to campaign against her. Several Atlanta Dream players were photographed wearing \"Vote Warnock\" shirts in the days leading up to the election earlier this month.\n Warnock's victory meant he became the first Black US senator from Georgia. He was also is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the US Senate in more than 20 years.\n NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted on January 6 that he was thinking of putting together an ownership group to purchase the Dream.",

        "title": "A 99-million-year-old beetle shines light on the evolution of glowing insects",
        "body_text": "Bioluminescent insects have long fascinated scientists, but little is known about how these animals got their light abilities. A 99-million-year-old beetle recently discovered by researchers, however, unlocks a piece of the evolutionary puzzle, according to a study published in The Royal Society journal.\n The beetle, known by its Latin name Cretophengodes, was found fossilized in a piece of amber in northern Myanmar. The tropical location was full of insect life during the Cretaceous period, said study author Chenyang Cai, an associate professor at Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.\n \"We even have records of dinosaur remains from the same amber deposit that Cretophengodes was found in,\" Cai said.\n Each of the insect's antennae had 12 segments branching off it, but what caught Cai's eye was the light organ nestled into its abdomen. That organ gave the beetle bioluminescence, the ability for a living organism to produce its own light, Cai said.\n Modern-day insects such as fireflies and glowworms are part of Elateroidea, the same superfamily animal classification that the beetle is from.\n Cretophengodes is one of the oldest bioluminescent beetles to be found, so it gives researchers insight into the early evolutionary building blocks of this superfamily.\n It's not known why the beetles were bioluminescent, but based on relatives, Cai speculated that the function was used as a defense mechanism. Today, some young beetle larvae in the same superfamily have used light to protect themselves from predators, and adults have been known to use their light abilities to attract mates.\n Modern-day fireflies produce light through a chemical reaction in their body. When a series of ingredients including the compound luciferin and the enzyme luciferase interact with oxygen, it produces a flickering light.\n Study author Erik Tihelka, a paleobiology student at the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, said he wants to spend time researching what predators drove the evolution of bioluminescence in Cretaceous beetles. His hypotheses have included birdlike dinosaurs and digging animals that fed on the forest floor.\n \"I find it fascinating that we may owe the glow of fireflies to an ancient predator-prey arms race with the dinosaurs,\" Tihelka said.",

        "title": "US surpasses 400,000 deaths from Covid-19",
        "body_text": "The United States has reported at least 400,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University as of Tuesday afternoon.\n That's more than the number of Americans who died in World War I, Vietnam War and the Korean War combined, and nearly as many Americans who died in World War II. It's far higher than any other country's Covid-19 death toll.\n The pandemic's death toll has risen sharply in increments of 100,000 since the first coronavirus death in the United States was reported February 29 in Washington state. (Later in the spring, two earlier deaths in California were posthumously confirmed to be from Covid-19.)\n \u2022 84 days after the first recorded death, the US surpassed 100,000 deaths on May 23, 2020.\n \u2022 121 days later, the US surpassed 200,000 deaths on September 21, 2020.\n \u2022 84 days later, the US surpassed 300,000 deaths on December 14, 2020.\n \u2022 36 days later, on January 19, 2021, the US topped 400,000 deaths.\n Those who've died were in focus Tuesday evening as President-elect Joe Biden, one day ahead of his inauguration in the nation's capital, attended a lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial's reflecting pool to honor Covid-19 victims.\n \"To heal, we must remember,\" Biden said. \"And it's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation.\"\n Biden's inaugural committee invited cities and towns across the country to join in by illuminating buildings and ringing church bells \"in a national moment of unity and remembrance.\"\n All of this comes almost a year after the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in the US. And it comes after brutal surges in recent weeks, during which the US saw hundreds of thousands of new cases daily and hospitalization and daily deaths hit all-time highs.\n The US has recorded an average of 3,237 Covid-19 deaths a day over the last seven days -- just below the pandemic's peak average of 3,377 reached on January 13. And more than 123,800 Covid-19 patients were reported to be in US hospitals Monday, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n While that hospitalization number is down from a January 6 peak of 132,474, hospitals and health care workers across the country are still under tremendous pressure. In Georgia, one hospital was so full it had to treat patients in hallways and ambulances, an official there told CNN affiliate WSB.\n In Texas, the city of Laredo has run out of ICU beds and sent an emergency message to residents urging them to stay home, city spokeswoman Noraida Negron said. Over the weekend, the city's hospitals were diverting patients to facilities in other areas.\n \"We had no beds whatsoever,\" Negron said.\n Vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will hold an emergency meeting next week to discuss progress in administering doses, safety, testing in children, and studies on effectiveness.\n The panel has also scheduled a time slot for a vaccine manufacturer but hasn't added the company's name. Johnson & Johnson is expected to report by the end of the month on its last phase of clinical trials for its vaccine.\n Across the US, more than 10.5 million people have received at least the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, about 1.6 million of whom have received a second dose, according to CDC data last updated Friday.\n That's more than 12 million doses administered, out of the more than 31 million doses that have been delivered, according to the CDC.\n So according to that data, roughly 39% of the delivered doses had been administered nationwide as of Friday morning.\n But comments from state officials suggest the percentage of doses administered is likely higher, and as states' vaccine campaigns have picked up the pace, states have increasingly complained that the federal government is not sending vaccines fast enough.\n In fact, some states are saying that the number of doses the federal government said it has distributed isn't aligning with what health officials are seeing.\n Officials in New York, Tennessee and West Virginia said the federal tallies showing they have thousands of doses sitting on shelves don't accurately reflect the supply of vaccine on hand.\n Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey told the federal government that sites in her state had the capacity to vaccinate five times as many people as they are now.\n \"We're doing great,\" Piercey told CNN. \"The only thing we're missing is supply.\"\n Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday called for the federal government to release more doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, saying that his state currently had \"a very limited supply.\"\n New York City is on pace to run out of vaccines by Thursday if the state doesn't receive more doses, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.\n \"If we don't get more vaccine quickly, we will have to cancel appointments,\" de Blasio said.\n To boost their numbers, parts of the country are working to find ways to ramp up vaccinations.\n In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers was at the opening of a new Covid-19 vaccination site Monday at the Prevea Health/University of Wisconsin-Green Bay Kress Events Center.\n Tommy Thompson, president of the University of Wisconsin System and a former governor, says more vaccination sites will be opening up soon, with the goal of opening sites on all 26 campuses in the system.\n Walz, the Minnesota governor, announced the state was launching a vaccine pilot program and will partner with local health and school districts to target certain populations.\n \"These sites will initially serve adults 65 years of age or older, as well as prekindergarten through grade 12 educators, school staff, and child care workers,\" a news release from the governor's office said. \"The community vaccination pilot program will be the foundation for mass vaccination clinics in Minnesota communities once the federal government increases vaccine supply.\"\n In California, all Los Angeles County residents 65 and older will be eligible to receive the vaccine later this week, under a new executive order signed by Board of Supervisors Chair Hilda Solis.\n That comes just days after health officials in the county said they did not have enough supply to begin vaccinating that age group, after the state expanded eligibility.\n \"If we are to ever get out of this dark winter, it is critical that we make headway vaccinating people 65 years of age and older as soon as possible -- in line with Governor Gavin Newsom's recommendations,\" Solis said in a statement.\n In Florida, more than 40,000 people who received their first vaccine dose are overdue for their second shot, according to a report from the state's health department.\n \"Overdue\" individuals are defined as \"those who have received their first dose and have passed the recommended time frame to receive their second dose.\"\n It's unclear why the residents are overdue.\n Both vaccines that have been authorized for the US market are a two-dose series. The second dose should be administered 21 days after the first dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 28 days after for the Moderna vaccine.\n While new cases across the country have been trending down since hitting a peak last week, experts urge Americans not to let their guard down yet.\n \"The virus has established itself in the human population and it's not going anywhere,\" infectious disease expert Amesh Adalja told CNN. \"We're going to see a lot of transmission until we cross the threshold for herd immunity.\"\n But also, the Covid-19 variant first identified in the UK is spreading across the US. Experts have warned that while it does not appear to be more deadly, it is more easily transmittable.\n More than 120 cases of the variant have been identified across 20 states, according to data from the CDC.\n That variant, known as B.1.1.7, has been imported to the US multiple times, and it might have been \"established in the US for some 5-6 weeks before (it) was identified as a variant of concern in the UK in mid-December,\" University of Arizona biologist Michael Worobey wrote late Monday on a website dedicated to sharing genetic information about the virus.\n Worobey also said he found evidence B.1.1.7 circulated in California without seeming to drive more transmission -- even though scientists widely agree it can be spread more easily and even though the CDC warned last week that a modeled trajectory of the variant in the US \"exhibits rapid growth in early 2021.\"\n That variant and others -- including one first identified in South Africa -- still could \"substantially increase the number of cases,\" Michael Osterholm, a coronavirus adviser to Biden, told CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday.\n \"I worry desperately in the next six to 12 weeks we're going to see a situation with this pandemic unlike anything we've seen yet to date,\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n Other variants include two in Brazil. Another has shown up in California, but it's not known whether it is contributing to renewed spread there.\n CNN's Ralph Ellis, Amanda Watts, Jen Christensen, Maggie Fox,  Ashley Killough, Naomi Thomas, Michael Nedelman, Gregory Lemos, Deidre McPhillips and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Group of House conservatives pushing to oust Liz Cheney, an effort Republican aides still view as a long shot ",
        "body_text": "A group of House conservatives is pushing to challenge Liz Cheney's role as conference chairwoman, trying to force a special meeting to discuss her future as the No. 3 House Republican.\n In a draft of the petition, which was obtained by CNN, conservatives are calling on Cheney for a special meeting \"to discuss a resolution on your leadership.\" The petition is still in draft form and is being circulated by members of the House Freedom Caucus.\n While the petition is garnering support, signing onto the petition means members back holding the special meeting. Under House Republican conference rules, you need 20% of the conference or 43 members to sign onto a petition like this in order to hold a special meeting. Signing onto the petition to hold the meeting is not the same as saying members are willing to vote to oust Cheney right now. In any meeting, the members would have to vote separately on the resolution asking her to step down.\n The effort to actually oust Cheney continues to be viewed as a long shot by GOP aides watching the process. While it is expected the conference may have to hold a special meeting on the topic, actually ousting Cheney is much harder. The conference would have to vote on a resolution asking her to step down and a majority would have to back it, something that aides don't expect is possible right now.\n \"There is angst, but I don't think they get there,\" one Republican aide told CNN on the condition of background to freely discuss the issue.\n Part of the obstacle for conservatives is that that leadership is not currently backing the effort. A spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN that the California Republican did not back efforts to oust Cheney.\n A spokesperson for Cheney responded to the effort in a statement Tuesday.\n \"We always welcome the opportunity to have discussions within the conference, and look forward to this one,\" Cheney spokesman Jeremy Adler said. \"As President-Elect Biden takes office and begins to implement an agenda that threatens our economic recovery and reverses course on important national security issues, our conference will be united in standing for conservative solutions to bring the nation together and retake the majority in 2022.\"\n Behind the scenes, frustration with Cheney has grown not simply over the fact that she voted to impeach President Donald Trump, but in how she went about it. The scathing statement against Trump was delivered the day before the vote giving Democrats a chance to use it over and over again in their calls to impeach Trump on the floor. Still, aides argue McCarthy is focused on keeping intra-party fights at bay as House Republicans recalibrate and set their sights on winning back the House in 2022. One former senior GOP official told CNN that ousting Cheney would be a massive step backward for the party.\n Cheney's calls for impeachment were far from the only ones in Congress from Republicans. Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Trump and multiple GOP senators have said they are open to looking at impeachment against the President. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the mob that attacked the US Capitol had been \"provoked\" by Trump.\n \"If it is true they are trying to do this, the party is committing suicide,\" the official said. \"Taking out the most senior woman in leadership when your party is bleeding out suburban women is the definition of self-harm.\"\n \"At some point there is going to have to be a conversation about whether we are going to have this civil war or not in the Republican Party,\" the GOP aide said. \"The cumulative effect of all of this is not helpful. I think at some point you get to a mutually assured destruction posture and people just stand down.\"\n This post has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Jamie Gangel contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden's daughter Ashley on not having traditional hand-off at White House on Inauguration Day: 'I think we're all OK with it' ",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden's daughter, Ashley Biden, did her first network television interview with another member of the small club of presidential children, Jenna Bush Hager of NBC.\n In an interview that aired Tuesday, Ashley Biden said her mother, incoming first lady Jill Biden, has not heard from first lady Melania Trump about any kind of traditional handoff at the White House, as is custom on Inauguration Day.\n \"I don't think they're doing the traditional protocol, which is unfortunate, but I think we're all OK with it,\" Ashley Biden said.\n Ashley Biden, a private person who does not have any public social media accounts, said she will not have a job in her father's administration, unlike Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter.\n But she will use her platform \"to advocate for social justice, for mental health, to be involved in community development and revitalization,\" she said.\n Ashley Biden reflected on the attacks that were leveled against her family during the presidential campaign and said, \"The cruelty and the meanness, that's why I'm not, I don't have a social media account that's public.\"\n \"Part of it is also having boundaries for myself, because I believe in kindness. I believe in the humanity of all of us,\" she continued.\n Ashley Biden is the only child of Joe and Jill Biden. The President-elect had two sons, Beau and Hunter, and a daughter, Naomi, with his first wife, Neilia. Neilia and Naomi, who was an infant at the time, were both killed in a car crash in 1972.\n Ashley spoke of the close bond she had with Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, and said when her father takes the oath of office on Wednesday, she knows Beau \"will be there with us.\"\n \"He was 46 when he passed. Dad will be the 46th president,\" she said.\n She recalled a heartfelt moment she and her father shared when she said they felt Beau's presence with them in South Carolina. A small community church they had stepped into was playing the hymn \"On Eagle's Wings\" which she said reminds her father of Beau.\n \"Dad and I looked at each other, started bawling, hugged, and were like, this is Beau,\" she said.\n Ashley Biden said family is the most important thing to her father, and said, \"We have a rule, still today, that no matter where Dad is, no matter what meeting he's in, if one of the kids' call, you have to get him out.\"\n She spoke about how her mother, Jill Biden, keeps her father grounded, and \"always\" reminds him to take out the trash and put his cereal bowl away. She described her mother as \"fierce\" and \"extremely loyal.\"\n Ashley Biden described the riot at the US Capitol on January 6 by a mob of Trump supporters, which left five people dead, as \"truly horrifying\" and said she was \"deeply saddened.\"\n \"This was a place I grew up going as a child, as you did too, and a place where Dad has worked for over 30 years. A sacred place, really,\" she said.\n She worries about the safety of her family, she said, but is reassured by the United States Secret Service.\n When the presidential race was called for Biden, days after Election Day as a record number of mail-in ballots were counted amid the coronavirus pandemic, Ashley Biden said she had been taking a nap upstairs but came rushing down when she heard celebrations.\n \"After the excitement, I sat next to Dad, while he was on the phone, and just grabbed his hand,\" Ashley Biden said.\n She praised her father and said she took issue with characterizations of him as a \"gaffe machine.\"\n \"I thought the media kind of always got it wrong when they made him out to be this gaffe machine, or that he wasn't, you know, as smart. I mean, the man is brilliant.\"",

        "title": "Trump pardons Steve Bannon as one of his final acts in office",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump pardoned his former chief strategist Steve Bannon in a last-minute decision made only hours before he is scheduled to depart the White House for a final time.\n Trump told people that after much deliberation, he had decided to pardon Bannon as one of his final acts in office.\n \"President Trump granted a full pardon to Stephen Bannon. Prosecutors pursued Mr. Bannon with charges related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project,\" the statement from White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany read. \"Mr. Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.\"\n Bannon faces a federal case that began in August when New York federal prosecutors charged him and three others with defrauding donors of more than a million dollars as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump's border wall.\n Bannon's pardon would follow a frantic scramble during the President's final hours in office as attorneys and top aides debated his inclusion on Trump's outgoing clemency list. Despite their falling out in recent years, Trump was eager to pardon his former aide after recently reconnecting with him as he helped fan Trump's conspiracy theories about the election.\n It was a far cry from when Trump exiled Bannon from his inner circle after he was quoted in a book trashing the President's children, claiming that Donald Trump Jr. had been \"treasonous\" by meeting with a Russian attorney and labeling Ivanka Trump \"dumb as a brick.\" Those statements from Bannon drove Trump to issue a lengthy statement saying he had \"lost his mind.\"\n \"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,\" Trump said at the time.\n Things shifted in recent months as Bannon attempted to breach Trump's inner circle once again by offering advice before the election and pushing his false theories after Trump had lost.\n One concern that had stalled debate over the pardon was Bannon's possible connection to the riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol earlier this month, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\" Bannon promised listeners of his podcast -- \"War Room\" -- on January 5, the day before the deadly siege on the Capitol.\n The day after Bannon's comments, Trump urged supporters to go to the Capitol because the election \"was stolen from you, from me and from the country.\"\n The pardon would bring a quick end to his criminal case, which began in August when New York federal prosecutors charged him and three others with defrauding donors of more than a million dollars as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump's border wall.\n Bannon's pardon would trigger relief from a series of charges brought against him by New York federal prosecutors, which carried the risk of jail time. Bannon had been released on $5 million bond in August, secured by $1.75 million in cash or real property. As part of his bail conditions, he was prohibited from travel on private airplanes, yachts or boats without permission from the court.\n The four men were accused of allegedly using hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to an online crowdfunding campaign called We Build the Wall for personal expenses, among other things.\n Bannon and another defendant, Brian Kolfage, allegedly promised donors that the campaign, which raised more than $25 million, was \"a volunteer organization\" and that \"100% of the funds raised ... will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose,\" according to the indictment.\n Instead, according to prosecutors, Bannon, through a nonprofit under his control, allegedly used more than $1 million from We Build the Wall to \"secretly\" pay Kolfage and cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon's personal expenses.\n Through his counsel, Bannon pleaded not guilty, and he dismissed the charges after his initial court appearance as a \"fiasco\" intended to \"stop people who want to build the wall.\"\n Trump said at the time that he felt \"very badly\" for Bannon, who had been an enormously influential voice inside the White House before he was ousted by the President in August 2017.\n A senior Trump adviser told CNN that Trump and Bannon had communicated in recent weeks.\n While some advisers believed it was decided last weekend that Bannon was not getting a pardon, Trump continued to raise it into Tuesday night. Throughout the day, Trump had continued to contemplate pardons that aides believed were settled, including for his former strategist -- something he continued to go back and forth on into Tuesday night, sources told CNN.\n Ultimately, Trump sided with Bannon.\n Bannon had helped run Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was credited as a driving force behind Trump's populist appeal, nationalist ideology and controversial policies.\n Before joining the campaign, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart, a right-wing news site that traffics in incendiary headlines. He returned to Breitbart after leaving the White House, but left again in 2018.\n Since Trump's election defeat, the President has leaned further into his expansive pardon powers -- granting pardons to his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, longtime ally Roger Stone and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, among others.\n Among Trump's pardons earlier in his term were those for former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza and financier Michael Milken.\n This story has been updated with further developments.",

        "title": "Trump has left, but some of his supporters still think he's about to declare martial law -- and they're excited",
        "body_text": "Sometime Monday, some of the remaining dead-enders convinced that President Trump will remain in office for at least the next four years got a sign. A Telegram account falsely purporting to be run by Gen. John Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was telling them that the moment they'd been waiting for, the moment Trump would finally act and use the military to crush his enemies, was coming.\n \"Nothing can stop this,\" the account said in a message that had been seen by at least 185,000 people as of Tuesday morning. \"They can no longer hide in the shadows,\" it added half an hour later. Then, 20 minutes later: \"Last hours.\" It continued on like this. Around 10 a.m. ET it posted an ominous picture of soldiers in uniform behind a fence in Washington DC with the caption \"Stay in your homes.\"\n By Tuesday afternoon, the account had almost 220,000 followers -- likely helped by the fact that it was being widely and actively discussed and promoted on other platforms including Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB). After CNN asked about the people sharing links to and promoting the Telegram channel on its platform, Twitter said it was \"taking action on accounts sharing it\" and would prevent the link from being tweeted further. Additionally, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone told CNN that Facebook had started blocking the link to the Telegram account as of early Wednesday morning.\n A spokesperson for Gen. Hyten told CNN Tuesday morning that the account is \"an absolute fake\" and added the Pentagon was \"actively working\" to get it taken down. Tuesday afternoon the account was marked as a \"scam\" with the message, \"Warning: Many users reported this account as a scam or a fake account.\" The account has since shed some followers, and many of the messages have been removed. A Telegram spokesperson told CNN, \"Telegram monitors reports and warns users about fraudulent accounts in clear-cut cases like the one you pointed out. \" Facebook and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n The account, which largely reflected old tropes from the QAnon conspiracy theory, was emblematic of a bigger trend. A sizable group of people who believe the lie that the election was stolen from Trump and that someone or something -- the courts, state legislatures, members of Congress, Vice President Mike Pence -- would stop Joe Biden from being inaugurated have not been dissuaded from that belief. Instead, they came to believe that the only thing left is violence, and blood. They are convinced, even now that he's left Washington, that Trump is about to institute martial law -- and they can't wait.\n The conspiracy theory has at its root the same thing that inspired the riot inside the Capitol on January 6th \u2014 the false idea that the election was stolen and American democracy under threat, and someone had to do something. Then, the rioters took it upon themselves. After the riot, similar groups of people had faith that they could hang back and wait because Trump and the military would take action. But given the way conspiracy theories work generally, and the way they have proliferated after the riot, it is easy to imagine these theories spinning out in new ways once it is clear no such action is coming.\n Much of the discussion around martial law online ultimately connects to QAnon, which has long had a promise of and a lust for blood. But the people who are excitedly discussing the possibility of a military takeover may not know the origins of their obsession. And the phenomenon does not appear to be confined to a niche corner of the internet.\n Over the past two weeks, CNN has seen Trump supporters embracing the idea in large numbers and across multiple social media platforms.\n On Facebook, a video in which a man warned people they should stock up on food before martial law was implemented was viewed more than five million times before it was fact-checked and marked as false. The video is no longer on Facebook, though it is not clear who took it down. CNN has reached out to Facebook for comment.\n On YouTube, a man who had previously been best known for his claims that he has an alien mother and an alien daughter has suddenly become a star. He racked up more than 3.5 million views with a video in which he claimed that Trump had signed the Insurrection Act, a prominent feature of many martial law conspiracy theories. Another video in which he said that as much as 85% of Congress could be arrested has been viewed almost 1.7 million times. After this article was initially published, Ivy Choi, a YouTube spokesperson, told CNN that the company had removed the latter video after being asked about it by CNN, saying it had \"violat[ed] our presidential election integrity policy.\"\n On TikTok, thousands if not tens of thousands of people have been seeing and reacting to dozens of videos tied to the conspiracy theories. Those videos range in subject, all tied to the same false idea that Trump is about to institute martial law -- in some, people excitedly film the movement of military vehicles, convinced it's a sign; in others, people repeat warnings about being prepared with food and water; one popular theme is that at any moment Trump will use the Emergency Broadcast System to announce the beginning of his move. There is rarely, if ever any sign of hesitation or concern over the lives that might be lost.\n -- CNN's Mallory Simon contributed reporting",

        "title": "As Biden prepares to be inaugurated, a journalist hopes the war on truth is over ",
        "body_text": "The American democracy was sorely tested over the past four years. Wednesday's inauguration of Joe Biden is a testament to its resilience. Wednesday is also a long-overdue opening of the tent \u2014 with Kamala Harris becoming the first woman, the first Black person and the first South Asian to be elected VP.\n Biden is entering office with a reservoir of goodwill. Almost six in ten Americans view him favorably, according to CNN's latest polling. And even some people who are so-so about Biden are rooting for Harris and the belated leap toward equality that she represents.\n The immediate question: Will they squander this goodwill in the first week with crowd size controversies and lies about voter fraud? No, almost certainly not. Will anti-Democratic media outlets stir up faux-scandals that muddy the first week anyway? Yes, they almost certainly will. And so it begins.\n Robert McLean edits the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter most nights, so he has had an up-close view of the war on truth that has raged for the past four years. On the eve of Biden's inauguration, he wanted to write about his hope for the next four years. So I'm handing the reigns to Rob, starting now:\n My calling to journalism has always been rooted deeply in the idea that an informed electorate is a safeguard against despotism and would-be tyrants. Capable journalists report facts \u2014 key to understanding the world around us \u2014 without spin or putting their thumbs on the scale of opinion.\n If a legacy brick-and-mortar retail company declares bankruptcy, we report information from the court filing.\n If a Silicon Valley company flags a security breach to its clients, we report on how the breach happened and what it could mean for those customers.\n And if a politician is caught lying, we report on that falsehood and provide to our audience what is objectively true. This is not a partisan issue. But for the last four years, my colleagues and I have been cast as villains by the leader of the free world. The person whose job it is to defend the Constitution \u2014 and by default a free press \u2014 labeled us as \"enemy of the people.\" We've been harassed, assaulted, and even had to evacuate our offices after bomb threats, all spurred by the rhetoric of a US President desperate to cast doubt on objective reality.\n That effort to subvert truth came to a head two weeks ago when the US Capitol was assaulted by those who believed lies that aligned with their own world views.\n But despite President Trump's best efforts to distort reality, we in the press have continued our jobs unabated. We covered the first impeachment -- and the second. We have counted every life lost to the coronavirus pandemic. We've exposed misinformation, including from Trump, all the way through Tuesday night.\n I'm hopeful that the war on truth ends with Wednesday's inauguration. President-elect Biden has already signaled far more support for a free press than President Trump and his administration ever did.\n On a November broadcast of \"Reliable Sources,\" Biden aide TJ Ducklo said Biden \"believes that the media is a critical piece of our democracy; that transparency is incredibly important.\" Transition officials said they would restore the daily press briefing -- a duty to the American people that the Trump administration tarnished before abdicating altogether. True to the incoming admin's word, incoming press secretary Jen Psaki will hold an on-camera press briefing on Inauguration Day.\n While I'm relieved our next President has signaled support for a free press, I know that he and his administration's leaders will be annoyed with some of the coverage in the coming years. That's how it is supposed to work. I know that capable journalists will cover Biden as aggressively as they covered Trump, Obama, Bush and every previous administration.\n The types of questions responsible journalists pitch to lawmakers help keep America's leaders accountable to the people they serve \u2014 because they aim to reveal objective truth about our government. Truth has been shrouded by Trump's lies for four years. I don't know what Biden will do. But I know that the press will continue to report facts, point out lies and inform the American electorate \u2014 as we always have. That's the job.\n Thank you Rob!\n DARCY HAS A MORE PESSIMISTIC TAKE...\n Oliver Darcy writes: \"When Americans turn on the television Wednesday, they will see an inauguration like no other. National Guard troops. Road blocks. Fences with barbed wire. Which is to say, they will see the physical manifestation of our information crisis. That's what the current state of DC represents. Yes, Trump's lies bear a large bulk of the responsibility. But our information infrastructure is what allowed those lies to spread to millions and radicalize those who stormed the Capitol earlier this month. And it is what is largely responsible for the current locked-down state of our nation's capital.\"\n Alex Koppelman and Donie O'Sullivan write: \"A sizable group of people who believe the lie that the election was stolen from Trump and that someone or something -- the courts, state legislatures, members of Congress, VP Mike Pence -- would stop Biden from being inaugurated have not been dissuaded from that belief. Instead, they came to believe that the only thing left is violence, and blood. They are convinced Trump is about to institute martial law -- and they can't wait.\" Read about this sickness here...",

        "title": "DOJ closes insider trading investigation into Sen. Richard Burr",
        "body_text": "The Justice Department has notified Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina that it has closed the insider trading investigation into him.\n \"Tonight, the Department of Justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year,\" Burr said in a statement. \"The case is now closed. I'm glad to hear it. My focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of North Carolina during this difficult time for our nation.\"\n The New York Times was first to report the investigation had been closed.\n CNN reported last year that Burr was under investigation by the Justice Department, which was looking into stock transactions he had made ahead of the sharp market downturn sparked by concerns over the coronavirus.\n He turned over his official Senate phone to the FBI after a warrant was served, an official confirmed to CNN at the time. Use of the warrant had been signed off at the highest levels of the Justice Department, as is protocol, according to the source.\n The Senate-issued cellphone was Burr's primary device and investigators had asked Apple for information from Burr's iCloud backup, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\n Alice Fisher, an attorney for Burr, said in statement Tuesday evening the North Carolina Republican is \"pleased that the Department of Justice has completed a thorough review of this matter and closed it without further action.\"\n \"As the country continues to concentrate efforts on battling the challenges presented by COVID-19, Senator Burr's focus will remain on the safety and security of North Carolinians and the United States as a whole,\" Fisher said.\n The Department of Justice has now closed all of its investigations into insider trading against members of Congress.\n Four members were investigated: former Georgia GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and now Burr.\n Burr consistently denied any wrongdoing, saying he made the trades based solely on public information, not information he received from the committee, and he asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review the sales after they were made public.\n Still, he faced lingering public scrutiny from his sales -- which represented a sizable share of his portfolio of stocks, according to his latest Senate financial disclosure documents filed in May 2019, although exact numbers aren't possible because lawmakers report trades only as a range of dollar values.\n Congress passed the Stock Act in 2012, which made it illegal for lawmakers to use inside information for financial benefit. Under insider trading laws, prosecutors would have needed to prove the lawmakers had traded based on material nonpublic information they had received in violation of a duty to keep it confidential.\n Additionally, CNN reported last year that Burr's brother-in-law, Gerald Fauth, sold a half-dozen stocks for as much as $280,000 on the same day in February that Burr did.\n Burr, however, also denied at the time that he coordinated his trading with his brother-in-law that day and declined to discuss the controversy when asked whether he had been in touch with the Justice Department or the Ethics panel.\n \"I'm not addressing it at all,\" he said. \"Let's let these things play out.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information Tuesday.\n CNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Key takeaways from the first confirmation hearings for Biden nominees",
        "body_text": "With just one day left until President-elect Joe Biden takes office, five of his Cabinet nominees faced Senate panels as part of the first step of the confirmation process.\n Nominees taking part in confirmation hearings on Tuesday include Janet Yellen, Biden's pick to lead the Treasury Department; Avril Haines, Biden's choice to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary designate for the Department of Homeland Security; Antony Blinken to lead to State Department; and Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin for Secretary of Defense.\n The hearings' late start means that Biden is on track to take office without key Cabinet members confirmed. Still, aides have told CNN it is possible the Senate moves on Wednesday, after Biden is sworn in, to confirm some of the nominees.\n Nominees participated in hearings across the halls of Congress on Tuesday. Here are the key takeaways.\n Biden's pick for director of national intelligence underscored the need to keep politics out of the US intelligence community -- an apparent attempt to turn the corner after years of tension between Trump and the intelligence community during his time in office.\n \"To be effective, the DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power -- even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult,\" Haines said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever.\"\n Notably, Haines, a former top CIA official and deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, was introduced by Dan Coats, Trump's first director of national intelligence and a former GOP senator.\n Coats, who repeatedly clashed with Trump over Russia's interference in the 2016 election, emphasized Haines' \"commitment to bringing non-politicized truth to power and restoring trust and confidence in the intelligence community and the American public.\"\n Blinken also said during his confirmation hearing that the State Department \"has to be\" a nonpartisan institution, breaking sharply from his predecessor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has repeatedly engaged in political activity while serving as America's chief diplomat.\n Yellen, Biden's nominee to head the Treasury Department, told lawmakers that if confirmed, her core focus will be on the needs of America's workers and another coronavirus aid package.\n \"I will be focused from day one on providing support to America's workers and to small business, putting into effect as quickly and efficiently as I can the relief in the bill that was already passed and then, over time, working for a second package that I think we need to get through these dark times before the vaccination program enables us to go back to life as we knew it,\" Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee during her confirmation hearing.\n Yellen also reaffirmed that Biden eventually \"wants to repeal parts of the 2017 tax cuts that benefited the highest income Americans and large companies,\" as well as \"reverse the law's incentives to offshore operations.\" But she added that Biden has been \"very clear\" that he does not support a complete repeal of the 2017 tax law.\n Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security reiterated Biden's commitment to stop further construction of the wall on the southern border of the US.\n \"President-elect Biden is committed to cease funding for further construction of the border wall. I would execute President-elect Biden's commitment in adherence to the laws that guide us,\" Mayorkas said during the hearing. He dodged questions about whether he thinks the physical barriers along the southern border be taken down or removed.\n That didn't satisfy Sen. John Hawley, for one, who moved to block Mayorkas' quick consideration after the hearing due to his border answer.\n Mayorkas also said the dismantling of existing immigration policies created under Trump will take time. He also told lawmakers that he does not recommend defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \"I think President-elect Biden, and people who will be joining his incoming administration have spoken about the fact that there's a commitment to follow our asylum laws to enforce our asylum laws, and that means to provide humanitarian relief for those individuals who qualify for it onto the law,\" Mayorkas said. \"That cannot be accomplished with just the flick of a switch and turned on and day one(.)\"\n Both Haines and Mayorkas addressed ongoing concerns about domestic terrorism and the spread of conspiracy theories during their hearings -- held in the halls of Congress less than two weeks after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building.\n Haines said she felt \"concern and obviously empathy\" for those working in the Capitol at the time, calling the images \"disturbing.\" She also said she would work with the FBI and DHS to produce a public assessment of the threat that QAnon poses to the US.\n Mayorkas called the threat of domestic extremism \"is one of the greatest challenges the Department of Homeland Security confronts, and it has unique capabilities in confronting that challenge.\"\n \"If I should have the honor of being confirmed, I will do everything I can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror that you felt, your colleagues, staff and everyone present, will not happen again,\" Mayorkas said.\n Later Tuesday afternoon, Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, Biden's nominee to be Defense Secretary, pledged during his hearing to \"fight hard ... to rid our ranks of racists and extremists.\"\n \"The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies,\" Austin said. \"But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.\"\n Nearly all of the nominees who participated in Tuesday's confirmation hearings previewed the Biden administration's approach to China.\n Blinken said at his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing Tuesday afternoon that \"there is no doubt\" that China \"poses the most significant challenge of any nation-state to the United States.\" He also bluntly said that Trump was right for taking a tougher approach to China, even though he does not agree with the Trump administration's tactics.\n Blinken said the US had to \"start by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness.\" Part of that strength, he said, was in working with allies and engagement with international institutions.\n Austin said during his hearing that he saw China as \"a pacing challenge\" for the Defense Department.\n And earlier Tuesday morning, Haines said she supports an \"aggressive stance\" to deal with China -- one that is \"more assertive than where we had been in the Obama-Biden administration.\"\n She called China \"a challenge to our security, to our prosperity, to our values across a range of issues\" and said the intelligence community's approach to China \"has to evolve.\"\n Yellen told lawmakers that if confirmed, she would not relax the US' approach on China, promising to take on \"China's abusive, unfair and illegal practices.\"\n \"China is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers, and giving away subsidies to corporations,\" she said.\n Nominees also further detailed how the incoming administration expects to approach Iran.\n Haines said that while the incoming Biden administration has indicated it would come back to the table with Iran if Tehran came back into compliance with the Iran nuclear agreement, she noted that \"frankly, we're a long ways from that.\"\n Blinken said the incoming administration has \"an urgent responsibility to do whatever we can to prevent Iran from acquiring ... (a) weapon or getting close to the capacity to having the fissile material to break out on short notice,\" but did not offer specific steps with regard to rejoining the Iran nuclear deal.\n And Austin said he thinks \"Iran's ... behavior continues to be destabilizing.\"\n Blinken and Austin previewed their incoming administration's approach to Israel.\n The secretary of state-designate told senators that the incoming administration recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said it would leave the US Embassy in the contested holy city.\n And both men praised the Trump administration's efforts to normalize relations between Israel and other countries in the Middle East.\n Austin further said that he thought the recent agreements between several countries in the region to normalize relations with Israel is \"a good thing.\"\n \"I think certainly this has put a bit more pressure on Iran and I hope that it will have good effects,\" he added.\n Blinken said that while he applauded the Abraham Accords established during Trump's tenure in office, it presented an opportunity to \"create a greater sense of confidence and security in Israel as it considers its relationship with the Palestinians. Because whether we like or not, whether they like or not, it's not just going away.\"\n Austin told senators he supported the incoming administration's priority to overturn Trump's ban on transgender people enlisting in the military. And Blinken said during his hearing that he will swiftly appoint an LGBTQI envoy and will allow embassies to fly the pride flag -- after the Trump administration denied multiple embassies the ability to fly the flag during pride month in 2019.\n \"This is a matter, I think, of some real urgency,\" Blinken said of the envoy position, which was left empty under Trump. \"We've seen violence directed against LGBTQI people around the world increase. We've seen, I believe, the highest number of murders of transgender people, particularly women of color, that we've seen ever. And so I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQI people is something that the department is going to take on and take on immediately.\"\n Blinken also affirmed that he would repudiate the findings of the \"Commission on Unalienable Rights\" -- Pompeo's keystone initiative, which contended in its report that some rights were not worth defending. Rights groups and advocacy organizations feared it would have damaging effects on human rights abroad and the rights of women and LGBTQ people.\n If Biden's Cabinet picks are confirmed, they will make history as the most diverse group to ever lead federal agencies.  Four out of five of Biden's nominees participating in confirmation hearings on Tuesday are breaking ground in that regard.\n If confirmed, the nominees include the first female director of national intelligence, the first female treasury secretary, the first Hispanic and first immigrant DHS chief and the first Black Pentagon chief.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Jeremy Herb, Vivian Salama, Priscilla Alvarez, Geneva Sands, Michael Conte, Kate Trafecante, Anneken Tappe, Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood, Nicole Gaouette, Nicky Robertson and Nick Neville contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Members of extremist Oath Keepers group planned attack on US Capitol, prosecutors say",
        "body_text": "Prosecutors on Tuesday filed the first significant conspiracy charge in the US Capitol attack, alleging that three members of the so-called Oath Keepers, an extremist militant group, planned and coordinated ahead of the January 6 assault.\n In an amended complaint unsealed Tuesday in federal court, an FBI agent divulged striking new details about the group's efforts. Jessica Watkins, the alleged founder of an Ohio militia, had instructions to make explosives out of bleach printed out at her home, according to the court document.\n Chilling messages sent between the militants during the siege that are quoted in the complaint appear to indicate they were searching for lawmakers inside the building as they sought to stop Congress from certifying the presidential election.\n While at the Capitol, one alleged member of the conspiracy, Thomas Edward Caldwell, allegedly received a Facebook message reading \"All members are in the tunnels under capital seal them in. Turn on gas.\"\n In subsequent messages, an unidentified person appeared to give Caldwell directions inside the labyrinthian government building:\n \"Tom all legislators are down in the Tunnels 3floors down\" one says. \"Go through back house chamber doors facing N left down hallway down steps,\" says another, according to court documents.\n Watkins turned herself into local police in the state on Sunday along with Donovan Crowl, another member of the Ohio group accused in the conspiracy charges.\n The pair, along with Caldwell, are accused of moving together \"in an organized and practiced fashion\" as they pushed through a crowd towards a door to the Capitol building, according to a charging document.\n The three were part of a group of eight to 10 people all wearing paramilitary gear and Oath Keeper paraphernalia, signifying their affiliation with the self-styled militia that's driven by anti-government conspiracies, according to an FBI affidavit. (The Ohio militia founded by Watkins pays dues to the Oath Keepers, according to the affidavit.)\n Individual charges against the three had been revealed in recent days but the new conspiracy charge grouping them together represents the most serious allegation of coordinated activity at the riot made by prosecutors investigating the events of the insurrection. Prosecutors have called Caldwell an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers, and had previously charged him alone with conspiracy. (Oath Keepers leader Steward Rhodes denied that to CNN.)\n It's not clear who is representing Watkins and Donovan on the charges. Caldwell was arrested in Virginia earlier Tuesday and at an initial appearance in federal court in Harrisonburg, Virginia, Tuesday afternoon, a federal magistrate judge ordered that he remain in jail as he awaits trial.\n \"The conduct and statements of Mr. Caldwell and the others, it really is just pure lawlessness,\" Judge Joel Hoppe of the Western District of Virginia said.\n Prosecutors said at the hearing that Caldwell could face more charges, potentially including federal riot and sedition charges. He currently faces charges of obstruction of a federal proceeding, destruction of federal property and two conspiracy counts that carry serious possible penalties.\n Caldwell's defense lawyer argued that he should be released because he is at risk of contracting Covid-19 in detention, his charges are not that serious and that he is a retired Navy captain who served the country and was honorably discharged. Caldwell said in court he still receives retirement payments from the Navy.\n \"Seventy percent of Republicans believe that the election was fraudulent,\" his temporarily appointed defense lawyer said, adding that Caldwell's opposition to the government wasn't out of the ordinary for \"blustering on Facebook.\"\n According to a recording of walkie-talkie-like communications that the militant group members were allegedly having during the riot, Watkins said that she was part of a team of 30 to 40 people.\n \"We have a good group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan,\" Watkins said, according to the affidavit.\n At another point in the recording, after Watkins reports to the group that unknown others were \"throwing grenades\" and \"shooting people with paint balls,\" a man responds to her telling her to be safe and adding, \"Get it, Jess. Do your F**king thing. This is what we f**king [unintelligible] up for. Everything we f**king trained for.\"\n In an interview, Crowl's mother, Teresa Joann Rowe, said her son, who previously served in the US Marine Corps, has expressed increasingly hostile political views in recent years.\n \"It felt like he did a 180-degree turnaround, felt like the world owed him a living and had a big chip on his shoulder,\" she told CNN. \"I don't know if it's because life didn't go the way he planned.\"\n Asked why she thinks Crowl may have been joined to this extremist group, she said, \"I would like to understand myself. I don't get it.\"\n She said Crowl served in the Marine Corps for about six years starting in the late 1980's and in recent years has done \"odd jobs, being paid under the table so that he doesn't have to pay taxes.\"\n She said prior to the news surrounding the storming of the Capitol, she was unaware of Crowl's involvement in any political groups, though she had heard him express pro-Donald Trump political views. She also said she recalled Crowl stating that \"they were going to overtake the government if they... tried to take Trump's presidency from him. So he did make that statement, but that was two or three years ago so I forgot all about it.\"\n Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said he's concerned some of those arrested have US military backgrounds.\n \"Some right-wing extremist groups, particularly the anti-government Oath Keepers, have a long history of recruiting from current and former members of the military and law enforcement,\" Segal told CNN.\n \"Oath Keepers are part of the resurgent militia movement, which believes the federal government has been co-opted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights. Though the Oath Keepers will accept anyone as members, what differentiates them from other anti-government extremist groups is their explicit focus on recruiting current and former military, law enforcement and first responder personnel,\" he added.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Curt Devine, Mallory Simon, Sara Sidner and Anna-Maja Rappard contributed to this report.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n Today in business news: Stocks are having a post-election rager, Janet Yellen testifies on Capitol Hill, and Bed Bath & Beyond drops MyPillow. Let's get into it.\n It's Inauguration Eve, and Wall Street \u2014 true to form\u00a0\u2014 is feeling good.\n Stocks\u00a0have gained\u00a0about 13% since Election Day.\u00a0That's\u00a0the best post-election market performance for a new president in modern history, my colleague Paul La Monica writes.\n The market also cheered Donald Trump's win in 2016, rising 6% from the election to the inauguration. But there's one major difference: Trump was inheriting an economy that was growing at a stable rate during the long, post-Great Recession recovery. Biden is walking into the Covid-19 economy.\n It might seem incongruous to have such a happy stock market during such a dark time. Coronavirus deaths just passed 400,000 in the United States. Millions of people are unemployed or have dropped out of the workforce entirely. Thousands of National Guard troops are patrolling DC to prevent extremist violence.\n An incredible thing happened in the Senate today: Janet Yellen, Joe Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill.\u00a0And it was\u00a0boring.\n I mean that in the best possible way.\u00a0This was a substantive, policy-heavy snooze-fest -- a very different vibe from the partisan grandstanding and squabbling we've seen in other hearings in recent years.\n During her confirmation hearing, lawmakers asked thoughtful questions and received\u00a0nuanced\u00a0answers about plans for a federal stimulus package, the national debt, global trade and taxes. The decibel levels in the room hovered somewhere between \"sober country club luncheon\" and \"elderly crowd at a golf tournament.\"\n Yellen is urging Congress to \"act big\" on stimulus spending, especially while interest rates are at historically low levels.The Treasury should focus its relief spending on those who need it most: American workers, especially women and people of color, who've been hit hardest.She sees the role as having a \"dual mission:\" first, it's to get Americans through the pandemic, and then, longer term, to rebuild the economy.\n \"It is hard to imagine a better prepared nominee to meet this great moment of need than Dr. Yellen,\" the former officials wrote in a letter released this morning.\n -- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon\n At an event hosted by the Business Roundtable, Doug McMillon lamented that the baseless claims of a stolen election, pushed by President Trump and his allies, have further inflamed the United States in a time of peril.\n The reckoning has finally come for MyPillow.\n Bed Bath & Beyond confirmed it has stopped selling the poorly reviewed pillow and related products after the company's CEO supported the January 6 insurrection and made false claims about the validity of the presidential election.\n MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, one of Trump's holdout supporters in Corporate America, said in an interview with a right-wing broadcaster that retailers are \"scared\" and blamed \"leftist groups\" for pressuring the vendors to dropping\u00a0his product. He said that Wayfair, Kohl's and HEB also stopped selling MyPillow products. The three companies didn't respond to CNN Business' requests for comment.\n Lindel was also spotted at the White House last Friday with pages of notes that appear to outline a series of recommendations including installing a Trump loyalist as the acting CIA director.\n Netflix announced a milestone Tuesday: It now has more than 200 million subscribers globally after adding 8.5 million subscribers in Q4.

        "title": "Right-wing extremists and their supporters use Christian website to raise funds",
        "body_text": "Before Proud Boys member Nick Ochs was arrested and charged in connection with the insurrection at the US Capitol, he raised $300 on the Christian-oriented website GiveSendGo.com  to help get him to DC.\n Following Ochs' arrest, a supporter turned to GiveSendGo to raise money for his legal defense, a campaign that has garnered nearly $20,000 for the member of the right-wing extremist group.\n The campaigns for Ochs weren't the only controversial causes on the site. A CNN review found more than two dozen fundraisers related to protesting the outcome of the presidential election, raising travel funds to attend the January 6 protest in Washington and other right-wing causes.\n Among the campaigns and their beneficiaries: Ali Alexander, a Stop the Steal organizer who raised money for a \"security and administrative team.\" As of today, he's reached 75% of his $40,000 goal on the platform. Friends and family of Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, have raised more than $113,000 for his legal defense on GiveSendGo.com. Tarrio was arrested two days before the insurrection at the Capitol and charged with destruction of property for burning a Black Lives Matter banner after a protest in December and with possessing high-capacity firearm magazines. Jim Hoft, founder of the conservative news outlet Gateway Pundit, is currently the beneficiary of two campaigns on GiveSendGo.com, totaling more than $135,000, intended to fund an investigation into alleged voter fraud in Michigan and to \"take on the tech giant censorship of conservative voices.\"At least five other campaigns that collectively raised nearly $200,000 are tied to self-described Proud Boys members looking for funds for \"protective gear,\" travel expenses to the January protest in Washington, DC, and medical costs after a December rally in the capital turned violent.\n Requests for comment from Alexander, Tarrio and Hoft went unanswered.\n Though the money raised through GiveSendGo for extremists and other controversial causes \"get a lot of limelight,\" the company's co-founder said the site hosts \"thousands\" of other campaigns that are in no way contentious.\n Still, the site has emerged as an alternative fundraiser for those who have been kicked off -- or shunned by -- larger crowdfunding platforms, such as GoFundMe.\n Jacob Wells, the co-founder of GiveSendGo, told CNN just because a cause may be unpopular it doesn't mean a person shouldn't have an opportunity to raise money from like-minded supporters.\n He said the decision at GiveSendGo about whether to allow someone to raise funds on the site is focused on the two-pronged question of whether it's legal and, if so, whether there's anything in its stated goal that's \"derogatory to anybody.\"\n GiveSendGo's terms and conditions prohibit any \"abusive or hateful language\" on its platform, as well as campaigns for \"items that promote hate, violence and racial intolerance.\"\n \"We're not here to take sides,\" Wells said in an interview with CNN. \"We don't necessarily condone on our platform a campaign any more than when you tweet on Twitter that Twitter somehow agrees with you,\" Wells said.\n Wells, who said he is a \"Jesus guy\" as opposed to someone motivated by politics, likened the decision to host campaigns for groups or people that some may find unsavory to a missionary looking to save souls in a brothel.\n \"As best we can, we're going to represent the hope of Jesus in every situation to people who use our platform,\" Wells said. \"We're going to cover it all with grace.\"\n Critics, however, say GiveSendGo and others in the tech industry enable extremists by refusing to take a firm stand against them.\n The Proud Boys and other groups like them need \"an architecture through which they can meet, recruit and finance themselves,\" said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\n \"Big tech has not just made it easy,\" Ahmed added. \"It has turned a blind eye to extremist activities.\"\n Michael Hayden, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks alleged hate groups, offered this blunt take:\n \"We want to limit the capacity of these groups being able to get money in any way,\" he said. \"Repeatedly, we've seen if the money is not there, the presence will not be there either.\"\n Hayden brushed aside extremist groups' claims that their fundraising is protected free speech as a \"slanted and corrupted\" interpretation used to \"vilify those who seek to limit their power.\"\n Not every company's view on who can raise money is as charitable as GiveSendGo's.\n PayPal, for example, said it no longer provides services to GiveSendGo, citing unspecified violations of PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy. But Wells told CNN it was GiveSendGo that cut ties with PayPal rather than adhere to its demand that the company not cater to certain clients.\n \"This is really coming down ideological lines,\" Wells said. \"We're not just going to cut off one half of the population's ability to espouse their ideas or desires because the other side yells at us to do it.\"\n CNN did not independently authenticate all the campaigns or verify whether the funds reached their designated recipients. In many of the controversial cases, the campaigns remained on the GiveSendGo website but the ability to donate had been suspended. Wells said that action was not taken by GiveSendGo; rather, he said, it was the result of third-party vendors in charge of processing payments or the individual administrating the account.\n Not all the contributions on GiveSendGo are monetary. For folks inclined to give spiritual support, rather than financial, there is \"pray now\" button. The campaign for Help Storm the Captial (sic) Patriots Legal Defense, for example, got $10 from one anonymous donor, but received 12 prayers.\n Many of the fundraising campaigns GiveSendGo supports are of the sort Wells envisioned when he co-founded the giving platform with his sister seven years ago: A scholarship in the name of a beloved coach. A child in need of surgery. Five hundred dollars for \"cat supplies\" for a disabled couple caring for 14 rescued felines.\n The site exploded in popularity among the right over the summer when it began hosting a fundraiser for the legal defense of Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen charged with killing two people amid the unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. As first reported by the Daily Beast, GiveSendGo allowed the Rittenhouse fundraiser after it was banned by GoFundMe.\n Rittenhouse claimed he was there to protect people and property from rioters and opened fire in self-defense. Prosecutors charged the 17-year-old with two felony charges of homicide.\n While the case had a polarizing effect, Wells told CNN, \"In my opinion, the media tried to paint a very one-sided story about what happened.\"\n Since launching the GiveSendGo fundraising effort, Rittenhouse's supporters have exceeded their stated goal of half a million dollars, raising $585,940 from more than 13,000 donors, according to the website.\n GiveSendGo has also provided a platform for a number of police officers involved in controversial uses of force, Wells said, including the police officer charged with killing George Floyd, an officer who pulled the trigger in the raid on Breonna Taylor's apartment, and the Wisconsin officer who shot Jacob Blake. Authorities have since declined to file criminal charges against any officers for Taylor's death or for the shooting of Blake. The officer charged with Floyd's killing is awaiting trial.\n Wells said GiveSendGo's growing popularity has coincided with improved financial performance. Once \"a labor of love\" that made little money, he said he expects campaigns on the site to bring in $20 to $30 million in 2021, from which the company takes a cut of at least 3%.\n Along with its increased popularity, the site has drawn additional scrutiny from the media, including in a recent article by The Washington Post about fundraising related to the Proud Boys and other controversial causes.\n Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who specializes in First Amendment issues, said there was nothing illegal -- or, in his view, immoral -- about GiveSendGo's business.\n \"Whatever you might think about Kyle Rittenhouse, I hope we can agree that he is entitled to a criminal defense,\" Volokh said. \"If people want to help hire lawyers, in part because of their ideological views, that's something that is constitutionally protected.\"\n Ochs, the Proud Boys member, charged in connection with the siege on the Capitol, did not return a phone call seeking comment for this article. He previously told CNN that he was working as a professional journalist when he entered the building, and that he didn't go into any congressional offices or the chambers.\n \"We didn't have to break in, I just walked in and filmed,\" he said hours after the siege.\n CJ Grisham, a Proud Boys member from Texas, who raised funds on GiveSendGo for tactical gear so the group can be \"ready at a moment's notice to protect our communities,\" said the Proud Boys should be entitled to raise funds just like anyone else.\n He said his fundraising campaign brought in nearly $5,000 for a cause he explicitly stated was nonviolent, but that he has so far been denied any money because a third-party vendor that processes payments for GiveSendGo decided his campaign was \"too risky.\"\n \"Who gets to decide what a good cause is?\" Grisham asked. \"Are we gonna let big tech decide what a good cause is?\"",

        "title": "Trump mythologizes his skill as a builder. He will be remembered for destruction",
        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 19 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\nPresident Donald Trump will be gone tomorrow.\n For millions of people in America and around the world, the departure of a White House wannabe autocrat who spent four years living inside everybody's head means the end of a long nightmare.\n But Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday will be a day of dispossession for millions more Americans who saw Trump as a lone leader who voiced their fear that the modern world scorns their religion, culture, livelihoods and patriotism.\n When people look at Trump and say, \"This is not America,\" they are wrong. His presidency personified a gap between America's liberal, urban, multiracial citizens and their White, rural, conservative counterparts. And his great sin as President was that he didn't try to build common bonds and language between an internally estranged people. Instead, he exploited the divide.\n These facts are indisputable: Trump destroyed millions of people's faith in the US political system by refusing to accept his election defeat and inciting an insurrection against Congress. He inspired radical, far right White nationalists. He lied every day. His \"beautiful\" health care plan was a sick myth. He torched America's global reputation. And he incessantly exploited his job to boost his business, reversing President John Kennedy's admonition, \"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.\"\n Trump did often raise questions that conventional politicians dodged: Shouldn't the US be tougher on an increasingly hostile China? When will someone actually help ghost towns in the Midwest and the South where industries died at the hands of elite free traders? Why don't prosperous Europeans pay more for their own defense? What is the sense in sending heartland Americans to die in the Middle East?\n But he never answered these questions. And for all Trump's championing of \"forgotten\" Americans, his sole big legislative win was huge tax cuts for corporations and his rich cronies.\n Trump mythologizes his skill as a builder, but he will be remembered for destruction. After losing the White House, the House and the Senate, being impeached twice and throwing tens of thousands of lives into the teeth of the pandemic, this one-termer has earned his inevitable historic ignominy as one of the worst US presidents, if not the worst.\n Civil rights leader and peaceful protest advocate Martin Luther King Jr. would be disappointed by the state of the country if he were alive today, his son said on Monday -- a national holiday to honor King. \"My father always believed in the people of our nation. Certainly, he would be greatly disappointed in how we have chosen to conduct ourselves at this particular moment, but most particularly, probably disappointed in the commander in chief, because the commander in chief is supposed to bring people together and not to bring people together to actually intercept your government,\" Martin Luther King III told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n In the words of one of his campaign anthems, Trump has no time for losers. Yet he has no choice but to face the consequence of his election defeat this week: exiting the White House.\n He won't go quietly. Trump is planning his own sendoff with full military honors and a 21-gun salute, in what could be his last super-spreader event as President. But since his supporters sacked Congress, the guest list for his early morning farewell at Joint Base Andrews may no longer be a hot ticket. Even Anthony Scaramucci -- who after a farcical 10-day term as White House communications director now refers to Trump as \"the domestic terrorist of the 21st century\" -- got an invite.\n Some presidents leave looking like they can't wait to hand over the burdens of office. But others loathe ceding the spotlight. President Richard Nixon, who also left in disgrace, delivered a tearful farewell to his Cabinet with the immortal self-justifying line, \"Others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.\" Then he was off with that famous two-armed salute, fingers flashing a \"V\" for victory, at the door of Marine One.\n No one loved being president like Bill Clinton. Even after the longest of goodbyes, he couldn't bear to let go, stringing out a huge farewell rally at Andrews that some saw as a poor taste distraction from George W. Bush's inauguration.\n Pointing to a sign that read, \"Please don't go,\" the two-termer told fans, \"I left the White House \u2014 but I'm still here.\"\n Eight years later, George W. Bush left incoming President Barack Obama's inauguration and helicoptered over a crowd singing, \"Na na na na, hey hey, goodbye!\" in mockery of his presidency, which had effectively expired in the bloodied sands of Iraq.\n The joke soured on Democrats eight years on, though, when Obama was succeeded by a president who made W look like George Washington.\n Trump of course, will spare himself such humiliation by shipping out of Washington early on Inauguration Day. In doing so, he'll crush presidential decorum to the very end, by snubbing Biden's big day.",

        "title": "Trump reportedly wants a 21-gun salute for his departure. The military honor has a fascinating history",
        "body_text": "As President Donald Trump prepares to leave Washington, D.C. for a post-presidential life in Florida, he has indicated that he wants an elaborate sendoff.\n A color guard, a military band and a red carpet are among the pomp and circumstance under consideration, an administration official told CNN.\n Another idea that's being floated: a 21-gun salute.\n The 21-gun salute is one of the great honors bestowed on government and military officials, fired for heads of state, on the day of a US President's funeral and on Memorial Day.\n Here's the history behind the honor, and how it's used today.\n Gun salutes are rooted in the practices of early warriors, who would lay their weapons on the ground to honor the other party and signal that they came in peace.\n As warfare evolved, the tradition gave way to the cannon salute in the 14th century, according to the US Army Center of Military History.\n If a ship entering a foreign port wanted to demonstrate that it came in peace, it would fire its weapons from a safe distance -- an action that would leave the incoming ship defenseless for a period of time. Because reloading was a lengthy process, the gesture was a show of respect and a lack of hostile intentions.\n The incoming ship would typically fire seven times. The forts onshore, which had easier access to gunpowder, would welcome the ship by firing 21 times, three for each shot fired by the incoming ship. Though there are various hypotheses as to why those numbers were chosen -- from the idea that ships on board only had seven guns to the significance of the number seven in the Bible -- it's not entirely clear.\n As technology improved and warships became more robust, the ships at sea also began firing 21 times, the educational website Today I Found Out notes.\n By about 1730, what was once a symbolic gesture of peace had evolved into an official salute, according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs.\n The British navy began using the 21-gun salute on certain occasions to honor members of the royal family. By 1808, it was adopted as the standard salute for royalty, though the US wouldn't adopt it as its national salute until years later.\n In 1810, the US declared its national salute would consist of firing one shot for each state in the union. US military installations would fire the salute on Independence Day and whenever the President visited, the Army Benefits website Military OneSource states.\n But as the number of states in the union grew, the tradition became increasingly burdensome for foreign nations saluting the US and its officials. So by 1842, the US adopted the 21-gun salute as its presidential salute, the Center of Military History notes.\n In 1890, the US formally declared the 21-gun salute as its national salute. It's used today to honor the President, ex-Presidents and President-elect, as well as foreign heads of state or members of a royal family.\n The 21-gun salute is fired on Memorial Day and in honor of the US flag.\n Under the current tradition, 50 shots are still fired on Independence Day and after the lowering of the flag on the day a president, ex-president or president-elect is buried.\n The 21-gun salute is often confused with the three rifle volley, an honor displayed at military funerals -- but the two salutes are not the same.\n For the three rifle volley, an honor guard typically made up of seven members will fire three shots each at a fallen veteran's funeral. Though the result is 21 shots, those shots are fired from rifles, making that honor distinct from the 21-gun salute.\n The three rifle volley comes from a battlefield custom during European dynastic wars in which both sides would pause fighting in order to remove their dead, according to Military OneSource. Once the dead had been taken care of, three volleys would be fired to signal that battle could resume.",

        "title": "These coronavirus variants are keeping scientists awake at night",
        "body_text": "At least four new variants of the coronavirus are keeping scientists awake at night.\n One, first identified in southeast England, has now shown up in at least 50 countries and appears to be spreading more efficiently than older variations of the virus. Its appearance has frightened political leaders, who have closed borders and imposed travel restrictions in attempts to curb its spread.\n Others, identified in South Africa and Brazil, haven't traveled as far and wide but show a constellation of mutations that have grabbed the attention of geneticists.\n And then there is a new variation that's shown up in California that may or may not be driving renewed spread there.\n \"We don't get much sleep, to be honest, lately,\" said Dr. Christian Gaebler, a molecular immunologist at the Rockefeller University who is studying the body's immune response to coronavirus infection.\n So far, none has done what scientists most fear and mutated to the point that it causes more severe disease, or evades the protection provided by vaccination. While some of the new variants appear to have changes that look like they could affect immune response, it's only by a matter of degree.\n At the top of the list for researchers in the US is the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned last week it could worsen the spread of the pandemic.\n While there's nothing like the phrase \"mutant new virus\" to grab the attention, scientists say so far they are reassured by what they have found: The human immune system can handle the variants that have sprung up so far.\n \"It is not any more or less severe. It doesn't cause different rates of hospitalization or mortality,\" Gregory Armstrong, who directs the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at CDC, told CNN.\n \"As far as we know it is transmitted in exactly the same way.\"\n That means the same measures already known to reduce spread will also stop the new variants: mask use, social distancing, avoiding large groups or crowds and frequent handwashing.\n The mutations in the variant help it enter cells more easily -- which means if someone, says, breathes in a lungful of air that has virus particles in it, those particles are going to be more likely to infect some cells in the sinuses or lungs rather than bouncing off harmlessly. The changes enhance the spike protein that the viruses uses to attach to cells.\n Armstrong says the evidence that B.1.1.7 is more easily transmitted is compelling to him.\n For one thing, it took over in southeast England during a time when people were supposed to be in lockdown in November and December, infecting 50% more people than the older, so-called wild type virus variants.\n \"They also looked at what happens with the contacts of these people,\" he added. About 11 out of every 100 people in contact with someone infected with wild-type virus would themselves get infected.  \"But the contacts of people with B.1.1.7. 16 out of 100 would get sick,\" Armstrong said. \"Contacts of people with B.1.1.7 would get sicker at higher rates.\"\n Plus there's evidence people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant have what's known as a higher viral load -- they have more virus reproducing in their bodies. That makes sense if the variant infects cells more easily, because viruses hijack the cells they infect, turning them into virus factories. More infected cells equal more virus.\n But Armstrong discounts initial worries that the new variant infects children more easily. Britain left schools open during the lockdown that saw B.1.1.7 spread, he said, and that would easily explain why more children became infected.\n All this simply means people need to try harder to prevent spread until vaccination can be sped up.\n \"In order to interrupt transmission, we are going to need higher rates of what we do to slow transmission,\" Armstrong said. \"We are going to need to pay more attention to wearing masks. And we will need to increase vaccine coverage.\"\n Mike Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, doesn't have a lot of faith that people will do that.\n \"I do think that the B.1.1.7 is going to have a deadly impact of the number of new cases in 6-8 weeks,\" he said. \"Hope I'm wrong.\"\n So far, CDC has reports of 120 cases of people infected with B.1.1.7 in 20 states, although the agency says it's likely far more common than that. The US doesn't have many labs doing the testing needed to identify mutated versions of coronavirus.\n Biologist Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona said he's found evidence B.1.1.7 was imported at least five separate times to the US, and likely many more. \"It is striking that this lineage may already have been established in the US for some 5-6 weeks before B.1.1.7 was first identified as a variant of concern in the UK in mid-December,\" he wrote in a post on a website dedicated to sharing genetic information about the virus. \"And it may have been circulating in the US for close to two months before it was first detected, on 29 December 2020.\"\n A variant first seen in South Africa called B.1.351 or 501Y.V2, has a different pattern of mutations that causes more physical alterations in the structure of the spike protein than B.1.1.7 does. One important mutation, called E484K, appears to affect the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein most important for attaching to cells.\n It could help the virus partly escape the effects of vaccines. \"There is more concern about immune escape,\" Armstrong said. Vaccine makers and academic researchers are testing samples of this variant, along with others, to see if it can evade the immune response caused by vaccination.\n Dr. Michel Nussenzweig of Rockefeller University doesn't think so, however.\n He and colleagues have been studying the immune response to coronavirus infection and say the body produces hundreds of different types of antibodies to attack the virus.\n People are born with some of them, and once there is an infection, the immune response matures and becomes even better at targeting the virus, Nussenzweig's team reported in the journal Nature Monday.\n \"We have a reservoir of antibodies that are preformed,\" said Gaebler, who worked in the study.\n \"The immune system goes to that pool and sees what fits well. Once it finds those antibodies, it can refine them and make them even better.\"\n That should reassure people, Nussenzweig said. The human immune system adapts very well to viral mutations, he said, and produces hundreds of different antibodies that can attack coronavirus.\n \"For sure there is a breadth of different kinds of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. These kinds of things in plasma are likely to be resistant to the emerging mutations,\" Nussenzweig said.\n Vaccines produce a similar immune response to natural infection. So even if a new variant emerges with mutations that allow it to dodge some of the immune response, the body is producing antibodies that can see undisguised parts of the virus.\n Nonetheless, officials in South Africa say this variant is now the most common version of the coronavirus found in several areas. It's also common in neighboring Zambia and has been detected in 20 countries. It has not been found in the US yet.\n Two variants of concern have shown up first in Brazil. One, called P.1., has been found in 42% of specimens in one survey done in the Brazilian city of Manaus, and Japanese officials found the variant in four travelers from Brazil. \"The emergence of this variant raises concerns of a potential increase in transmissibility or propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals,\" CDC said. P.1 also carries the E484K mutation.\n P.2, also first seen in Brazil, caused a flurry of alarm when it turned up in Britain last week in 11 people.\n Finally, there's a new variant seen in California. \"We don't know yet what the significance of that one is,\" said Armstrong. It also has a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. The new California variant is called L425R and while it's being found commonly, it's not yet clear if it's more transmissible.\n Any viral strain can become more common because of what's known as the founder effect. \"The founder effect is a matter of a virus being in the right place at the right time,\" Armstrong said. If a particular strain happens to be circulating when transmission increases because of human behavior, that strain will ride along and become more common not because it spreads more easily, but simply because it was there.\n In a pre-print -- a study that's posted online but not reviewed by a medical or scientific journal -- a team at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles said they found this variant in 36% of samples taken from 192 patients at the hospital in late November and December, and in 24% of samples from southern California\n The California Department of Public Health said the variant was \"increasingly\" turning up around the state.\n Right now the US is doing a poor job of what's known as genomic surveillance, Armstrong said. \"We don't have gold standard sequencing-based surveillance like the UK has,\" Armstrong said.  That may explain why the UK spotted B.1.1.7 before the US did.\n Staffers who might be doing this kind of testing instead are running tests to diagnose coronavirus infections in people. \"State labs have just been overwhelmed. A lot of staff that were doing sequencing are doing PCR testing instead,\" he said.\n So the appearance of L425R may just be a function of labs in California starting to look for the variants and finding them.\n CDC is working to increase the capacity to do this kind of testing, stepping up efforts with state and local health departments, funding academic labs to do more testing and working on deals with commercial testing labs, Armstrong said. \"Within two to three weeks, we'll be getting 5,000 sequences a week from those companies,\" Armstrong said.\n It will take more study to show whether these variants can increase the already astronomical spread of the virus. The US has more than 24 million diagnosed cases and close to 400,000 deaths.",

        "title": "Biden transition team denies outgoing acting defense secretary transitional office space",
        "body_text": "The Biden transition team has declined to give outgoing acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller office space and resources for his transition out of the role, according to a Biden transition official.\n It is typically a courtesy to provide transitioning office space and resources to departing secretaries of defense, and the decision reflects the extraordinary bitterness of the presidential transition.\n \"Given Mr. Miller's acting capacity in that role, as well as reduced staffing and occupation of the Pentagon and auxiliary offices during Covid-19, we deemed it appropriate not to extend that perk in this instance,\" the official said. Miller was named acting secretary on November 9.\n CNN has asked the Department of Defense for comment. But the decision prompted a parting shot from an outgoing Trump administration official familiar with the transition.\n \"Excuses aside, the American people see this break in a long tradition of accommodation, proper records management, continuity of government and good manners for what it is: the last petty act of this transition's intransigent party,\" the official said.\n Tensions between the Biden transition and Trump's political appointees at the Pentagon simmered for weeks, coming to a head in late December when the transition team disputed suggestions from Pentagon officials who questioned the accuracy of the President-elect's assertion that the Department of Defense has refused to brief his team on the massive cyberattack on government agencies and major American technology and accounting companies. Unnamed Pentagon officials essentially accused Biden of lying when he was discussing the attack with reporters and said that the Defense Department \"won't even brief us, on many things.\"\n Earlier that month, Biden's transition team said that they had not agreed to a two-week break in critical transfer-of-power discussions with Pentagon officials, despite an assertion from the acting Defense secretary that both sides had agreed to take such a \"holiday pause.\" The tensions spilled into public view after Miller had said the incoming Biden team had agreed to a two-week holiday break in previously scheduled transition talks at the Pentagon.\n The strained relationship between the incoming and outgoing administrations has seen several controversial last minute moves.\n The National Security Agency said Sunday it was installing Trump National Security Council staffer Michael Ellis as its general counsel, after Miller ordered NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone to place the Trump loyalist into the role. The move is significant because the role of general counsel at the country's largest intelligence agency is a civil service position, not a political role, meaning it could be difficult for the Biden administration to remove Ellis. The strategy of trying to install political loyalists into career positions is known as \"burrowing\" in the government.\n Miller's appointment preceded a post-election purge that saw some of the senior-most Defense Department civilians ousted in a matter of days, including the leaders of the Defeat-ISIS task force, the top Pentagon officials overseeing policy and intelligence, and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, among others. The positions were quickly filled with individuals perceived as Trump loyalists.\n Miller has stated that he \"cannot wait to leave this job,\" according to a transcript released by the Department of Defense. The admission came as the Pentagon said at least 25,000 National Guard were being mobilized in Washington, DC, amid security concerns around this week's inauguration following the deadly riot at the US Capitol.\n CNN's Oren Liebermann, Jeff Zeleny, Sarah Mucha, Jeremy Herb and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "title": "What Hoover could teach Trump about Inauguration Day",
        "body_text": "Meg Jacobs teaches history at Princeton University. Follow her on Twitter @MegJacobs100. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\nFor most of the country's history, a peaceful transition of power has defined American democracy.  That does not mean we have always been a nation united. What marks Joe Biden's inauguration as different is not the disagreement among parties and peoples, but rather how the opposition expresses those differences.\n On March 4, 1933, President Herbert Hoover and President-elect Franklin Roosevelt sat next to each other in an open car in stony silence for the short ride from the White House to the Capitol for Roosevelt's inauguration. By this time, the two men despised each other. For the rest of his life, Hoover accused Roosevelt of driving the country deeper into the Great Depression and causing the banking panic that awaited the incoming executive. After the swearing-in, Hoover shook the new President's hand, boarded a train for New York -- and the two leaders never saw each other again.\n In the months between the election and the inauguration, a lame duck period of four months before the passage of the 20th Amendment that shortened the interregnum, Hoover warned that Roosevelt would be the death of the democracy. On the campaign trail, he predicted that if the Democrats won, \"the grass will grow in streets of a hundred cities, a thousand towns.\"\n \"When the American people realize some 10 years hence it was on November 8, 1932, that they surrendered the freedom of mind and spirit for which their ancestors had fought and agonized for over 300 years, they will, I hope, recollect, that at least I tried to save them,\" Hoover wrote privately to a friend after the election.\n On March 3, the day before the inauguration, instead of inviting the Roosevelts for the customary dinner, Hoover had them to the White House for tea. It did not go well. Roosevelt recalled, \"I hustled my family out of the room. I was sure Jimmy (his eldest son) wanted to punch him (Hoover) in the eye.\"\n But unlike President Donald Trump, who is leaving town before his successor takes the oath of office, Hoover still showed up the next day. He rode alongside Roosevelt, albeit miserably, down Pennsylvania Avenue to the inaugural ceremony, a moment captured indelibly in photographs with a joyless Hoover next to an ebullient Roosevelt. Hoover had called a special session of Congress to allow for the rapid approval of Roosevelt's Cabinet appointments. And he allowed for the smooth transfer of power, even as he felt certain the country would ignite into flaming embers.\n While most schoolchildren can tell you that Franklin Roosevelt was one of the most popular presidents of all time, elected four times over, that did not mean there was not a loyal opposition.\n Indeed, the leader of the opposition was Hoover himself. Hoover had come into office in 1929, the first president (and the last before Donald Trump) to have never held elective office or served in the military.  He had become a household name in World War I by organizing humanitarian relief to starving Europeans. An engineer by training, he used his technocratic skills to orchestrate tremendous voluntary efforts to help people in need from war-torn Europe to victims of the Mississippi flood of 1927. When he ran for office, he promised an end to poverty, and the country believed him.\n But then the stock market crash in 1929 and the desperate conditions of depression overcame his engineering skills. It was not long before the homeless built shantytowns they called Hoovervilles.\n As he had during the war, Hoover urged Americans to take up charity once again. And he urged businesses to retain workers and maintain wages. He also orchestrated loans to farmers and ailing banks, and, by the time he left office, Hoover even approved of loans to states for relief.\n But those measures were not enough. America needed more government, just like today. At the time of the 1932 election, there were some 13 million unemployed, a staggering one in four out of work. In big cities, the numbers were even worse. One in three residents in Chicago were unemployed. Even for those with jobs, their wages plummeted.\n Against this backdrop, Roosevelt won a staggering victory, by 7 million votes, promising Americans a \"New Deal.\"  That would come to include federal relief, public works, unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, labor protections, minimum wages, farm subsidies, public power, banking reform, lower tariffs, a departure from the gold standard and much more.\n All of which Roosevelt had mapped out on the campaign trail. If the details were murky, Roosevelt left no doubt that his approach would be a radical departure from Hoover's conservatism.\n And Hoover knew it. In fact, he did more than anyone else to warn about how radical this departure would be. In his last major campaign speech, at Madison Square Garden, Hoover declared, \"This campaign is ... more than a contest between two parties. It is a contest between two philosophies of government.\" He warned against \"so-called new deals which would destroy the very foundations of our American system.\"\n To clarify the stakes, Hoover later claimed that Roosevelt's approach would lead to tyranny, the same philosophy that had \"poisoned all Europe ... the fumes of a witch's cauldron which boiled in Russia.\"\n After his defeat and during the transition, Hoover unsuccessfully tried to shoehorn Roosevelt into extending his policies, which would have curtailed the New Deal. As banks across the nation failed, which would prompt Roosevelt to use authority to close them, Hoover refused to act. Hoover discouraged, and at times banned, his officials from meeting with the President-elect.\n As world events as troubling as the rise of European fascism were unfolding, Hoover seemed more focused on fighting with Roosevelt. Why? Because, presumably, he thought the domestic threat was larger.\n As he would later make clear, Hoover saw his successor as a fascist-like threat. In his memoirs, he held Roosevelt and the New Deal responsible for \"introduc(ing) to Americans the spectacle of Fascist dictation to business, labor, and agriculture.\"\n Hoover's main assertion was not only that Roosevelt was a fascist in his approach to the country's economy, but also that his very policies would fail and indeed prolong the economic crisis, destroying democracy in the process. That perspective shaped conservative opposition to the New Deal right away.\n In his inaugural address, Roosevelt, too, left no room for doubt that his would be a different style of leadership, the previous President having failed the country in its moment of need. His was a new leadership \"of frankness and vigor,\" a rejection of the \"false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit.\"\n In a promise of a different future, Roosevelt said, \"We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.\"\n All of this was exactly what Hoover feared. And he spent the rest of his life fighting against Roosevelt and the New Deal, at times with bombastic rhetoric.\n But this loyal opposition pales in comparison to today. Today we are witnessing something far different; disloyal is putting it too mildly. It is one thing to have profound policy differences and to fight for them through political channels -- even with fiery rhetoric; it is quite another to challenge the very institutions of democracy, including and above all else, the peaceful transition of power through popular elections.",

        "body_text": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book \"High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nDear Donald,\n When we first met in 2014, I was a year into research for the biography I was writing about you. I knew about your stern father, your exile to military school at a tender age and your tendency to spin dramatic fantasies. I knew that you considered life a battle for survival and humans to be \"vicious\" by nature.\n In your Trump Tower stronghold, you were attended by aides who looked like soap opera stars and surrounded by ego-boosting emblems: a wall of framed magazine covers, each featuring your face; a boxer's championship belt given to settle a debt; a stack of clippings delivered with a note that read, \"Dad, FYI -- All great press. Ivanka.\" These totems of greatness, which I haven't seen in the quarters of other super-rich Americans, made me think of you as desperately, and perhaps dangerously, insecure.\n In five interviews that lasted about 10 hours total, you would heighten my fear that despite a life spent in unending luxury and privilege, no amount of wealth and power would move you off the life-is-warfare view. Even worse, you told me that you might run for president because Twitter fans said you should (I wasn't surprised by your ambition and, given your celebrity, I thought you might win). Then, as we stood to inspect a framed letter you had received from the disgraced Richard Nixon, you said his only problem was that he had left office for the good of the country. In your view, he should have stayed and fought.\n You ran for president and you won. And as you visited upon the country more pain than Nixon ever did, you fought on. Unrelenting in your aggression, lies and cruelty, you presided over four years of chaos and conflict provoked by your words and deeds. Though impeached, you escaped conviction and stayed in office to redouble your commitment to ego-driven chaos.\n As you refused to mount a serious federal response, the Covid-19 death toll surpassed 400,000. Defeated in your bid for reelection, you spun lies that created an alternative reality so powerful that  hundreds of your followers formed a mob that carried out a bloody attack on the United States Capitol. Many there intended to overturn the election, which you had repeatedly claimed was invalid due to fraud that in fact had not occurred.\n In the attack, which was televised by news networks and livestreamed on social media, five people -- including one Capitol police officer -- would die.  A DC Metro Police officer, who had been Tasered several times, heard one of your followers say, \"Kill him with his own gun.\" Although Congress reconvened after the mob was driven out, you stand disgraced as the only president in US history to be impeached twice, and all I can think is that you had finally made your narcissistic nightmare of a constant battle against vicious enemies come true for us all.\n Your dangerous narcissism was not widely noted when I interviewed you, but it seemed, to me, to be the hallmark of your personality. I consulted experts and learned that this grandiosity was likely a defense mechanism against a fear of shame and rejection. I came to believe this fear was installed by your father, who, when you were a child, demanded you be a \"killer\" and a \"king.\" When you failed to meet his expectations and became a troublemaker, he exiled you to military school, at age 13. Talk about a scarring experience.\n The title of my book, \"Never Enough,\" pointed to your endless drive to prove your superiority, which, ironically, led to bankruptcies, divorces and legal defeats. It's likely these failures provoked the same sense of shame and humiliation that you must have felt as a rejected child. You once told me you hated to reflect on the past, but in refusing to do this, you were bound to repeat your mistakes. No matter how much you achieved, it was never enough. And so, you went too far. (For more on this see what your psychologist niece, Mary Trump, wrote in her 2020 book, \"Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man.\")\n As President, your weaknesses posed terrible threats to the country. Your many failures at running businesses such as casinos or the airline Trump Shuttle showed that you were not a nimble thinker capable of leading complex operations. The Covid-19 pandemic has only made this glaring incompetence crystal clear -- and despite your efforts to deflect the blame, the country's death toll speaks for itself. More than 400,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States -- more than any other country in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n Having seen your inability to recognize others as human beings, I have not been shocked by your indifference to the deaths of your fellow citizens. Nor have I been surprised by your encouragement of violence. Violence was what I always expected from your presidency. I just didn't know what form it would take.\n The power of your methods was obvious during your 2016 campaign, when you lied in a way that separated your most ardent followers from reality itself.  You promoted many of your old conspiracy theories about 9/11 and climate change and added new ones on the fly. (When an attendee asked -- after first stating as fact that Obama was Muslim and not American -- about the wildly untrue idea that Muslims were running secret training camps in the United States to kill people, you refused to shoot down his claims, promising instead to \"look at that.\"\n You also whipped people into a frenzy of hatred by describing opponents, critics and the free press as enemies. I recalled reading how your first wife, Ivana, had said you kept a book of Hitler's speeches near your bed. You once corrected a reporter, telling her it was \"Mein Kampf\" instead (though Marty Davis, who gave Trump the book, told Vanity Fair it was a book of speeches).\n For four years in office, you functioned as a kind of anti-President, inflaming rather than calming passions and attacking rather than negotiating, all while demanding adoration from your Cabinet and constant attention from the media. Having ordered aides to think of each day as an episode in a TV show before you even took office, you tried to gin up as much drama as possible.\n As President, you used the authority of your office to spread baseless claims about voter fraud, former President Barack Obama and even of a friendship between former President Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sexual predator who was your Palm Beach neighbor and friend, to name a few. Many of your followers abandoned reason and dove headfirst into the QAnon conspiracy theory movement, which reveres you as a savior and regards the government and much of the news media as evil. Many of those who attacked the Capitol brandished Q symbols along with Trump flags, Jesus banners and the Confederate stars and bars -- a mix of powerful symbols that shows the breadth of your influence.\n Before the attack, you were among many who called for a big crowd of protesters to stop the Congress from affirming your election defeat. After your lawyer Rudy Giuliani, your namesake son ginned up the crowd, and they heard you call for them to march on the Capitol.\n \"You have to show strength,\" you said, \"and you have to be strong.\"  You promised to go with them but chose instead to view the destruction on TV. I wondered if you understood that the violence that unfolded was real, and not something made for television. Did you order Cokes as you watched? Did you eat popcorn?\n I can imagine you snacking because you have played with violence, both real and imagined, for so long that you must be inured you to it. It all started back in the 1970s when you began employing armed guards-chauffeurs, for no apparent reason. I think it was because you enjoyed the sense of menace they added to your presence.\n During your 2016 campaign one of your security guards roughed-up a picketer outside Trump Tower in New York, while another physically forced reporter Jorge Ramos out of a news conference in 2015. At one rally you told followers, \"If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them.\"  When a loud protester disrupted one of your other campaign rallies, you said, \"I'd like to punch him in the face.\"\n Your tough guy image was embraced by followers who traded memes in which you were drawn to look like a superhero or shown brandishing weapons Rambo-style. Your avatar punched out a figure labeled with the CNN logo. Add this to the bigotry you expressed in words and images, which you shared with millions of people on Twitter, and a combustible mix was created. (Remember posting an image of Hillary Clinton, along with a Star of David set against dollar bills, brandishing her the \"most corrupt candidate ever?\").\n The atmosphere of bigotry you helped create exploded in Charlottesville in 2017 as men chanted \"Jews will not replace us\" before a White supremacist murdered a counterprotester by running her down with his car.\n Heather Heyer was one of the first civilians to die in this charged political context during your presidency. It did not change your behavior. Instead, you declared there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" By delaying your condemnation of her attackers and resisting efforts to remove monuments to those who fought against the United States to preserve slavery, you sent clear signals about your views on race and violence.\n With Charlottesville, questions about your bigotry grew louder. You made your stance clear when you reportedly said Haitian immigrants \"all have AIDS\" (though the White House denied it), and that people were entering the US from \"shithole\" countries. Add your vicious comments about Black athletes calling out police brutality, your penchant for slamming individual Black women, and your fearmongering about low-income housing, and everyone understood your perspective. Three years into your presidency, 65% of Black Americans said it's \"a bad time to be a Black person\" in the United States, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll.\n It would have been bad enough if your bigotry had been confined to words, but you enshrined it in policy by restricting refugees from entering this country. This led to a sharp decline, from about 85,000 refugees admitted to the United States in 2016 to about 12,000 in 2020. If the \"huddled masses yearning to breathe free\" didn't get the message, then they could consider the way you cozied up to strongmen, the likes of which many of them were fleeing. From Kim Jong Un of North Korea to Russian President Vladimir Putin, you showed a consistent admiration for dictators who jail and kill their critics.\n Along our border with Mexico, you began separating children from parents who arrived seeking asylum. By May 2019, six children had died in federal custody. In June of that year, Americans were shocked by the photo of a father and child who had drowned attempting to cross the Rio Grande. In December, a surveillance video obtained by ProPublica showed a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy was left alone in his Border Patrol cell in Texas for hours before he died on the floor, of complications from the flu.\n How many minors died in Border Patrol custody during the four years prior to your administration? Zero, per FactCheck.org.\n The deaths were just one measure of the suffering your harsh policies inflicted on asylum-seeking families. New data from June 2019 reveals there were around 5,500 known cases of children, from infants to teens, being separated from their parents and placed in facilities ranging from foster family homes to cells made out of chain link fencing.\n Amid all this pain, it seemed you still weren't satisfied. You asked about building anti-immigrant moats to be stocked with alligators. You wondered whether soldiers could shoot immigrants who threw rocks. Those ideas were nixed, but the crisis continues. Because of inept recording-keeping, your administration has not been able locate the parents of at least 545 children, according to court documents from last October.\n Refugee families, stuck in limbo while waiting for asylum in the United States, are still filling squalid camps on the Mexican side of the border, many of them fearing for their lives -- particularly in the midst of a global pandemic.\n You got away with cruelty in part because you conditioned many Americans to believe that brown-skinned, undocumented immigrants constituted a criminal horde that required a draconian response.\n You promised to build a \"beautiful\" concrete border wall along 1,000 miles of the frontier and force Mexico to pay for it.\n Only about 452 miles of tall steel fence has been completed as of January 5, 2021, according to a Customs and Border Patrol Report, and instead of the $8 billion you estimated for 1,000 miles, $18 billion dollars have already been devoted to the work because -- surprise! -- Mexico is not paying for it.\n Hyping the wall was just one example of the exaggerations, false claims and lies that came out of your mouth in such a torrent it was nearly impossible for anyone to react properly. You combined this strategy with denigrating the media as \"enemies of the people\" and purveyors of \"fake news\" with such consistency that facts seemed to lose their power. You added an Orwellian flourish when you said, \"What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\"\n What has been the effect on journalists? Threats became a part of our daily lives and the lives of our family members. (One of your followers found my wife's business phone number and called to say that he had located our address and to suggest we be careful.) A \"press freedom tracker\" run by the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Freedom of the Press Foundation has counted 421 attacks on journalists during your time in office.\n Far worse than the impact on journalists is your effect on Americans' ability to agree upon an established set of facts as they consider critical issues. You are not solely to blame for this problem. However, you have both contributed to it and exploited it. You have made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims, according to The Washington Post, which have landed with the authority that comes with the presidential seal.\n The easy way out for someone mired in disinformation is to pick a person to believe and go all in. Many of those who doubled down on their support for you found a sense of belonging amid the slogans, regalia and fervent rallies. They felt they were right. Those who disagreed were not fellow citizens but enemies who, some concluded, should be defeated by violent means.\n The loyalty of your followers meant that ordinary politicians feared provoking the ire of your base. When it came to light that you were trying to coerce Ukraine's President into helping your reelection effort, you were impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But this fear helped keep the Republican-controlled Senate in line, and you were acquitted. Afterward, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine defended her vote to acquit you, saying you had learned \"a big lesson.\" What you learned, it seemed, was that you could get away with anything. Even before you were elected, you claimed you could \"stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,\" and not lose voters.\n Shortly after the impeachment trial wrapped up, you proceeded to mislead the American people about the novel coronavirus. You downplayed the dangers of the virus so that the vibrant economy, the main bragging point of your presidency, would continue to hum. In late February, at a White House coronavirus task force briefing, you said \"It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for.\" But you told journalist Bob Woodward weeks before that the coronavirus was \"more deadly than your -- you know, your, even your strenuous flus.\" Nevertheless, you declined to organize a true national response and undermined public health officials who urged everyone to wear face masks.\n You also held mass rallies where people were infected. On May 8, when the death toll was more than 77,000, you continued this charade, insisting, \"This is going to go away without a vaccine.\" To say that people died as a result of your posture is not mere speculation. Families have told stories of those who followed your lead, got sick and died. Harvard epidemiologists estimate that thousands have died as a result of your example.\n Today the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage the country. The death toll is now roughly equivalent to a 9/11 each day -- but many of your acolytes, even in Congress, still refuse to protect themselves and others with facemasks. Meanwhile, millions are turning to food banks. Mass evictions loom.\n When I consider the hungry, the infected, the traumatized and the deceased and hold in my mind the images of the deadly mob at the Capitol, I hear your voice summoning the worst in my fellow citizens. With those words you truly established yourself as the anti-President, a distinction that cancels any claim you might make to the respect normally accorded the office.\n When we met you told me to call you \"Don,\" as if we were friends. You also invited me to examine your hair. I didn't do either because I sensed that you wanted to establish a bond that you would eventually try to corrupt. This was confirmed when you hinted that my book could make me rich if I abandoned my professional duty and wrote it to your liking.\n Thankfully, enough Americans recognized your immorality and incompetence and lack of human feeling so profound that the suffering and death so much a part of your presidency didn't appear to affect you at all. They chose Joe Biden in November, making you truly accountable for perhaps the first time in your life.\n After four years of your chaos, what's left is a wounded country grieving for its dead and for its innocence. But we will recover, and you now face criminal and legal threats in state courts, along with the harsh judgment of history.\n As you desperately summon the remains of your following for comfort and fundraising, your disgrace is growing with the mounting evidence that your words motivated the mob that attacked the United States Capitol. This incitement may be the single worst thing a president has ever done, and it will define you for centuries to come.",

        "title": "'Several dozen' of Trump's pardons pushed by criminal justice reform groups, source says",
        "body_text": "Several dozen of President Donald Trump's final slate of more than 100 pardons and commutations will be doled out to individuals whose cases have been championed by criminal justice reform advocates, a source close to the process tells CNN.\n Trump's final acts of clemency come after a scramble in recent days among criminal justice reform advocates and several White House officials to finalize the list and convince Trump to approve the actions. These pardons will undoubtedly be overshadowed by the slew of controversial ones Trump is also expected to issue in the same final batch on Tuesday.\n During the President's final hours in office, there is a frantic scramble happening behind the scenes on whether to grant former campaign strategist Steve Bannon a pardon as Trump finalizes the list with his attorneys and top aides. One concern is Bannon's possible connection to the January 6 riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n Throughout the day, Trump has continued to contemplate pardons that aides believed were settled, including for his former strategist.\n Trump has continued to go back and forth on it into Tuesday night, sources told CNN.\n While outgoing Presidents typically issue a raft of 11th-hour pardons before leaving office, Trump has proven more willing to use his pardon power to brazenly reward political loyalty, the wealthy and well-connected and those who did not cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n According to three people familiar with the matter, the clemency actions will include white-collar criminals, high-profile rappers and others but -- as of now -- is not expected to include Trump himself.\n The January 6 riots that led to Trump's second impeachment have complicated his desire to pardon himself, his kids and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and a source close to the process said those are no longer expected.\n After the riot, advisers encouraged Trump to forgo a self-pardon because it would appear like he was guilty of something, according to one person familiar with the conversations. Several of Trump's closest advisers have also urged him not to grant clemency to anyone involved in the siege on the US Capitol, despite Trump's initial stance that those involved had done nothing wrong.\n But only Trump knows what he will do with his last bit of presidential power before he is officially out of office at noon on January 20.\n Other attention-grabbing names, such as Julian Assange, are also not currently believed to among the people receiving pardons, but the list is still fluid and that could change, too.\n \"There's no crazy pardons,\" the source said, noting that White House counsel Pat Cipollone has been \"direct and strong\" in advising Trump against a self-pardon.\n After weeks focusing on contesting the election and reeling from the fallout of the January 6 insurrection, Trump finally snapped back to attention on pardons in recent days, one source said.\n \"You couldn't get the President to focus on this,\" a source close to the process said of Trump in recent weeks. \"And then this weekend, he didn't have his Twitter, he didn't have all these other distractions.\"\n Trump, who sank deeper into lame duck status in recent weeks, was reminded that his pardon power is one of the remaining undiminished aspects of his presidential power.\n This source said Trump also resonated with cases in which individuals who went to trial got significantly more prison time than co-defendants who cooperated with law enforcement.\n \"I don't think he likes when people get screwed just because they go to trial,\" this source said.\n While Jared Kushner has been closely involved in pardons throughout his time at the White House, this source said that Ivanka Trump became much more closely involved in the push for pardons in recent days.\n Together, Kushner and Ivanka Trump worked with the White House counsel's office and Department of Justice while also working to convince Trump to support a series of clemency actions in the vein of criminal justice reform.\n After meetings this weekend, Trump met again with his daughter, son-in-law and other White House officials on Monday to finalize the list of clemency actions.",

        "title": "Up to 100 mph wind gusts rip through California as dangerous Santa Ana winds raise fire risk",
        "body_text": "Tens of thousands of residents across several California counties were without power Tuesday as officials aim to reduce fire risk from the powerful Santa Ana winds roaring through the region.\n More than 11 million residents, from the central coast into southern California, were under red flag warnings due to winds exacerbating fire risks. And nearly 150,000 customers were already without power Tuesday from a combination of downed trees and power lines, and utilities proactively shutting off power to prevent fires.\n Two brush fires were reignited in the footprint of the CZU Lightning Complex that burned through parts of Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties over the summer.\n The North Butano Fire is currently burning within the scar left by the 86,000 acre wildfire, according to Cal Fire spokeswoman Cecile Juliette. The CZU Lightning Complex burned actively for over a month after being sparked by a lightning storm in mid-August. Nearly 1,500 homes and other buildings were destroyed and one person was killed in the wildfire.\n \"Having fires like this is very unusual for January,\" Juliette tells CNN. \"We've had barely any rain this year.\"\n Sometimes embers from a large wildfire can \"hide\" under the litter from the trees, and when the wind blows, the embers smoldering underground get lifted up and ignite dry brush, Juliette explained.\n The wind storm has knocked down several trees, blocking firefighter's access the put out the flames.\n Winds in the highest elevation of the High Sierra had topped 100 mph on Tuesday. Strong gusts of over 50 mph were reported at San Francisco International Airport.\n Several hurricane-force wind gusts in the mountains of Ventura and Los Angeles counties in Southern California were reported Tuesday. The cause of the high winds: The combination of a developing storm off the California coast, and strong high pressure building across the Western US.\n Winds were expected to slowly diminish on Wednesday.\n On Monday, wind gusts of more than 90 mph were reported from Sacramento to the Bay Area, with one gust reaching 100 mph near Kirkwood, east of Sacramento. A 90 mph wind gust was even reported in Tahoe, with winds well over 60 mph stretching up and down the coast.\n To put that in perspective, a Category 1 hurricane's winds are 74 to 95 mph and Category 2 winds are 96 to 110 mph. This means, wind gusts in California could reach speeds equivalent to a strong Category 2 hurricane.\n Tuesday's Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) could affect at least 280,000 customers -- mostly in Los Angeles and Ventura counties but extending to customers in Fresno, Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, and Tulare counties -- the utility company Southern California Edison (SCE) warned.\n According to SCE, \"When there is a high risk for a wildfire, we may temporarily shut off power to your neighborhood to prevent our electric system from becoming the source of ignition.\"\n Dry, hot and windy conditions combined with problems with power lines have contributed to massive fire outbreaks in the recent past, including the deadly 2018 Camp fire.\n \"With nearly 80% of the Western US experiencing drought conditions, the area is akin to a tinderbox,\" CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said.\n The Southern California region could see winds exceeding 50 miles per hour Tuesday, while further north could get gusts reaching up to 100 mph, the National Weather Service said.\n There are more than half a dozen other brush fires burning in the area, the largest, dubbed the Freedom Fire, is about 40 acres and has led to the evacuation of approximately 100 nearby homes just north of the city of Watsonville. So far, there have been no reports of injuries or significant damage.\n The winds could be the strongest wind event of the season, forecasters say -- which could make a blaze even more dangerous.\n \"The combination of dry fuels and tropical storm force winds could lead to downed trees and power lines, thus any ignition of new fires would flourish and rapidly expand under these conditions,\" Javaheri said.\n Many locations across Southern California, including Los Angeles, have not seen measurable rain since the end of December, meaning the vegetation across the region has had over two weeks to dry out.\n Southern California has also experienced record heat over the last several days, in addition to the growing drought across the region.\n And the wind expected to reach the region is the kind only seen every three years, the National Weather Service of San Diego said.\n \"So it is likely to cause some mayhem with palm fronds and the like. Secure loose outdoor objects,\" the NWS said.\n Nearly 30 million Californians, or about 3 of every 4 people in the state, could see high winds through Tuesday, Javaheri said.\n With warmer temperatures and less consistent rainfall, wildfire conditions are becoming more dangerous and occurring more frequently. Areas burned by wildfire are increasing in the US, particularly across the Western states.\n The annual burned areas in the Western US could increase two to six times from current levels, according to the US National Climate Assessment.\n \"What is currently happening in CA is a perfect example of how Wildfire season has increased in length throughout the Western US,\" says CNN meteorologist and climate expert Brandon Miller.\n While Santa Ana wind events generally occur from October to March, typically, only the early months present dangerous fire weather.\n \"By January, the Western states should be well into the rainy season and moisture levels would be high enough to keep the fire threat low,\" says Miller.\n With the record-breaking fire seasons over the last several years, \"Firefighters in California no longer refer to a 'fire season', but rather a 'fire year,' since climate change has increased the length of the season on both sides,\" Miller said.\n There could be a sliver of good news later in the week because as the windstorm moves out through Southern California on Wednesday it could leave a parting gift of moisture, Javaheri said.\n A low-pressure system developing off the coast could bring cooler temperatures and higher humidity values. And increased moisture could mean weather to quench the parched Southwest region.\n In Arizona, Phoenix had a 242-day streak without precipitation and Yuma a 110-day one until both cities saw rainy days on December 10.\n Lowering the widespread drought across the region could mean relief from possible fire conditions.\n CNN's Haley Brink contributed to this report.",

        "title": "What happens to Mike Pence now?",
        "body_text": "If an alien landed on Earth today, he/she/it could be forgiven if they assumed that Mike Pence was the president of the United States.\n After all, Pence has been fulfilling that role more and more in the final weeks of Donald Trump's presidency, as the 45th president has retreated more and more into his own conspiracy-theory cocoon.\n In fact, it will be Pence, not Trump, on the dais on the West Front of the US Capitol on Wednesday as Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president of the United States.\n (Trump will abscond to Mar-a-Lago early Wednesday, becoming the first president since Andrew Johnson not to attend the inauguration of his successor.)\n It's uniquely possible that these last few weeks will be the best it gets for Pence. That his role as the sort of de facto president after the real one decided he was no longer interested in the job will be the acme of a political career that once seemed to have so much promise.\n Pence staked his political future on Trump when he agreed to be the billionaire businessman's second-in-command in 2016. Pence was facing a surprisingly serious reelection challenge -- although he was still favored to win -- but saw a shortcut to the top of the Republican pile if Trump happened to win.\n And Pence spent almost the entirety of Trump's term trying to make good on his gamble -- defending the President at every turn (and oftentimes against his own past moral convictions) in order to be at the front of the line to inherit the Trump coalition in 2024 or 2028.\n Then that all ended -- in a flash -- when Pence refused to bend the Constitution to its breaking point (as Trump wanted) in order to somehow invalidate the results of the 2020 election.\n \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\" Trump tweeted amid the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (Some of the rioters were heard chanting \"Hang Mike Pence!\")\n \"The whole Pence team is still very much shaken up by the attempts on his life just two weeks ago, and seems like they are more head-down, focused-on-the-day-job than ever (long one of his tactics for surviving last four years), so future talks kind of froze up after January 6,\" explained Tom LoBianco, who wrote \"Piety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House.\"\n LoBianco adds that the Pences remain undecided on whether to stay in DC or move back to Indiana in the coming months: \"I was hearing Indiana, but have been hearing more now that they stick around DC,\" he said.\n That uncertainty in where they live is reflective of the broader lack of clarity surrounding Pence's future.\n Politically speaking, Pence is a man without a country. He is FAR too Trump-y for those within the GOP who want a clean break from the soon-to-be-former president. And he is not Trump-y enough for the diehard adherents of the 45th president.\n That no-man's land is a very tough place to be politically as the Republican Party begins to turn -- and this is already happening -- to the fight for its future (and the 2024 nomination).",

He worked as hard as anyone I've ever known and he treated those he encountered with great respect...and he took me to work a lot. For all these things, I am very grateful. Rest In Peace,\" Daron Sutton tweeted.\n \"Today we lost a great ballplayer, a great broadcaster and, most importantly a great person,\" said Dodgers President Stan Kasten. \"Don left an indelible mark on the Dodger franchise during his 16 seasons in Los Angeles and many of his records continue to stand to this day.\"\n MLB Commissioner Robert D. Manfred said Sutton \"represented our game with great class.\"\n \"The longtime Dodger was a four-time All-Star, a top-five finisher in Cy Young Award balloting for five consecutive years, a World Series participant four times in a nine-season span, and a model of durability on the mound,\" Manfred said.\n Along with the Dodgers, Sutton pitched for the Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics and the California Angels.\n \"Sutton, a member of the #Brewers Wall of Honor, will always be remembered as a key contributor to the beloved 1982 American League championship team,\" the Brewers tweeted.\n Sutton was born in Clio, Alabama, in 1945, and made his big-league debut in March 1966 with the Dodgers.\n During his time in the MLB, he won 324 games, pitched 58 shutouts and struck out 3,574 batters -- the seventh most in MLB history, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n Sutton also didn't miss his turn in the pitching rotation over a span of 756 starts -- the third-most all-time in MLB history.\n \"Did not miss a turn in the starting rotation due to illness or injury,\" Sutton's plaque in the Hall of Fame reads. \"Consistency and model control led to 15 or more wins in 12 seasons and 100 or more strikeouts 21 times.\"\n Following his playing career, Sutton worked as a broadcaster for several teams, notably the Atlanta Braves. Sutton called Braves games on TV and radio for almost 30 years.\n \"Don was as feared on the mound as he was beloved in the booth. A 300-game winner who was a four-time All-Star, Don brought an unmatched knowledge of the game and his sharp wit to his calls,\" the Braves said in a statement. \"But despite all the success, Don never lost his generous character or humble personality.\"\n The club inducted Sutton into the Braves Hall of Fame in 2015.\n CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Variant might partially evade protection from vaccines or prior infection, early research suggests",
        "body_text": "A new study suggests someone might be able to get infected with one of the new variants of the coronavirus even if they've had Covid-19 before or have been vaccinated.\n The variant was first spotted in South Africa in October and has now been found in more than a dozen countries.\n \"I think we should be alarmed,\" said Penny Moore, associate professor at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa and the senior author of the study.\n \"Based on Penny's data, it's likely that the vaccine is going to be somewhat less effective, but how much less effective we don't know,\" said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center.\n Montefiori added that this is the first study that gives him serious doubt about whether prior infection or a vaccine will protect against a new coronavirus variant.\n \"This is the first time I've been concerned about a variant partially evading the immune response and partially evading the vaccine,\" he said.\n Both experts emphasized that people should still get the vaccine. It's extremely effective against other forms of the virus and they think it likely will still give some level of protection against the new variant as well.\n The study was posted on a pre-print server and has not been peer-reviewed and published in a medical journal.\n This is one of the first reports to look at the variant's effect on antibody potency. Labs around the world are furiously studying the issue and expect to report results within the next few weeks.\n \"I worry desperately in the next six to 12 weeks we're going to see a situation with this pandemic unlike anything we've seen yet to date. And that is really a challenge that I don't think most people realize yet,\" Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota and a member of President-elect Joe Biden's Transition Covid-19 Advisory Board, told CNN's New Day.\n In the study, Moore and her colleagues took blood from 44 people who'd had Covid-19. Nearly all of their cases were confirmed to have occurred prior to September, which is before the variant was spotted in South Africa.\n The researchers then looked to see whether their antibodies would fight off the new variant.\n For about half of the 44 people, their antibodies were powerless against the new variant.\n \"We saw a knockout,\" Moore said. \"It was a scary result.\"\n For the other half, the antibody response was weakened, but not totally knocked out.\n The analysis showed that the strongest antibody response was from those who had suffered more severe cases of Covid-19, and therefore had developed a stronger antibody response after their illnesses.\n The culprits were mutations in two different parts of the spikes that sit atop the coronavirus. The vaccines work by targeting those spikes.\n \"It was a two-armed escape from the immune system,\" Moore said.\n Moore emphasized that these are results in the lab, and studies need to be done to see if people who've previously had Covid-19 get re-infected with the new variant.\n The antibody assays did not measure other immune responses, such as T-cell responses, that are generated by previous infections and vaccines.\n Moore's team is now gathering blood from people who've been vaccinated to see if their antibodies can fight off the new variant.\n \"I think the data on people with prior infection raises all kinds of red flags for the vaccines,\" she said. \"We have to test it to find out.\"\n Montefiori, the Duke virologist, agrees.\n \"I don't have any reason to think the results with people who've been vaccinated will be any different than with the people who had prior infection,\" he said.\n For several reasons, Montefiori thinks the vaccine will likely take a hit -- but probably not a huge one.\n t\n First, the two vaccines authorized for use in the US work very well, so even if the new variant puts up a fight, the reduction in vaccine efficacy likely won't be devastating.\n \"We have to remember, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 95% effective -- that's an extraordinary level of efficacy,\" Montefiori said. \"If it reduces to 90, 80, 70% effective, that is still very, very good and likely to have a major impact on the pandemic.\"\n Also, while surveillance in South Africa shows the new variant is becoming the dominant variant in the country, Montefiori points out that it's been found only in small numbers in 13 other countries.\n The UK, which has a very aggressive surveillance system, has found 45 people with the new variant, according to GISAID, an independent data-sharing initiative. Botswana has seen six cases; Japan has seen five; there have been four cases spotted in Germany; two each in France, Australia, Switzerland and Finland; and one each in Sweden, South Korea, Norway, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n Also, getting vaccinated might trigger a stronger antibody response than infection.\n Monday, researchers at Sheba Medical Center in Israel announced that an analysis of blood from 102 hospital employees who'd received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine showed their mean antibody levels were higher than those found in people who'd recovered from severe Covid-19. That study has not been peer reviewed, published or posted online.\n \"That's very good news,\" Moore said.\n While scientists work out what effect the variant might have on the vaccine, experts advise that prevention, such as wearing a mask and social distancing, is the best course for bringing Covid-19 rates down -- that and and getting a vaccine when you can.\n Amir Tal and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report",

        "title": "'A vote of conscience': GOP senators signal that Trump's fate is in their hands",
        "body_text": "A wide range of Senate Republicans are noncommittal about whether they are considering convicting Donald Trump of committing high crimes and misdemeanors at his upcoming impeachment trial, a sign that the soon-to-be former President's political future rests squarely with his fellow Republicans who are weighing whether to hold him accountable for the deadly riot in the Capitol this month.\n As the Senate reconvened Tuesday for the first time since the pro-Trump mob ransacked the Capitol on January 6, a number of top Republicans pointedly refused to say if they'd consider convicting Trump for his role in inciting the crowd, trying to subvert the will of voters and lying for months about widespread fraud in the elections. Yet an outspoken faction of their colleagues warned their party not to take such a drastic step of forbidding Trump from ever holding office again, while other Republicans contended that convicting a former President would be unconstitutional, giving them a way to argue for acquittal while also criticizing Trump's conduct.\n In interviews, several Republicans claimed they were keeping an open mind -- a sign that it remains far too early to know whether 17 Republicans would break ranks and join 50 Democrats to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection. How Republicans ultimately vote will come down to a mix of factors: The strength of the case brought by House Democrats, how the President's team mounts its defense and, perhaps most importantly, the mood of the country at the moment it comes time to cast the decisive votes.\n \"I've heard people talk about a vote of conscience, and I think that's a good way to put it,\" Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's leadership team, told reporters on Tuesday.\n The GOP positioning is another indication that Republican senators' posture toward Trump's second impeachment is markedly different than last year's trial, when virtually all GOP senators steadfastly aligned themselves with the President after the House impeached him over charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress.\n This time, though, many GOP senators are disgusted at Trump's conduct as he cast doubt about the election results and fed lies to his supporters that Biden didn't actually win, ultimately leading to the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol as Congress was certifying Biden's electoral victory. There's wide expectation that the vote to convict will almost certainly be a bipartisan one and could very likely gain more than the support of just Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the lone Republican who voted to convict Trump on the abuse of power charge in 2020, but who says he's undecided now. Still, getting to 17 Republican defectors remains an open question.\n South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP whip who was critical of the doomed efforts by Trump allies to overturn the election in Congress, has been viewed as a potential swing vote. On Tuesday, Thune, who is up for reelection next year and is close to McConnell, punted when asked if the President committed impeachable offenses.\n \"It sounds like we're going to have a trial to examine that, and like all senators, I'll fulfill my constitutional duty and listen intently to the evidence, and we will come to the conclusion,\" Thune said.\n Others took similar positions.\n Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican up for reelection next year, told CNN that he would \"do his duty\"  but refused to cast judgment on Trump's actions.\n \"I'm focused on the very near term, which is a peaceful transition of power,\" Young said. \"I just spent a week traveling around the state of Indiana. That's really what's on people's minds. They were rattled, to put it mildly, by the events of January 6, and I've done my best to be part of the near-term healing and rebuilding of trust, and in trying to help people process that.\"\n McConnell, who has privately indicated he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses but said he would listen to the arguments in the impeachment trial before settling on a decision, set the tone on Tuesday when he pointedly blamed Trump for playing a key role in inciting the mob.\n \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"They were provoked by the President and other powerful people. And they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like. But we pressed on.\"\n The Senate's second impeachment trial for Trump, which could begin within days, will force Republicans to go on the record one more time about how they view the outgoing President. If 67 senators convict Trump, they then could vote to bar him from running for office again by a simple majority of senators.\n GOP senators close to Trump are warning that such as vote could backfire on the GOP, where Trump still holds significant sway among the base.\n \"It will destroy the party,\" Graham predicted when asked about a successful vote to convict Trump. \"The Republican Party wants to move forward.\"\n Congressional aides and senators have spent the past several days digging into the question about whether the impeachment trial is constitutional, with many concluding that there are arguments to make the case on either side. A number of other Republicans are making a constitutional case against the trial itself. That argument -- that the proceedings are unconstitutional -- could give GOP senators a way to argue that the President's conduct was improper without casting a politically tough vote to convict him.\n \"Why are we doing this when the President is out of office?\" asked Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, who said Tuesday she didn't think it was constitutional. \"I have read arguments on both sides, but he is not our President after tomorrow.\"\n The House Democratic impeachment managers -- and many other constitutional scholars -- argue that it's constitutional to move forward with an impeachment trial of a former President. While it would be unprecedented for the Senate to convict an ex-president, they point to precedent where the Senate has asserted it has the constitutional right to try former federal officers.\n \"We need to set a precedent that the severest offense ever committed by a President will be met by the severest remedy provided by the Constitution,\" Schumer said Tuesday. \"Impeachment and conviction by this chamber as well as disbarment from future office.\"\n For members up for reelection in 2022, the question of convicting Trump becomes even harder. Many members are running in states that Trump won. And some of those members have made it clear that they will weigh conviction with the question of what is best for uniting the country.\n \"My answer to anything that doesn't relate to the inauguration is I'll talk to you after the inauguration,\" said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who is playing a central role in preparing for the Wednesday event but who also faces voters next year.\n And some of Trump's Hill allies wouldn't lay out their thinking on Tuesday.\n \"I got to wait 'til I hear the evidence,\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior Senate Republican, said Tuesday when asked if he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses.\n The timing of the Senate trial remains in flux, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the article of impeachment to the Senate.\n The impending trial gives Republicans some control over delaying Biden's agenda, if they choose to. While Democrats will control the Senate after Wednesday, Republicans can slow down the Senate so that it cannot conduct an impeachment trial and confirm Biden's nominees at the same time.\n On Tuesday, Cornyn told reporters that he did not believe Republicans would be agreeing to divide the days in half so that the Senate could approve Biden's Cabinet nominees in the morning and then move to an impeachment trial each afternoon. Doing so would require 100 senators to agree, which, Cornyn said, \"is not going to be possible.\"\n \"It's Nancy Pelosi's choice because once she sends the article of impeachment over, it displaces all other business,\" Cornyn said. \"If she wants to delay the confirmation of President Biden's nominees to Cabinet positions and prevent President Biden from asking for and receiving additional Covid-19 relief, that would be one way to do it, so they have a big decision to make.\"\n With so much uncertainty ahead, even some Republicans viewed as likely to convict have refused to show their hands.\n \"I'm going to wait and see the evidence as it's presented,\" Romney told CNN.\n CNN's Donald Judd, Ali Zaslav and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Experts have uncovered the remains of a gigantic dinosaur in Argentina, and believe it could be one of the largest creatures to have ever walked the Earth.\n Paleontologists discovered the fossilized remains of a 98 million-year-old titanosaur in Neuqu\u00e9n Province in Argentina's northwest Patagonia, in thick, sedimentary deposits known as the Candeleros Formation.\n The 24 vertebrae of the tail and elements of the pelvic and pectoral girdle discovered are thought to belong to a titanosaur, a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs, characterized by their large size, a long neck and tail, and four-legged stance.\n In research published in the journal Cretaceous Research, experts say they believe the creature to be \"one of the largest sauropods ever found\" and could exceed the size of a Patagotitan, a species which lived 100 million to 95 million years ago and measured up to a staggering 37.2 meters (122 feet) long.\n \"It is a huge dinosaur, but we expect to find much more of the skeleton in future field trips, so we'll have the possibility to address with confidence how really big it was,\" Alejandro Otero, a paleontologist with Argentina's Museo de La Plata, told CNN via email.\n Titanosaur fossils have been found on all continents except Antarctica. But the biggest \"multi-ton\" varieties of the species -- including those titanosaurs exceeding 40 tons -- have mostly been discovered in Patagonia.\n Patagotitans may have been the world's largest terrestrial animal of all time, and weighed up to 77 tons, while Argentinosaurus were similarly gargantuan, and measured up to 40 meters (131 feet) and weighed up to 110 tons -- weighing more than 12 times more than an African elephant (up to 9 tons).\n Experts believe that the specimen strongly suggests the co-existence of larger titanosaurs together with medium-sized titanosaurs and small-sized rebbachisaurids at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous period, which began 101 million years ago.\n \"These size differences could indeed explain the existence of such sauropod diversity in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin during the Late Cretaceous in terms of niche partitioning,\" they wrote.\n Researchers said that, while they don't believe the creature to belong to a new species, they have so far been unable to assign it to a known genus of dinosaur.\n The research was conducted by Argentina's The Zapala Museum, Museo de La Plata,  Museo Egidio Feruglio and the universities of R\u00edo Negro and Zaragoza.",

        "title": "Bernie Sanders: This is the agenda Democrats should pursue under Biden's leadership",
        "body_text": "Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with the Democrats, is the junior US senator from Vermont. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\nThe headlines dominating the news understandably deal with the outrageous behavior of President Donald Trump and the attempted coup he inspired at our nation's Capitol.\n Yes, it was important for the House of Representatives to impeach Trump. Yes, the Senate must convict him. No president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the United States government and get away with it.\n But as enormously important as that is, we must not lose sight of the pain and anxiety of millions of working families all over this country, as they suffer through the worst public health and economic crises in the modern history of our country. In fact, many working families are facing more economic desperation today than any time since the Great Depression.\n As a result of the pandemic, tens of millions of our fellow citizens have lost their jobs and incomes. Hunger is at its highest level in decades, and 40 million could be on the brink of eviction when the federal moratorium expires at the end of January.  While more than 24 million people in our country have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or under-insured.\n Amid so much economic suffering and despair, when many Americans have lost faith in their government -- and when millions are prepared to accept lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election -- it is imperative that Democrats pass a bold and aggressive economic agenda within the first 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency. Now is not the time to think small. It is the time to think big and to restore faith among working families -- Black, White, Latino, Asian American and Native American -- that in a democratic society, government can respond to their needs.\n Failure to adequately respond to the economic desperation in America today will undermine the Biden administration and likely lead Democrats to lose their thin majorities in the US House of Representatives and US Senate in 2022. Democrats suffered significant loses in 1994, two years after President Bill Clinton's victory -- and, in 2010, two years after President Barack Obama's victory.\n We must not repeat those mistakes.\n The danger we face would not be in going too big or spending too much but in going too small and leaving the needs of the American people behind. If Republicans would like to work with us, we should welcome them. But their support is not necessary. In 2010, Sen. Mitch McConnell was willing to sabotage the economy to advantage Republicans, doing everything he could to make Obama a \"one-term president.\"\n We cannot let him play the same games again.\n The Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass major legislation has become an excuse for inaction. But let's be clear: We have the tools to overcome these procedural hurdles. As incoming Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I will use a process known as budget reconciliation that will allow us to pass comprehensive legislation with only 51 votes.\n This is not a radical idea.\n When the Republicans controlled the Senate during the George W. Bush and Trump presidencies, they used reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations. They also used reconciliation to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Today, Democrats must use this same process to lift Americans out of poverty, increase wages and create good-paying jobs.\n First, we must increase the direct payments passed by Congress in December from $600 to $2,000 for every working-class adult and their children. On this issue, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, several Republicans in the House and the Senate and undoubtedly millions of struggling Americans -- who wanted more stimulus in December --would agree.\n But given the enormous crises facing the country, that is not enough. Through reconciliation, we must pass a major Covid-relief package that expands emergency unemployment benefits to $600 a week, provides aid to state and local governments to prevent mass layoffs, enacts hazard pay for frontline workers, saves the US Postal Service, addresses the crisis of homelessness and ensures that no one in America goes hungry or is evicted.\n During the crisis, we must provide emergency health care to all by requiring Medicare to pay the medical bills of the uninsured and under-insured. We must fully fund Covid-19 testing, tracing and vaccine distribution.  At a time when our primary care health care system is faltering, and when millions have no medical home, we must also substantially increase funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps, which provides scholarships and forgive student debt of medical professionals who agree to work in underserved areas.\n Through reconciliation, we must make sure that unemployment benefits during this crisis period are not taxable so that workers don't get hit with a huge tax bill they didn't expect on April 15.\n Moreover, we need to create millions of good paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure -- our roads, bridges, sidewalks, schools, water systems and affordable housing. Further, as we lead the world in combating the existential threat of climate change, we can create millions more jobs by making massive investments in wind, solar, geothermal, electric vehicles, weatherization and energy storage.\n We must guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and end the international embarrassment of the United States as the only high-income nation that fails to provide paid maternity leave.\n In order to address our dysfunctional early childhood education system, we must provide universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country and greatly expand childcare. And, if we are to have the best-educated workforce in the world, we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and cancel all student debt for working-class Americans.\n As we do all these things, we can use the reconciliation process to substantially lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs and raise the minimum wage to $15. Not only would these provisions improve life for millions, they would save the federal government hundreds of billions.\n In this extraordinarily difficult moment, poll after poll has shown that the American people want government to respond aggressively to address the crises they face. The job of Congress now is to listen to the American people, move our country boldly forward on a path to economic success and show voters that Democrats are prepared to do everything possible to improve their lives.\n This is an unprecedented moment in American history. We must act in an unprecedented way.",

        "title": "The renegade Catholic clerics who shamefully backed Trump's Big Lie",
        "body_text": "Paul Moses is a professor emeritus of journalism at Brooklyn College and a former reporter and editor at Newsday. He is a contributing writer at Commonweal and is the author of books including \"The Saint and the Sultan: The Crusades, Islam and Francis of Assisi's Mission of Peace\" and \"An Unlikely Union: The Love-Hate Story of New York's Irish and Italians.\" The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nDuring the two days before the January 6 riot in the Capitol, numerous far-right websites carried an interview with a Catholic archbishop who warned that the United States would be \"wiped out from history\" if it failed to expose \"now\" what his interviewer called \"the coordinated theft of our election.\"\n Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, is a renegade cleric best known for calling for Pope Francis' resignation.\n He is the most prominent of a group of Catholic clergymen who joined evangelical Protestant figures in the religious wing of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement. Given the role of Catholics as a swing vote \u2014 and as 30% of the members of Congress \u2014 these far-right clerics have played an important role in supporting President Donald Trump's Big Lie that he won the 2020 presidential election.\n Video messages from Vigan\u00f2, Bishop Joseph Strickland of the Tyler diocese in east Texas, and the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, were featured in the December 12 \"Jericho March\" called \"to preserve fair and free elections in America.\" Vigan\u00f2's role is particularly troubling. He invokes his position as an archbishop, \"Successor of the Apostles,\" and former top Vatican official to claim apostolic authority to indulge in conspiracy.\n The claims that Vigan\u00f2, Strickland and Pavone have made were amplified through their access to a large range of conservative and far-right Catholic media such as the EWTN Global Catholic Network, and many others.\n Catholic bishops and other Catholic opinion-makers have mostly been slow to respond to this misuse of their faith to help Trump, in all his pride and wrath, as he tried to lie and bully his way into a second term. Divided by their own intra-church battles, their voices have been absent or tepid.\n The Jericho March's organizers adopted Trump's falsehood: \"We will not let globalists, socialists and communists destroy our beautiful nation by sidestepping our laws and suppressing the will of the American people through their fraudulent and illegal activities in this election,\" its website said at the time.\n The march's publicity release listed Vigan\u00f2 as the headliner for that rally, along with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser Trump pardoned. From a jumbo video screen on the National Mall, Vigan\u00f2 said he prayed that \"order will triumph over destruction,\" telling the crowd, \"We are the silent army of the children of light, the humble ranks who overthrow evil by invoking God, the praying army that walks around the walls of lies and betrayal in order to bring them down.\"\n Bishop Strickland, filmed standing before an altar, was more restrained but still worked some of the rally's buzzwords into his prayer: \"We pray in a special way for our nation in a time of darkness, confusion, this time of too much corruption and doubt.\"\n Strickland was so agitated over Biden's victory that after the US Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement with congratulations on his victory, he tweeted on Nov. 10, \"A dark cloud has descended on this nation when the USCCB and Planned Parenthood speak in unison in support of a Biden-Harris administration that supports the slaughter of innocents by abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy.\" He repeated the false claim that the bishops had somehow acted \"in unison\" with their arch-foe Planned Parenthood on November 24 in his program on LifesiteNews.\n Pavone sounded more like a politician as he pushed Trump's Big Lie for the December 12 rally: \"Lord you have given President Trump victory over all these enemies and we ask you to give him and us victory once again,\" he said. \"Bless his campaign as it fights voter fraud.\"\n After that event, the Jericho March organizers put together a five-day \"Save the Republic\" rally that culminated on the fateful afternoon of January 6 in a Capitol Hill meet-up with the \"Stop the Steal\" crowd. For further directions, the Jericho March provided a link to wildprotest.com, according to its website at the time. Jericho March's promotional material featured a picture of Trump, pointing straight on like Uncle Sam, under the header, \"Take America Back.\" Below, it borrowed from Trump's infamous tweet, \"Be there, will be wild!\"\n There can be no doubt that the statements of these religious leaders helped to create the violent atmosphere that exploded on Capitol Hill. After the violence, the Jericho March has cleared away the edgy statements from its website, replacing them with a page that says, \"Jericho March has a history of totally peaceful marches and we have not, did not, and never will condone violence or destruction.\"\n As a Catholic, I cringe especially at Vigan\u00f2's actions. The \"open letters\" he issued throughout 2020 are reminiscent of the demagogic radio addresses that Father Charles Coughlin delivered in the late 1930s, filled with apocalyptic warnings about evil forces  vying for world domination.\n The day after November's election, Vigan\u00f2 wrote a \"Letter to American Catholics and Americans of Good Will.\"\n \"We have seen the deep state organize itself, well in advance, to carry out the most colossal electoral fraud in history, in order to ensure the defeat of the man who has strenuously opposed the establishment of the New World Order that is wanted by the children of darkness,\" he wrote. \"In this battle, you have not failed, as is your sacred duty, to make your own contribution by taking the side of the Good. Others, enslaved by vices or blinded by infernal hatred against Our Lord, have taken the side of Evil.\"\n Though he is on the run from papal authority, the archbishop invoked his status as \"Successor of the Apostles\" to make statements such as this one in an October open letter to Trump: \"Around you are gathered with faith and courage those who consider you the final garrison against the world dictatorship.\" He also plays on the piety of devout Catholics by frequently invoking the Blessed Mother in support of his fantasies.\n Pavone, for his part, showed no regret. At 4:33 p.m. on January 6, he tweeted, \"These Democrats are hypocrites. Biden should shut up; he has no authority to talk right now. He is a fraud & he is not the president-elect. The rest of these sanctimonious, self righteous Democrats should stop complaining. They tried to steal the election & want us to accept it!\" His organization Priests for Life issued a statement January 13 saying it opposes violence.\n Bishop Strickland has hinted that he is examining his conscience, however. He declined to discuss this with me, but he tweeted on January 11, \"Let us stop blaming each other, yes I'm a sinner & I can be foolish but I love God & I love this country.\"",

        "body_text": "Sen. Josh Hawley blocked quick consideration of President-elect Joe Biden's Homeland Security nominee, Alejandro Mayorkas, on Tuesday, leaving the third-largest federal department without confirmed leadership as it faces national security concerns, a pandemic and an incoming president prepared to roll out ambitious immigration plans.\n The Missouri Republican's decision stemmed from an exchange with Mayorkas hours earlier during the nominee's confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n \"Mr. Mayorkas has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border given President-elect Biden's promise to roll back major enforcement and security measures,\" Hawley said in a statement.\n \"Just today, he declined to say he would enforce the laws Congress has already passed to secure the border wall system. Given this, I cannot consent to skip the standard vetting process and fast-track this nomination when so many questions remain unanswered,\" he continued.\n Transportation Security Administration head David Pekoske is expected to temporarily take over as acting Homeland Security secretary when the Biden administration enters office Wednesday, according to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Alexei Woltornist.\n Under President Donald Trump, DHS has been rattled with consistent leadership turnover, including in the final weeks of his administration. Earlier this month, Chad Wolf stepped down from his post as acting secretary following intense scrutiny over the validity of his appointment.\n Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor assumed the role of acting DHS secretary, becoming the sixth secretary under the Trump administration. The department hasn't had a Senate-confirmed secretary since April 2019.\n Gaynor told his workforce he would fill the job until \"January 20 when President-elect Biden is inaugurated.\"\n In a statement to CNN, Sean Savett, a Biden transition spokesperson, called Mayorkas \"one of the most knowledgeable homeland security experts in the country.\"\n \"The Senate held swift confirmation votes for the DHS Secretary nominee in 2009 and 2017 in order for them to start on day one for good reason,\" Savett said. \"Senator Hawley's threat to disrupt historical practice and try to leave this vital position vacant is dangerous, especially in this time of overlapping crises when there is not a moment to waste.\"\n Hawley questioned Mayorkas on Tuesday about funds appropriated for the US-Mexico border wall and whether they would be spent as intended, in light of Biden's pledge to halt wall construction.\n While Mayorkas committed to following through with Biden's promise, he maintained he'd do so \"in adherence to the laws that guide us.\"\n \"Senator ... if I may strike at the fundamental point that I believe you are inquiring of, which is, will I follow the law and the execution of my responsibilities should I have the privilege of serving as the secretary of Homeland Security? And the answer is yes, I will follow the law,\" Mayorkas said, adding that he would need to understand \"what the law provides with respect to the obligation of funds to construct the border wall and see what the opportunities are to discontinue any such obligations if in fact the law permits and act accordingly.\"\n The government has long-standing authority to terminate contracts, though it comes at a cost, according to contracting experts. A US official previously told CNN that some contracts can be modified. But the department's mission extends beyond immigration. DHS is also playing a leading role in securing the US Capitol for the inauguration and is involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\n \"Our nation is facing unprecedented crises and threats to American national security, from the devastating Coronavirus pandemic to massive cyber breaches across government and the private sector -- and as we have seen too clearly in recent weeks -- rising domestic terrorism and anti-government violence. The Department of Homeland Security is the lead agency charged with combatting these threats and more, and it needs qualified, Senate-confirmed leadership in place immediately,\" Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement, urging his colleagues to confirm Mayorkas.\n Sen. Chris Murphy said Tuesday that Hawley's decision is putting the \"country's security at risk.\"\n \"I mean, you know, all he can do is slow down the nomination and put the country's security risk especially in a moment when domestic terrorists are plotting another attack against this nation,\" the Connecticut Democrat said when CNN's Phil Mattingly asked for his reaction to Hawley's objection.\n Murphy continued, \"But Senator Hawley and his crowd are pretty clear that they put their political interests ahead of the security interests of the country and that obviously is not changing.\"\n This story has been updated to note that Transportation Security Administration head David Pekoske is expected to step in as acting Homeland Security secretary temporarily.\n CNN's Geneva Sands, Phil Mattingly and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick to lead the State Department, said Tuesday that he plans to swiftly appoint an LGBTI envoy, allow embassies to fly the pride flag and formally repudiate the findings of the controversial \"Commission on Unalienable Rights.\"\n Taken together, Blinken's comments during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee signal a clear departure from the Trump administration's approach to LGBTQI protections as Biden looks to usher in a new era of equality.\n While the position of special envoy for the human rights of LGBTI persons was left vacant under the Trump administration, Blinken said Tuesday that appointing someone to the role is \"a matter, I think, of some real urgency.\"\n \"We've seen violence directed against LGBTQI people around the world increase. We've seen, I believe, the highest number of murders of transgender people, particularly women of color, that we've seen ever,\" Blinken said.\n \"And so I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQI people is something that the Department is going to take on and take on immediately.\"\n Blinken also said he would allow US embassies to fly the pride flag. CNN reported in 2019 that multiple US embassies had been denied permission by the Trump administration to fly the rainbow flag to commemorate LBGTQ Pride Month.\n He similarly committed to repudiating the findings of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's keystone initiative,The Commission on Unalienable Rights, which contended in its report that some rights were not worth defending.\n The Trump administration for years has reversed, dropped, removed and withdrawn established LGBTQI protections and has been particularly hostile toward transgender Americans.\n Among its most criticized moves was an effort last year to roll back an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender. A federal judge blocked the repeal over the summer, ruling it had violated a recent Supreme Court decision.\n Blinken also sought to make clear Tuesday that he plans to emphatically redirect the trajectory of US foreign policy after four years of the Trump administration, rebuilding and reengaging alliances to confront transnational threats ranging from Russia and North Korea to climate change.\n If confirmed, Blinken said, he aims to reengage with Congress in a bipartisan fashion, an implicit criticism of his predecessor's combative relationship with some lawmakers.\n CNN's Nicholas Neville, Tami Luhby, Caroline Kelly and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump talked out of pardoning kids and Republican lawmakers ",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump received an unsettling warning on his final Saturday night in the White House.\n Huddled for a lengthy meeting with his legal advisers, Trump was warned the pardons he once hoped to bestow upon his family and even himself would place him in a legally perilous position, convey the appearance of guilt and potentially make him more vulnerable to reprisals.\n So, too, was Trump warned that pardons for Republican lawmakers who had sought them for their role in the Capitol insurrection would anger the very Senate Republicans who will determine his fate in an upcoming impeachment trial.\n White House counsel Pat Cipollone and another attorney who represented Trump in his first impeachment trial, Eric Herschmann, offered the grave warnings as Trump, his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner listened. Other lawyers joined by telephone. They all told Trump he should not pardon himself, his family or any GOP lawmakers in a prospective manner unless he was prepared to list specific crimes.\n Cipollone and former Attorney General William Barr both warned Trump earlier this month they did not believe he should pardon himself, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN last week. Barr conveyed this position to Trump before resigning last month, sources say.\n Trump continued to bring the matter up in the ensuing days, even after officials believed the issue was resolved. But the sobering meeting on Saturday evening at the White House seemed to put the idea to rest.\n While Trump often discards advice he doesn't agree with -- particularly coming from Cipollone, with whom he has a fractured relationship -- the message Saturday resonated. The conversation spooked Trump in a way few others have, a person familiar with his reaction told CNN.\n Now, Trump will leave office muted and disheartened at being unable to wield the power he has cherished most while president. Boxed in by his own actions that helped spark the riots at the Capitol, Trump finds himself constrained in a way he mostly avoided for his entire tenure.\n His final batch of pardons, due later Tuesday, is expected to contain few of the controversial or outlandish criminals that have characterized his earlier use of his clemency powers.\n Trump could still change his mind, and retains his sweeping clemency powers until noon on Wednesday. The President continues to bring up pardons that aides once thought were off the table, including for former strategist Steve Bannon, leading to general uncertainty about whether Trump will continue adhering to his lawyers' advice.\n There is a frantic scramble happening behind the scenes on whether to grant Bannon a pardon. One concern is Bannon's possible connection to the January 6 riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n Trump has continued to go back and forth on Bannon's pardon into Tuesday night, sources told CNN.\n Earlier Tuesday, White House officials and others familiar with the matter describe a muted President, concerned about his pending impeachment trial and swirling legal problems, who was talked out of his long-discussed notions following the Capitol insurrection.\n Several Republican lawmakers who are alleged to have been involved in the rally that preceded the deadly riot on the US Capitol have sought clemency from Trump before he leaves office, but after meeting with his legal advisers for several hours on Saturday, the President decided he would not grant them, according to two people familiar with his plans.\n The fear of legal exposure is not limited to Republicans who promoted or spoke at the rally, including Reps. Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks and Paul Gosar. Those who participated, organized and fundraised for it are also concerned, sources told CNN, including his eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who both spoke at the rally.\n Top figures associated with the groups that helped organize it -- including Women for America First and Turning Point Action, the political action committee arm of Turning Point USA -- have also voiced private concern about legal repercussions, a person familiar tells CNN.\n Several of Trump's closest advisers have also urged him not to grant clemency to anyone who breached the US Capitol, despite Trump's initial stance that those involved had done nothing wrong.\n As CNN has previously reported, one of the top organizers of the movement that aimed to overturn the election results claimed he worked closely with Republican congressmen. Ali Alexander, a leader of the \"Stop the Steal\" group, said in several livestream videos he planned the rally with Gosar of Arizona, Brooks of Alabama and Biggs of Arizona.\n The idea of pardoning himself has captivated Trump nearly the entire span of his presidency. He viewed the prospect as a unilateral magic wand he believed could ease his legal troubles, if not make them disappear entirely.\n Almost as alluring: preemptive clemency for members of his family, who Trump has long bemoaned were being unfairly targeted by his enemies. Rendering them immune from retribution seemed like a raised middle finger to his detractors.\n The legal standing of either move was questionable, and Cipollone had been \"direct and strong\" that a self-pardon was unlikely to hold up in court, a person familiar with the matter said. Internally, one of Cipollone's legacy items is believed to be whether he dissuades Trump from pardoning himself.\n Others appealed to Trump by warning he should be more concerned about the effect it would have his legacy, not the legal standing of the pardons.\n The decision to not pardon any Republican lawmakers or his family members was a last minute one. After initially defending the idea that he may pardon himself or his family members out of concern they would be targeted once he's out of office, Trump decided Saturday night that he would not pardon anyone in his family or himself.\n Trump agreed with the attorneys and other advisers that doing so would increase the appearance of guilt and could make them more vulnerable, but was disappointed at the outcome, according to people familiar with the matter.\n Trump, according to people he'd spoken to, appeared more taken with the message of unchecked power it might send to his naysayers than actual protection from liability. His pardon power was among his favorite perks of the job.\n Trump will depart office facing significant legal questions that only escalated during his final days in office. His phone call to Georgia's secretary of state urging him to \"find\" votes and his speech encouraging his crowd to \"show strength\" in their march to the Capitol have both put him under a legal microscope.\n The new possible criminal exposure comes on top of ongoing New York state investigations into the President's finances and multiple defamation lawsuits related to Trump denying sexual assault accusations by women. The Manhattan district attorney's office has a broad criminal investigation looking into allegations of insurance fraud and tax fraud. The New York attorney general has a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of its assets.\n The sizable legal store the President now enters provided the looming backdrop to his ongoing discussion of pardons, which began in earnest last year.\n Over the past weeks, Trump has discussed pardons incessantly with associates, often asking if people who had not been accused of any crime wanted one before he left office. The discussions unnerved some aides, who did not believe they were in line for prosecution.\n Even as recently as Monday, with hours remaining in his presidency, Trump appeared fixated on pardons.\n While he was considering preemptive pardons for his children and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, a source close to the process said those are no longer expected. Bannon, who has been indicted on fraud charges, is also not expected to receive a pardon on Tuesday, the source said.\n Trump is also not expected to pardon Edward Snowden or Julian Assange, whose roles in revealing US secrets infuriated official Washington.\n While he had once entertained the idea, Trump decided against it because he did not want to anger Senate Republicans who will soon determine whether he's convicted during his Senate trial. Multiple GOP lawmakers had sent messages through aides that they felt strongly about not granting clemency to Assange or Snowden.\n As he departs office, Trump has expressed real concern that Republicans could turn on him. A conviction in the Senate impeachment trial would limit his future political activities and strip him of some of the government perks of being an ex-president.\n Trump is less worried about being barred from running from office again, and more concerned with the optics of being convicted by the Senate, people familiar with the matter said.",

        "title": "US accuses China of 'genocide' of Uyghurs and minority groups in Xinjiang",
        "body_text": "The US has officially determined that China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups who live in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.\n \"This genocide is ongoing, and...we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Tuesday, on the last full day of the Trump administration.\n \"Since at least March 2017, local authorities dramatically escalated their decades-long campaign of repression against Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, including ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Kyrgyz,\" Pompeo said.\n The US State Department has previously estimated that up to two million Uyghurs, as well as members of other Muslim minority groups, have been detained in a sprawling network of internment camps in the region.\n Former reeducation camp detainees have told CNN they experienced political indoctrination and abuse inside the camps, such as food and sleep deprivation and forced injections. CNN reporting has also found that some Uyghur women were forced to use birth control and undergo sterilization as part of a deliberate attempt to push down birth rates among minorities in Xinjiang.\n China denies allegations of such human rights abuses in Xinjiang. It has insisted that its reeducation camps are necessary for preventing religious extremism and terrorism in the area, which is home to about 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that speak a language closely related to Turkish and have their own distinct culture.\n Op-eds and reports in Chinese state-controlled media have also specifically argued against applying the term \"genocide\" to the situation.\n At a press conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused Pompeo of spreading \"poison\" with his genocide declaration.\n \"This is just one of many of his absurd, big lies,\" Hua said in response to CNN's question. \"In our view, Pompeo's so-called declaration is a piece of scrap paper.\"\n Hua singled out Pompeo himself for special criticism. \"This American politician, who is notorious for lying, is turning himself into a doomsday clown and joke of the century,\" Hua said.\n The State Department's declaration won't automatically trigger any immediate penalties, but Peter Irwin, senior program officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, said it would have a powerful symbolic impact, both in the US and internationally.\n \"Determinations like these are only meaningful insofar as they're supported by tangible, sustained pressure,\" he said. \"The worst thing that the US government can do, especially when we're in the midst of a transition of power, is to become self-satisfied with this powerful rhetorical statement about the crisis without following it up.\"\n A Washington-based advocacy group, Campaign for Uyghurs, welcomed the designation as a step toward justice.\n \"As any victim will tell you, having the eyes of the world community see us, and acknowledge that our horror is real, means everything,\" said CFU director Rushan Abbas in a statement Tuesday.\n \"My own sister's 20 year prison sentence on false charges is clearly linked to this genocidal intent by the Chinese regime. She, and all Uyghurs, deserve justice,\" she added.\n Darren Byler, a Xinjiang expert and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Colorado, said he anticipated the ruling would strength Uyghur claims for asylum in the US as well as increase pressure to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. \"But I don't know what it will mean for Uyghurs in China,\" he said.\n Concern over human rights issues in Xinjiang is a bipartisan issue in the US. However, the announcement in the final hours of the Trump administration could further complicate the incoming Biden administration's approach to and dealings with Beijing.\n The president-elect has spoken out about China's human rights abuses and in November 2019 called the mass internment of Uyghur Muslims \"among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today.\" \"The US cannot be silent \u2014 we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world,\" Biden tweeted.\n In a statement to Politico in August, his campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates described China's actions in Xinjiang as genocide. On Tuesday, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he also agreed with the designation.\n In his statement, Pompeo also said he had \"directed the US Department of State to continue to investigate and collect relevant information regarding the ongoing atrocities occurring in Xinjiang, and to make this evidence available to appropriate authorities and the international community to the extent allowable by law.\"\n The treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang has been widely condemned by the international community. In July 2019, twenty-two countries including Japan and the UK signed a letter urging China to end its \"mass arbitrary detentions and related violations\" and called on Beijing to allow UN experts to access the region.\n In December, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning China over the forced labor allegations. The British government has also criticized Beijing and said earlier this month that it would fine companies which hide connections to Xinjiang.\n The new measures are designed to ensure that all British organizations \"are not complicit in, nor profiting from, the human rights violations in Xinjiang,\" according to the UK Foreign Office.\n Earlier this month, the US also banned imports of cotton products and tomatoes produced in Xinjiang over forced labor concerns.\n CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this article.",

        "title": "How a US presidential inauguration works",
        "body_text": "This story originally ran January 14, 2021.\nThe invitations have been scaled back by the pandemic and the security has been heightened by the insurrection, but Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th president of the United States will still have plenty of pomp.\n The National Mall has been shut down to keep people away, so we will all be spared another comparison of crowd sizes, especially since Donald Trump's Twitter handle has been turned off. The threat of violent protests from election-denying Trump supporters and the presence of National Guard troops will keep anyone from forgetting Trump's turbulent leadership, or lack thereof.\n Anyway, the soon-to-be former President will have already fled to Florida rather than stay in Washington to watch his successor take the oath of office. Instead of inaugural balls, there will be a TV special hosted by Tom Hanks.\n It will be unusual, but it will still be an inauguration.\n None of the pageantry -- inaugural balls, inaugural parades, inaugural luncheons -- is laid out in the Constitution.\n All you need to swear in a new president, now that the electoral votes have been counted, is for Biden to say these words, which are written in the Constitution, at noon on January 20:\n \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n Usually the chief justice of the US Supreme Court administers the oath, but that's a custom, not a requirement. If the chief justice isn't available, it can be another judge. Calvin Coolidge's dad, a justice of the peace, gave his son the oath in the family living room in Vermont after Warren G. Harding's death. The only woman to deliver the oath of office to a president was Sarah Hughes, a federal district judge in Texas, who was called onto Air Force One after JFK's assassination to make LBJ president.\n Most presidents have employed Bibles. Obama used two at the same time! But that's a custom. Theodore Roosevelt didn't use one.\n There's not technically any need for an inaugural address, although every elected president has given one. Some are short (George Washington's second was 135 words) and some are long (William Henry Harrison's was more than 8,000 words and the lore is he caught cold while giving it and died of pneumonia a month later). It's a valuable custom for a new president to use the address to lay out his (or, in the future, her) agenda and move on from what may have been a bruising campaign.\n Abraham Lincoln, after states seceded due to his election, tried to keep the nation together at his first inaugural. At his second, after the bloody Civil War, and with his soon-to-be assassin in the audience, he tried to sew it back up, with \"malice toward none and charity for all.\"\n Teddy Roosevelt talked about the importance of American democracy not just for Americans, but for mankind.\n FDR said the only thing Americans had to fear was \"fear itself.\"\n JFK said you should be asking what you could do for your country.\n And Ronald Reagan, conversely, said, \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\"\n Trump used his inaugural address to talk about how he'd end \"American carnage,\" but since Capitol Police recently had to retake the Hill from a riotous mob of Trump-supporting election deniers, you've got to assume he failed.\n Pay special attention to how Biden references his predecessor, soon to face an impeachment trial, during his inaugural address.\n A lot.\n Biden had originally planned to make a statement by arriving in Washington by Amtrak from Wilmington, Delaware, where the train station bears his name -- a testament to the days when he was a senator and used to make the round-trip home to be with his kids. That was called off.\n Normally, members of Congress get a raft of tickets to distribute at will. This year they each get a +1. The public is being encouraged to stay away and the National Mall will be shut down. There will be no public parade from the Capitol to the White House, but instead a virtual parade bringing in people from around the country.\n The inaugural balls -- usually there are multiple and the new president makes a short appearance at several -- will be replaced by a produced TV show featuring stars like Hanks along with Justin Timberlake. This will feel very much like the Covid inauguration.\n All the normal VIPs, incoming and outgoing Cabinet members, lawmakers and Supreme Court justices are likely to attend, as is outgoing Vice President Mike Pence. Trump will not. It's rare, but not unheard of, for a president to skip the transfer of power.\n Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga will add some show-biz glitz to the ceremony, which will still take place at the West Front of the US Capitol, looking out on an empty Mall, a show of defiance to the people who stormed the Capitol on January 6, maybe. But also a reminder that this is a very singular beginning to a new administration. Read more.\n Andrew Johnson was sworn in after Lincoln's death and as John Wilkes Booth was being pursued. At the time, according to The New York Times that day, travel out of the city was restricted.\n There's precedent for pared-back inauguration ceremonies, even for an elected president. FDR took his fourth oath of office -- something now forbidden by the 22nd Amendment, which allows only two terms -- in the White House at the height of World War II.\n Andrew Jackson, Trump's favorite president, had to flee the White House as his supporters surged in to see him. They trashed the place.",

        "title": "The worst final popularity rating ever for a first lady belongs to Melania Trump",
        "body_text": "Much has been written about President Donald Trump's historically low popularity ratings as he leaves office. But the tarnish on the Trump brand goes beyond the President.\n Melania Trump leaves the White House with the worst popularity rating for any first lady at the end of her term in polling history.\n The latest CNN/SSRS poll had Trump's favorable rating at 42% to a 47% unfavorable rating. The 47% is the highest unfavorable rating we ever recorded for Trump. It's also amazingly high from a historical perspective.\n Traditionally, first ladies are nearly uniformly admired. The position is unelected and normally uncontroversial. It's hard to be unpopular.\n Take a look at the final CNN and Gallup polls that asked about first ladies popularity since Pat Nixon. The average first lady's final popularity rating before Trump was 71% with an unpopularity rating of 21%. That means the average net popularity rating for these first ladies was +50 points.\n Now, the ratings for Nixon, Betty Ford and Rosalynn Carter were taken before their husband's final month in office and the questions asking about popularity were worded differently than Trump's question. Even if we take these first ladies out of the equation, we get a very similar 70% favorable and 23% unfavorable average final rating since Nancy Reagan in 1989.\n In fact, the only first lady to leave office with a net popularity rating below +40 points was Hillary Clinton. Her net favorability rating of +13 points (52% favorable and 39% unfavorable) in a January 2001 CNN/Time/Yankelovich Partners poll still easily beat Trump's final rating.\n Remember, Clinton, unlike Trump, ran for her US Senate seat during her husband's final year in the White House and was sworn in weeks before he departed the White House. She was also far more politically active in the White House, helping lead its push for health care reform. In other words, unlike most first ladies, Clinton was going to be seen in a partisan light.\n Trump has not been anywhere near as involved in the day-to-day management of the White House. She's usually not that visible, at least to most Americans.\n Indeed, it's not entirely clear how much Trump's low ratings have to do with her in particular. Yes, she's had some moments that blew up on social media, and she did break tradition (with her husband) in not welcoming the Biden family into the White House.\n But Trump's low ratings precede her time in office. She's frequently featured relatively low net popularity ratings, dating back to when her husband was running for president in 2016. (She was not very well known then at all.)\n It does seem that merely being associated with her husband has had a negative impact on her popularity.\n Tempting as it might be to think that a husband's unpopularity automatically means a first lady is unpopular too, this has not been the case historically.\n When Richard Nixon was already well into the throes of the Watergate scandal in August 1973, 83% of Americans rated Pat Nixon a +1 or above on a favorability scale that ran from -5 to +5. Just 13% rated her a -1 or worse.\n When Jimmy Carter's approval rating was at a mere 32% in August 1979, Rosalynn Carter's approval rating stood at 59% to a disapproval rating of 19%. The Carter comparison to Trump is especially interesting because Donald Trump's current approval rating is quite similar to where Jimmy Carter's was at that point in his presidency.\n Originally, I thought the current first lady's low popularity could be because of increasing polarization in our politics.\n Laura Bush, however, proved that even in the modern era, a first lady can be vastly more popular than her husband. Her final favorable rating in a January 2009 CNN/ORC poll was 67% to a 20% unfavorable rating. George W. Bush's  favorable rating was 35% in the same poll.\n In fact, Laura Bush and Michelle Obama (69% favorable rating) both finished with popularity ratings about average for departing first ladies.\n Of course, no first lady this century has ever left office with the 85% favorable rating of Barbara Bush in 1993.\n My guess is that incoming first lady Jill Biden won't either. Her favorable rating was 58% to a 29% unfavorable rating.\n But just like her husband, Biden starts off a lot more popular than her predecessor.",

        "title": "Bitter, Trump skips chance to say splashy, high-profile farewell",
        "body_text": "A president's most valuable commodity is time and Donald Trump is out of it.\n With a day remaining in his term, Trump was still consumed with grievance over Republicans he believes abandoned him and insistent to people around him that he actually won the election he lost.\n On Tuesday, the once-loyal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor that the insurrectionist mob was \"provoked\" by Trump.\n McConnell touted that Congress did its duty despite the violence on January 6, certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n \"We'll have a safe and successful inaugural right here on the very front of the Capitol,\" said McConnell.\n The President, meanwhile, has been in a foul mood for several days and has lost interest in the performative parts of the presidency he once relished, a source he's spoken with in recent days told CNN.\n While he was eagerly anticipating his military-style send-off from Joint Base Andrews on Inauguration morning -- one of the few items that have cheered him up recently -- there were already signs the crowd may be smaller than he'd hoped. And a slate of actual celebrities lined up for Biden's inauguration disappointed a president who tried and often failed to secure A-list support for his own presidency.\n He hadn't left the White House or been seen in public for a week. On Monday evening he taped a valedictory final message from the Blue Room of the White House, ticking through several achievements that he believes should define his administration.\n \"This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous,\" he said in the video, which was released online Tuesday afternoon by the White House. \"We did what we came here to do -- and so much more.\"\n That sentiment was something Trump's advisers were hoping he would voice in his final weeks in office. In the video, Trump described his accomplishments and said he worked arduously for the American people. He framed his presidency as one that championed the forgotten and made no apologies for his brazen approach to politics.\n \"I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult,\" he said. \"I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism.\"\n \"America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree,\" he went on.\n He touted having not started any new foreign wars and adopting a tough stance on China. And he took credit for a resurgent US economy, even though it has slowed during the coronavirus pandemic, which he termed the \"China virus.\"\n His only mention of the 400,000 American lives lost to the virus was to say he grieved them and pledged \"in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all.\"\n The speech made no mention of Biden by name, but did allude to the violence at the Capitol earlier this month.\n \"All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans.  It can never be tolerated,\" he said. \"Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning.\"\n Trump recorded the message late Monday with a skeleton staff. Unlike most of his predecessors in the television era, a live prime-time farewell address attempting to burnish what has become a badly tarnished legacy is no longer in the cards.\n On his last full day as president, Trump was expected to issue a final raft of pardons and commutations and could sign new executive orders, according to White House officials. He was taking exit meetings with aides, posing for photos in the Oval Office, keeping tabs on his carefully planned departure ceremony and receiving briefings from the Secret Service on security for an inauguration he does not plan on attending.\n His schedule was empty except for the notice he dictated himself weeks ago asserting he'd \"work from early in the morning until late in the evening\" and \"make many calls and have many meetings.\" His vice president was scheduled to convene a final meeting of the coronavirus task force.\n For Trump, there has been relatively little reminiscing about the past four years, according to people who have spoken to him. Although he often waxed nostalgic about his 2016 presidential campaign, the years he was actually president have inspired less fond memories. Instead, Trump has appeared embittered at those he believe deprived him a second term, from the \"deep state\" to ruthless Democrats and disloyal members of his own party.\n On Monday, trucks from a Washington-based moving company pulled up at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's South Florida club, as his nights remaining in the White House dwindled to one.\n Ordinarily, presidents spent their final weeks in office looking to hone their legacy through exit interviews, policy speeches and the capstone farewell address, delivered in prime time for the largest possible audience. But after inciting a riot mob that stormed the US Capitol, Trump's aides have attempted to keep him away from any situation that could aggravate the situation further.\n That includes keeping Trump from any type of live, off-the-cuff scenario where he might reverse the carefully scripted work that went into his taped speeches last week condemning the insurrectionist violence and vowing a smooth transition.\n When Trump presented a final batch of Medals of Freedom this month, it occurred behind closed doors. All of his speeches have been taped by White House cameras, with aides watching closely to ensure Trump does not divert from his script. His only appearance in public has been a trip to the southern border last week.\n Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks before his final departure from Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday, where a military-style ceremony is being planned. Invitations have gone out to Trump's friends, allies and former administration officials saying it will begin at 8 a.m. ET. Each invitee is allowed five guests; organizers hope to secure a large crowd because Trump has complained about the size of his gatherings in the past.\n At the moment, not even Vice President Mike Pence is not expected to attend the departure ceremony, according to two Pence sources. Logistically, the sources said it would be difficult for Pence to be there for Trump's sendoff and attend Biden's inaugural.\n In a sign the guest list may not have been carefully curated, Trump's former communications director turned critic, Anthony Scaramucci, was invited to the departure. He told CNN he did not plan to attend, but saw his invitation as a sign the White House was eager to bulk up the guest list.\n Other former officials who left the White House on rocky terms, including former chief of staff John Kelly and former White House counsel Don McGahn, also received invitations to the event but aren't planning to attend, sources told CNN. Kelly told CNN's Jake Tapper he had other pressing commitments.\n One official familiar with the planning said organizers are anxious that a crowd will not materialize on Wednesday morning. But the official said the event would proceed anyway.\n While a number of potential events had been considered for Trump's final week in office celebrating his accomplishments, including on Middle East peace, regulatory reform and lowering taxes, none materialized. During his trip to the southern border to herald wall construction, Trump spoke for only 20 minutes.\n Aides once begged Trump to consider delivering a major speech ticking through his accomplishments, and there was even discussion about requesting a prime-time slot from television networks over the weekend, people familiar with the matter said.\n The talks appeared to go nowhere, and now Trump is not expected to make public remarks until the send-off ceremony at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday morning.\n Top Trump officials have pushed the President for two weeks to at least tape remarks touting some of his accomplishments in office. His wife, first lady Melania Trump, posted a similar video on Monday trumpeting her \"Be Best\" program and encouraging Americans to be kind to one another.\n But aides described Trump as seeming non-committal and disinterested in delivering the type of formal address to the nation that would provide an alternate accounting of a presidency ending in isolation and a second impeachment.\n Advisers had hoped Trump could shift focus back to his governing record, even though many of his allies now believe his legacy is irrevocably tarred by his incitement of riots at the Capitol this month.\n He has focused his attention instead on his clemency powers, convening meetings on Sunday and Monday with advisers to go over a lengthy list of pending pardons and commutations that are expected on Tuesday. He has discussed pardons at length with his remaining team, enthusiastic to exercise one of the few unilateral powers of his office.\n The live prime-time farewell address is another presidential tradition gone by the wayside in the norm-busting Trump era. Ever since Harry Truman beamed into Americans' relatively new television sets from the Oval Office on January 15, 1953, the evening farewell address has been a fixture of a departing commander-in-chief's final days.\n Even Richard Nixon, the only president ever to resign, delivered a live address announcing his decision from behind the desk in the Oval Office, its iconic windows covered with blue drapes.\n Before the television era, the farewell address extended back to George Washington, who issued warnings against unchecked power and partisan entrenchment in a written address to the nation in 1796.\n Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter all used the Oval Office for their farewell addresses. George H.W. Bush traveled outside of Washington to West Point for a departing address after failing to secure a second term. Barack Obama delivered his farewell speech inside McCormick Place convention center in Chicago, acknowledging in his hometown that after Trump's victory \"for every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.\"\n But Trump has mostly dismissed the traditions that go along with leaving office. He has not contacted Biden and will be the first president in 150 years to boycott his successor's inauguration.\n Trump once marveled at the reception he received from President Barack Obama, who met with him in the Oval Office after the 2016 election and welcomed him to the White House on the morning of his inauguration. In the early days of his presidency, Trump liked to show visitors the letter Obama wrote him and left in the top drawer of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n It wasn't clear whether Trump would reciprocate that gesture. Aides said he hasn't written one yet.\n CNN's Jim Acosta and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

The brief chase ended near the California State Fairgrounds Race Track in Sacramento, where the driver crashed the vehicle and refused to get out, deputies said.\n After using less-lethal weapons to shoot out the back window, \"one of the K-9 officers deployed a dog to the vehicle to try and assist getting the suspect out,\" said the sheriff. \"The suspect immediately shot and killed the K-9 unit and then immediately started firing on the officers.\"\n Two deputies were struck by gunfire and transported by fellow deputies to a local hospital where one was pronounced dead. The other deputy is in stable condition. The suspect is dead, CNN affiliate KCRA reported.\n The fallen deputy was a six-year veteran and leaves behind a wife and an infant child, said Jones. His wife \"is  going to be going through something she should never have to go through and they have a  very small infant that is going to grow up without a father,\" he said.\n \"There were a lot of shooting officers, there were a lot of shots fired,\" said Jones.\"The  crime scene investigators will want to do their best to try and account for each of the shots,\" he said.",

        "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond stops selling MyPillow after CEO's Capitol siege comments ",
        "body_text": "Bed Bath & Beyond has stopped selling MyPillow products following CEO Mike Lindell's support of the January 6 insurrection and his continued false statements questioning the validity of the US presidential election.\n The retailer said in a statement Tuesday that it's discontinuing the sales of a \"number of underperforming items and brands,\" which includes MyPillow. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) said it's part of its broader plan of selling more in-house brands when they debut this spring.\n Lindell, a major Republican donor, said in an interview with a right-wing broadcaster that the retailers are \"scared\" and blamed \"leftist groups\" for pressuring the retailers into dropping his product. He said that Wayfair, Kohl's and HEB also stopped selling MyPillow products. The three companies didn't respond to CNN Business' requests for comment.\n Despite the violence at the Capitol two weeks ago, Lindell has held firm with his support of President Donald Trump. He called the attack \"very peaceful\" and blamed \"undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people\" for the chaos, according to The New York Times. \"Donald Trump will be our president for the next four years,\" he said earlier this month.\n Lindell was spotted at the White House last Friday with pages of notes that appear to outline a series of recommendations including installing a Trump loyalist as the acting CIA director. He also has presented other false conspiracy theories echoed by Trump since the election.\n Founded in 2004, MyPillow has grown beyond selling pillows and now has a variety of household goods and even face masks. The privately held company has sold more than 40 million products, with a \"huge number of them directly to consumers\" through its website and hotline, reported Bloomberg. MyPillow is a steady advertiser on right-leaning TV networks, including Fox News and Newsmax.\n The Better Business Bureau currently gives MyPillow an \"F\" for its confusing pricing and discount tactics. The pillow itself has also earned low ratings from Consumer Reports because it's too lumpy.",

        "title": "Capitol riot investigators narrow in on extremist groups and military-style coordination ",
        "body_text": "They moved in an \"organized and practiced fashion\" as they pushed through crowds toward entrances to the US Capitol. On the inside, several maintained formation, putting their hands on each other's shoulders to keep in lockstep. Some communicated over radios, while others gave directions with hand signals and voice calls.\n Members of militant groups that stormed the seat of legislative power earlier this month during the certification of the presidential vote have quickly become a top focus of federal law enforcement investigating the January 6 insurrection.\n At least six alleged rioters with ties to self-styled militias have been named in criminal complaints released in recent days, representing a small but alarming segment of the dozens of defendants charged to date.\n RELATED: Decoding the extremist symbols and groups at the Capitol Hill insurrection\n Some of the groups present, like The Oath Keepers, try to draw their ranks from former service-members and law enforcement officers, relying on their tactical training to patrol and intimidate at protests across the country. Many have been radicalized by racial rhetoric and false claims coming from the Trump White House, security experts say.\n Through court documents and interviews with multiple officials familiar with the investigation, their organized role in the siege of the Capitol is coming into view and being built into cases that could potentially carry charges of sedition, indicating a concerted effort to incite a revolt against the government.\n The information is also key to the efforts to vet the police and National Guard officers who are guarding Washington, DC, this week. On Tuesday, two members of the National Guard were removed from inauguration duty, a defense official confirmed to CNN.\n \"That is a tier-one, top priority for both the U.S. Attorney's office and our federal law enforcement partners, to see whether there was this overarching command and control, and whether there were these organized teams that were organized to breach the Capitol, and then perhaps try to accomplish some type of a mission inside the Capitol,\" acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia Michael Sherwin said Friday.\n In the pre-dawn hours of Sunday, FBI agents fanned out around a home in rural Woodstock, Ohio. Inside was the founder of the Ohio State Regular Militia, a group of veterans who'd made the 450-mile drive to the nation's capital, fueled by what they describe as a sense of patriotic duty as well as \u200ba history of grievances against the government and a belief in false claims about the 2020 election that they aired on social media.\n \"We made it to DC. Spent all day protecting various speakers on the main stage in Freedom Plaza,\" Jessica Watkins, the Ohio militia founder, wrote on January 6 in a message posted on the right-wing friendly social media website Parler.\n In the lead up to the insurrection, Watkins, an Army veteran and bartender, according to an interview she gave to the Ohio Capital Journal last week, had vented her anger about pandemic lockdowns and repeated a \"stop the steal\" hashtag online, referencing the lies spread by President Donald Trump that election fraud prevented his November victory.\n She posted about plans to provide medical care and security at the planned protests, offering to escort Trump supporters to their hotels if they felt unsafe. But soon after arriving to the Capitol protest, Watkins and her fellow militiamen allegedly moved to the front lines of a takeover.\n Alongside eight to 10 other people in paramilitary gear and Oathkeeper paraphernalia (the Ohio State Regular Militia pays dues to that group, according to a charging document), Watkins began \"aggressively approaching an entrance to the Capitol building,\" an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit filed in federal court.\n \"These individuals,\" the agent alleged, \"move in an organized and practiced fashion and force their way to the front of the crowd gathered around a door to the U.S. Capitol.\"\n Having broken in, she made her way with the group into the rotunda and squared off with police officers who tried to block their way, she later wrote on Parler.\n \"We never smashed anything, stole anything, burned anything, and truthfully we were very respectful with Capitol Hill PD until they attacked us,\" she wrote. \"Then we stood our ground and drew the line.\"\n Federal authorities arrested Watkins on Sunday and charged her with knowingly entering a restricted building. Another member of the Ohio group, former Marine Donovan Crowl, was also arrested in that state Sunday for his alleged role in the riots.\n Thomas Caldwell, of Virginia, was arrested on Tuesday and is referred to as an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers in a charging document. According to the FBI, he stormed the Capitol alongside Watkins and Crowl and was \"involved in planning and coordinating the January 6 breach.\"\n It's not clear who is representing the three in court.\n The arrests of the two from Ohio are among the more than 90 criminal cases unsealed publicly against participants of the insurrection in the past two weeks. Prosecutors had initially focused on some of the more notorious and viral crimes, like the man seen walking in the Senate chambers with zip ties and the rioter who wore a \"Camp Auschwitz\" T-shirt, but began moving on alleged \"militia\" members in the past few days.\n Many established self-styled militias have long aligned with anti-government and extremist causes in pockets of the US, and their camouflage gear and military hardware was not out of place in a horde that also included tell-tale signs of hate groups, like Confederate flags and Nazi paraphernalia.\n Groups like the Oath Keepers, described by the FBI as \"a large but loosely organized collection of militia who believe that the federal government has been co-opted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights,\" first became a prominent antagonizing presence at protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.\n Last year, the vigilante groups became heavily armed fixtures at nationwide racial justice rallies spawned in the wake of George Floyd's killing. At times, local police seemed to welcome their presence amid demonstrations that occasionally grew violent. In other cases, they fueled the violence themselves, shooting and killing unarmed protestors, like in a chaotic episode in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year where authorities charged a teenager with felony homicide.\n The group's reliance on military tactics adds an explosive element to already highly charged situations, hate group researchers say.\n \"This dangerous crossover is one of the reasons we continue to be alarmed by events like the January 6 attack, which provide right-wing extremists ample opportunity to mix with and potentially influence 'regular' Americans,\" said Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism.\n As lawmakers voted to certify the electoral victory of President-Elect Joe Biden inside the Capitol, some men affiliated with so-called militia groups were attacking police officers outside and helping clear the way for people convinced the White House was being stolen to make their way in.\n Colorado man Robert Gieswein, who, according to an FBI affidavit, appears to be affiliated with the Three Percenters, a militia movement that believes \"a small force with a just cause can overthrow a tyrannical government if armed and prepared,\" is accused of helping to lift and shove a barrier against a group of Capitol Police officers as he tried to force his way into the building.\n Jon Schaffer, the frontman of a popular heavy metal band from Indiana, allegedly sprayed a Capitol Police officer with bear spray while wearing a hat the read \"Oath Keepers Lifetime Member,\" according to FBI documents.\n Both men are facing charges related to entering a restricted building and engaging in violence. Schaffer was arrested Sunday in Indiana. It's not clear if Gieswein is in custody. It's also not clear if either man has retained legal representation.\n Meanwhile, prosecutors in Washington, DC, have dedicated a team to examine potential charges of sedition, scouring travel records, communications and funding channels of rioters suspected of organizing and planning the attempt to disrupt the transfer of presidential power, according to Sherwin, the acting US attorney.\n As they've combed through troves of images and video taken during the insurrection, investigators have tracked the military-style coordination among some of the rioters.\n Some members of the mob inside the Capitol can be seen on video walking with their hands on each other's shoulders, which authorities believe indicates they were trained in certain paramilitary techniques, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\n Some also used radios to communicate as they moved through the Capitol, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\n Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, an Army reservist charged over the weekend for his alleged role in the insurrection, used voiced and hand signals to encourage rioters to advance through the building, according to court documents.\n Federal law enforcement agencies have warned in recent days of the potential for even more extremist-inspired violence across the country, including at Wednesday's Inauguration.\n It's unclear, however, to what extent the threat will materialize, as the failure to secure the Capitol has led authorities to erect a protective fortress around the perimeter of Washington's downtown government center.\n Even before their arrest, a conspiratorial bent had informed a plan for members of the Ohio State Regular Militia to stay away from Washington during the inaugural events.\n It's a \"trap,\" Crowl, the ex-marine, told The New Yorker in an interview before his arrest, adding in an expletive.",

        "title": "Dale: Reflections on four weird years fact checking every word from Donald Trump",
        "body_text": "I had to email the Boy Scouts to find out if the President had invented a nonexistent phone call from the head of the organization. (He had.)\n I had to email a Babe Ruth museum to find out if the President had made a bunch of false claims about the baseball legend while awarding him a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom. (He had.)\n I had to email some of Michigan's most prominent organizations to find out if the President had actually received a state \"Man of the Year\" award he kept claiming he once got. (Nope.)\n I fact checked every public word Donald Trump said or tweeted for just under four years. The job was unrelenting. The job was unrelentingly weird.\n Lots of politicians lie as a means to an end -- to wiggle out of a scandal or to inflate their policy accomplishments. Trump was willing to lie about everything, all the time, often for no obvious reason. This was lying as a way of life.\n And it took over much of my own life.\n I started counting Trump's false claims in September 2016, late in his race against Hillary Clinton, when I was the Washington correspondent for my hometown newspaper, Canada's Toronto Star. I started because I was frustrated by a gap in most US media coverage. Trump's incessant dishonesty was barely being mentioned in news copy, let alone treated as what it was: a central story of that campaign.\n So I thought I'd tweet out an occasional list of the false stuff Trump was saying. Then Michael Moore, the filmmaker, tweeted that I made a list \"every single day.\" I suddenly got thousands of eager new Twitter followers. And I thought: My God, I guess I need to do this every single day...\n I thought Trump's deception was bad then. It got much worse. In 2017, Trump averaged 2.9 false claims per day. By 2018, it was 8.3 false claims per day. What started as a side project I could handle in a few hours a week started requiring regular all-nighters. By the time I joined CNN in mid-2019, it required a second reporter, Tara Subramaniam.\n Trump's 2017 dishonesty tended to be impromptu ad-libbing. His 2018 dishonesty was much more scripted; he used serial lying as a deliberate strategy in the midterm elections. Then he used serial lying as a deliberate strategy in his 2019 Ukraine scandal. Then he used serial lying as a deliberate strategy in his response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic -- holding daily \"briefings\" so wildly dishonest that CNN needed me to go on TV right afterward to debunk the nonsense viewers had just heard.\n People almost certainly died because of Trump's Covid-19 lying. And people died at the Capitol because of Trump's lying spree about the 2020 election. Though there was some solid absurdist comedy mixed into the President's dishonesty repertoire -- I couldn't help but be entertained by his imaginary \"sir\" stories about burly blue-collar workers crying in his presence -- there were always dark consequences, too.\n One of them was anger at journalists. I received hundreds of hateful emails, thousands of irate tweets, one graphic death threat I felt compelled to report to police. For all the Twitter moms' concerns about my mental health, though, the job was always much more tiring than traumatic. I was typing at home in pajama pants, not covering a war.\n I lost my composure only once. Watching an early pandemic briefing in which Trump falsely assured Americans that the virus was under control, I choked up for a minute thinking of all the people who would probably die because of the President's mendacity.\n There was nothing to be done to stop him. Whether it was his consequential coronavirus lies or trivial lies like the Michigan Man of the Year fabrication, he kept lying no matter how many times fact checkers noted he was wrong. People kept asking me if the work felt pointless given his imperviousness to correction.\n It never did. The point was never to change Trump's own behavior.\n I had three aims. One, to get readers and viewers the facts they were not getting from their president. Two, to show other journalists when the President was lying so they might incorporate that information into their own work. Three, to take a stand for truth -- to declare that there was still such a thing as verifiable reality, no matter how hard Trump tried to erase it, and that we weren't going to surrender, no matter how hard Trump tried to discredit us.\n And so I stuck to a daily routine I could never have imagined before Trump launched his campaign.\n I would roll over in bed, turn off my alarm, and open Twitter to see what lies the President of the United States might have told while I was sleeping. And then, because Trump lied about a staggering variety of topics, I would try to rapidly educate myself on stuff I had known nothing about -- trade with China, or Obama-era veterans' health care legislation, or hurricane forecasting.\n The lying sometimes continued until I had gone to sleep. Every time I felt like I had caught up, Trump would lie about something new -- while still keeping many of the old lies in regular rotation. When I started tweeting fact checks of Trump's rally claims moments after he made them, admirers viewed this as a kind of magic trick. In truth, it was pretty easy. The President kept saying the same false stuff over and over.\n It was, in sum, a lot. In September 2020, I had to abandon my effort to produce a comprehensive count of the false claims: Trump was doing so much lying during the campaign that I physically could not keep up. By then, I'd tallied about 9,000 false claims since September 2016.\n Trump never lashed out at me that whole time. (He did block me on Twitter in 2017.) And unlike aides to other politicians I've fact checked, Trump's White House underlings never got in touch to try to scold me or to spin me out of a finding that he had been inaccurate.\n I thought this was telling.\n Whatever the Trump officials said publicly, they likely knew, too, that Trump lied a whole lot. They also knew that, whatever some guy wrote for a Canadian paper or said on CNN, they could get his lies to his base unchallenged through social media and friendly outlets like Fox News, One America News and Breitbart.\n Maybe my most disturbing experience on this beat was a trip to Trump-friendly towns in Ohio in 2017. I went to ask his supporters whether they knew he was lying. A bunch of them didn't. Even worse, a bunch of them did -- and told me they liked the lying because it was agitating Washington elites like me.\n I never got a good sense of how many Trump supporters were genuinely interested in the work of fact checkers, though I noted with interest that some of the Trump 2016 voters who switched to Joe Biden in 2020 mentioned his lying as a factor in their disenchantment. This sliver of the electorate aside, it has never been more obvious that a good chunk of the President's base has either followed him or preceded him down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories.\n Frankly, I don't know how to reach this hard-core bunch. But we should remember that it is a minority of the country, and we shouldn't let its belief in lies deter us from our mission of truth-telling. Whether we're covering Trump or Biden or any other politician, we need to be straight with our readers and viewers.\n Media coverage of Trump has improved since the inadequate 2016 coverage prompted me to embark on this project. By 2020, some traditional outlets would at least occasionally use the word \"lie\" in their Trump coverage; some would at least occasionally write stories focusing on the dishonesty. To be frank, though, I think the coverage of the lying remained inadequate to the end.\n Too often, coverage of flagrantly dishonest Trump speeches still mentioned the dishonesty in passing or not at all. Too often, coverage still quoted the President's lies without explaining that they were wrong.\n Telling people what is true and what is false is a core responsibility of every news reporter and every outlet. Pointing out a lie is objective reporting, not bias. And as interesting as all of this has been for me, fact checking should not be left to the designated fact checker.",

        "title": "Risk of ADHD may increase if expectant mother has autoimmune disorder, study says",
        "body_text": "Women with autoimmune disorders who become pregnant are significantly more likely to have babies that later develop attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, according to a longitudinal study of babies and mothers in Australia.\n Common autoimmune disorders include Type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's and celiac disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few.\n \"Autoimmune diseases are disorders where the immune system incorrectly 'attacks' the body,\" said study author Timothy Nielsen, a research officer and doctoral student at the Children's Hospital at Westmead Clinical School of the University of Sydney. The study was published Tuesday in JAMA Pediatrics.\n The attack can result in \"a 'multi-organ' disorder such as lupus, or an 'organ specific' disorder such as autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease),\" Nielsen said via email.\n Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, learning disabilities and autism are caused by disruptions in fetal brain development during pregnancy, Nielsen said. Prior research has linked autoimmune disorders in mothers with autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tics or Tourette's syndrome in children, he said, but this is one of the first studies to examine their role in ADHD.\n \"I hope these findings don't stress out women with autoimmune conditions too much,\" said developmental pediatrician Dr. Jenny Radesky, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Michigan Medicine C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who was not involved in the study.\n \"I treat lots of children with ADHD, and these findings wouldn't change how I manage them,\" Radesky said. \"Although kids with ADHD can be a handful, I love their little expansive, curious minds and unique ways of seeing things.\n \"Mothers with autoimmune disease can work to have optimal control of their condition during pregnancy, but autoimmune disease is not like smoking during pregnancy -- another risk factor for ADHD -- that mothers have more direct control over,\" she added.\n The study followed more than 63,000 children born full term between July 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, in New South Wales, Australia. Nielsen and his team identified 12,610 mothers with at least one of 35 common autoimmune disorders. Each of the expectant mothers had a diagnosis code for an autoimmune disorder in their linked hospitalization records.\n A child was determined to have ADHD if there was a hospital diagnosis of ADHD or a record of a prescribed or filled prescription for stimulants.\n All 12,610 offspring who were diagnosed with ADHD over the age of 3 were included in the study, and then matched to four children of the same age with mothers without any autoimmune disorders. Both sets of children were then followed until the end of 2014.\n The study also conducted a meta-analysis of existing research on the topic.\n Combined, the results have shown that a diagnosis of any autoimmune disease, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatic fever or rheumatic carditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), psoriasis and hyperthyroidism were associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the child at later ages.\n Precisely how a mother's autoimmune disorder might affect her unborn baby isn't yet known. Researchers hypothesize maternal autoantibodies -- those which attack the mother's body -- cross via the placenta. Inflammatory molecules could do the same.\n Once there, the chronic inflammation could alter fetal brain development, possibly by impacting innate immune cells in the developing baby's brain, the study said. Or perhaps inflammation alters epigenetic markers  -- the chemicals that turn genes on or off -- on key neurodevelopmental genes in the fetus.\n Another theory, the study said, is that inflammation impacts the formation and function of synapses in the baby's developing brain. Synapses are the small pockets of space between two cells that allow the cells to pass messages and communicate.\n \"These changes may lead directly to ADHD symptoms, or they may make the child more vulnerable to environmental risk factors,\" Nielsen said.\n Environment can contribute greatly to a child's neurodevelopmental outcomes. Studies have found associations between lower maternal education, socioeconomic status, depression and a parent's history of antisocial behavior and a child's risk for ADHD. Higher levels of iron in a child's blood has also been connected to hyperactivity disorders.\n Studies have found a strong link between hyperactivity and inattention in children and obesity and high blood pressure in the mother, as well the use of acetaminophen and smoking during pregnancy.\n Prior research has found that women with autoimmune disease that is poorly controlled by medication or other treatments could be a risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes such as failure to grow properly and preterm birth, Nielsen said.\n \"Our team is currently working on research into the causal mechanisms that underlie the association between autoimmune disease and ADHD,\" he said, which may shed light on whether the \"severity of disease, symptoms, use of medications or other inflammatory factors modifies this risk of ADHD.\"\n An expectant mom having an autoimmune disorder is only one of many risk factors for any childhood neurodevelopmental disorder, Nielsen stressed, \"but understanding risk and expression of disease is essential if we want to prevent and treat disease.\"\n Having the knowledge of such an association can empower both women and their health care providers to \"emphasize the importance of high-quality multidisciplinary care to manage autoimmune conditions before and during pregnancy,\" Nielsen said.\n \"This includes good pre-conception care and possibly avoiding pregnancy when disease activity is not well controlled,\" he said.\n Past that, it's no one's fault if a child develops a disorder based on a parent's medical condition, experts stress.\n \"Sometimes parents will perseverate on their guilt over a child's ADHD being their 'fault.' \" developmental pediatrician Radesky said.\n \"When this happens, I try to redirect their mental energy to understanding their child's unique mix of strengths and challenges, why the child behaves the way they do, and how to advocate for supports,\" she said.",

The public art display reflects \"our commitment to an inclusive and safe event that everyone can enjoy from home,\" the committee said.\n Biden's inauguration was already going to be unique given the pandemic. So the President-elect discouraged supporters from attending for their safety.\n Then, this month's insurrection at the US Capitol heightened security concerns, as federal officials warned that extremists are more emboldened by the violent events of January 6 to carry out their own attacks on Inauguration Day and throughout 2021.\n Biden's inauguration will be much more intimate than is standard for a presidential inauguration. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies said in December that the ceremony will more closely resemble a State of the Union address, for which members of Congress and the President can invite a limited number of guests.\n It'll be no less star-studded than usual, though: Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks, among others, are expected to perform Wednesday.\n The events will be broadcast on most major TV networks and will stream online from the Presidential Inaugural Committee's site.\n CNN's Nicole Gaouette and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

The Keystone pipeline system current stretches more than 2,600 miles, carrying crude from Alberta, Canada, through Manitoba, Canada, and down into Texas. The Keystone XL portion, which has been protested and opposed by numerous indigenous groups, would run from Alberta to Nebraska and cut through Montana and North Dakota.\n The Supreme Court delivered a substantial blow to the project in 2020 when it cleared the way for several pipeline projects to be receive fast-tracked permits, but excluded the Keystone XL pipeline from that order.\n The decision on put a block on the cross-border pipeline was first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, citing a presentation that included \"Rescind Keystone XL pipeline permit\" in the list of environmental executive actions Biden would take on his first day.\n The Biden transition declined to comment on the plans. A source familiar with the decision, however, said that the presentation reported by the CBC was weeks old.\n Trump signed executive actions at the outset of his administration that approved the Keystone XL pipeline, dispensing with plans from the Obama era to block construction.",

        "title": "Guiding gender-atypical kids through puberty ",
        "body_text": "Lisa Selin Davis is the author of \"Tomboy: The Surprising History and Future of Girls Who Dare to Be Different.\" She has written for The New York Times, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian and many other publications.\nMy 11-year-old daughter and I cracked open a book I'd bought for her on puberty and changing female bodies. On the very first page it informed her that, once her body developed, men would start looking at her differently.\n We crinkled our noses in some combination of discomfort and skepticism. No matter how her body changed, we both knew she would continue to wear the same oversize hoodies, cargo pants and short hair dyed pink that she'd been sporting for years. However well intentioned and helpful to gender-typical girls the book's messages were, they didn't seem to apply to a kid like mine, who had flouted gender norms her entire life. These books and others like it operate on the assumption that, once puberty hit, girls like mine would feminize and conform.\n Gender atypical girls have often been tolerated or even encouraged before puberty. \"Historically, they were labeled tomboys and there was a high acceptance of that and a presumption that they'd outgrow it,\" said Robert Blum, professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and lead investigator of The Global Early Adolescent Study, which looks at how gender socialization affects health globally.\n For a book about tomboys, I interviewed dozens of women who'd had happy tomboy childhoods, or what some have called a \"boyhood for girls.\" (For boys, that kind of gender atypicality was never sanctioned, even in childhood; they were called sissies, or worse.) These girls played baseball or football, hung out with boys and got their hands dirty. Many ran, shirtless, across the fields, until their mothers \u2014 they told me it was always their mothers \u2014 told them they were getting close to puberty and had to wear their shirts.\n Acceptance of their gender nonconforming behavior had an expiration date on it, whether the kids wanted it to or not.\n Puberty changes the rules of gender, and the force of gender norms and stereotypes bear down, even on kids who might have been immune to them before. In addition to the discomfort of a changing body, kids suddenly encounter changing expectations and social norms, based on their body parts.\n Gender stereotypes are international, ubiquitous and harmful, and particularly insidious as puberty approaches, noted Blum's 2017 study, It Begins at 10: How Gender Expectations Shape Early Adolescence Around the World.\n \"There is a global set of forces from schools, parents, media, and peers themselves that reinforce the hegemonic myths that girls are vulnerable and that boys are strong and independent,\" the report noted. Girls also feel pressure to sexualize, and boys feel pressure to see girls as sexual objects, leading to gender-based violence. In addition, puberty starts earlier for girls than it used to, so many girls' bodies are changing before their minds are ready.\n Many kids are \"really uncomfortable with the kind of messaging that assigns them certain gender roles, or certain attention paid to their gender,\" said Heather Corinna, an educator and founder of Scarleteen, a sex, sexuality and relationship education site for young people.\n Kids internalize the pressure to conform, and police those who don't, Corinna said. So do parents, even unwittingly. Parents treat kids differently based on sex, with separate and unequal rules and expectations, many studies have shown.\n The problem with those unequal rules and expectations is that they can force kids into boxes that just don't fit. Boys who feel pressure to conform to male stereotypes may grow into men with anxiety, who drink too much, tamp down their feelings or are prone to violence, according to ethnographer Maria do Mar Pereira, associate professor of sociology at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and author of \"Doing Gender in the Playground: The Negotiation of Gender in Schools.\"\n Meanwhile, many girls internalize the pressure to be thin; some 5% of girls suffer from eating disorders and some 60% are on diets. Twice as many girls than boys drop out of competitive sports by age 14, due to lack of role models, social stigma and decreased access, among other reasons, according to the Women's Sports Foundation. \"This constant effort to manage one's everyday life in line with gender norms produces significant anxiety, insecurity, stress and low self-esteem for both boys and girls, and both for 'popular' young people and those who have lower status in school,\" Do Mar Pereira's study concludes.\n What can we do to protect our kids from these messages and forces? The first thing is for adults and children to realize they're perpetuating them.\n Even in an era when some kids learn there are dozens of options for gender identity, gender norms persist. \"There's a notion that today there's a lot more flexibility,\" Blum said. \"There isn't. Gender norms are very prescriptive. Gender norms are very restrictive. And everyone reinforces those gender norms.\"\n Girls can be sent home from school for wearing skirts deemed too short, while boys can be given in-school suspension for wearing nail polish.\n Parents, Blum said, are often much more focused on restricting their pubertal daughters than their sons. \"But boys are at much greater risk for death from violence,\" he said. Adults can and should examine how they treat their boys and girls differently, and how much gender norms influence their decisions.\n Puberty education can also focus much more on attacking gender norms, much the way education programs for tweens and teens have tackled child abuse or bullying. That means, Blum said, \"teaching kids what's acceptable and unacceptable behavior.\"\n What's acceptable? According to Blum and Corinna, dressing or looking any way you want, no matter your sex or gender identity. What's unacceptable? Bullying someone because he, she or they don't look or behave how someone else thinks they should because of their sex. (The use of they/them pronouns are used when referring to an individual who self-identifies as nonbinary, the term that describes a person whose gender identity is neither male nor female.) Parents can tell kids that they don't need to meet adult expectations of their appearance or behavior just because their bodies are changing.\n The programming should also be trans-inclusive, and with the understanding that puberty is hard no matter how you identify or who you are, Corinna said. Some kids, for instance, won't know they're intersex until puberty, when their bodies don't perform as expected, based on the sex they were assigned at birth.\n If a child is uncomfortable with the idea or experience of puberty, Corinna said, ask why. Most education around puberty doesn't adequately address kids' experiences, they said.\n \"There's dismissive messaging to everybody,\" Corinna said. \"Kids presumed to be cisgender \u2014 who may or may not be trans or otherwise gender nonconforming \u2014 are often told that any discomfort with puberty must be about them being trans.\" The idea that such kids could be uncomfortable with puberty otherwise, Corinna said, is often not even considered. Cisgender refers to children whose gender identity conforms with the sex they were assigned at birth.\"\n In addition to recognizing how adults treat kids, and improving the kinds of health education they receive, families can present kids with gender-diverse books and media, which have not only trans and nonbinary characters, but also physically and emotionally strong girls and vulnerable, sensitive boys (admittedly, harder to find).\n \"This is an opportune time for communities to encourage the development of positive health and equitable gender norms early in life that can be transformative both immediately and over the life course,\" a 2017 commentary in the Journal of Adolescent Health noted.\n In other words, it's incredibly important to widen the range of what's acceptable in early adolescence, a time when society is often narrowing that range. \"The goal should be to broaden what it means to be conforming,\" Blum said.\n In the 1970s and early '80s, many kids listened religiously to \"Free to Be... You and Me,\" an album encouraging the blasting of gender stereotypes, and telling girls they didn't have to be traditionally feminine and telling boys they could. \"I might be pretty; you might grow tall. But we don't have to change at all,\" go the lyrics of \"When We Grow Up,\" sung by Diana Ross.\n My parents taught me to question why there were different rules of decorum for boys and girls, and I try to pass on those same critical thinking skills to my kids. I tell my child that all the options are open to her, including the option that, as the song says, she doesn't have to change at all.\n \"Our job is to create a protective environment for kids to be who they will become,\" Blum said. \"And to run interference around those who will try to knock them down because of it.\"",

        "title": "Tesla has started deliveries of the Chinese-made Model Y",
        "body_text": "Tesla has begun rolling out locally made Model Y crossover vehicles in China, reaching an important milestone in the world's largest auto market.\n The electric carmaker announced the news on Twitter on Monday, releasing photos of the SUV being purchased from a company showroom.\n The Model Y is the second vehicle Tesla (TSLA) has made and sold in China, after deliveries of the Model 3 kicked off last year. Both lines are being produced at the company's sprawling Gigafactory in Shanghai, where manufacturing started in 2019.\n Deliveries began Monday in cities including Shanghai, Hangzhou and Wuhan, the company said in a Chinese social media post. To help customers feel more comfortable, staff also packed a \"virus prevention\" kit in the new vehicles, which included bottles of hand sanitizer, it added.\n China has increasingly become a critical part of Tesla's global strategy, with CEO Elon Musk once calling its factory there a \"template for future growth.\"\n In 2019, the company beat its own deadline to start making cars in China, kicking off trial production only 10 months after it broke ground on the plant. That boosted confidence that the company had the ability to hit delivery targets as it grew.\n Tesla has said that the initial goal for the Shanghai factory is to make 250,000 cars a year, before ramping up to 500,000 units. It revealed last October that it had hit that first goal, while \"continuing to expand\" capacity significantly.\n The company was also the first foreign automaker to be allowed to open a factory in the country without a Chinese partner, putting pressure on local players.\n Tesla previously won a tax break for some of its cars, which helped make its prices more attractive to customers. It also lowered the price of its Model 3 to qualify for government subsidies.\n The debut of the Chinese-made Model Y has been hotly anticipated, with the launch seen as another challenge to Chinese rival Nio (NIO), which sells its own line of electric SUVs.\n Tesla has recently leaned more heavily on its Chinese operations, including a decision last October to start exporting Chinese-made vehicles to Europe.\n It also has plans to push deeper elsewhere in Asia, including a launch in India that is expected to happen this year.\n Meanwhile, the Chinese auto market is predicted to become even more crucial in the coming years. \"By 2022, we believe [more than 40%] of Tesla's overall delivery sales could come from China, as this remains the main growth region going forward, followed by Europe, then the US,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note last week.\n \u2014 Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Egyptian authorities have arrested a pastry chef for baking cakes with genital-shaped toppings after images of them went viral on social media.\n The cakes drew the attention of authorities after a Facebook post showing a group of women eating them at a birthday party in an exclusive Cairo community club went viral, state newspaper Al-Ahram said Monday.\n The baker was arrested and later released from custody after posting EGP 5000 ($318) bail, semi-official newspaper Akhbar el-Yom said.\n The pictures of the women eating cupcakes with penis and vagina-shaped iced toppings at the Gezira Club circulated widely on Facebook this week, stoking debate between Egyptian social media users.\n \"After investigations, it was possible to determine the manufacturer of the sweets... security services were able to detain her at her residence in Cairo where she was using her home to manufacture the sweets,\" said Al-Ahram.\n The Ministry of Youth and Sports is investigating.\n \"We will not be lenient [with our decisions],\" Mohamed Fawzy, spokesman for the ministry, told a news program on Egyptian television.\n Egypt's top Islamic religious body Dar al-Ifta also issued a statement saying that sexual insinuations on cakes is religiously forbidden and legally criminalized, calling the incident a \"blatant abuse to societal values.\"\n The incident caused uproar amongst Egyptian social media users and was the highlight of the country's prime time talk shows.\n Some on social media criticized the women involved and called for more action to be taken by authorities, with claims the incident was an attack \"on family values.\"\n But others offered support and criticized Egypt's slow response to arrest sexual harassers, rapists and abusers compared to measures being taken against the women.\n Since taking power in 2014, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has passed a number of laws tightening government control of the internet.\n One piece of legislation strengthened the government's ability to target social media as part of continued efforts to crack down on dissent, including categorizing social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers as public websites and therefore worthy of surveillance.\n Last week, an Egyptian appeals court overturned prison sentences for two well-known TikTok influencers, in a high-profile public morality case.\n Haneen Hossam and Mawada Eladhm had been charged with \"violating family values and principles and establishing and running online accounts to commit this crime.\"\n They were initially sentenced to two years in prison in July 2020, and fined EGP 300,000 (around $19,000 USD) each.",

She sits by herself, wearing a huge pair of headphones and lends an ear to the most unusual characters who call in from around the world.\n \"Black Monday\" actor Paul Scheer, his wife, \"Grace and Frankie\" actress June Diane Raphael, and comedian Jason Mantzoukas break down truly awful movies -- and it's hilarious. \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" \"Swordfish,\" and the entire \"The Fast and the Furious\" franchise are all discussed. No one is safe.\n Comedian Nicole Byer takes dating and turns it upside down. Her podcast is a full investigation into why she's remained single for most of her life. Every week, she has a guest on to discuss why dating is so complicated, disastrous and funny.\n Comedian Mike Birbiglia gets raw and honest about life after becoming a dad. His wife, poet Jennifer Hope Stein, contributes her voice to the book too. (You can also stream the stage version of their stories on Netflix.)\n Sedaris chose a collection of favorite essays that he has written over the years. The book includes tales about shopping for rare taxidermy and his dealings with his family, a cast of characters that will make you laugh out loud.\n Samantha Irby, who wrote the Hulu show \"Shrill,\" starring Aidy Bryant (based on a novel by Lindy West), writes about how she wants to become the next \"Bachelorette\" and how she deals with friends who have moved to the burbs and can no longer barhop with her.\n This show on Amazon Prime is a hidden gem. Chelsea Peretti stars as a 39-year-old caterer with no real romantic prospects and a dream of opening a restaurant. You'll fall in love with Peretti if you're not already familiar with her standup.\n In one of the very best and most creative standup shows to come out of the coronavirus pandemic, Morril used friends and whatever free space he could find on New York City rooftops to make the special. The result is truly original.\n Starring humorist Fran Lebowitz in conversation with Martin Scorsese, who also directed the series, the two break down a pre-pandemic New York and it's a beautiful.\n Birbiglia loved watching this too, telling CNN, \"I think what's so charming about [Lebowitz] is that as a new Yorker, when you're watching her, she is sort of effortlessly and endlessly entertaining, just free associating about living in New York. And she's making fun of New York over and over and over again. And it's making me love New York even more.\"\n Jones wins the internet. The comedian has long shared her refreshingly candid opinions on current events, but her recent Zoom room critiques are especially joyous.\n Someone please give her a show doing just this.\n Writer Jordan Firstman has attracted an Instagram crowd over the past year with his hilarious impressions.\n A man who manages to give voice to the publicist for banana bread or the ever-controversial-herb cilantro is worth following.",

        "title": "Why Putin wants to keep Navalny locked up",
        "body_text": "Michael Bociurkiw (@WorldAffairsPro) is a global affairs analyst and host of the podcast \"Global Impact.\" He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nWith Alexei Navalny back in Russia five months after surviving a poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok, his courageous return presented Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who Navalny believes ordered his killing -- with two choices: allow the high-profile activist to continue to be a thorn in his side or lock him up in the hopes that he fades into obscurity.\n We learned Sunday that Putin chose the second option. And the question now is whether Navalny's anti-corruption movement can survive with its incredibly telegenic and social media savvy leader isolated from the frontlines -- especially with factors like pandemic restrictions limiting public gatherings stacked against them.\n We were also reminded, if we even needed it, of Putin's disdain for any form of dissent, his reflex to reach for the most barbaric tactics to silence voices of opposition. These certainly are not the hallmarks of a leader who seeks a place in history among the great statesmen of the world.\n Unfortunately for Navalny, his brave gamble in going back to take on someone as ruthless as Putin appears to have been a miscalculation. The Russian leader can remain in office for years, cares little about the international opprobrium for his treatment of Navalny and no doubt expects little retaliation from a United States pre-occupied with the turmoil of Donald Trump's departure. That makes it unlikely to mean -- at least in the short term -- that Navalny's supporters can make a heroic return to the protest barricades.\n Indeed, during a hastily arranged hearing on Monday at the Moscow police station where he is being held, Navalny was ordered to remain in custody for 30 days. In what can best be described as a sham trial, a judge was brought in, defense lawyers were not informed until the last minute and only pro-Kremlin journalists were allowed to attend.\n The prospects for the 44-year-old politician -- expected to be jailed for at least 3.5 years\u2014 do not look at all favorable.\n Shortly before his arrest, he told journalists at Moscow's airport he was not afraid because \"I know that I will leave and go home because I'm right and all the criminal cases against me are fabricated.\" Navalny probably wanted to end his stay abroad in order to avoid the risk of becoming irrelevant or being seen as a foreign-backed agent. Likely he had an eye on two things: the situation of Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who was forced to go into exile in Lithuania last August and remains outside of her country, and the fact that Russians -- as I am told by many contacts in the country -- rarely have sympathy for politicians who flee abroad (even though his departure from Russia last year was forced by his needing medical treatment after the poisoning attempt, which almost killed him).\n Putin, who typically refuses to acknowledge Navalny by name and has said that if Russian special services had wanted to kill Navalny they would have \"finished it,\" probably wanted nothing more than to see the anti-corruption activist absent at least until later this year, after elections for the lower house of Parliament are held and where the ruling, pro-Putin United Russia party is hoping to be handed a loyal majority in the next State Duma. \"This is the main political event of the year and the main reason to ensure his (Navalny's) absence,\" Russian political scientist and Chatham House Associate Fellow Ekaterina Schulmann told me Sunday.\n At the time of his poisoning, Navalny, who refers to United Russia as the party \"of crooks and thieves\" was promoting a \"Smart Voting\" strategy that encourages voters to cast tactical ballots for any opposition candidates considered likely to unseat a ruling party member in regional and federal elections. The tactic was used effectively in Moscow last year. That, coupled with an ability to reach millions of supporters via social media and in a way which Putin and his cronies are unable to compete, presented a formidable challenge that the Kremlin could not ignore.\n Navalny's return home also comes at a time the Kremlin and its security services are likely still seething: Late last year, an investigation by CNN-Bellingcat revealed the complicity of Kremlin agents in the poisoning, with Navalny duping a Russian agent tailing him into discussing details of the poisoning.\n To further complicate matters for Navalny and his movement, harsh Covid-19 restrictions in Russia make it difficult for large protests to take place. That, coupled with an economic downturn, essentially silenced Russia's protest movement throughout 2020.\n The pandemic situation in Russia is one of Putin's top problems at the moment. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Russia, with more than 3.5 million cases, has the fifth highest caseload in the world. (Though Russia's official reporting figures, especially on deaths, is said to be wildly inaccurate).\n A series of other economic headaches are hitting hard: plummeting global oil prices, the disruption to the completion of Russia's $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and punishing sanctions imposed after Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and invaded eastern Ukraine shortly afterward. An unpopular attempt in 2018 to raise the pension age infuriated many Russians and caused the ruling party's popularity to plummet.\n Putin may have wanted to sideline Navalny at a time when incoming US President Joe Biden is distracted by crises like Covid-19, domestic violence and the foreign policy fires lit by outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Taiwan, Cuba, Sudan) in his final days in office.\n Russia is certainly on Biden's agenda, with his incoming National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan already signaling a more activist approach, calling the attacks on Navalny \"not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard.\"\n But the new administration needs to play a more activist role. Biden needs to take this opportunity to forge a unified alliance among world leaders to confront Putin and renew pressure on him to lay off opposition leaders such as Navalny and Tikhanovskaya.\n And to do it before Putin takes any more outrageous steps against those who speak out in opposition to him.",

        "title": "States complain that demand for the Covid-19 vaccine is outpacing supply ",
        "body_text": "So far, the US has distributed more than 31 million Covid-19 vaccines to the states, but the CDC says only about 40% have actually been given to people, according to the latest data.\n But the evidence shows the percentage of people vaccinated is likely much better than what the numbers suggest.\n There's lag time between when the states report their numbers to the CDC and there's an additional reporting delay with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. For example, Michigan's website says that as of Sunday, it's given out 124,000 more doses than the CDC gives it credit for. The CDC numbers last updated Friday.\n \"If it takes me firing up my pickup truck and doing it myself, so be it,\" Kemp said.\n Georgia residents have called his office frustrated with the rollout and the supply.\n \"Yes, the phone lines will be busy. Yes, the websites will certainly crash,\" Kemp said. \"This is no doubt frustrating. I would prefer that we have ample supply, and we could vaccinate everyone immediately.\"\n \"We're doing great,\" Piercey told CNN. \"The only thing we're missing is supply.\"\n Piercey said she has made it clear to her clinics they should hold nothing back. Their single goal, she said, should be \"to run out of vaccine.\"\n \"It is wholly unethical for us to sit on it,\" Piercey said.\n Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday called for the federal government to release more doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, saying that his state currently had \"a very limited supply.\"\n Last week Walz signed onto a letter with other governors that urged the US to purchase as many vaccines as possible so states could get more shots in arms in the coming weeks.\n \"If you look at the number of doses being administered by week, they are picking up the pace considerably compared to the first couple of weeks of the vaccination program,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, the deputy director of the Immunization Action Coalition, who has also run several prior vaccination campaigns. \"As we have predicted, their capacity to deliver vaccines is increasing as they get accustomed to the process and work out the bugs in the system.\"\n Michigan is using the National Guard to augment the work of local clinics and the state is vaccinating people faster, according to Tricia Foster, the chief operating officer for Michigan's Covid-19 response.\n \"We've jumped forward considerably in our doses in arms,\" Foster said.\n Foster said the CDC numbers don't fully capture Michigan's effort. Like in other states, part of the state's allocation has been set aside for a long-term care vaccination program the federal government runs in Michigan. That program gets about 245,000 of the state's total doses. The federal government only reports its numbers twice a week.\n New York also wants to buy doses directly. The state website said it has given out about 72% of its doses as of Monday. State officials think the supply could run out by week's end. Mount Sinai in New York City has temporarily suspended vaccine appointments between January 15 and 19 due to supply shortages, according to affiliate WABC.\n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo blamed the delays on the federal government. Cuomo said Monday he wrote to the president of Pfizer asking to buy doses directly.\n \"After myself and seven other governors called on the Trump Administration to release more doses, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said that relief was on the way. To date, however, the federal government has not acted on that promise -- in fact, New York will received just 250,000 doses this week, 50,000 fewer than the week prior,\" the letter said.\n Pfizer responded that it was open to collaborating with the federal government on a distribution model that \"gives as many Americans as possible access to our vaccine as quickly as possible. However, before we can sell directly to state governments, HHS would need to approve that proposal based on the EUA granted to Pfizer by the FDA.\"\n Vaccines cannot come soon enough. The incoming director the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said Sunday the country could see \"some dark weeks ahead,\" predicting half a million deaths in the US by mid-February.\n CNN's Keri Enriquez, Diedre McPhillips, Amanda Watts, Amanda Sealy, and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report",

        "body_text": "Ahead of Wednesday's transition of power, Black voters in Atlanta say they are feeling more represented and are hopeful for the future despite the divisiveness the country has experienced over the last four years.\n They have been bolstered by their success in helping President-elect Joe Biden win in Georgia on Election Day and by changing the state's representation in the US Senate in the two runoff elections, races in which Black voters played a crucial role.\n For the first time, Georgia has a Black senator, Raphael Warnock, who along with fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican candidates Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the January 5 showdown that determined control of the US Senate.\n And with Kamala Harris about to become vice president, another series of firsts will occur this week -- the first woman vice president, the first Black vice president and the first Indian American vice president.\n \"I have two young sons and just to see people in office that looked like me gives me hope for the future, the future for them,\" Tagan Lovett told CNN.\n Lovett and her friends, Tierra Carter and Lisan Douglas, said they are excited and hopeful that the outcome of these elections will help change the US for the better.\n \"I'm ready for the change. I'm done with the division, and I'm ready for us to unite as a country slowly. I know it's not going to happen overnight. It's not going to happen in four years, eight years, maybe even 20, but just a different direction,\" Carter said.\n \"Hopefully, we'll have someone in an office that cares about the people, like actually cares about the people,\" Douglas told CNN. \"We have a lot of politicians that say they do, and they speak all this rhetoric, but they show no action.\"\n Douglas said she's ready to see action from lawmakers and officials. \"We've heard it all the talk. We've heard all the speeches,\" she said. \"Let's see the action what's going to happen. Let's get it done.\"\n In the face of political divisions that have rocked the country -- and which hit their nadir during the January 6 storming of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump -- these voters think the new faces can help the US turn a new chapter.\n \"My hope is that we can all come together as a nation. Like we're all, again, Americans, we're all living in America and we need to like, just come together,\" Lovett said. \"This isn't gonna work with just this division. It's just not. And I I'm just hopeful.\"\n Kevin Scandrett, a self-proclaimed ATLien from Atlanta's West Side, was impressed by the campaign to encourage voting in the state.\n \"To have the state of Georgia and the city of Atlanta be so pivotal in the presidential election, it's really, really heartwarming,\" Scandrett told CNN.\n He's hopeful that Biden will keep his promises and help guide the country away from divisiveness.\n \"It's a sense of relief, so much going on, all these last four years. I mean a whole lot of racial tension,\" Scandrett said. \"It's just a good thing that we can finally move forward as a society.\"\n Scandrett's mother Denise James said the division of the last few years was \"very hurtful.\"\n She said she couldn't believe what happened on January 6, when a mob of people overtook the US Capitol, sending politicians into hiding and disrupting the formal presidential vote verification.\n \"I thought it was another country. I couldn't believe that our country was actually fighting each other,\" she said, choking up. \"We got to call the National Guard to protect us.\"\n James shares her sons' hope for a better, less divided future with Biden at the helm following his inauguration on Wednesday.\n \"I feel very hopeful. Not just because of Joe Biden, but because I know that he has the whole world in his hand. So, we are going to be all right. We're going to be good.\"\n In Atlanta, Black radio remains an important grapevine for voters and the V103 station has kept listeners engaged in the city's trending topics.\n Host Big Tigger entertains commuters with his popular radio show, and in 2020, it not only provided entertainment and witty banter, but also political discourse and a platform to reach voters.\n \"We had Vice President-elect Joe Biden. We had Jon Ossoff.  We had Senator Warnock. I love saying Senator Warnock, we had, Kamala Harris. She called on my birthday, which was awesome. Wish me happy birthday. Uh, we had Stacy Abrams,\" Big Tigg said.\n When Georgia flipped the two Senate seats, Big Tigg and his co-hosts Ms. Basketball and Tylerchronicles, whose real name is Troy Fluker, fielded call after call of excitement and optimism.\n \"People were so happy because after having so many bad things happen in 2020, it was like a sigh of relief. Like, yes, something's finally going our way,\" said Christina Granville, AKA Ms. Basketball.\n \"It felt a lot more hopeful before what happened at the Capitol,\" Big Tigg, whose real name is Darian Morgan, told CNN. \"But at the same time, lots of people are hopeful that, OK, now maybe we can get on a better path. We know it's not gonna all get fixed immediately...We know we have a lot of work still to do, but at least maybe we have the right people that are in our corner that reflect our interests.\"\n Isaac Lee Hayes III, the son of the late soul musician and actor Isaac Hayes, is a record producer and content creator who believes Atlanta and Georgia have helped spark a new movement in the South.\n \"It was completely critical because there's so much on the line, especially with healthcare, $15 minimum wage, this pandemic, you know, assistance to people that need it.\"\n Hayes said Black voters in the South have for years been ignored and overlooked.  He thinks the high voter turnout, especially among the state's Black residents is a positive step.\n \"We showed up heavy, you know what I'm saying? We let our voice be heard. And I think voting is becoming part of our culture. ... Georgia came through with flying colors.\"\n The record turnout of voters in the Peach State signified hope is on the horizon for many.  This was echoed over and over again by Black voters from around the city.\n \"My hope is that we can all come together as a nation,\" Kevin Taylor told CNN. \"I'm hoping for more peace, more coming together, more love.\"",

        "title": "Violence at Capitol and beyond reignites a debate over America's long-held defense of extremist speech ",
        "body_text": "With most Americans hoping this week's expected inauguration protests look nothing like the Capitol siege, questions emerge about unrestrained free expression, long championed by First Amendment theorists as a benefit to society, no matter how ugly and hateful.\n The optics may be disturbing, especially so soon after the riot, with the potential of protesters -- many of like mind with those who stormed the Capitol -- screaming, or worse, at troops and police standing guard outside the razor wire-topped fences surrounding the Capitol.\n Is allowing this type of expression \"good\" for America? An old First Amendment theory -- known as the safety valve -- says it is, that permitting groups to express themselves releases pressure, ensuring objectionable ideas aren't driven underground where they might boil over into violence.\n Permitting free speech, including hate and extremist speech, is often cast as a universal boon, reinforced in idioms such as, \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant\" and \"I don't agree with what you say, but I'll defend your right to say it.\"\n Not all First Amendment scholars are buying the safety valve theory, especially after the deadly episode at the Capitol. They question if extremist speech demands more limitations when it's inextricably linked to the violence at the nation's legislative headquarters, after hateful online rhetoric dovetailed with politicians and activists delivering speeches to revved-up crowds that marched to the Capitol, some bent on insurrection.\n Even the American Civil Liberties Union, the consummate guardian of speech, has sought to address the \"competing values\" its long-held defense of expression presents, and some experts say free speech theories need to take into account the way social media has been used to manipulate the marketplace of ideas.\n \"We have to pay attention to the way that tech platforms are shaping discourse and the way technology moves fringe ideas into the mainstream,\" said Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \"The idea we would somehow get out of it by not paying attention to what's going on and opening the floodgates to more speech misunderstands the phenomenon of online platforms and misunderstands the technology.\"\n Ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, government and corporations are taking measures to avoid the violence that marred his Electoral College affirmation. Thousands of troops and police will be on hand, and companies including Apple, Google, Amazon, Twitter and Facebook are deplatforming and banning users, including President Donald Trump, while corporations such as PayPal and Airbnb are temporarily blocking resources, such as fundraising venues and places to stay.\n Some of those targeted are crying censorship, but the First Amendment protects against government, not private organizations, stymieing expression. Big Tech and others, several scholars say, are correct to shut down extremist speech after seeing the role words on their platforms played in planning and stoking the Capitol mayhem.\n The concept that would become the safety valve theory was born with US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' 1927 concurring opinion in Whitney v. California. He posited \"that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine.\"\n Four decades later, renowned First Amendment scholar Thomas Emerson named the theory, writing that \"suppression of belief, opinion and expression is an affront to the dignity of man, a negation of man's essential nature.\"\n Robert Richards, founding director for the Pennsylvania Center for the First Amendment at Penn State, believes the safety valve theory has relevance in today's censorship discussions, he said, but he's not sure it's at play here, yet, given the timeframes, who's shutting down the speech and the other available avenues for expression.\n Rather, he sees the corporations responding in a temporary manner to an emergency situation, \"exigent circumstances that threaten to play out again,\" he said. Yes, shutting down speakers over time carries risks their behavior will \"bubble up in some worse fashion,\" but there's no indication the corporate measures are permanent. They're narrowly tailored to specific speakers, apps or windows of time, he said.\n \"The main difference (between corporations and government shutting down speech) is the private sector can make its own rules,\" he said. \"Going forward, those restrictions will ease up as the temperature of the country's politics goes down. ... I don't really think there's a lot of permanent ending of speech.\"\n A far better example of the safety valve theory is the Arab Spring, Richards said. Citizens rose up across the Middle East and Africa -- to spur reform and regime change, not question a legitimate election -- but their anger reached critical mass after years of systemic oppression, he said, not a few weeks of Twitter or Airbnb bans. Americans also have alternative venues to speak out, where most Tunisians and Libyans did not\n Brandeis died in 1941, Emerson in 1991 -- long before the advent of social media. They couldn't envision what the town square would become once an individual could reach millions by pulling out a phone and pecking at the screen.\n \"As a technologist and a lawyer, I've been troubled by the role that gatherings facilitated by technology have played,\" said Wendy Seltzer, an affiliate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. \"The First Amendment protects speech but not incitement to violence, so the challenge is to figure out how to offer the widest possible venue/forum for speech that enables people to develop ideas ... and find other perspectives and learn, while having checks in place to prevent it from turning into violence or being a place where violent mobs gather to plot their activities.\"\n Distinguishing between protected speech and incitement of violence isn't easy. Many theorists once felt online \"rabbit hole conspiracy development\" was harmless, Seltzer said, but new research suggests \"people (are) being drawn into them because they find themselves surrounded by people with extreme viewpoints and get confirmation for those viewpoints -- and they have a hard time getting back to reality.\"\n While Seltzer says experts need to reevaluate where First Amendment theory \"meets practice when people behave in ways that get radicalized by discussion,\" others call for outright prohibitions on extremist speech.\n Numerous nations, including Canada and some American allies across Europe, have banned hate speech, in particular, but the US Supreme Court historically has held such rhetoric is protected -- despite myriad examples of First Amendment caveats, including inciting violence, libel/slander, child pornography, fighting words, copyright infringements and threatening the president.\n Roy Gutterman, director of Syracuse University's Tully Center for Free Speech, worries, he said: Once you start criminalizing speech, where does it end?\n \"Europe and Germany and France, they have different histories and obviously their laws have criminalized certain speech that we would legally accept here,\" he said. \"The categories of speech that we criminalize are really specific and narrow, and narrow for a reason. I'm not sure a new category of illegal hate speech would really comport with the First Amendment, and maybe I'm being naive.\"\n Ninety-four years after Brandeis' pontifications, it's still an evolving discussion. Supreme Court decisions offer sparse bright lines for what expression can be banned.\n Texas v. Johnson said flag burning is OK. Watts v. US stated that \"crude political hyperbole\" is not a true threat, another First Amendment caveat. Brandenburg v. Ohio found speech advocating crime is allowed as long as it doesn't incite imminent lawlessness. Virginia v. Black ruled cross burnings could be carried out in private but not in public to intimidate others. Elonis v US ruled rapping about killing can be protected speech, but Justice Samuel Alito, in a partial dissent, worried the high court decision would \"cause confusion and serious problems\" because it left the standard for true threats subjective.\n Justice Sonia Sotomayor said herself the high court's standards for true threats are murky. In denying a 2017 hearing in Perez v. Florida involving a man drunkenly threatening to blow up a liquor store, she wrote the Watts and Black cases clarify a speaker must intend to convey a threat to be guilty of a crime, but the high court never addressed the level of intent -- \"a question we avoided two terms ago in Elonis.\"\n Gutterman knows definitive answers are elusive; still, he errs on the side of free expression, he said.\n \"So often, free speech advocates end up having to support viewpoints that we don't always agree with,\" he said. \"After what we saw (at the Capitol) and even going back a couple years to Charlottesville, I can understand how people might have reservations about the safety valve theory. I still think it involves a pretty important function, to allow people to say things that are offensive.\"\n Other observers see it differently, including Richard Moon, a law professor at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, where hate speech laws broadly prohibit inciting hatred against \"identifiable groups.\"\n \"Hate speech and false claims on the internet can have consequences -- and are not just steam being blown off,\" he said. \"Hateful speech plays to fear and resentment -- appealing to the audience at a visceral level. It is often directed at a sympathetic audience in a context that limits the opportunity for debate and reflection. In such circumstances, some in the audience may take seriously the message of hate speech and follow its logic to a violent conclusion.\"\n Bad actors harnessed free speech to fool the Capitol rioters into believing an election was stolen, justifying their anger and pushing them to violence, Moon said. While he worries efforts to ban hateful, harassing or misleading speech might become overinclusive, he said, he's not convinced that's happening.\n \"Limiting the spread of false information -- particularly to a mob -- is not going to lead to more violence,\" he said. \"I'm not persuaded that the frustration at not being able to reach a significant audience outweighs the risks that come with spreading hatred and disinformation. There is more reason to think that denying hatemongers a platform cuts off their oxygen.\"\n Harvard's Seltzer and Donovan say it's time to have new conversations on the absolutist interpretations of the First Amendment, taking into consideration the ways ideas live, grow and motivate others in the technological landscape.\n Race and gender scholars point out notions about free speech emanate primarily from scholars and politicians who are overwhelmingly White, Seltzer said: \"It's easy for a White male to say, 'Anyone's speech is OK,' and much harder for someone in a minority position who is constantly bombarded with speech telling them they are not equal and who don't have as much access to laws and courts to gain protections.\"\n Those notions also don't account for confirmation bias, a plague of social media wherein people believe disinformation, seek out data supporting it and ignore contradicting information.\n \"Our First Amendment theory and practice need to be informed by the context and the way humans behave in technological affordances,\" Seltzer said. \"I'm comfortable saying I will defend even hateful speech as long as I can stand up in alliance with those harmed by that speech and do useful things to protect them from the consequences of it.\"\n Donovan doesn't think about extremist speech in the abstract, she said. As a queer woman, she moved to Canada in 2004 to escape the hate she felt homing in on the LGBTQ community.\n As an expert in online extremism and disinformation campaigns, she watched as: Trump \"seeded hundreds of little lies\" across fertile social media fields; extremists tore Black Lives Matter banners off church facades last month, most with little consequence; and key figures in Gamergate and Charlottesville stoked online fury ahead of the attempted coup.\n \"I think about what it makes people who are hated on have to do in order to stay safe. ... I think about the people who are impacted, all the things Black people are going to have to go through in the next couple weeks to make sure they're not attacked,\" Donovan said.\n It can't be ignored, too, that some of those involved in the January 6 attempted coup chanted about the Vice President, \"Hang Mike Pence!\" and one of the insurrectionists wrote, \"Murder the media\" on a door inside the Capitol.\n \"We're not in the abstract here in that there's no direct threat, and there's no morally ambiguous words being used here. They're threatening to kill people,\" Donovan said.\n It will take years to \"dampen and temper\" the effects of extremists having the opportunity to network and congregate unfettered, said Donovan, who in 2018 made a case for journalists and community groups \"quarantining\" toxic ideas.\n \"I'm talking about this group that really rode the lightning that was Donald Trump into relevancy, and now we have to understand that those people who have met each other and smiled and high-fived and talked about overthrowing the Capitol and killing (US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and hanging Mike Pence, they now all know each other. They've exchanged phone numbers,\" she said.\n Those ideas grow more dangerous in numbers, Seltzer said.\n \"It would be great if the safety valve worked,\" she said. \"The fear and what we're seeing in lots of YouTube rabbit holes and QAnon conversations is people expressing things that are out there and finding themselves amid a cluster of people whose views are even further out there -- maybe even more dangerous views.\n \"They're not in the public square taking turns on a soap box. They're in an echo chamber.\"",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nThe UK is in the middle of a devastating second wave, pushing health care workers closer to the brink as they treat more Covid-19 patients in hospitals than at any point in the pandemic, Kara Fox reports.\n Fazilah, an intensive care unit (ICU) nurse at a central London hospital, told CNN that during the first wave of the pandemic, she was enveloped by a wave of depression for months, but was too busy saving other people's lives to be able to identify it, or process it. Now she's working through another nightmare.\n UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned last week that the country's hospitals are at substantial risk of being overwhelmed if cases keep rising. The country had the highest death rate in the world last week, according to Our World in Data. There are currently more than 37,400 Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals.\n ICU nurses working for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) are bearing the brunt of this surge. A number of ICU workers CNN spoke to say they have been pushed to \"dilute\" the level of care because of the spike in admissions and in some cases they say they are treating as many as eight patients at a time -- far higher than the \"safe\" NHS recommended ICU nurse to patient ratio of 1:1 to 1:2.\n While the NHS has not responded to CNN's request for comment, NHS chief executive Simon Stevens told the BBC on Sunday that the nurse to patient ratio varied between hospitals from 1:1 to 1:2 to 1:3, and that staff are making \"dynamic adjustments in real time.\"\n It's a situation that not only risks compromising the level of care for the sick, but also adds to the stress and well-being of the health care workers providing it, Ameera Sheikh, an ICU nurse and Unite union representative at a London hospital, told CNN. Even on off days, it's almost impossible to switch off. \"Guilt suddenly rushes in because you aren't at work helping,\" she said.\n And when a patient dies, there is often little time to grieve before the next patient arrives. \"It's like you're on a constant carousel and you can't get off,\" said Fazilah.\n Next, check the Covid-19 vaccination page on your state health department's website. Most have links to county-level appointment sites where you can sign up, and emails where you can direct questions.\n For those who are less internet savvy, each state also provides a phone number. Be patient, experts suggest, as the lines are often busy. To assist, CNN has created a list of vaccination information pages for all 50 states and territories here:\n Send your questions here.

It is a dangerous gambit that could risk undermining overall confidence in mass vaccinations just as the world desperately needs people to get inoculated, James Griffiths reports.\n For example, the state-run tabloid Global Times has led the way in defending Chinese-produced vaccines, not by establishing their effectiveness, but by seeking to tear down the reputation of other candidates -- particularly those produced by US company Pfizer.\n Days before Joe Biden is set to take over the Presidency, US President Donald Trump has lifted coronavirus-related travel restrictions for much of Europe, the UK, and Brazil, effective January 26.\n Biden's administration has promised to block the move, over worries about \"more contagious variants emerging around the world,\" Biden's incoming press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.\n While new cases in the US are trending downwards since hitting a peak last week, experts are urging Americans not to let their guard down.\n The country, which surpassed 24 million cases on Monday, has averaged about 207,000 new cases daily in the past seven days -- with California becoming the first state to top 3 million cases. Meanwhile, health officials in the badly-hit state have told medical providers not to administer doses from one lot of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine -- which contains more than 330,000 doses -- while they investigate possible severe allergic reactions last week.\n The controversy over tennis' Australian Open, which has seen 72 players placed under strict hotel quarantine, has raised questions about whether large-scale international sporting events can take place in the middle of a pandemic and could offer a preview of the difficulties facing this summer's Tokyo Olympics, Helen Regan, Paul Devitt and Angus Watson report.\n Biden and his administration vow to ensure Black and brown people get equal access to the Covid-19 vaccine through mobile clinics, vaccination centers and partnerships with local communities.China and the World Health Organization could have acted quicker and more forcefully to contain the start of the coronavirus outbreak, an independent review panel said on Monday. Singapore Airlines is hoping to become the world's first airline to get all of its crew members vaccinated.If Kim Jong Un destroyed North Korea's economy to keep Covid-19 out, will sanctions ever be enough to stop him pursuing nuclear weapons?\n Those already exhausted by 2021 -- and well, all of 2020 -- can get some relief by calling a hotline and screaming down the line. Just Scream!, a hotline created by elementary school teacher Chris Gollmar, aims to reduce tension for those needing an outlet. All you have to do is call up and scream as loud as you want, for as long as you want -- and then hang up.\n \"For the vast majority of Americans, the testing program they are being sold ... is simply an illusion of public health.\" --  Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of Epidemiology at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",

        "body_text": "Tiffany Trump, the youngest daughter of President Donald Trump, announced her engagement to Michael Boulos Tuesday. Her happy news -- which happened at the White House -- comes on her father's final full day in office.\n \"It has been an honor to celebrate many milestones, historic occasions and create memories with my family here at the White House, none more special than my engagement to my amazing fianc\u00e9 Michael! Feeling blessed and excited for the next chapter!\" Trump posted on Instagram, with an image of herself and Boulos standing on the White House colonnade, a ring on Trump's finger.\n Boulos, described by Town & Country as a \"scion from a wealthy family overseas\" and by Vanity Fair as a \"billionaire heir,\" posted the same image, writing, \"Got engaged to the love of my life! Looking forward to our next chapter together.\"\n Trump, the only child of the President and his second wife, Marla Maples, was primarily raised by Maples in California. She graduated from Georgetown Law School in May 2020, and though she's largely kept a low profile over the last four years compared to her older siblings, she stepped into the political spotlight over the summer when she spoke at the Republican National Convention.\n \"Our generation is unified in facing the future in uncertain times -- and many of us are considering what kind of country we want to live in. As a recent graduate, I can relate to so many of you who might be looking for a job. My father built a thriving economy once, and believe me, he will do it again,\" she said at the time, urging Americans to vote \"based on results and not rhetoric.\"\n Trump also made multiple stops as a campaign surrogate in the weeks before the election.\n Trump, 27, and Boulos, 23, have been spotted together at multiple events with the first family, from holidays at Mar-a-Lago to the State of the Union address.\n The couple's plans after the Trump presidency were not immediately clear.",

        "title": "Aldi, Trader Joe's and others will pay workers to get a vaccine",
        "body_text": "A growing number of large US chains are offering their workers incentives to get Covid-19 vaccines.\n Grocery chain Aldi said Tuesday that it will provide its hourly workers with two hours of pay for each vaccine dose they receive, giving workers up to four hours total of paid time off. Aldi also said it will \"cover costs associated with vaccine administration\" for employees who want to get vaccinated.\n Aldi is \"ensuring that all hourly workers who wish to receive the vaccine are able to do so without concern about losing pay or taking time away from work,\" the company said in a news release.\n Aldi joins Dollar General, Trader Joe's and Instacart as major US companies that have made similar moves.\n Dollar General (DG) said last week that it will give its workers a one-time payment equivalent to four hours of pay after receiving a completed vaccination. Trader Joe's will give workers \"an additional 2 hours of regular pay per dose for taking the time to get vaccinated,\" Kenya Friend-Daniel, a spokesperson for the company, said in an email.\n Instacart, the on-demand grocery delivery platform, also said last week that it will provide some financial assistance for its in-store workers and independent contractors.\n Beginning February 1, Instacart will have a \"vaccine support stipend\" of $25 available for in-store employees and its independent contractors who have been vaccinated. To be eligible, its independent shoppers must have shopped and delivered at least five batches for the company in the past 30 days.\n The companies' policies come as the vaccine rollout is off to a slow start in the United States. More than 31 million vaccine doses have so far been distributed, according to the latest CDC data, and more than 10 million people have received their first dose. Federal officials had said 20 million people would have received first doses by the end of December.\n Most states are still only vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, Kaiser said last week. Essential workers, such as retail and grocery store workers, are set to be vaccinated in later phases of the rollout, but their eligibility to receive the vaccine varies by states.\n Aldi, Trader Joe's, Instacart and Dollar General are all stopping short of mandating vaccinations for their employees.\n Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said mandates don't make sense right now because of supply constraints. They would also be \"too provocative at this point\" and provoke backlash among anti-vaccine groups.\n \"Right now, encouraging employees to get vaccinated and creating that leave policy for that purpose is a great idea,\" he said, adding that mandates could be revisited once more people have been vaccinated and more doses are available.\n Seventy-two percent of current and recent CEOs of major companies signaled an openness to vaccine mandates, according to a poll held last month at a virtual summit by the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The broad question did not specify whether the mandate would apply to all employees or just ones who needed to work in close proximity to customers and colleagues.\n \u2014CNN Business' Matt Egan and Sara O'Brien contributed to this article.",

        "title": "12 Army National Guard members removed from inauguration duty",
        "body_text": "Twelve Army National Guard members have been removed from inauguration duty in Washington, DC, as part of the security vetting process initiated, in part, to ensure troops tasked with securing Wednesday's ceremony in the nation's capital do not have ties to extremist groups, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau said Tuesday.\n Two of the individuals were flagged due to \"inappropriate\" comments and texts, Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson told reporters after a defense official told CNN earlier Tuesday that they were removed over possible links to extremists.\n The other 10 Guard members were removed for questionable behavior found in the vetting process, Hokanson said, emphasizing that this does not necessarily mean they have ties to extremists, but simply that they were \"identified\" and removed from service \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n \"I'm not concerned as a large part of our organization, if you look at 25,000, we've had 12 identified and some of those they are just looking into, it may be unrelated to this, but we want to make sure out of an abundance of caution as I stated earlier that we do the right thing until that gets cleared up,\" he told reporters.\n The news comes as there are now approximately 25,000 National Guard troops on the ground in Washington, DC, according to spokesman Major Aaron Thacker.\n The nation's capital is on edge ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. While much of Washington has been shut down following the deadly riot at the US Capitol on January 6, defense officials have sought to reassure the public that the troops sent to protect the inauguration are being fully vetted.\n Pentagon spokesman Jonathon Hoffman reiterated that the vetting process is in place. \"What the partner organizations have found, but much of the information is, as the general mentioned, unrelated to the events taking place at the Capitol or to concerns that many people on extremism. These are vetting efforts that identify any questionable behavior in the past, or any potential link to questionable behavior, not just related to extremism,\" he said.\n Earlier Tuesday, a defense official confirmed to CNN that two Army National Guard members were removed from inauguration duty as part of the security vetting process.\n When asked to comment on the decision, the National Guard responded: \"Due to operational security, we do not discuss the process nor the outcome of the vetting process for military members supporting the inauguration,\" and referred future questions to the Secret Service.\n The Associated Press was the first to report the two guards had been removed.\n Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller said Monday that there is \"no intelligence indicating an insider threat\" to the inauguration.\n Miller's statement came hours after the head of the DC National Guard said that the FBI is vetting troops involved in securing the US Capitol to prevent any insider threats.\n \"As is normal for military support to large security events, the Department will vet National Guardsmen who are in Washington, DC. While we have no intelligence indicating an insider threat, we are leaving no stone unturned in securing the capital,\" Miller wrote. \"This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events.  However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique.\"\n Miller also thanked the FBI for its assistance in vetting members of the National Guard.\n Efforts to find and eliminate extremism within the military's ranks, particularly among those who espouse White supremacist beliefs, began long before this month's riot at the Capitol but have taken on increased urgency in the days since.\n The enhanced screening measures come as tens of thousands of National Guard members are patrolling the streets of the nation's capital ahead of Inauguration Day.\n The 25,000 National Guard members currently in the nation's capital is the maximum number authorized by the Pentagon for security around the inauguration.\n The numbers have been growing over the past several days as troops have arrived from other parts of the country.\n \"What happens is they're screened before they leave their state and what it is is a credentialing process so they're screened and they're repeatedly screened until they are actually put on the street,\" Major Gen. William Walker told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Monday.\n Walker did not say that the screening included specific questions about the members' beliefs surrounding the legitimacy of the election, but they are carrying out enhanced background screening.\n \"No, it's all about the background. So, a regular background check is enhanced with more screening, more details and it's layered so the FBI is part of it, the Secret Service is part of it and once they are certain that there's no insider threat then that soldier, guardsman or airman is given a credential,\" he said.\n Walker stressed that members of National Guard are screened upon their entry to the service and this is adding another layer.\n The DC National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in the nation's capital that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command, an Army spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN last week.\n \"There is no place for extremism in the military and we will investigate each report individually and take appropriate action,\" the statement said.\n \"The Army is committed to working closely with the FBI as they identify people who participated in the violent attack on the Capitol to determine if the individuals have any connection to the Army,\" the statement added, noting any type of activity that \"involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace,\" may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state and federal law.\n Current Defense Department policy requires all service members be trained annually under a program that requires department personnel to report \"any information regarding known or suspected extremist behavior that could be a threat to the department or the United States,\" the statement said.\n \"We don't know the size and scale of the problem,\" Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told CNN on Monday. \"We are working with federal law enforcement to vet our people, obviously ones in particular supporting this operation. But you would do that in most cases.\"\n \"We're taking the extremist threats very seriously. And we're vetting all of our soldiers. We're going to continue to look at the entire army as a whole and how we can ensure that these threats are not in our formation. And if they are, we'll find them and we'll get rid of them,\" he added.\n This story has been updated with additional comments from a Pentagon press conference and additional background.",

        "title": "Biden's favorability on the rise as majority of Americans think he's handling transition well",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden will take office Wednesday with high expectations and largely positive reviews of how he has handled the transition, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. But those rosy assessments of Biden come as negative perceptions of how things are going in the United States are at the highest level since 2009.\n Biden will take office with a store of goodwill in his corner: Two-thirds of Americans approve (66%) of the way Biden is handling the presidential transition, and his favorability rating has climbed 7 points compared with a pre-election poll in October (59% view him favorably now, compared to 52% then).\n The public is less positive about the way the rest of elected Washington is handling the transition. Most disapprove of President Donald Trump's combative handling of the time since the election (70% disapprove), and his fellow Republicans in Congress earn similarly negative reviews (66% disapprove). About half (51%) approve of the way Democrats in Congress have handled it.\n Once Biden is sworn in and the results of Georgia's Senate runoffs are certified, the Democrats will control the presidency, the House and the Senate. Most Americans say single-party control will be good for the country (53%), more than those that said the same about Republican control of the presidency and Congress following the 2016 election (49%), but fewer than those that felt that way about Democratic control after 2008 (59%).\n Most say it is likely that Biden will achieve several key goals, including signing into law another coronavirus stimulus bill (83% say that is very or somewhat likely), restoring relations with US allies (74%), ensuring that 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine are administered by the 100-day mark of his presidency (70%) and establishing a government-run health insurance option that anyone could purchase (64%).\n But there is skepticism that he will be able to ease political divisions in the country (53% say that is unlikely). And the Republicans to whom Biden would need to appeal to in order to succeed are the most likely to say it will not work (88% unlikely).\n The poll shows that views of Biden himself start out sharply polarized, with as large a partisan gap in expectations for his presidency as Trump faced at the start of his term in 2017, and drastically larger than the partisan divide in expectations for Barack Obama before he took office.\n Overall, 61% of adults expect Biden to do a very good or fairly good job as president, more than said so about Trump in 2017 (48%), but well below the share who expected good things from Obama before he took office (79%).\n Nearly all Democrats expect Biden to do well as president, 96%, the same as said so about Obama. But among Republicans, the share expecting Biden to do a good job as president is 40 points lower than the share who said the same about Obama (57% of Republicans said Obama would do a good job, while 17% say Biden will).\n That 79-point chasm between Democrats and Republicans on Biden is identical to the gap between Republicans and Democrats in January 2017 over whether Trump would do a good job as president (93% of Republicans said he would do a good job vs. 14% of Democrats).\n Favorability ratings for the incoming vice president, Kamala Harris, are higher than they have been at any point in CNN's polling on her. Overall, 51% have a favorable opinion, 39% an unfavorable one. Opinions on Harris are also split by party, with 90% of Democrats saying they have a favorable view of her vs. 9% of Republicans.\n Jill Biden's favorability rating is largely positive and about as high as her husband's (58% have a favorable opinion of the soon-to-be first lady) with 28% expressing a negative view of her.\n As was true during last year's presidential campaign, Democrats and Republicans are living in completely different worlds when asked what the biggest problems are in the country today.\n Overall, 46% say the coronavirus outbreak is the largest problem, with 21% choosing political divisions, 15% the economy, 10% racial injustice and 7% national security. Among Democrats, 65% say the coronavirus is the most important problem, with racial injustice second at 16%. Among Republicans, though, 32% choose political divisions, 30% the economy, 25% coronavirus and less than 1% say it is racial injustice.\n Majorities across parties, though, say things in America today are going poorly: 77% say so overall, including 91% of Democrats, 77% of independents and 61% of Republicans. That's the largest share saying things are going poorly in CNN polling since April 2009.\n Republicans' views on the state of the country have worsened significantly since October (from 77% saying things were going well then to 37% now). That is typical of a party losing the presidency, but it is a steeper dropoff than among Democrats after their 2016 election loss (from 85% saying things were going well before the election to 61% ahead of Trump's inauguration).\n And perceptions of the economy are worse than they were at the start of Trump's term: 43% say it is in good shape today compared with 57% in January 2017.\n About 6 in 10 overall (61%) say they think the country will be better off in four years than it is today, more than said so in January 2017 (47%). But that too is divided by party. Among Democrats, 95% say the country will be better off in four years, while 73% of Republicans say it will be worse.\n The methodology and weighting for the poll has been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cell phones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for partisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls.\n The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

        "body_text": "We know a lot about dinosaurs -- what they looked like, what they ate and what killed them off -- but no fossils have definitively preserved two dinosaurs in the act of mating.\n However, a fossil from China of a Psittacosaurus is so well preserved that the opening the Labrador-size dinosaur used to pee, poop and reproduce is visible, allowing paleontologists to study it for the first time.\n While it doesn't offer any concrete answers on how dinosaurs may have procreated, it does give some hints.\n \"We don't have any dinosaur fossils where you can be confident they've been caught in the act,\" said Jakob Vinther, a paleontologist and senior lecturer at the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences.\n What we know is \"based on natural history where we compare it to living groups of animals.\"\n While most mammals have separate holes for bodily functions, many other animals -- including birds and reptiles -- have just one and it's known as the cloaca.\n The fossilized cloaca confirms that dinosaurs had one but it doesn't look like that of any other living animals.\n \"It is very unique. Most cloacas form a kind of slit. Sometimes it's a vertical split, sometimes it's a smiley face, sometimes it's a sour face. This thing has a V-shaped structure with a pair of nice flaring lips and there's not a living groups of animals that have morphology like that,\" Vinther said. \"It is somewhat similar to crocodiles but still unique.\"\n The study, which published in the journal Current Biology on Tuesday, said that large, pigmented lobes on either side of the opening could have harbored musky scent glands, as seen in living crocodiles and alligators.\n What's more, the outer margins of the cloaca are highly pigmented with melanin. While they don't know for sure what color it was, it likely would have contrasted with the dinosaur's pale underbelly, Vinther said.\n The fossil is displayed at the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History in Frankfurt, Germany, but was found in a fossil-rich area of Liaoning in northern China.\n Vinther had worked on the fossil before in 2016, reconstructing the dinosaur's color patterns, and it was only at the end of that study that he realized that the cloaca was really well preserved, he said.\n In animals with cloacal vents, the genitals are tucked inside the body and haven't been preserved so it's not known whether this particular dinosaur was male or female.\n Most birds, the only living relative of dinosaurs, mate by \"cloacal kissing\" -- by pressing together their openings. Some paleontologists think dinosaurs may have mated like this.\n Vinther, however, believes that this dinosaur would have had a penis -- the fossilized opening is more similar to a crocodile's, which do, and there are some birds, like ostriches and ducks, which also have penises.\n \"From what we can see, this cloaca would not have been suitable for cloacal kissing,\" Vinther said. \"It looks like it would have been penetrative sex.\"",

        "body_text": "Dangerous winds are sweeping over parts of California, and that means a greater wildfire risk and the possibility of power losses for hundreds of thousands of residents.\n (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n In Washington, DC, and states around the country, authorities are boosting security before tomorrow's presidential inauguration. The head of the DC National Guard even said the FBI is vetting troops involved in securing the US Capitol to prevent any insider threats. However, there is no intelligence indicating such a threat is afoot, the acting defense secretary said. Smaller protests broke out in some state capitol cities over the weekend, including crowds of armed demonstrators who gathered yesterday in Richmond, Virginia. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris officially resigned her Senate post in anticipation of her new role, and Melania Trump will break with tradition by not inviting her successor, Jill Biden, to tour the White House living quarters.\n President Trump is expected to issue around 100 pardons and commutations today, his last full day in office. The list of clemency actions reportedly includes white-collar criminals and high-profile rappers but so far not Trump himself or members of his family (there's been talk of Trump pardoning himself in the wake of the Capitol riots). The President also wanted to declassify information related to the Russia probe before he leaves office, but with the hours ticking down, it's not clear if that will get done. Even after he leaves office, Trump has at least one thorny battle waiting for him: his impeachment trial, which will likely start in the Senate soon. Speaking of the Senate, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell are hammering out a plan for how the evenly split Senate will be run. Democrats will make the schedule, and each party will likely hold an even number of committee seats.\n China and the World Health Organization could have acted quicker and more forcefully to contain the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. That's the conclusion from the Switzerland-based Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. The panel also said the world needs a \"global reset\" on how it deals with such situations. In the US, there's bad news and, well, slightly less bad news. More than 60% of all Covid-19 cases nationwide have been reported since Election Day, leading to nightmare-level infection rates. However, cases have declined 11% since hitting a peak last week. Experts say it's too soon for optimism, since such a dip may not be sustainable. Also in China, a dangerous situation is unfolding as state media have launched disinformation campaigns to hit back against questions about the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccine produced by Chinese medical company Sinovac.\n Alexey Navalny has been ordered to stay in custody for 30 days after returning to Russia this weekend. The Kremlin critic was immediately detained after flying to Moscow from Germany, then subjected yesterday to a surprise hearing. Navalny was placed on the country's federal wanted list last month for violating terms of probation related to a 2014 conviction for fraud, which he dismisses as politically motivated. It's only been five months since Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Several Western officials and Navalny himself openly blamed the Kremlin for the act. Following his hearing yesterday, Navalny urged his followers to \"not be silent\" and take to the streets. A nationwide demonstration is being organized to demand his release.\n Most of Uganda is back online after a five-day internet outage that critics are calling a \"textbook case of pre-meditated, pre-election internet blackout.\" Ugandans recently held their presidential election, and internet connectivity was restored after incumbent President Yoweri Museveni was declared the winner for a record sixth term. His opponent, Bobi Wine, a singer-turned-politician whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has protested the results and says he has evidence of fraud and intimidation. Wine has been under house arrest after military surrounded his home on Friday, he said. Heavily armed military and police raided his party offices in Kampala yesterday. Museveni's house arrest of Wine and blocking of the internet have been met with international condemnation.\n Terrible news for the recent fried chicken sandwich wars.\n The Trip of the Magi.\n He said he was scared to go home because of Covid-19, but frankly, he ended up doing the scaring.\n And they say the perfect job doesn't exist!\n \"Hello, yes, I'd just like to ... AAAAAAAaAAAAAaaaGGGHHHHHH.\"\n That's the depth of the deficit at which the National Rifle Association operated in 2019. The NRA filed for bankruptcy over the weekend, following leadership shake-ups and allegations of financial mismanagement in recent years.\n \"My father always believed in the people of our nation. Certainly, he would be greatly disappointed in how we have chosen to conduct ourselves at this particular moment.\"\n It seems like it will be a stressful week.

        "body_text": "The investment, announced Tuesday, puts Cruise's total value at $30 billion, Cruise and Microsoft said.\n Microsoft (MSFT) joins Honda (HMC), already a major investor and partner in Cruise, and various institutional investors in the $2 billion total equity investment. The companies did not divulge how large of a portion of that investment Microsoft is making or how large of a stake in Cruise Microsoft will receive as a result of its investment. However, a Cruise spokesperson confirmed that General Motors will retain a majority stake.\n Microsoft joins other tech companies that have ventured into self-driving vehicles. Apple has reportedly restarted plans to create it's own electric self-driving car. Waymo, a leading competitor to Cruise, is a subsidiary of Google's parent company Alphabet.\n Cruise was founded in 2013 and acquired by GM in 2016 for an undisclosed amount. The company's current president, Dan Ammann, had been president of GM until joining Cruise in 2018.\n GM executives said in 2017 that they expected driverless taxi services to one day be a bigger and more profitable business than selling vehicles directly to customers. At the time, though, they also expected Cruise to be ready to serve paying customers by the end of 2019.\n Honda first teamed up with GM on Cruise in 2018, announcing then that it would invest $2 billion over 12 years. Honda's participation in this latest round of investment is in addition to that, a Cruise spokesman said,\n Honda worked with GM to develop a purpose-built self-driving car, called the Origin, for things like taxi and delivery services. It has no steering wheels or pedals, and is designed to function entirely without a driver. GM announced last fall that it will be built at GM's Factory Zero, formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly, a factory in Michigan that is being modified to build only electric vehicles.\n Cruise will need an exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to operate the Origin because it doesn't have traditional car components like a steering wheel.\n The company has been using modified Chevrolet Bolt EVs to test its technology and has recently begun testing cars in San Francisco with no human driver inside the vehicle. Previously, the cars had always had a human driver in the driver's seat to take over if needed.\n The company hasn't lived up to its projections so far. In 2017, GM said it would be mass-producing fully autonomous electric cars by the end of 2019. It also announced plans in 2017 to test self-driving vehicles in New York City, but has yet to do so.\n The entire self-driving sector has struggled to live up to the hype that has dominated much of the decade. Companies are realizing the immense challenge of building a self-driving car that works, and then proving to regulators that it is safe.\n Matt McFarland contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Donald Trump *did* set at least 1 record as president",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump has always been fixated on writing his name into the history books, to ensure his four years as president aren't forgotten. Well, he's done it!\n Trump ends his term with the lowest average job approval rating -- 41% -- of any president in the last seven-plus decades, according to Gallup. That's four points worse than the next, uh, worst -- Harry Truman, who averaged a 45% job approval score throughout his time in office. Barack Obama averaged 47.9% job approval in his eight years, while George W. Bush averaged 49.4.\n There are other \"firsts\" for Trump in the Gallup data. Trump is the first president to never break 50% job approval in any single poll conducted by the organization over his term. (The final Gallup poll pegged Trump's job approval at a dismal 34%.) Trump is also the most polarizing president as measured by Gallup; the average gap between his job approval ratings among Republicans and Democrats was a whopping 81 points -- 11 points higher than Obama's partisan gap, which is now the second-highest ever. (Trump's average job approval rating among Democrats for his term was 7%.)\n \"Trump leaves office as the least-positively evaluated president in the Gallup polling era, based on the average of his approval ratings,\" concludes Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones. \"He also just received his personal low approval rating, thanks largely to a sharp decline in public support during a lame-duck period marked by controversy, which could overshadow his accomplishments.\"\n And these findings tend to presage bad news for presidential legacies. As Jones writes of Trump's 34% approval rating in the last Gallup poll of his presidency: \"The significance of Trump's final rating could be more important than his average, as the former is the one that is often most predictive of how presidents are regarded historically.\"\n As I noted last week, early indicators about where Trump's presidency will land on the best/worst scale suggest that he will be at or near the bottom. One prominent survey of political historians placed Trump dead last among the 44 presidents; the other had him third from last, behind only Andrew Johnson and James Buchanan.\n This will all bother Trump. Hugely.\n He has long been obsessed with where he will stand among his fellow presidents, often offering up his own rankings  -- in which he, unsurprisingly, fares quite well. \"It is much easier to act presidential than what we are doing here tonight, believe me,\" Trump told a crowd in 2017. \"With the exception of the late, great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president that's ever held this office.\"\n He has also, uh, joked about being added to Mount Rushmore one day. \"Every single president on Mt. Rushmore -- I'd ask whether or not you think I will someday be on Mt. Rushmore,\" Trump said in 2017. \"But here's the problem: If I did it, joking, totally joking, the fake news media would say he believes he should be on Mt. Rushmore. So I won't say it.\"\n (Narrator voice: He did say it.)\n One thing is for sure: Trump has now written himself into the history books. But not at all the way he wanted to.",

        "title": "Biden to implement new ethics rules banning 'golden parachute' bonuses for appointees    ",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden plans to impose a slew of new ethics restrictions on his incoming administration, a source familiar with the plan tells CNN, including barring his appointees from accepting \"golden parachute\" bonuses from their former employers when they join the government.\n The new ethics rules are also expected to attempt to slow the revolving door between the government and the lobbying world by barring employees who leave the Biden administration from lobbying the administration for the length of Biden's term in office.\n The ethics rules, which were first reported by The Washington Post, are expected to be embodied in an executive order in the early days of Biden's presidency, also would bar departing executive branch from assisting lobbyists for one year after they leave the administration. The new one-year prohibition on \"shadow\" lobbying clamps down on the practice of well-connected former officials cashing in on their government expertise by joining firms where they help lobbyists and lobbying firm clients navigate Washington without formally registering as lobbyists.\n Democrats, after four years under President Donald Trump where questionable ethical moves were commonplace, have long called for more stringent ethics rules for the incoming Biden administration and these new guidelines, some of which are stricter than rules during the Obama administration, look to assuage those desires.\n The ban on incoming government officials receiving payments from their former employers is the most significant shift in the new guidelines. Banning employers from making substantial payments to incoming government officials became a topic during the presidential campaign, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren often decrying the practice.\n The new rules would limit the influence of officials on the way out of government work, too, by keeping the Obama-era pledge to ban people leaving their jobs from quickly lobbying the government they just left. Biden also plans to implement new rules aimed at curbing contact former officials have with both their old agencies and senior White House staff, as well as former officials registering as foreign agents so they can lobby on behalf of foreign entities.\n The plan will also ask government officials to adhere to certain ethical commitments, such as making decisions entirely with the public interest in mind and making choices after their government work that do not create even the appearance of using their service for gain.\n \"If the plan is as currently being reported, this policy goes further than we have ever seen in a presidential ethics plan,\" Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen, said in a statement. \"It will crackdown on shadow lobbying jobs, end golden parachutes intended to seat corporate insiders in government, and halt the rapidly spinning revolving door.\"\n \"Boldness is needed in this moment to restore the people's faith in government and this policy takes a critical step in the right direction,\" she added.\n Details of Biden's ethics plan emerged as Senate Democrats, who are poised to soon take the majority in the chamber, announced that their first legislative effort will be a sweeping measure to overhaul government ethics, campaign finance and voting laws.\n The legislation, dubbed \"For the People Act,\" aims to make it easier to vote by requiring, among other changes, same-day voter registration and 15 days of early voting in federal elections. It also seeks more disclosure on political spending, establishes public matching funds for Senate and presidential candidates and would impose new congressional and executive branch ethics requirements, including requiring presidents to divest assets that pose potential conflicts of interest within 30 days of taking office or disclose more information about their business interests.\n Gilbert said the twin proposals emerging Tuesday from the incoming Biden administration and Senate Democrats means \"it's a good day for government integrity.\"\n In addition to the forthcoming ethics executive order, the Biden administration also plans to restore a practice instituted during the Obama administration and publicly release information about visitors to the White House, incoming press secretary Jen Psaki recently announced.\n In the early months of Trump's tenure, his administration cut off the practice of publicly releasing the logs of visitors to the White House complex, citing national security and privacy concerns.\n Norm Eisen, who served as White House ethics czar during the first term of the Obama administration, called Biden's soon-to-be-released rules \"the most ambitious ethics plan we've seen from an administration of either party.\"\n \"It's a very impressive start,\" he told CNN. \"Now, all of us watchdogs will be monitoring for compliance. But there's every indication they will stick with it.\"",

        "title": "Chris Gethard's highly addictive 'Beautiful/Anonymous' podcast hits 250 episodes",
        "body_text": "Comedian Chris Gethard started a podcast a few years ago with the simple premise he would tweet out a phone number, answer a random call, and have an hour-long conversation with the individual on the the other end of the line.\n Since those conversations first started in 2016, Gethard has talked to a woman who discovered her friend murdered someone, a caller whose husband cheated for years with her best friend, a puppet master, a woman in a harem, a person who spends their spare time dressed as a pirate, a man obsessed with Groundhog Day, and a guy with a laugh like a clown horn.\n These are just a few of the amazing life stories you hear on \"Beautiful/Anonymous,\" which celebrates its 250th episode on Tuesday.\n \"I'm just really proud of the [show's] spectrum because I think even the darkest [episodes], you always see at least a handful of comments from people who have been through something similar,\" Gethard told CNN in a recent interview. \"I think even the darkest ones provide a little bit of people feeling less alone and less isolated, like there's a bigger world out there that they get to hear a little bit about.\"\n Though at first Gethard did not screen his callers, he eventually realized he needed help to ensure subject matter variety and improve audio connections.\n \"While it led to a lot of episodes that kind of went in a lot of surprising directions, what we found was it also led to a lot of situations where people would be calling with like horrific phone connections or I'd be sitting there, like, 'are you standing in a hurricane?' Gethard laughed.\n But he does not overproduce the show, Gethard said, he just seeks to offer people a platform to discuss a broad spectrum of life experiences in their own words.\n \"If you listen to the first handful of episodes, that very much feels like [I'm] a therapist. And my own therapist actually stepped in and told me like, 'Hey, you're not trained to giving people advice, let alone, when there's like a hundred thousand people listening to it,\" Gethard recalled. \"That actually made me realize, okay, I don't need to try to solve a person's problem. That was an eye opening conversation. I might be a comedian by trade -- and I do think we managed to find at least a couple of laughs, even in the darkest episode -- but my priority can't be getting the joke out.\"\n What he will do, Gethard said, is step in if the person sounds nervous or has lost their train of thought.\n \"Let me step in here and make a joke so they can take a breath and feel more comfortable or need a second recover,\" he explained.\n \"I have this really unique job that I never expected where I have this perspective to remember that everybody and anybody I may meet on the street deserves some empathy, some attention and some assumption,\" Gethard said. \"That's the thing the show has given me, is it has trained me to just assume that the individuals that I come into contact with are layered interesting people with opinions and life experiences.\"",

        "title": "Google CEO to meet with Black college leaders following racism allegations",
        "body_text": "Leaders from some of the nation's top historically Black colleges and universities are meeting virtually with Google CEO Sundar Pichai next week to discuss the future of their schools' relationships with the tech giant in the wake of racism and sexism allegations made by two Black former employees.\n In December, ex-Google artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru and former Google diversity recruiter April Curley both tweeted that they had been fired by the company after raising concerns about the lack of Black people working there and how those who currently work there are treated.\n Google has declined to comment on Curley's workplace allegations. Both women's departures from the company sent shock waves through the tech world and caught the attention of HBCU administrators.\n \"We were not willing to stand by on this issue and let it go,\" Florida A&M University president Larry Robinson told CNN Business during a pair of recent phone interviews.\n \"When our students have the opportunity to go into the world of work and the world of work has an opportunity to work with our talented students, it's important they are provided an environment that is appreciative and respects who they are, their talent,\" he continued. \"It's not going to be sustainable otherwise.\"\n \"We obviously have a relationship with Google that we want to make sure is the right kind of relationship and the right environment,\" Frederick said.\n The virtual meeting was arranged by Harry Williams, president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports a network of publicly funded HBCUs and other predominantly Black institutions. Williams said he invited Pichai to the meeting in a late-December email at the behest of several HBCU presidents.\n \"Whenever someone says something negative that could potentially impact HBCU students, I pay attention to it,\" Williams told CNN Business. \"Our presidents reached out and said, 'Let's do a deep dive here and get some intel directly from the company.'\"\n Williams said the goal of the meeting is to continue a positive dialogue and engagement between Google and the HBCU community.\n Google told CNN Business the work it's doing to recruit Black talent is critical.\n \"We are dedicated to hiring and retaining Black+ and other underrepresented talent at Google, and we're committed to strengthening our partnerships with HBCUs,\" a Google spokesperson said via email.\n The company began piloting its HBCU and Hispanic-Serving Institutions tech exchange program at Howard University in 2017 before opening it up to 11 total schools a year later. The initiative allows computer science majors from HBCUs and HSIs to spend a semester receiving coding instruction at Google's Mountain View, California, global headquarters.\n In the aftermath of the George Floyd tragedy last summer, Google committed to increasing Black representation at its senior levels and set a 2025 deadline to improve leadership representation of \"underrepresented groups\" by 30%. Only 3.7% of Google's US workforce is Black, up from just 2.4% in 2014, according to the company's 2020 diversity report, which notes that Google hired from 15 HBCUs and 39 HSIs in 2019.\n Robinson said Florida A&M University graduates about 60 tech field students every year. He himself is a former Lockheed Martin nuclear chemist who says the mythical dearth of Black American STEM talent is something he constantly heard about throughout his science career.\n \"The reason I came to FAMU is because I got so tired of hearing the statement that, 'We can't find them,'\" Robinson said. \"We are making a huge contribution to helping [Google] find capable, qualified talented young men and women who can do the job of computer science, computer engineering.\"\n In October, Frederick wrote a CNN Business op-ed rebutting claims made by Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf, who apologized in September for drafting a memo to employees that said his company's struggles to recruit Black Americans were due to \"a very limited pool of Black talent.\"\n Frederick pointed out in his op-ed that HBCUs only represent 3% of America's higher-ed institutions yet produce nearly 20% of bachelor's degrees earned by African Americans and almost a quarter of all undergraduate STEM field degrees earned by Black Americans.\n \"There's no doubt our students are smart enough and talented enough,\" Frederick told CNN Business during a recent phone interview. \"The issue, I think, is more an issue of exposure.\"",

        "title": "Brazilian officials were warned six days in advance of a looming oxygen crisis in Manaus",
        "body_text": "Local and federal officials in Brazil were warned of looming oxygen shortages nearly a week before crisis struck in the city of Manaus, the country's Solicitor General has revealed.\n In a country already hard-hit by the coronavirus, oxygen shortages and soaring Covid-19 cases have pushed Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, into a healthcare crisis. Nurses in the city have been quoted in local news reports as saying patients have died of asphyxiation in the city's hospitals because there is no oxygen to give them.\n The Brazilian government has come under sharp criticism over its handling of the crisis. Last week, Supreme Court judge Ricardo Lewandowski ordered the government to present a response plan to solve the oxygen shortage, citing the Jair Bolsonaro administration's \"omissive behavior\" in addressing the emergency.\n On Sunday, Bolsonaro's Solicitor General Jos\u00e9 Levi do Amaral sent a 16-page report defending the government's response to the court. The report discloses that the federal health ministry knew about the crisis six days before the situation became critical on January 14.\n It also stresses that the local government in Amazonas did not inform federal authorities about the looming oxygen shortage. \"The Health Ministry...became aware on (January) 8th through an e-mail sent by the product manufacturer,\" the report states. The provider, named in the report as White Martins, first notified the Amazonas State government, and then federal authorities, the report says.\n It is not clear why notifying the federal government of oxygen shortages was allegedly left to a private contractor. According to the Solicitor General's report, the Manaus health department had been aware that the city's health system was on the verge of collapse since early January.\n Manaus City officials did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n An Amazonas' state government spokesperson told CNN they would provide \"clarifications\" to the Prosecutor General's office, and added that the state continues to work to mitigate the crisis, including, \"the transport of oxygen from other states to Manaus, the installation of mini oxygen in hospitals, the transfer of patients for assistance in other states and the requisition of all production from local oxygen suppliers.\"\n Brazil's General Prosecutor Augusto Aras has ordered the Health Ministry to open a probe into the collapse of Manaus' health system, in addition to a separate investigation examining potential negligence by state and city officials.\n But the Solicitor General's report raises questions about why the federal Health Ministry was not able to help prevent the collapse of Manaus' healthcare system, after it received advance notice. Officials from the Ministry traveled to Manaus in the beginning of January, and Pazuello personally visited the city from January 11 to January 13.\n Disaster struck the city's hospitals the next day. On January 14, Amazonas state officials announced that Manaus hospitals and emergency rooms faced crippling shortages of oxygen, amid soaring Covid-19 cases. \"We are facing a lot of difficulty in getting medical supplies. And as everyone is following, our main difficulty now has been getting oxygen,\" Governor Wilson Lima told reporters.\n Though the Brazilian air force responded by delivering emergency supplies of liquid and gaseous oxygen, shortages continue. Logistical problems have compounded the crisis, as Manaus' supplies mainly enter the city via the Amazon River. There is only highway out of the city, which connects it to the neighboring state of Amap\u00e1.\n Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello has defended his agency's response.  \"We took action immediately,\" he said at a press briefing in Brasilia on Monday. \"There was no indication of lack of oxygen from our meetings in early January. The rise of the cases was very fast,\"  he said.\n \"When we [visited Manaus] on [January] 4, the problem was not oxygen. The problem was bed structure, the number of Covid-19 patients, the queues,\" Pazuello also said.\n Bolsonaro's appointment of Pazuello, a former military commander, to lead the Health Ministry, have been heavily criticized by opponent as Brazil's Covid-19 death toll remains second highest in the world, behind only that of the United States.\n Bolsonaro himself rejected any responsibility for the city's lethal crisis. \"There is a problem in Manaus ... We mourn the deaths from asphyxiation, from lack of oxygen, and people blame the government. We have allocated billions to the states, but those responsible for the lack of medication are the state and municipal health secretaries,\" he told supporters on Monday.\n His statement followed Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o's claim last week that no one could have foreseen the city's health system collapse.\n \"You cannot predict what would happen with this (virus) strain that is occurring in Manaus. Totally different from what had happened in the first half,\" Mour\u00e3o said.",

        "title": "Hundreds of health care facilities were hit by ransomware last year amid pandemic ",
        "body_text": "At the University of Vermont Medical Center in October, a cyberattack knocked out 5,000 computers on the hospital's IT network, disrupting everything from its financial systems to its radiology services and sleep studies. Patient care ground to a halt -- and the outage lasted for weeks.\n \"We really did not anticipate the scope or the impact the attack had on our system and how far-reaching it was,\" the organization's president, Dr. Stephen Leffler, told reporters at a December news conference. Staff at the facility had been trained to handle outages of 3 to 5 days at most. What hit UVM Medical Center was far worse: \"Thirty days of downtime, going across all systems, was a true challenge for our staff -- it was a challenge for our patients.\"\n UVM Medical Center is one of many health care facilities \u2014 in the middle of a global pandemic, no less \u2014 to fall victim to ransomware, an increasingly common form of malicious software that criminals use to seize control of computers and often refuse to unlock until the victim pays a fee.\n In fact, health care providers were among the most popular targets for ransomware last year, according to new research by the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Emsisoft's review \u2014 which is based on public announcements, local media reports and information leaked by hackers on the web \u2014 provides the clearest picture yet of the growing threat ransomware poses to the country.\n The company's list shows that as many as 560 health care facilities, 1,681 schools and 113 government agencies at every conceivable level were held hostage by ransomware in the United States last year. The software encrypted computers and other devices so that they couldn't be used, and in many cases, the hackers would not only lock up the data, but would also steal it.\n The attackers didn't discriminate. They struck from coast to coast, targeting victims in California, Kentucky, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Virginia, along with many other states. Some like the University of California, San Francisco agreed to pay off their attackers, to the tune of more than $1 million, even as security experts pleaded with victims not to give in for fear of encouraging more attacks.\n The epidemic of ransomware couldn't have come at a worse time. Education and health care workers were already struggling to adapt to quarantines and lockdowns, as well as an explosion of Covid infections that threatened to break the nation's medical system. Both sectors had also increasingly turned to technology to provide remote learning and health care, in a move that some cybersecurity experts warned early on could lead to new risks and points of failure.\n As late as December, UVM Medical Center was still limping along at 70% capacity, restoring systems one by one. In a press conference posted to YouTube, Leffler said the true impact of the attack wouldn't be known for months \u2014 but that it had already cost the medical center $1.5 million a day in lost revenue alone.\n Asked for an update on the situation, UVM Medical Center spokesperson Annie Mackin told CNN Business Monday that the organization's network has \"largely recovered,\" though there is \"some work remaining to complete.\" No personally identifiable information or patient health data was lost in the attack, she added.\n In the case of victims who refuse to pay up, ransomware attackers have been known to release internal files they've stolen. These dumps, some of which were reviewed by both Emsisoft and CNN, have contained everything from arrest records to the financial details of city governments.\n Why publish these data troves? Often, they serve as leverage for cyber criminals to extract more money from helpless targets, said Brett Callow, an Emsisoft threat analyst.\n \"Like any legitimate business, attacking health and education sectors has proved to be profitable,\" he said. \"They may also be softer targets. In the case of health care, they have unusually large attack surfaces spanning various networks and medical devices.\"\n In a blog post, Emsisoft said the breaches don't just represent a momentary inconvenience. The loss of data could come back to haunt many institutions, governments and perhaps consumers for years.\n \"It is also entirely possible -- probable, even -- that data was sold to companies' competitors or passed to other governments,\" the company said. \"Today's incidents represent a risk to national security, election security, economic security and to individuals' privacy, health and safety. It is, therefore, critical that solutions are found.\"\n In July, the Department of Homeland Security, along with state officials, issued a warning urging leaders in the private sector to safeguard their systems. Create offline backups of critical files, they said, and ensure all systems remain patched and up to date. Don't allow staffers to click on what may be malicious links or attachments in emails. In September, DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a 16-page official guide to ransomware, reflecting the gravity of the threat.\n The following month, the Treasury Department took its boldest step yet against ransomware, warning that those who pay hacker ransoms and even those who help victims pay up -- such as lawyers, insurance companies or consultants -- could be held liable if the payments end up going to a country that is under US sanctions.\n But despite US officials' efforts over the course of the year to raise the alarm, incidents of ransomware continued to pile up, culminating in two attacks that grabbed national headlines: A breach affecting United Health Services, one of the nation's biggest hospital networks, and one against Tyler Technologies, a software vendor serving many state and local governments.\n The attacks came ahead of the presidential election, when some cybersecurity experts worried about the potential for ransomware to cause chaos and confusion around election results. One Georgia county acknowledged in October that its election infrastructure -- including a voting precinct map and a voter signature database -- had been temporarily disabled by ransomware.\n \"2020, without a doubt, was the worst year for every chief information officer, and it is absolutely driven by ransomware,\" said Kevin Mandia, the CEO of Mandiant, a top cybersecurity firm, at a recent event held by the Aspen Institute.\n As the year wound to a close, officials at UVM Medical Center expressed disbelief at the amount of damage a single attack could cause. It's an experience that an alarming number of institutions can now say they share.\n \"If you'd told me [that] more than a month later, we'd still have functions that weren't normal, I would have bet you that you'd be wrong,\" Leffler said at the press conference.\n Luckily, UVM Medical Center was never confronted with a monetary demand, so it never paid a ransom.\n \"Our IT staff did find a note, which did not request money, but included instructions to contact the criminals responsible for the attack,\" said Mackin. \"UVM Health Network leaders did not follow those instructions and instead contacted the FBI.\"",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs posts impressive earnings thanks to Wall Street's strength",
        "body_text": "Goldman Sachs, one of the largest investment banks on Wall Street, reported results for the fourth quarter that easily topped analysts' expectations Tuesday morning.\n It's yet another sign of the disconnect between the strength of the stock market and the struggles many average Americans face due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) fell slightly in early morning trading after the earnings report was released. But the stock is up nearly 15% in 2021 and is not far from its all-time high.\n Goldman Sachs reported quarterly revenue of $11.74 billion, up 18% from a year ago. The company posted net income of $4.5 billion, a 135% surge from the fourth quarter of 2019.\n The company reported record revenue from its investment banking unit, thanks to booming demand for initial public offerings and an increase in merger activity. Goldman Sachs also said it posted its best year for global markets revenue in a decade, largely due to strong trading volume for stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.\n Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO David Solomon said in a press release that \"it was a challenging year on many fronts\" and added that \"we hope this year brings much needed stability and a respite from the pandemic.\"\n Still, the rally on Wall Street may be a case of stocks going up too far too fast. Solomon recently told Axios in an interview that he was worried about \"some excess in the market.\"\n The latest numbers from Goldman Sachs follow strong earnings reports last week from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) as well as mixed results from Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C). Bank of America (BAC) also reported earnings that beat forecasts but revenue that missed estimates on Tuesday.\n \"It's a tale of two different cities,\" said Mark Doctoroff, global co-head of financial institution coverage for MUFG, in an interview with CNN Business about bank earnings. \"Corporate America is resilient and healthy but small businesses are hurting.\"\n Doctoroff noted that banks with more exposure to big businesses -- ones that advise on mergers and initial public offerings -- are doing well. But those with deeper ties to consumers and smaller local merchants have been hit harder by the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic slowdown.\n Still, Goldman Sachs is planning a bigger move into consumer finance. The company runs the online banking company Marcus by Goldman Sachs, which offers loans and savings accounts.\n Goldman Sachs said in its earnings release that revenue from its consumer and wealth management unit grew 15% last year to $6 billion. The business now accounts for nearly 15% of the firm's overall revenue.\n And Goldman Sachs is looking to bolster Marcus further. The company announced last week it was partnering with card issuing company Marqeta, which Goldman Sachs has a stake in, to begin offering digital checking accounts to Marcus customers later this year.\n Goldman Sachs also said last week that it is collaborating with MasterCard (MA) to issue General Motors (GM)-branded credit cards. The bank is already partnering with Apple (AAPL) on the iPhone maker's Apple Card.\n But Solomon, like many other business leaders recently, stressed that any rebound for consumer spending and the broader economy will largely depend on the success of Covid-19 vaccinations and plans for more government stimulus.\n \"Although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the U.S., U.K. and other nations, there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence, vaccine distribution and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risks,\" Solomon said on the earnings call.\n He added that \"progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally\" and urged political leaders around the world \"to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan.\"",

        "body_text": "The US casino group said in a statement Tuesday that it would not make a firm offer for Ladbrokes owner Entain, following \"careful consideration\" and \"limited recent engagement.\"\n MGM (MGM) made a \u00a38.1 billion ($11 billion) takeover proposal earlier this month, seeking to capitalize on a surge in online betting during the pandemic. But Entain said the offer \"significantly\" undervalued the company's shares and its prospects.\n Shares in Entain surged 25% after the MGM offer was disclosed, indicating that investors believed a higher offer was coming, either from MGM or another competitor. Following the announcement on Tuesday, Entain's stock plunged 15% in London. MGM's shares rose 2.6%.\n MGM, a major player in Las Vegas, said it remains committed to BetMGM, its existing joint venture with Entain. BetMGM, a sports betting and online gaming company, operates in more than a dozen US states.\n \"We remain committed to working with Entain to ensure its strong momentum continues as it expects to be operational in 20 states by the end of 2021,\" MGM CEO Bill Hornbuckle said in a statement.\n Entain echoed that sentiment in a regulatory filing while touting its credentials.\n \"Entain has a clear growth and sustainability strategy, backed by leading technology, that it is confident will deliver significant value for stakeholders,\" the company said.\n The British company's next steps will have to involve hunting for new leadership, with CEO Shay Segev stepping down later this year. The announcement that he would leave Entain to lead a sports streaming platform was made just days after the MGM bid was rejected.",

        "title": "How Trump will hand off the 'nuclear football' to Biden",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump will not be in attendance Wednesday to watch as his successor Joe Biden is sworn into office, but his absence will have little impact on what may be one of the most important moments of Inauguration Day, the handing off of the \"nuclear football.\"\n The \"football,\" which contains the equipment that Trump would use to authenticate his orders and launch a nuclear strike, is carried by a military aide who accompanies the President at all times -- up to the second he officially leaves office on January 20.\n Typically, the football would be handed off to another military aide standing on or nearby the inauguration viewing stand as Biden takes his oath of office.\n But on Wednesday, that exchange will happen a bit differently as Trump is currently expected to depart Washington, DC, for Florida before Biden's inauguration ceremony.\n The nuclear football will likely travel with him, experts say, meaning there will be at least two briefcases in different locations, presenting a unique challenge of ensuring the transfer of authority goes smoothly.\n While that process may play out slightly differently than it has in years past, there are safeguards in place to ensure a seamless transition of nuclear control from one president to the next, regardless of circumstance, according to Stephen Schwartz, a nonresident senior fellow at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\n Contrary to popular belief, the nuclear football does not contain a button or codes that can automatically launch a nuclear weapon but instead has the equipment and authorities that Trump would use to order a strike.\n \"There are at least three to four identical 'footballs': one follows the president, one follows the vice president, and one traditionally is set aside for the designated survivor at events like inaugurations and State of the Union addresses,\" according to Schwartz..\n \"On January 20, [the extra footballs] will be out of town somewhere with their designees, leaving just [Vice President Mike] Pence's briefcase unless the White House Military Office has prepared (or already has on hand) another backup for Biden,\" he told CNN.\n Additionally, the President is required to carry a plastic card known as the \"biscuit\" with them at all times. The biscuit contains alphanumeric codes that are used to positively identify the president, who maintains the sole, legal authority to authorize a nuclear launch.\n The reason is explicitly laid out in the Constitution, which gives Trump complete authority over the US nuclear arsenal up to the very second Biden is sworn in at noon on Wednesday.\n \"Under the 20th Amendment -- and absent any invocation of the 25th Amendment that would make Mike Pence the acting president -- Donald Trump is president through 11:59:59 am on January 20. Up to that point in time, he has the sole, legal authority to authorize the use of any or all of the US nuclear arsenal,\" Schwartz said.\n \"If an aide with the football accompanies Trump on Air Force One to Florida, that aide will remove himself or herself from Trump's presence at noon and return to Washington, DC, with the briefcase,\" he added.\n After that point, Trump will no longer have such authority and the nuclear codes he carries will automatically be deactivated, he added. Meanwhile, Biden will automatically inherit the power to launch a nuclear strike at exactly the same time.\n That means if Trump attempted to order a strike at 12:01 pm on Wednesday, the order would be considered illegal and military commanders tasked with carrying out the launch are obligated to refuse.\n The transition of that authority is ensured by the fact that the codes Trump would use to authenticate his identity as President will become invalid at that time. Meanwhile, Biden will likely receive his \"biscuit\" on Wednesday morning when he, and likely Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, are briefed on the process of initiating a nuclear strike.\n But their codes will not become active until noon on Wednesday.\n \"The easiest way to think about it is there is a seamless cutover as to which 'biscuit' is valid at noon Wednesday,\" according to Vipin Narang, a nuclear policy expert and professor at MIT. \"Biden's biscuit would not be valid at 11:59 am, and Trump's would not be valid at 12:01 pm.\"\n Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats in a letter that she spoke with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley to discuss Trump's access to the nuclear codes amid calls for the President to be removed from office after a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol.\n \"This morning, I spoke to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike,\" Pelosi wrote in a letter. \"The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy.\"\n After speaking with Milley, Pelosi told her caucus that she has gotten assurances there are safeguards in place in the event Trump wants to launch a nuclear weapon, according to multiple sources on a caucus call.\n Senior military officials say while the President has sole authority to launch nuclear weapons he cannot do it alone.\n If an adversary were to launch a missile at the US, the president would immediately be on a classified communication network, receiving minute-by-minute intelligence and recommendations on how to proceed.\n There are safeguards against illegal attack orders whether its nuclear or conventional. To be legal, orders must have a legitimate target, a clear military objective and use proportional forces.\n The general who recently commanded strategic weapons and is now number two at the Pentagon is adamant the military will not follow illegal orders from any president.\n \"If it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options, with a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. It's not that complicated,\" Gen. John Hyten, the former commander of US Strategic Command, said in 2017.\n If a president persists in pushing illegal orders, a military commander would have no option but to resign.\n CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to report.",

        "title": "America almost lost its democracy. Here's how its citizens can protect it",
        "body_text": "As we swear in a new President and look to a new era in Washington DC, a cloud of anger and fear hangs over America after pro-Trump insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol. President-elect Joe Biden has big plans and a serious mandate, but he will have to govern a divided nation, one that was nearly torn apart by a mob hellbent on destroying it. I talk to US Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut and CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen about what comes next for America's fragile democracy. But first, Rep. Himes writes this week's CNN op-ed. --SE Cupp\n On January 6, America almost lost its democracy. I was in the House chamber as officers piled furniture in front of doors and pointed their weapons at insurrectionists intent on tearing down humankind's most recognized temple to self-government.\n I've been thinking about a quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin, where he tells a group of citizens that the Constitutional Convention delegates have crafted a republic \"if you can keep it.\" He didn't say \"if we can keep it,\" referring to his fellow Founders in Independence Hall. He put the burden on the citizens in the street in 18th century Philadelphia: \"if you can keep it.\"\n Make no mistake. We elected officials have immense work to do. Americans have near record levels of distrust for their government, some so much that they would violently try to tear it down. Joe Biden, our President-elect, must address this bleak reality in everything he says and does. He must demand accountability for those who would seek to destroy us, even as he welcomes all those who long for a less divided nation.\n He and Congress must end the ideology-fueled gridlock that prevents progress on the problems that besiege Americans every day. For years, the federal government has been largely immobile on crumbling infrastructure, climate change, gun violence, systemic racism and receding economic opportunity. We must do something novel: listen, compromise and solve problems.\n We also need to change the way we talk about who we are and what we do. Most Republicans, by knowingly repeating lies and madcap conspiracy theories, nurtured the lethal Trump insurrection. Even today, many seemed more outraged at their loss of Twitter followers than at the violence that killed five Americans, threatened their lives and laid waste to their workplace.\n And while the Republican Party has gone to a uniquely dark place, Democrats have some soul searching to do as well. On Election Day, more than 74 million Americans looked at our candidate, a profoundly decent man of integrity, empathy and experience, and chose instead four more years of President Donald Trump.\n Many of us win elections by trashing the institution we desperately want to join. We campaign on draining the swamp, destroying the establishment, ending business-as-usual -- and then we're puzzled when we return home to rage and suspicion. Worse, and fatally, too many of us tell the American people that the opposition is not just wrong, but evil, immoral and a threat to the country.\n And let's be clear: There's a short fuse between Republican cries of election fraud and a police officer being beaten by an angry pro-Trump mob on the Capitol's steps.\n But back to Franklin's \"you.\" I'm convinced that whether or not we keep our democracy -- Franklin's republic -- is in fact up to you. Government of, by and for the people is not some happy gift of history. It is a challenge to each of us. It imposes obligations and duties, many of which are neither comfortable nor intuitive.\n As broken glass is swept from the floors of the Capitol, we must decide now whether we will be worthy citizens or passive consumers, repeatedly doping ourselves with posts and memes that scratch our itches and fire up our tribes. Do we grapple with the messiness of complicated reality, or do we close our minds to all but those facts that validate our beliefs?\n Today we live in radically different media -- and social media -- universes. We can't debate policy because we don't agree on basic facts. One difference between a citizen and a political dope addict is that a citizen is open to learning and seeing reality from different points of view, whereas an addict only feeds his political point of view with reinforcing sources of information.\n Ask yourself: Do you work every day to get ideas and information from responsible sources with which you disagree? Do you see inconvenient facts as opportunities to learn or as evidence of someone's ignorance or treason?\n A commitment to citizenship also requires a firm rejection of those ridiculous two words: \"both sides.\" That both sides \"do it,\" whatever \"it\" may be, is an anesthetizing balm for tribalists faced with uncomfortable evidence of wrongdoing. Yes, violent protest is always wrong. And yes, both the right and left have risible activists who accept or promote it. But to equate violence by a small group of antifa protesters in Portland with a presidentially-instigated insurrection in Washington D.C. is not just wrong, it's madness.\n A close cousin of the \"both sides\" opium poisoning our minds is whataboutism. Whataboutism holds no water as a moral defense when offered by toddlers battling for crayons. But it is now the go-to political get-out-of-jail-free card. For every clear breach of law or decency by Trump there is a bottomless inventory of transgressions by some Democrat to make everything right. Through some unholy alchemy, breaking a window in the Capitol is excused by a broken window in Portland.\n No party or individual has a monopoly on sin or virtue.  After the Civil War, the Democratic Party worked to reestablish murderous White supremacy in the South. There were no \"both sides.\" Meanwhile, last week, and over the last four years, the Republican Party supported and excused every anti-constitutional depredation of Trump, such as his desire to baselessly contest ballots that were lawfully cast and affirmed by the Electoral College, including on the very day of the insurrection. There were no \"both sides.\"\n That \"they do it, too\" is not a defense in kindergarten, in court or in the politics of a supposedly great democracy.\n Finally, there is no better way to be a participant in our experiment in self-government than to actually get involved in it. Even if you're not thrilled by the details of school budgets or suburban zoning, the act of working with others on those things is an education that money can't buy. I've noticed that it is much easier to work in the Congress with colleagues who were mayors or governors, people who actually had to run police forces, organize garbage collection and get real things done in their communities. They understand the need to listen to all points of view and to craft a compromise.\n Reflect on 5,000 years of recorded human history. I believe that the vast majority of humans who have ever lived would trade their stations to be a citizen of our democratic republic. It is a supremely valuable gift. If we do not actively burnish and cherish it, we will lose it.",

The S&P 500 (SPX) rose nearly 14.6%, and the Nasdaq (COMP) 40.4% during that time.\n Wall Street has largely shrugged off the pandemic and political turmoil, while near-zero interest rates, stimulus relief and vaccine rollouts continue to boost investor optimism.\n For those who missed out on the latest stock market boom, never fear. There are steps you can take to get into position well before the next market highs hit.\n Here's how to make sure you're not missing out the next time around, without taking on too much risk:\n Let's face it, the market is often unpredictable, but that doesn't mean you have to be.\n \"Investors can naturally shy away from putting money into markets that are near all-time highs, thinking they might be able to purchase the investment for a cheaper price once the market cools off,\" said Michaela McDonald, a certified financial planner at personal finance app Albert.\n McDonald suggests an investment method called dollar-cost averaging. That essentially means investing the same amount of money on a recurring basis, no matter what the market may be doing.\n \"This helps you focus on what you can control instead of the unpredictability of the market,\" said McDonald.\n A handful of individual stocks have led the charge over the past year, with the strong performances of the big five tech giants -- Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google owner Alphabet  (GOOGL)and Facebook (FB) -- leading the way for the S&P 500 index.\n Tesla, (TSLA) which debuted on the S&P 500 in December, is now also among the index's top performing stocks, surging roughly 27% since its first day.\n Promising vaccines and other developments in the fight against Covid-19 have also sent shares of some pharma companies, like Moderna (MRNA), and biotech companies, like Sorrento Therapeutic (SRNE), soaring.\n But jumping on the bandwagon of a stock that's already had a major run can be ill-advised.\n \"The last thing you want to do is purchase an investment that is trading at an all-time high and has little room to run,\" said Leyla Morgillo, a certified financial planner with Madison Financial Planning Group.\n When a market boom hits, emotions can run high. But it's not the time to give into your FOMO, or fear of missing out. Instead, use it as an opportunity to assess your financial goals, evaluate your risk tolerance and balance your portfolio investments.\n One way is by diversifying your investment portfolio in a way that gives you somewhat limited exposure to the stock market so you can benefit from market rallies, but you don't risk putting all your eggs in one basket.\n Those investments can include dividend-paying stocks, cash, bonds and real estate.\n \"It can be very easy to get caught up in the euphoria of a stock market boom and lose sight of reality or behave irrationally,\" she said. \"It is always wise to utilize stock market booms to trim investments that have appreciated significantly and use it as an opportunity to rebalance back to your target investment weightings.\"\n On a similar note, when stocks are up it can often lead to significant growth or winning trades. But experts warn you shouldn't let it go to your head.\n Behavioral finance shows that \"overconfidence bias\" in investing can result in poor investment decisions and attempts to time the market.\n \"You don't want to let the market highs influence you to take on more risk than you can afford,\" Morgillo said.\n Sometimes investors may not be so lucky, noticing a stock market boom once it's too late. But you can still prepare for the next inevitable rally that's to come.\n Milo Benningfield, a certified financial planner and founding principal of Benningfield Financial Advisors, recommends \"figuring out what your financial goals are, learning some investment basics and putting together an investment plan.\"\n And once you do, he says, write it down and stick with it.\n \"If you do that, you'll be way ahead of the game already.\"",

        "title": "The 5 big lessons I learned about Donald Trump over the last 5 years",
        "body_text": "The first major thing I wrote about Donald Trump was wrong.\n The date was June 17, 2015. The headline was \"Why no one should take Donald Trump seriously, in one very simple chart.\" And the argument was simple: Trump, who had officially entered the 2016 race the day before, was deeply unpopular among the Republican base, especially as considered against the rest of the GOP field. And therefore, had zero chance of being a factor in the race -- much less winning.\n Less than two months later, I was forced to admit I had it wrong. (The headline of that piece, published August 4, 2015 was \"Boy, was I wrong about Donald Trump. Here's why.\") Explaining what I had gotten wrong, I wrote:\n \"Why did I miss Trump's appeal so badly? Simply put: I had NEVER EVER seen a reversal in how people perceive a candidate who is as well known as Trump -- much less a reversal in such a short period of time. I based my conclusion that Trump would never be a relevant player in the Republican primary fight on the ideas that once people 1) know you and 2) don't like you, you can't change those twin realities much.\n \"That was 100 percent true. Until Donald Trump proved it (and me) wrong.\"\n Thus began my five-year odyssey of writing and thinking about Donald Trump -- first as a presidential candidate and then as the 45th president of the United States. Over the years, I learned a few things about who this man was -- and wasn't. Below are my reflections on this most radical president.\n Remember how Trump occasionally promised during the campaign that his rude, boorish behavior would change if and when he was elected president? \"I will be so presidential you will be so bored,\" he promised in April 2016.  \"You'll say, 'Can't he have a little more energy?'\"\n That was, of course, ridiculous. For all the talk in the early days of his presidency that a pivot to actually acting like a president was just around the corner or coming in the next speech, that was never, ever going to happen.\n Trump had been the braggadocious, well, jerk for his entire life. If anything, the 2016 election victory affirmed for him that acting the way he acted was his path to success. Why would he change his behavior after the single greatest success of his life?\n The truth is -- and always has been -- that there is no Trump but Trump. He only has one speed, one gear. He is not capable of any sort of major personality change -- nor was he ever interested in one.\n Trump's absolutely stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- contra polls, money, message and every other metric that had traditionally predicted winners and losers -- led to a lingering belief for much of his first few years in office that he was operating at a different (and higher) strategic level than the rest of the political world and, especially, the media.\n What became clear as his presidency wore on was that assuming Trump was operating from some intricate blueprint or strategic plan was totally and completely misguided. There was no grand plan. There was just Trump acting and, more often, reacting to the news of the day.\n Which, of course, Trump told us all -- way back in the opening pages of \"The Art of the Deal\":\n \"Most people are surprised by the way I work. I play it very loose. I don't carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. You can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.\"\n In the words of Maya Angelou: When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. There is no plan. There never was. It was just Trump coming to work and seeing \"what develops.\"\n To run for president, you have to have a very healthy ego. You have to believe that, among the 330 million Americans, you are uniquely qualified to represent them. Right?\n But most people, after being elected -- or, ideally, before that -- understand that the office of the president is less about you and your own personal interests and more about the American public and what's best for them. That never happened for Trump.\n At the start of his term, there were questions about whether this most unusual president would bend to the norms of the presidency or whether he would bend those norms to him. Turns out he didn't just bend the norms, he broke them. From his repeated assertions about \"my generals\" and \"my military\" to his frustrations that the Justice Department would not act as his personal police force and law firm, Trump repeatedly demonstrated that he saw the presidency as a vehicle to reward his friends and punish his enemies. Period.\n In the early days of his presidency, I grappled with the best way to understand Trump the person and the President. But then it came to me: He was simply a bully. Throughout his life, he had used his celebrity, his money and his power to get what he wanted from those with less born-in advantages. He had simply shoved his way where he wanted to go -- and never worried about who was left behind.\n The idea of Trump-as-bully was cemented for me in 2017 when, at a NATO summit in Brussels, Trump simply moved Dusko Markovi\u0107, the leader of Montenegro, out of his way as he moved to the front of a photo op. Trump almost certainly had zero idea who Markovi\u0107 was. He simply wanted to be in the center of the picture -- because he was president of the United States, yes, but also because he was Donald Trump. And so he shoved whoever he needed to aside to get there and never gave it a second thought.\n Unfortunately, when you give a natural bully a job as prominent and powerful as the presidency of the United States, bad things happen. Like Charlottesville. And January 6, 2021.\n Loyalty is a one-way street for Trump. He expects absolute fealty from those around him but shows little in return. And inevitably, he turns on everyone -- even those who sacrificed their careers (and personal reputations) for him.\n The list is massive. Here are a few select names: Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, Michael Cohen, Steve Bannon, John Kelly, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Bolton, Anthony Scaramucci, Jeff Sessions, Brian Kemp, Bill Barr, Kirstjen Nielsen, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, Tom Bossert.\n And while I often rolled my eyes at the seeming exaggeration in \"Never Trump\" critic Rick Wilson's assertion that \"everything Trump touches dies,\" there is truth in the sentiment.\n Many of the people who came closest to Trump have been destroyed (in terms of reputation) the most utterly. Giuliani has gone from America's Mayor to a wild conspiracy theorist. Christie transformed from a take-charge governor to a Trump lackey. Trump does appear to have a poisoning effect on reputations, and when he turns on you (and he always does), his only goal is to seek and destroy.",

        "body_text": "An Ohio police officer was shot dead Monday after a suspect, wanted for arson and vandalism at a Toledo cathedral, emerged from a standoff with police and started shooting, officials said.\n Officer Brandon Stalker, 24, was providing perimeter security during the standoff, Chief of Police George Kral said.\n \"Very sad day for the city of Toledo and specifically the Toledo Police Department,\" said Kral, who described Stalker as \"an amazing police officer.\"\n Stalker, who joined the department in July 2018, leaves behind a fiance and a \"very young child,\" Kral told reporters.\n The suspect  was also shot during an exchange of fire with police. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, a press release from the department said.\n The preliminary investigation found that multiple officers fired their weapons at the suspect, according to the release. They will all be placed on paid administrative leave in accordance with their collective bargaining agreements, the department said.\n Kral said officers from the Gang Task Force recognized a suspect who had vandalized the Rosary Cathedral earlier in the day standing outside of a building in the Fulton Street area of Toledo.\n After speaking with the task force members briefly, the suspect went around the corner of a building, pulled out a gun and went into a house, according to Kral.\n Officers set up a perimeter and called in negotiators and a SWAT team, Kral said.\n After more than two hours of negotiations, the SWAT team deployed \"chemical agents,\" according to the department release.\n \"At approximately 6:22 PM, the suspect emerged from the house with a firearm in both hands and fired shots in multiple directions, one of which struck Officer Stalker in the head,\" the department said.\n \"I'm sad to say that Officer Brandon Stalker was struck once and has passed away,\" Kral said.\n The chief did not take questions and said additional information would be provided at a second press briefing Wednesday.\n Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered that all US and Ohio flags be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds throughout Lucas County and at the Ohio Statehouse, the Vern Riffe Center, and Rhodes State Office Tower in Columbus in honor of Officer Stalker.\n Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said the death of Stalker comes at a dark time for the city. Two other officers have died this past year, Officer Anthony Dia in the line of duty on July 4, and another unexpectedly just last week.\n Stalker was in the same class as Officer Dia and is the 32nd Toledo officer to die in the line of duty, the release said.\n \"This is a very dark and horrific day for the city of Toledo and it comes at a time when the Toledo Police Department has had to endure too many dark and terrible days in the last 6 months,\" the mayor said.\n \"I call on all Toledoans tonight, to say a prayer for their city, and to challenge themselves to respond to today's horrible events with thoughts of love and light,\" Kapszukiewicz said.\n \" And perhaps, each in our own way, we can drive out the darkness that we feel in our hearts right now, and provide a brighter path for our police department, our community, our neighborhoods, and everyone who is suffering tonight.\"\n CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

We're making some changes to reduce demands on students,\" the organization said in a statement.\n The subject tests will still be offered for international students, but only for two more sessions -- in May and June of 2021.\n Students already registered for subject tests will be automatically refunded, the organization said. Those registered for the SAT essay will still be able to take the test through June 2021.\n In response to why the organization is discontinuing the SAT essay, College Board again referenced the \"changing needs\" of students and colleges.\n \"This change simply streamlines the process for students who have other, more relevant opportunities to show they can write an essay as part of the work they're already doing on their path to college,\" it said in a statement.\n Though this change by College Board is permanent, the last few months have seen many schools temporarily step away from requiring college-readiness exams.\n Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California system, for example, all dropped their SAT and ACT requirements for the year -- with the UC system suspending them until at least 2024.\n At the same time, more and more students and parents have argued that the tests should be optional on a permanent basis, saying that the tests aren't a true reflection of a student's intelligence or academic ability.\n An analysis by Inside Higher Ed, for example, found that the lowest average scores for each part of the SAT came from students with less than $20,000 in family income, while the highest scores came from those with more than $200,000 in family income.\n Still, College Board and ACT, Inc. have defended their tests, arguing they are still widely used and provide a standardized measure of academic readiness.\n CNN's Alicia Lee contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Avril Haines, Biden's DNI pick, pledges to keep politics out of intelligence after Trump's wars with intelligence community",
        "body_text": "Avril Haines, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to be director of national intelligence, pledged Tuesday to turn the corner after President Donald Trump's warring with the intelligence community.\n \"To be effective, the DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power \u2014 even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult,\" Haines said at her confirmation hearing. \"To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever.\"\n LIVE UPDATES: Biden prepares for inauguration on Trump's last full day in office\n The intelligence community Haines would lead upon her Senate confirmation has been frequently under assault from a President who has accused a so-called \"deep state\" of undermining his presidency, particularly when it came to Russia and his impeachment.\n Trump has fired officials in the intelligence community, and he placed a loyalist in the top intelligence post, former GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, who clashed with career officials declassifying documents related to the FBI's Russia investigation and the extent that Russia and China sought to interfere in the 2020 election.\n Haines told senators Tuesday that Biden \"has made it absolutely clear that he expects the intelligence community to present him with an apolitical, truth-to-power analysis.\"\n \"He will want to know what information we have that actually conflicts with his policy positions,\" Haines added.\n A former deputy CIA director and deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, Haines would be the first woman to lead the intelligence community in a role that was created following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n Haines was introduced by Dan Coats, Trump's first director of national intelligence and a former GOP senator, who repeatedly clashed with Trump over Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n \"Most important to me as former director of national intelligence,\" Coats said of Haines' qualifications, \"is her commitment to bringing non-politicized truth to power and restoring trust and confidence in the intelligence community and the American public.\"\n Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who will become chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee once Democrats take control of the chamber, said that Haines' job will be to ensure the intelligence community \"recovers\" from the Trump era.\n \"The dedicated men and women of the Intelligence Community have been through a lot over the last four years,\" Warner said in his opening statement. \"Our intelligence professionals have been unfairly maligned. Their expertise, knowledge and analysis has often been ignored or even sometimes ridiculed by a president who seems oftentimes uninterested in facts. Those who bravely spoke the truth were vilified, reassigned, fired or retaliated against.\"\n Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the outgoing acting Republican chairman of the Intelligence panel, did not mention Trump's fights with the intelligence community in his opening statement, but said that it was important to fill the key national security role as quickly as possible. Among his first questions was asking Haines to commit to testifying publicly at the committee's worldwide threats hearing, which Ratcliffe balked at doing last year.\n Republicans questioned Haines on her views about China and Iran, including the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal that Trump pulled back from. Haines said that while the incoming Biden administration has indicated that it would come back to the table with Iran if Tehran came back into compliance, she noted that \"frankly, we're a long ways from that.\"\n Haines called China \"a challenge to our security, to our prosperity, to our values across a range of issues,\" noting that the intelligence community's approach to China \"has to evolve.\"\n \"I do support an aggressive stance, in a sense, to deal with the challenge that we're facing,\" Haines said, adding that the US needed a stance that's \"more assertive than where we had been in the Obama-Biden administration.\"\n In addition to pledging to restore trust both inside and outside the intelligence community, Haines noted the many challenges US intelligence agencies face, from China to the global Covid-19 pandemic to cybersecurity threats like the recent SolarWinds hack.\n In the wake of the insurrectionists ransacking the Capitol earlier this month, Haines was asked several questions about how the intelligence community can help the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to address the threat of white supremacist and far-right conspiracy groups. Haines told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, she would work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to produce a public assessment of the threat posed by QAnon, the far-right conspiracy group.\n \"The intelligence community is not in the lead in managing these events, it's the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, but the intelligence community I hope will have an important role in supporting their work and ultimately, in particular, looking at any connections there are between folks in the United States and externally in foreign connections or influence that might've been appropriately identified as a context of the intelligence community.\"\n Haines committed to Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to release an unclassified report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Trump administration refused to do despite Congress passing a law requiring its publication.\n \"Yes, senator, absolutely will follow the law,\" Haines said.\n And Haines also pledged to provide Congress with intelligence community whistleblower complaints, in a nod to the Trump administration's withholding of the 2019 Ukraine complaint that ultimately led to Trump's first impeachment.\n Haines is likely to be among the first Biden Cabinet officials to be confirmed by the Senate, and there's expected to be little, if any, opposition to her nomination. The Intelligence Committee had initially sought to schedule her confirmation hearing last Friday in order to expedite the process, but a senator objected to holding the hearing virtually, leading to Tuesday's in-person session.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Michael Conte, Alex Marquardt and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Shawn Snyder is the head of investment strategy for Citi Personal Wealth Management. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n As more Covid-19 vaccines are becoming readily available, 2021 offers renewed optimism that we may expect a rebound of the economy -- and of life in general. The rapid development and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines has been nothing short of extraordinary and should allow daily life and the global economy to move from hurting to healing in the year ahead.\n The next few months will likely be difficult as Covid-19 cases continue to rise across many parts of the world, but there is hope. With several vaccines showing over 90% effectiveness in blocking infection in clinical trials, optimism has grown that the global population can achieve herd immunity over time. Citi's economists believe that some form of herd immunity could be reached in developed markets by the fourth quarter of 2021.\n Barring an unforeseen setback, the distribution of these vaccines should enable the global economy to recover more quickly and robustly than during a traditional recession, with the global economy in sound shape prior to the pandemic. Citi Private Bank's Chief Economist Steven Wieting believes that the global economy should rebound from an annual contraction of negative 4% in 2020 to a positive growth rate of 4.2% in 2021. This economic recovery will likely be accompanied by a notable rise in global trade volumes, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting that world trade volumes in goods and services could rise by 8.3% year-over-year in 2021.\n Some of this optimism has likely already been priced into the markets. After all, financial markets often serve as leading indicators, with asset prices often reflecting investor expectations for the future, rather than current conditions. Yet we continue to expect that there is further room to run in certain sectors and regions.\n The \"stay-at-home\" stocks that saw significant price appreciation in 2020, including cloud-computing, technology, exercise equipment and home repair, will likely continue to be in demand, for example. But investors should also consider looking for opportunity in stocks with more room to recover from the damaging impacts of Covid-19, like industrials and financials.\n The year ahead looks very promising, but it is not without risk. The development of Covid-19 vaccines is very encouraging, but the logistics and distribution challenges ahead are daunting. Virus mutations are also a cause for concern, but we believe humanity will once again come together during a time of great stress to overcome these challenges.\n Financial markets are unlikely to make it through the year completely unscathed -- a market pullback or correction almost assured -- but I am bullish on the year ahead and believe that investors will once again be rewarded for taking on these risks.",

        "title": "Inside the fight for the Capitol: US Capitol Police officers recount being unprepared and 'betrayed'",
        "body_text": "The day before the US Capitol was attacked, Capitol Police officers were ordered to report to the department's equipment depot to pick up helmets, an officer who was there that day told CNN. They didn't know why they were needed, but when they arrived, they were told to return later. The helmets had yet to be scanned into inventory.\n When officers finally secured helmets that Wednesday morning following roll call, they weren't given direction for use or storage. The helmets are heavy, and it wasn't clear they'd need them for the morning's protest. Some put them in their lockers, others kept them near their fixed posts.\n By afternoon, the officers in the Capitol were in a fight for their lives and for the seat of American government. They were left to their own devices, outgunned, without adequate protective equipment, unaware of backup, enclosed by people, many with weapons, attempting to take over the government.\n New details, provided by five US Capitol Police officers who spoke to CNN, provide a deeper look at how department leadership left its officers unprepared and how the police force charged with protecting Congress was overrun, leading to the most successful assault on the Capitol in more than 200 years.\n The officers who spoke to CNN felt betrayed by leadership. They spoke about the day's events, their feelings and observations, on condition of anonymity, citing fear of losing their jobs and a retributive command staff. Minority officers were hit with racial slurs by people attacking the building.\n And before the fight was over, officers were forced to shout that they were police to law enforcement responding to rescue the building after it was lost. They weren't put in a position to arrest the attackers, to defend themselves, or defend the Capitol. They weren't put in a position to succeed.\n The US Capitol Police handle dozens of protests and demonstrations and events each year. They're as common \"as stoplights in big cities,\" one officer said. They know how to plan, staff and work these events. They've handled mass arrest situations and they've kept the Capitol complex secure even after protesters crossed their lines -- such as when more than 70 people were arrested inside two Senate buildings during the first day of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n \"There was no planning. No pre-planning. I just don't understand. For the life of me, why not have the same precautions as we did with other demonstrations?\" one officer said. \"Our management was completely ... nobody knew what the hell to do. Nobody was giving direction on what to do.\"\n \"I feel betrayed,\" another officer said. \"They didn't even put us in a position to be successful.\"\n Steven Sund, the US Capitol Police chief, resigned after the assault. The sergeants at arms for the House and Senate resigned after Sund. They account for two of the three-member board that oversees US Capitol Police. The third, the Capitol Architect, is not involved in tactical decisions and has not been ensnared by the scandal.\n A retired general will lead an investigation into the security failures, Pelosi announced last week. What happened that day is now the subject of congressional and federal criminal investigations.\n A spokeswoman for US Capitol Police didn't respond to CNN's request for comment. Neither did the president of the labor union representing US Capitol Police officers.\n Officers knew of a protest, and they knew the President was speaking. They were not in an elevated posture of readiness and wore standard duty uniforms.\n But the all-hands planning sessions that precede major events, used to brief front-line officers on all the contingencies -- where to send people in case of sudden need to evacuate, where to send people who need medical help -- never happened.\n It wasn't that nobody had any sense things could go wrong. Days before the planned protest, Sund asked the sergeants at arms to activate the National Guard, a request they denied, Sund told CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" His department's intelligence section also circulated a report warning for potential violence, according to a report in The Washington Post. Sund did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment for this story.\n For some officers, it was the first time they were assigned helmets. Not every US Capitol Police officer is assigned riot gear that officers use in crowd or riot control settings, though items like helmets, face-shields, body-shields, batons, and protective padding are all standard kit for police in state-level and medium-to-large police departments.\n \"It started like a normal day. It shouldn't have started like a normal day,\" one officer told CNN. \"The thing that struck me was getting messages from coworkers saying, 'How come the members keep saying watch your back, be careful, you guys watch your six?' They knew what was coming.\"\n After the President spoke, a supervisor went on police radio to warn of protesters leaving Trump's speech and heading toward the Capitol.\n \"Here they go. There's a large number of Trump supporters, they're coming from the West. We need perimeter on the West,\" one officer recalled hearing.\n At first, it was just a crowd. The officers who spoke to CNN said they expected the normal yelling, name-calling and occasional pushing against the bike-rack fencing that they've grown accustomed to from years of policing demonstrations.\n \"It started like any other demonstration, except it was a lot of damn people,\" one officer told CNN. \"But when it went south, it went south in a hurry. There was not enough people to stop what was coming. What hurt us was, these people, they planned for it. They knew we weren't going to shoot. They knew they could get up on you and we're not going to shoot unarmed people.\"\n As the crowd set upon the Capitol, police rushed the workers setting up the inauguration stage to safety. They evacuated in such a hurry that some left tools behind.\n Before the violence, there was a call for a possible bomb. Someone showed pictures of the device to a police officer who used their radio to alert others, and police officers and the bomb squad had to respond. A few minutes later, they found another, and again more officers had to respond to create a perimeter and evacuate people.\n Police can't be in two places at once, and the officers handling the bombs couldn't help at the Capitol. That's when the fighting started on the West front of the Capitol. Investigators later determined the bombs were real, though it's not clear why they didn't detonate.\n \"They start throwing tear gas. Gas grenades. Flashbangs. Shooting cherry bombs, rubber bullet type guns they were shooting us with,\" one officer said. \"We have OC spray (another term for pepper spray) but we're pleading for help, send us help.\"\n Some of the group had blunt objects to break windows and projectiles to throw at officers, including bricks, signs, fence posts, fire extinguishers, lumber and shields.\n Some DC Metropolitan Police officers were already at the Capitol trying to hold a perimeter outside the building. They had been monitoring the group from the Ellipse, where Trump had spoken earlier.\n \"We were outnumbered as it was, but if MPD hadn't been there, they would have come right in,\" an officer said. \"They slowed the advance.\"\n The officers described the violence as methodical and escalating. Officers were coming off the line one at a time to decontaminate after getting sprayed or gassed. Gas lingered in the air. The spray used by attackers had longer range than the spray officers had, so those on the front lines weren't able to effectively use pepper spray against attackers.\n Sometimes, small groups would pick an officer to fight, occupying the officer and any other officer who joined to help.\n The breach of the first perimeter was fast, and police didn't have any real security barriers out. The bike-rack style fencing is used more as a guide to keep people from stumbling into restricted areas and they're light enough to be used as weapons by protesters if a protest turns violent.\n \"Finally, our less-than-lethal teams came out and we're deploying gas, flashbangs, fighting fire with fire. But they had masks, they were prepared. They had earpieces, they had radios. It's not a coincidence that once those bombs were found, they started to advance on us,\" an officer said.\n There was a call for help at the West entrance to the Capitol, and the attackers watched the police shift resources, leaving the East front scarcely guarded.\n A breach of the perimeter on the East entrance followed shortly after the West perimeter collapsed. Officers believe groups were communicating between the East and West fronts and coordinating the timing of their attacks on officers.\n \"They're methodical, lobbing cherry bombs, little bit of this and that,\" one officer said. \"The people we were fighting. They had gas masks. They had earpieces. They had radios.\"\n \"Look, when they busted through the bike racks and green fencing at the bottom of Pennsylvania Avenue, there was only like four people there. A woman, a supervisor, two other officers,\" an officer told CNN. \"They busted through that. (The female officer) hit her head and had a concussion, she hasn't been back.\"\n The officers who spoke to CNN, don't recall ever being made aware of plans to take back the Capitol. They remember hearing officers all over pleading for help, both in specific emergency situations and in general to formulate a plan to clear the building of the attackers. Neither recall being given orders about how or whether to arrest people.\n Capitol police, once a decision is made to start mass arrests, will set up a square using bicycle rack fencing, surround it with officers and put arrestees in flex-cuffs and into the pen for holding until things calm down. Then, officers can each handle paperwork on a handful of arrestees.\n That was not an option because, as the officer said, they were \"getting their asses kicked.\"\n \"You couldn't have arrested anybody,\" one officer said. \"You could not. We were surrounded. Normally in mass-arrest situation, they comply under arrest. But (the attackers had) already proven to us they wanted to beat our asses. No way arrests could have been affected at that moment. Just get these people out and survive.\"\n Even if the officers wanted to go into the crowd to grab a single problem actor, their lines weren't sufficiently staffed to allow for a small squad of officers to wade in, grab someone and drag them back behind the line for arrest.\n \"Everyone was screaming for help,\" an officer said. \"At that point, (officers) were just responding to '10-33' calls. Officer in trouble, needs help.\"\n Once the attackers were on the rotunda steps and near the doors, people started climbing the walls. US Capitol Police don't normally staff the grounds outside those walls with more than a couple officers because they weren't seen as entrances, so the people climbing were able to break windows and get inside.\n The officers at the doors didn't know people had already broken in behind them until someone went over the radio with that information, one officer told CNN.\n \"They're over the radio saying they've breached the doors, they've breached windows and got inside,\" one officer recalled. \"They came in packs, and officers working inside are trying to lockdown areas where members may be, trying to get members to secret hideaways and tunnels where they'll be safe.\"\n On scaffolding outside the Capitol, an officer climbed to try and arrest someone.\n \"You guys don't have the numbers,\" he told the police officer.\n Sund told \"60 Minutes\" he requested the National Guard during the siege, and the office of the Secretary of the Army delayed the request, citing the poor visuals of soldiers protecting the Capitol.\n \"I don't like the optics of the National Guard standing the line with the Capitol behind them,\" is the answer Sund says he got from a representative of the secretary of the Army. The chief of the DC Metro Police Department has confirmed Sund's account to \"60 Minutes.\"\n The Pentagon has denied Sund's optics claims and said guards were approved within about 40 minutes.\n Once inside, officers were getting surrounded and encircled, fighting protesters, trying to beat people back. Flashbangs and gas were going off and officers weren't sure if it was police or protesters.\n Lawmakers and staffers locked themselves in offices. At some point, one officer recalled the deputy chief (now chief) give an order over police radio to lockdown the Capitol. That means doors get secured with magnetic locks across the campus -- the Capitol and outlying office buildings. Members of congressional leadership were whisked away by officers who work dignitary protection.\n Two men who walked into the Capitol after it had been breached told FBI agents that an officer, who appeared to respond out of fear, shook one of their hands and said, \"It's your house now, man.\"\n One officer was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher and later died. A woman climbing through a window inside the building leading to the Speaker's Lobby was shot by an officer, the only apparent use of deadly force by US Capitol Police that day.\n One officer said he wouldn't have begrudged any officer for firing their gun, but they were outgunned. \"I got 16 bullets in my handgun, 28 in my long gun. Then what?\" he said.\n \"At that point, I wasn't looking for arms. But there were arrests with guns, a cooler of Molotov (cocktails was) found. We recovered 9 or 10 guns, found or taken off people. Guarantee so many more had 'em,\" he said. \"You don't want to start a gunfight and have a bloodbath. We wouldn't have won.\"\n \"They knew they could get up on you without you shooting 'em,\" said another officer. \"And there's so many. You could go hands on if you want, but there's too many people.\"\n One officer saw two attackers flash law enforcement badges once inside. One said, \"We're doing this for you, buddy.\"\n An arrestee inside was freed after a group surrounded officers. He had already been cuffed, cleared for weapons and was on the ground when the group freed him, cuffs still on.\n \"(He) had that one guy cuffed thinking, OK, but there was no direction. What do you do? Who do you go to? there was no direction and the crowd snatched him from (the officer),\" an officer told CNN. \"What can you do? Gonna get into a gunfight over that guy?\"\n \"The day ended when we got the reinforcements,\" one of the officers said. \"But hours had gone by. It was a bad day.\"\n The officers described reinforcements coming in, dozens at a time, in helmets and riot gear with rifles drawn. Police from DC, Fairfax County, Montgomery County, Prince George's County all mustered SWAT teams or other on-call officers to help secure the Capitol.\n \"You hear them going in and out of rooms and people are screaming 'blue, blue, blue,' so they know it's a friendly,\" one of the officers told CNN.\n \"I'm a Black officer. There was a lot of racism that day. I was called racial slurs, and in the moment, I didn't process this as traumatic,\" the other officer said, referring to racial epithets he received from some attackers. \"I was just trying to survive. I just wanted to get home, to see my daughter again. I couldn't show weakness. I finally reached a safe place, surrounded by officers, I was able to cry. To let it out. To attempt to process it.\"\n The next day, officers came to work bandaged and taped from the chaos the day before. The job of securing the capitol remains and there's an inauguration in a few days.\n Others haven't returned, some with serious injuries like concussions.\n About a week after the assault, the department's Internal Affairs section sent an email to officers asking to report colleagues for use of force that may have been outside Capitol Police policy. The officers who spoke to CNN found this offensive, considering the failures of planning and degree to which officers had to fight for the Capitol.\n \"I want to report the chief to (Internal Affairs) for getting one of our officers killed. I want to report command staff for keeping everything a fucking secret. Can I put that in a tip line? I don't care if an officer spit on one of those people,\" an officer said. \"At that point they deserved everything they got and then some.\"\n CNN's David Brooks and Kristin Wilson contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "Beijing on Monday reported that China's GDP grew 2.3% last year, averting the recession that gripped much of the world as the coronavirus pandemic spread. GDP in the fourth quarter grew by 6.5%, compared with a year earlier.\n The country can't sustain that kind of output without iron ore, which it needs to make the steel for roads, bridges and buildings. China imported 17% more iron ore last year than it did in 2019.\n Australia is a big winner of that growing demand, being responsible for some 60% of the iron ore that China imports.\n \"China's impressive industrial recovery has stoked demand for steel production, and Australia is a major supplier of steel making inputs to China,\" said Sean Langcake, senior economist at Oxford Economics.\n The country's dependence on iron ore from Australia, meanwhile, remains strong. Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reported Tuesday that shipments of the material rose 2.4% last quarter, helped by \"robust buying\" from China.\n \"In China, the industrial sector has recovered and is now at pre-Covid levels due to the rapid deployment of stimulus,\" the company said in a statement.\n Australia isn't the only country supplying China with this vital raw material. But it is by far the largest source, and one analysts say would be difficult to replace should relations between the two countries sour even further.\n \"If iron ore shipments from Australia were to be restricted, China would be forced to pay a higher price for iron ore imports from elsewhere,\" Langcake said.\n Brazil is one option \u2014 about 20% of the iron ore that China uses comes from there. But analysts at Changjiang Futures, a Wuhan-based securities firm, point out that there are problems to that alternative. Major Brazilian mining firm Vale (VALE), for example, has struggled with disruptions to supply after a wave of coronavirus infections among its workers last year.\n \"There is still uncertainty surrounding Brazil's supply in 2021, as its pandemic still hasn't been effectively under control and Vale S.A. is less mechanized than its Australian rivals,\" the Changjiang Futures analysts wrote in a research note earlier this month.\n \"As the Chinese economy continues to recover from the pandemic ... the country's demand for iron ore will increase further in the future,\" the article said.",

        "body_text": "Brayden Harrington, the 13-year-old New Hampshire boy who bonded with President-elect Joe Biden over their shared experience with stuttering, will be part of the prime-time special capping off Biden's inauguration on Wednesday evening.\n Harrington, who went viral over the summer after talking about his bond with Biden in a video at the Democratic National Convention, said Biden's inauguration will send a special message to kids -- including those grappling with stuttering. It shows them \"that they matter,\" he said. \"It's a huge part of our life because there's a president being elected that has a speech issue.\"\n Harrington will be part of a segment introducing the President-elect's remarks during the 90-minute \"Celebrating America\" special airing on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC, CNN has learned.\n In the segment, Harrington reads a famous line from President John F. Kennedy's Inaugural address: \"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.\"\n Harrington, whose segment also includes appearances by former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, labor leader Dolores Huerta and the first female MLB general manager Kim Ng, told CNN \"it's an honor\" to be part of the inauguration festivities as Biden is sworn in as the country's 46th president.\n \"He's come a long way and I'm pretty happy for him. When I first met him, it was in February and he came this far,\" Harrington said. \"He basically has the whole country in his hands, and I know he'll be good at that.\"\n Harrington and Biden first met last February at a campaign event in New Hampshire. After speaking briefly along the ropeline, Biden, who worked through a stutter as a child, invited the young boy to meet with him backstage where he spoke with him about stuttering and techniques for how to deal with it.\n The 13-year-old talked about that moment in one of the most powerful videos from the summer's Democratic convention.\n \"He told me that we were members of the same club: We stutter. It was really amazing to hear that someone like me became vice president,\" Brayden said.\n \"I'm just a regular kid, and in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me feel more confident about something that's bothered me my whole life,\" he said. \"Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us.\"\n Over the course of the campaign, Biden opened up about his own experience with stuttering, including at a CNN town hall.\n \"You know, stuttering, when you think about it, is the only handicap that people still laugh about. That (they) still humiliate people about. And they don't even mean to,\" Biden said at the town hall.\n CNN first interviewed Harrington in February after his chance encounter with Biden.\n \"It was shocking to shake somebody's hand who has the same trait as me and has the same thing going on,\" Harrington said.",

        "title": "Mitch McConnell is kicking Trump on his way out the door",
        "body_text": "On the final full day of Donald Trump's presidency, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put the blame for the US Capitol riot squarely on the 45th president.\n \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"They were provoked by the President and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.\"\n It's the latest public sign of McConnell's desire to flush the Trump years from the Republican Party. McConnell signaled last week, following the House's impeachment -- again -- of Trump that he was reserving judgment on whether he would consider voting to convict the President in the coming Senate trial. And late last year, McConnell publicly declared that Joe Biden was the President-elect following the Electoral College certification of the results.\n Plus, there's this: Elaine Chao, Trump's transportation secretary for much of his term, resigned in protest following Trump's actions (and inactions) in the Capitol riot. Chao is married to -- yup , you guessed it! -- McConnell.\n McConnell's moves are all designed to do one thing: Create as much distance as possible between himself (and the party's establishment) and Trump. Put another way: What McConnell is trying to do in the last few days of the Trump administration is ensure that the President is in the rear-view mirror of the GOP as soon as possible.\n This is purely a political calculation by McConnell. He knows that Trump is absolutely radioactive to a large number of Americans, including many people who lean toward Republicans but who either voted for Biden or stayed home in 2020. And that Trump's ability to punish those who publicly cross him has already been reduced with his deplatforming on Twitter and Facebook and will erode even further on Wednesday, when he is no longer the president.\n Given those twin realities, McConnell is leading the charge against Trump within the GOP. Which makes perfect sense.\n But that doesn't mean that McConnell isn't taking a risk by pushing the divide between Trump and the party establishment. He is -- in two major ways:\n 1) Trump may be less popular among Republicans than he was before the January 6 riots, but a majority of people who identify as GOPers still not only support Trump but also believe that he was \"definitely\" or \"probably\" the actual winner of the 2020 election. Which means that Trump still has power -- particularly among the party base, which tends to play an outsized role in deciding its nominees up and down the ballot. Trump and his followers have pledged political retribution against those senators and House members who refused to object to the Electoral College results, and if they can field candidates to primary people like Ohio Sen. Rob Portman or South Dakota Sen. John Thune, it could create real problems for McConnell and his efforts to win back the majority in 2022.\n 2) McConnell's conversion on Trump is very sudden -- and transparently motivated by political concerns. After all, McConnell didn't have an issue with Trump when they were working together to confirm three Supreme Court justices and hundreds of lower court appointees over the past four years. And McConnell largely avoided blasting Trump for the many, many things the President said and did that were either anathema to GOP policies and beliefs or were plain dangerous to the country.\n What McConnell is hoping with his decision to run from Trump as fast as possible, then, is that the President's threats to take on GOP incumbents are more talk than walk and that the general public has a very short memory about his (and the broader GOP's) relationship with Trump.\n It's a lot to ask -- and hope for. But this is where the GOP (and its leaders) find themselves on the verge of the post-Trump presidency political world -- flying into the future on a wing and a prayer.",

        "body_text": "It's \"Goodbye for now\" for Alec Baldwin and Twitter.\n The actor bid adieu to the social media platform Monday in the wake of uproar over his wife's claims of having a Spanish heritage.\n \"Twitter is like a party where everyone is screaming,\" his tweet read. \"Not much of a party. Goodbye for now.\"\n Hilaria Baldwin faced backlash after some on social media began accusing her of faking a Spanish accent and questioning whether she was born on the Spanish island of Mallorca.\n Videos of her speaking with an accent appeared on social media and people who claimed to have attended high school with her also posted to dispute her claim that she came to the US at the age of 19 to attend college.\n The lifestyle expert and podcaster sought to explain what she viewed as confusion.\n \"This is something I take very seriously,and for those who are asking -- I'll reiterate my story, as I've done many times before,\" she said in a video on her Instagram account. \"I was born in Boston and grew up spending time with my family between Massachusetts and Spain. My parents and sibling live in Spain and I chose to live here, in the USA.\"\n Alec Baldwin appeared to defend his wife in a lengthy video he posted on his verified Instagram account in which he talked about social media.\n \"There's things that have been said lately about people that I love, that I care about deeply, which are ridiculous,\" he said \"I mean, just ridiculous.\"\n It's not the first time the \"30 Rock\" star has taken a break from Twitter.\n He's done it a few times including in 2017 after comments he made about sexual harassment and assault in the wake of the beginning of the #MeToo movement sparked outrage.",

        "title": "Fearing more violence, online platforms are cracking down on livestreams from Washington ",
        "body_text": "When a mob of rioters overran barriers and broke into the Capitol on January 6, some of them boasted about their exploits on livestreams as thousands of followers watched in real time.\n As they marched through hallways and ransacked lawmakers' offices, they offered a play-by-play of their actions on YouTube, Facebook and other platforms as a transfixed nation watched. Other rioters turned to lesser-known streaming outlets such as DLive.\n Now some livestream platforms are taking steps to crack down on such broadcasts after the assault on the Capitol and in anticipation of potential disruptions at President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n Facebook plans to block \"the creation of any new Facebook events\" near the White House, the US Capitol and any state capitol buildings through Inauguration Day.\n \"We're monitoring for signals of violence or other threats both in Washington, DC and across all 50 states,\" the company said in a statement. \"In the lead up to Inauguration Day, we have implemented a series of additional measures to continue preventing attempts to use our services for violence.\"\n YouTube says it has removed multiple videos shot during the assault on the Capitol that appeared to incite violence or show Capitol rioters carrying firearms. The company told CNN it will continue to remove livestreams and other content that violate its guidelines on hate, harassment and election integrity.\n And DLive, a streaming service popular with gamers, announced after the Capitol attack it had suspended seven of its users for incitement of violence and illegal activities on January 6.\n DLive has since announced additional measures and said it's blocking all livestreams from the Washington, DC, area on Inauguration Day.\n Security experts fear extremists like the ones who invaded the Capitol may be motivated by widely shared images portraying that siege as a success.\n The Capitol livestreams provided a platform to spread hate while encouraging those who film them to pander to their followers, said Pete Eliadis, a former law enforcement official and founder of Intelligence Consulting Partners.\n Eliadis believes the streamers' revealing their vantage point inside the Capitol also has broader national security ramifications.\n \"It's being watched by state actors all over the world. ... If I'm a bad actor, I know the layout of the Capitol ...  I can see the defenses, the police response and I can counter that now,\" he told CNN. \"That's a huge challenge on a larger scale platform.\"\n Mob mentality and instant gratification also play a big role,he said.\n \"Individuals are filming this, they're blasting it to their followers, their followers are picking it up and it's bringing immediate feedback and instantaneous reward,\" he said.  \"You're seeing the impact of your filming, you're getting that adrenaline rush, you're almost pandering to your audience. \"\n Some streaming services offer opportunities for their users to make money.\n For example, DLive allows users to buy \"lemons,\" a form of digital currency, using a credit card or cryptocurrency. Each lemon is worth $0.012, and users can donate lemons to a streamer, which can be converted into real money.\n On DLive, users can host talk shows, stream their gaming sessions or stream other events in real time -- and earn money doing it.\n Some commenters watching on DLive called the Capitol assault a \"second revolution\" and awarded lemons to a handful of users who were streaming from in or around the building.\n DLive later intervened, freezing those accounts and saying that lemons donated to those users would be returned to donors.\n All streaming platforms have their own influencers who equate fame with money. To stand out, some users engage in a degree of acting -- almost like they're starring in their own movies -- to earn revenue, said Cindy Otis, vice president of analysis at  Alethea Group, which tracks disinformation and social media manipulation.\n And most users will flock to platforms where they can monetize their content, Otis said. For extremists, that can mean smaller, fringe platforms which have less restrictive policies on content and advertise themselves as homes for \"uncensored\" speech, she said.\n As platforms crack down on hate speech and incendiary content, extremist ideologies are finding new homes, says Megan Squire, a professor at Elon University in North Carolina and an expert on online extremism.\n After the attack on the Capitol, some alternative livestream channels saw growth of up to 200% within hours, Squire told CNN.\n \"When they are removed from mainstream platforms, extremists and other bad actors will sometimes gravitate to lesser-known platforms in order to continue whatever behaviors got them banned in the first place,\" Squire said.  \"Typically these behaviors include violent rhetoric, hate speech, trolling and harassment, and so on.\"\n For political extremists, one appeal of fringe or less tightly run platforms can be lax content oversight.\n \"There is always a risk that any platform that does not have good content moderation standards and strategies will be used by bad actors,\" Squire said. \"There are smaller platforms that do a great job of content moderation, and there are large platforms that do a terrible job. It's less about the size than it is about how committed the platform is to enforcing its own standards of behavior.\"\n Even on smaller platforms such as DLive, extremists make up only a fraction of users.\n DLive says the vast majority of its users focus on gaming, with less than 10% talking about current events or politics. And Squire said some DLive gamers are using the platform's community chats to applaud the suspension of the Capitol rioters and express their frustration at being associated with White supremacists.",

        "title": "Trump is handing Biden a more dangerous world. There's only so much the new president can undo",
        "body_text": "The recent attack on the US Capitol served as a sobering wake-up call: Not only have the Trump years left America deeply divided, they've also transformed it into a theater of political violence.\n President Donald Trump's impact on the world at large has been much the same. As he hands power to Joe Biden on Wednesday -- however reluctantly -- he also hands his successor a far more dangerous world than it was four years ago.\n At the start of 2020, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists behind the symbolic Doomsday Clock moved the time to 100 seconds to midnight, indicating that the world was closer to annihilation than it had been at any time since World War II.\n In their assessment, they considered the threat of nuclear confrontation, climate change and disruptive technologies. Of course, not every threat they point to is the result of a Trump policy. But those that are have been enormously consequential.\n One of the most significant of these policies was Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. The pact -- brokered by the Obama administration and five other nations -- was widely welcomed as a breakthrough in a decades-long security challenge.\n In return for an easing of economic sanctions, Tehran agreed to limit its enriched uranium stockpiles to 300 kilograms, a 98% reduction, and capped enrichment levels to 3.67%. Until Trump withdrew, Iran was complying.\n But without the US in the deal, Iran has returned to its old ways. It now has more than 2.4 tons of enriched uranium stockpiled -- 12 times the deal allowed for. It is now enriching uranium by 20%, closer to the level needed to produce an atomic weapon. And last week, it said it was researching the production of uranium metal, a component that can be used in nuclear weapons.\n Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran, involving yet more sanctions, has mostly caused suffering among everyday Iranians and done little to deter Tehran's nuclear ambitions or its missile program.\n Iran's violations of the deal give the country more leverage in talks with Biden's incoming administration. Both parties want to preserve the agreement, but Biden is under pressure to simultaneously address the country's ballistic missile program. Iran says it won't renegotiate terms of the deal and will only start complying once the US eases sanctions.\n \"It's going to be difficult to put that genie back into the bottle,\" International Crisis Group's Middle East Program Director, Joost Hiltermann, told CNN.\n \"All of this has triggered a response from Iran that led to an escalation of violence in the Middle East, broadly speaking, to the point that we saw a few incidents where things could have come to blows in a major way. They didn't, so we were lucky. But basically, this was luck,\" he said.\n In 2019, Iran shot down a US drone in international airspace in the Strait of Hormuz. An attack the same year on Aramco oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, was widely blamed on Iran. The US assassinated top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani on Iraqi soil in January 2020 in a drone strike, bringing the two foes to the brink of war.\n \"Any of these incidents could have sparked a wider escalation that could have led to a broader confrontation. It did in some cases, like where the Iranians fired back at the Iraqi military camps where American soldiers were co-located, after the Soleimani killing,\" Hiltermann said.\n The missile attack, just days after the Soleimani assassination, left more than 100 soldiers with traumatic brain injuries. An Iranian rocket attack at another base in March killed two Americans and one British soldier.\n Just as Tehran has used the Trump years to strengthen its position for negotiations, so too has Pyongyang. In a ruling party congress last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rattled off an ambitious list of new nuclear weapons and missiles his country is pursuing.\n After a saber-rattling start to North Korea's relationship with the US under Trump -- in which the President memorably threatened Pyongyang with his \"big button\" and called Kim \"Little Rocket Man\" -- the young North Korean leader managed to get what his father had dreamed of for years: a sit-down meeting with a US president.\n Trump's talks with Kim did result in a pause in missile testing, but his dalliance with the North Korean leader has broadly failed. Three meetings between the two men didn't amount to much in terms of actual denuclearization. Instead, they provided Kim with the all-important prize of time.\n Since relations broke down between Pyongyang and both Washington and Seoul, weapons experts believe North Korea has increased its nuclear and missile arsenal. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), North Korea had an estimated 10 nuclear warheads in 2016, before Trump's election. It now has between 30 and 40, according to SIPRI.\n That leaves two of Washington's foremost Asian allies, South Korea and Japan, within range of Pyongyang's missiles, including potential nuclear weapons. The US territory of Guam is, in theory, in striking distance too.\n There's little clue as to what Biden might do on North Korea. He and President Barack Obama made no progress with the pariah state during their eight years in office, continuing a long-held US policy of largely ignoring the country and its threats. They focused their nuclear arms control efforts on Iran.\n But it's not a threat that can be ignored. In its dire verdict on the nuclear threat level in 2020, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists said that world was \"sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape.\"\n \"The arms control boundaries that have helped prevent nuclear catastrophe for the last half century are being steadily dismantled,\" it wrote.\n In terms of Russia, all but one Cold War-era agreement with the US on nuclear arms control remains intact. Trump pulled the US out of the bilateral Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty after Russia tested a missile with a range of 2,500 kilometers (around 1,550 miles).\n The treaty banned ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Washington and its NATO allies agreed Russia had violated the deal. Moscow accused the US of breaking the agreement as well.\n The only nuclear deal left between the two countries is New START, an agreement due to expire on February 5, just 16 days after Biden takes office.\n Both sides have indicated a willingness to extend the treaty, but for how long and under what terms is still up in the air. Getting to a place of consensus could chew up a chunk of the new administration's time as it deals with the pandemic, a staggering economy and political violence at home.\n Russia said Friday it was also beginning the six-month process of withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty, a 1992 agreement that allowed reconnaissance flights over the airspace of its members' airspace to gain information on military activities. The idea was to build trust and transparency among members, and to prevent conflict between them.\n The US officially withdrew from the 34-member agreement in November. Russia now says that without the US, the treaty is flawed. It is concerned its members could share information with the US.\n The end of the INF treaty and erosion of Open Skies might make for a more dangerous world militarily, but Russia's foreign policy and defense strategies don't suggest the country is actually looking for more conflict, Emily Ferris from the Royal United Services Institute told CNN.\n A greater threat may be Russia's strength in disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks to spread its influence abroad, a problem hammered home when US intelligence agencies confirmed that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election.\n The nature of the cyber world also gives Russia plenty of cover, as tracing attacks back to the Russian state can be difficult.\n Several US agencies said last month they had been hit by a massive data breach after downloading what they thought was an upgrade to their IT platforms provided by Texas-based company SolarWinds.\n Some 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients inadvertently downloaded malware that was then used to hack into their systems, in a stunning cyberattack that US intelligence agencies say was \"likely Russian in origin.\" Officials still don't fully understand the extent of the hack, which penetrated dozens of government networks.\n \"In Russia, the idea of information warfare is very well established, even from early Soviet times. The idea of black PR and propaganda, and finding out information on your adversary is an absolutely well-established concept. And the cyber warfare you're seeing now is just a modernization of that. It is something the Russians have perfected and are quite good at,\" Ferris said.\n This widespread dissemination of false information and skepticism of facts have proven dangerous throughout Trump's presidency. Trump's earlier claims that Covid-19 was less dangerous than the flu no doubt contributed to the country's devastating health crisis. His baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen motivated thousands to march in the Capitol, at a protest that turned quickly into a violent and deadly riot.\n Russia takes a more subtle approach. It uses fake news articles, social media trolls and a growing English language news service to push its influence in places like eastern Europe, or even the UK during its debate on Brexit.\n America's foes have seized on events like the violence at the Capitol to justify their own repressive actions at home and to frame the US' moralistic finger wagging as hypocritical.\n Hu Xijin, the editor of China's state-owned Global Times, asked Americans in a Twitter post if they still recognized their country: \"How can the Chinese people continue to worship the US?\" he wrote after the riot.\n The Trump years have done little to slow China's aggressions in the region or its rise, widely seen by American officials as a threat to their own country's dominance.\n China fought its bloodiest conflict in decades with India over a shared -- and hotly disputed -- border in the Himalayas. It repeatedly threatened Taiwan's sovereignty. It buzzed Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea. It massively denuded Hong Kong in the past year with its National Security Law, depriving Hong Kongers of long enjoyed civil freedoms.\n Despite its sanctions and tough talk on China, the Trump administration has been unable to reel the country in on issues like human rights. In Xinjiang, millions of Uyghurs have been interred in so-called \"reeducation\" camps. Trump has ended his term with relations at an all-time low.\n And pushing issues like human rights and the sovereignty of China's neighbors aside to do business with the rising world power is becoming a new normal. A preliminary investment agreement between the European Union and China, over the objections of Biden's team, is one example. It also shows how concern over Washington's interests, once top of mind in Brussels, has been diminished by four years of Trump.\n Biden himself appeared to recognize this in a speech late last month, remarking that the US would have to \"regain the trust and confidence of a world that has begun to find ways to work around us or without us.\"\n If Biden or Beijing is looking for a reset, there is considerable room for one, but it is likely to be on China's terms.\n Sharon Squassoni, of George Washington University's Institute for International Science and Technology Policy, said the way forward for Biden is reengaging in diplomacy, and using his foreign policy expertise to work with countries like Russia and China, rather than positioning the US as perennially against them.\n \"We have Biden coming in with decades of experience in foreign policy and a deep, deep bench of connections, people who have spent their entire lives worrying about these issues,\" said Squassoni, who worked in the Bush Sr. and Clinton administrations.\n What he must do, Squassoni recently wrote, is scrap Trump's focus on the \"great power competition narrative\"-- the struggle for dominance between the US, Russia and China -- a term used repeatedly in the Trump administration's strategy documents, including a 2018 nuclear review.\n \"The one thing I've learned over many, many decades is that the US might be a superpower, but it cannot accomplish these tasks -- like reducing nuclear proliferation -- it can't do it on its own,\" Squassoni said.\n \"It really needs the cooperation of Russia and China and a whole host of countries that can make a real difference.\"",

        "title": "Biden transition finds culture of coronavirus denial throughout Trump's federal government",
        "body_text": "Joe Biden's transition team found a culture of coronavirus skepticism within Donald Trump's federal government as they prepared to take office, sources close to the Biden transition told CNN, with political appointees loyal to the President reflecting his dismissiveness of public health guidelines and sometimes mocking career employees for wearing masks.\n The findings from Biden's agency review teams are some of the earliest readouts from the Biden officials who were tasked with preparing for the new administration and signal one of the most apparent early changes that the incoming administration will make. They observed a federal bureaucracy devoid of clear leadership on the pandemic, the sources said.\n The Biden transition was subject to some of these unclear guidelines, as well, with one source describing awkward moments within some agencies where the Biden team would try to avoid large in-person meetings as the political leadership at those same agencies would schedule gatherings in small conferences rooms with \"a lot of people not physical distanced.\" For those Trump appointees who did wear masks, the Biden teams observed that oftentimes those masks were only put on when they entered the room. And even when the Biden teams were not in meetings, one source said that when they walked the halls of certain agencies, they would see groups of unmasked people working in conference rooms, a site they described as \"jarring.\"\n \"The general takeaway was that many of the career folks were relatively compliant and took Covid seriously,\" said one source familiar with the transition's findings. \"There was political direction, though, in a lot of places, that kind of set the set the tone.\"\n That tone, this person said, was one that reflected the President's own denial of the realities of coronavirus, leading to a pandemic that upended his final year in office after a lackluster response by the federal government sunk his reelection chances. Some agencies, the sources said, handled coronavirus responsibly and instituted strict rules for how federal employees who had to come to work should stay safe. Other government bodies, however, were remarkably lax about key health guidelines.\n \"There was a lot of variation. There's some agencies where you have to have people in person that were extraordinarily thoughtful about the way to meet their mission while still keeping the reports safe,\" the source said. \"And then there were other places where my guess is there were a lot more infections than were reported, just because the people who did come in were working in what I would call not necessarily a safe environment.\"\n A White House spokesperson did not return a request for comment.\n Among the agencies most impacted was the Department of Homeland Security, sources close to the transition said, where the critical and sensitive nature of the work required numerous employees to work in person. Biden's transition team also grew concerned that many in the department had not been prioritized for the coronavirus vaccine, despite high rates of infection inside the agency.\n One of Biden's earliest goals in the White House will be to implement strict coronavirus rules in places where he has the most authority -- namely, the federal government.\n Trump refused to accept the magnitude of the coronavirus crisis throughout his final year in office, declining to wear a mask for months and downplaying the virus in an attempt to allay fears that were dominating the presidential election. Biden ran on a pledge to make the coronavirus his top priority, creating a scenario where one of the most dramatic shifts between administrations could be how the virus is approached. And while Biden transition officials expected to see some legacy of Trump's coronavirus denial inside the federal bureaucracy, sources said the level to which political appointees reflected the President's message was significant.\n \"Anything that was seen as undermining the President's message was totally frowned upon,\" said one former Trump administration official. \"[Trump] wanted to show that everything was under control, so that's been the message, even if the numbers suggest the opposite.\"\n CNN has previously reported that current and former administration officials said there was no one in the White House or the National Security Council whose singular focus was to coordinate the Covid response among the Cabinet and various agencies. Efforts to mandate masks among government employees and inside government offices were shot down by the White House as Trump worked to portray strength and assure the public that the situation was under control. Even after Trump himself tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be hospitalized, staff within the West Wing largely opted against the use of masks.\n Biden has said that he intends to mandate mask wearing on federal property on his first day in office.\n In recent weeks, many government agencies, including the National Security Council, began making vaccines available for staff and security personnel. In some offices in the Executive Office Building, puzzles and other souvenir shop items bearing Trump's image and signature started piling up as free giveaways to staff who were popping in to receive their vaccines, one official recalled.\n But the President himself was never vaccinated, with the White House saying publicly that as someone who contracted the coronavirus, doctors believe he has the antibodies necessary to protect him. Even as that window the antibody ended last month, there was no indication that Trump would agree to a vaccine, even as a symbolic measure to assure the public of the vaccine's viability.\n \"He just doesn't believe he needs it,\" said one person familiar with the President's thinking, \"so he doesn't see a point.\"\n The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing federal workers, has repeatedly criticized the administration's handling of coronavirus, saying federal worksites reopened too quickly with too little regard for worker safety.\n A recent survey of workers in the Department of Veterans Affairs found that 60% of those surveyed said their facility didn't let them know when fellow staff members contracted Covid-19. Some 40% said they weren't receiving adequate personal protective equipment.\n \"If you want to give the Trump administration a grade on this, it would have to be an F,\" said Jacqueline Simon, director of the public policy department at AFGE.\n In addition to the issues at the VA, she said people struggled to get appropriate PPE and socially distance in their roles with TSA, the Department of Agriculture and in various agencies in the Department of Homeland Security.\n While some agencies handled Covid protections better than others, Simon said the tone at the top was that coronavirus wasn't a serious concern.\n \"From the top, of course, they get zero credit for doing anything right because they tried to muddy the message,\" Simon said.\n Trump, at the outset of the virus, lied about the fact that it would go away quickly, that the warmer weather in the spring would kill it and that the virus would \"fade away\" in short order. After a deadly spring, however, complete denial was impossible, and Trump began to argue that more cases of the disease were harmless, claimed that the high rate of positive tests was strictly because the country was testing too much, and that the country would soon be \"rounding the corner\" on the virus. And even after Trump himself contracted coronavirus in early October, after months of being lax about mask wearing and openly flouting social distancing guidelines for campaign events, Trump falsely claimed that he was now immune.\n Trump's attitude permeated the White House coronavirus task force, too, which was caught between pushing best practices to battle the coronavirus and navigating a White House that did not want to be seen enforcing mask wearing. The task force wasted days in mid-March debating whether they should recommend that critical infrastructure workers -- including those at all levels of government -- should wear masks. While the health experts on the task force were in favor of the face covering recommendation, they faced pushback from political appointees who didn't want to encourage mask-wearing, according to a person familiar with the situation.",

        "body_text": "ViacomCBS' newly rebranded streaming service Paramount+ will go live on March 4, the company announced Tuesday.\n The revamped service, which is currently known as CBS All Access, will launch in the US and Latin America with a slew of content from the company's biggest brands. That includes more than 20,000 episodes and movies from Paramount Pictures, CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, BET and MTV, as well as live programming such as sports and news.\n ViacomCBS (VIACA) will hold an investor event on February 24 to share more details about what the new service will offer, as well as \"deliver a comprehensive overview of the company's streaming strategy.\" Beyond Paramount+, ViacomCBS also owns Pluto TV and Showtime's direct-to-consumer offering.\n It's not clear how much Paramount+ will cost. CBS All Access, which is currently $5.99 a month with ads and $9.99 without, has been available since 2014 \u2014 long before the launch of competitors such as Disney+, NBCUniversal's Peacock and HBO Max, which is owned by CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia.\n ViacomCBS is hoping a new name, as well as a ton of content from one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, gives Paramount+ the boost it needs to compete in the streaming wars.\n Paramount+ will feature popular series from CBS All Access, including \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"Star Trek: Picard.\"\n But it will also include original programs such as \"The Offer,\" a scripted limited series about the making of \"The Godfather\"; a revival of BET's \"The Game\"; and a true-crime docuseries called \"The Real Criminal Minds,\" which is based on the CBS TV series.\n And these days, it seems it wouldn't be a true streaming service without children's programming.\n ViacomCBS will fill out its kids' content catalog via its family network Nickelodeon, with series such as \"Kamp Koral,\" a new show from \"SpongeBob SquarePants,\" alongside \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,\" which will be exclusive to Paramount+ subscribers early next year.",

        "title": "Trump's legacy will take years to purge from the American psyche",
        "body_text": "After four exhausting years of raging tweets, lies, \"fire and fury\" rants and orders for far-right extremists to \"stand back and stand by,\" it's almost over.\n Donald Trump's presidency is ending in a riot of division, discord and disgrace that encapsulates the pandemonium of his single term that culminated in him inciting an insurrection against Congress and a legacy that will take years to purge from the American psyche.\n Trump is expected to unfurl a new list of pardons, including for white-collar criminals and celebrity rappers, in his last full day in office Tuesday that is likely to reflect the self-dealing contempt for justice that was a dominant theme of his tumultuous term. And there are sure to be more political traps for Joe Biden's incoming administration on his way out the door.\n The very experience of being alive in America will change at noon on Wednesday when the mandate expires of the loudest, most disruptive and erratic commander in chief in history -- who forced himself into every corner of life on his social media feed and constant craving for the spotlight.\n Millions of Americans who viewed the twice-impeached Trump's assaults on decency and the rule of law with shame and alarm will finally be able to breathe easily again, liberated from his strongman's shadow. Biden will be a President who seeks to unify an internally estranged nation in contrast to Trump's obsession with ripping at its social, racial and cultural fault lines to cement his power. Trump's cynical weaponizing of race reemerged on Monday when his White House chose the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. to issue a commission report that minimizes slavery and insults the modern civil rights movement.\n But this is only one view of Trump. The 74 million Americans who voted to reward him with a second term saw him as a leader who voiced their anger at political, business and media elites. Trump channeled their belief that an increasingly diverse and socially liberal nation threatened their values, religion, gun rights and cultural heritage. His exit could trigger volatile political forces among a community that will mourn his White House. The continued devotion of Trump's loyal base voters means that while Biden can wipe out many of the outgoing President's policy wins, removing his influence from politics may well be impossible.\n As he moves into retirement, Trump's presidency will personify the divides between two halves of a populace -- one largely conservative and rural and the other more liberal, suburban and city-dwelling. The two increasingly lack a common cultural language and definition of patriotism -- and thanks to Trump and the media propagandists who sustained his personality cult, even a common version of truth.\n Trump's political career began with outrageous lies and a conspiracy theory over former President Barack Obama's birthplace. It is ending, at least for now, with another even more outrageous one: the false claim that he won an election he clearly lost. Trump's perpetuating of this alternative reality has caused catastrophic damage to faith in government that is the bedrock of any functioning nation. His shattering of the tradition of peaceful US transfers of power threatens to suffocate Biden's legitimacy and prolong the nation's agony at a time of dire crises.\n After his final White House departure on Wednesday, Trump's Marine One will fly over miles of iron fencing and troops protecting the US Capitol from a repeat of the mob insurrection he enlisted and inspired. There could not be a better metaphor for his assault on American democracy.\n Biden's inaugural celebrations will also be muted by the never worse pandemic that was fueled by presidential neglect. Nearly 400,000 Americans, many whose deaths could have been prevented, are dead on Trump's watch. Like his election sedition, Trump's denial over Covid-19 was rooted in an incessant focus on his own political needs rather than his oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency he swore in January 2017.\n The President's premature push to reopen the country in the service of his reelection campaign last summer helped spark a murderous second wave of the virus. Future generations will understand his contempt for science through his barely believable public pondering about whether ingesting disinfectant could cure Covid-19.\n A desire to promote his own interests was also reflected in the outgoing President's attempts to funnel cash and publicity toward his worldwide real estate and hotel empire. This was highlighted by his abortive effort to host the G7 summit at his struggling Doral golf resort in Florida. In many ways, Trump attitude to the presidency was the exact inverse of President John Kennedy's inaugural admonishment to his fellow citizens: \"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\"\n In purely political terms, the President leaves office with some achievements that will long outlast his term. He fundamentally remodeled the Supreme Court and the judiciary on conservative lines. He presided over the first criminal justice reform in years. And he managed to avoid being drawn into foreign wars and beefed up US policy toward an increasingly hostile China while putting NATO nations on notice they must spend more in their own defense. At the same time, he trashed America's reputation among its friends abroad, treated another looming threat -- climate change -- with the same denial he brought to the coronavirus and fawned over autocratic US enemies such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un.\n But perhaps his term will be mostly remembered for his adoption of \"forgotten Americans\" in midwestern and southern cities hollowed out by globalized free trade policies. Trump powerfully identified a populace badly neglected by Washington politicians of both parties -- as well as an audience for his populist, nationalist politics. But the facts suggest the President's tax cuts and economic policies in practice did more for corporations and rich cronies that the heartland Americans he championed.\n His promise to furnish Americans with a \"beautiful\" health care plan never materialized. And his immigration policy and southern border wall that Mexico never paid for turned out to be more successful as a demagogic prop than in addressing the causes of undocumented immigration.\n Trump's post-election propagandizing has added a dangerous layer of radicalization to the grievances of his supporters, millions of whom now reject the structures of US government they believe unjustly ejected their leader.\n Partly because of this, he leaves behind a country that is now as divided as it has been since the Civil War, in which White nationalism is on the march and in which extreme groups like QAnon have infiltrated a shattered Republican Party. How Trump's voters react to his departure will not only shape the future of the GOP -- a party that has shown itself to live in fear of Trump's base -- but will have huge implications for American unity in time to come.\n Biden's inheritance is the most challenging of any new President since Franklin Roosevelt, who took office in the teeth of the Great Depression in 1933, at a time when Nazism was building its totalitarian horror in Europe.\n Despite Biden's ambitious goals on issues such as climate, health care and foreign policy, the success of his presidency will likely be judged on his ability to lead America out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and the economic nightmare it created. And every President faces crises that they could never have anticipated.\n But one thing is for sure -- his White House will be far more conventional, quiet and stable than Trump's. In fact, America may never see anything quite like the last four years again.",

        "title": "Risky driving and fatal crashes surged in 2020, even with fewer drivers on the road, a new report finds",
        "body_text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has forced many Americans to stay home and stay put. But even though fewer people were driving during the first six months of the pandemic, riskier driving surged, leading to a troubling uptick in fatal crashes, preliminary data shows.\n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a report on Americans' driving habits from March to September 2020 and found some disturbing trends. Traffic deaths rose, fewer drivers and passengers wore their seat belts and more drivers who were injured in car accidents had drugs or alcohol in their system.\n The NHTSA report doesn't include context on why these dangerous driving trends have occurred during the pandemic, partly since the data it cites is preliminary. But it has already launched a social media campaign to appeal to drivers in states where highway deaths have surged the most, including Louisiana, Michigan, New York and Texas.\n \"NHTSA is deeply concerned about the trends in highway safety evident in the preliminary 2020 data,\" the organization told CNN in a statement.\n More people stayed home from March to September 2020 than in the same time period in 2019. The number of people who stayed home in the US peaked in April at 28.1% compared to 19.7% in April 2019, the report found.\n Despite fewer drivers on US roads, a larger share of drivers engaged in risky behaviors such as speeding or driving under the influence.\n Highway deaths surged as a result. During the first nine months of 2020, over 28,190 people died in car accidents -- an increase of 4.6% from the same period in 2019, when 26,941 people died, according to separate NHTSA report.\n Seat belt use also declined during the first several months of the pandemic. Before the pandemic, around 78.1% of drivers wore their seat belts. Between March and July 2020, that number fell to 71.6%.\n Passenger seat belt use declined even more steeply, from 75.4% before the pandemic to 59.2% between March and July 2020, though in the cases of both drivers and passengers, seat belt use increased slightly between late July and September 2020.\n Infrequent seat belt use likely led to more car occupants being ejected from their vehicles. Ejections from March to September hovered around 1 ejection per 100 crashes that emergency services responded to. Ejections peaked in April at 1.5 ejections per 100 crashes that required emergency services -- more than double the rate in April 2019, the NHTSA said.\n Average speeds increased on urban and rural roads throughout 2020, too. On average, speeds increased by 22% in selected metropolitan areas during the pandemic, according to the report. A large gap in speeds between drivers on the same road -- what's known as speed dispersion -- often correlates with a higher likelihood of crashes, the NHTSA reported.\n A study of fatal or severe injuries among road users found that two-thirds of drivers had at least one drug in their system at the time of their accident, including alcohol, marijuana or opioids, according to the report.\n That may have something to do with the uptick in alcohol and drug sales during the pandemic, the report said. From July to September, alcohol sales were around 20% higher than they were the previous year, according to the report. In Colorado and Oregon, legal marijuana sales increased 38% and 45% respectively compared to the previous year.\n In an open letter, the administration is pleading with drivers to stop risking their lives behind the wheel to prevent further strain on police and emergency responders.\n \"The law enforcement and EMS community across the country have made your road safety a priority -- but they are already stretched thin and at risk,\" the NHTSA said. \"Please do not further burden them with your poor driving choices.\"\n As the pandemic continues into 2021, the administration has asked drivers to continue wearing their seat belts, obeying the speed limit and driving sober to \"reverse 2020's terrible trend.\"",

        "body_text": "On a typical Inauguration Day, hundreds of thousands of Americans flock to Washington, DC, to catch a glimpse of the new President being sworn in.\n Not this year.\n Government leaders and health officials are telling people to stay away. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to not travel to the United States capital for the inauguration in a news conference early last week.\n \"Our goals right now are to encourage Americans to participate virtually and to protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its grounds on January 6,\" Bowser said.\n Even before the January 6 attack on the Capitol, rising Covid-19 numbers had already forced President-elect Joe Biden's inaugural committee to transition to a virtual ceremony.\n The inauguration ceremony will be broadcast on major news channels, including CNN, so everyone can watch the festivities safely from home. Performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez will headline the swearing-in ceremony, with Gaga singing the national anthem.\n In addition to the broadcast, you can join virtual events organized by people all over the country to celebrate the historical day.\n Gastronomes can dine on presidential-inspired food and hear from African American leaders at the virtual event \"Presidential Soul: A Virtual Presidential Inauguration Event.\"\n Chefs from around the country teamed up to create menus inspired by President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Participants will receive recipes to create the dishes themselves, which include tequila-agave salmon and apple pie.\n Throughout the event, there will be fine arts performances and interviews with African Americans who are pioneers in their industry. One of the guests will be US Air Force Senior Master Sgt. (Retired) Wanda Joell, who was the first African American woman to be selected to serve on Air Force One.\n A portion of the proceeds will go to charity. Tickets for the event can be found here.\n The Democratic National Committee is offering an online service for people to organize and host their own virtual inauguration watch parties.\n People can fill out the form here with their online video chatting link, such as a Zoom link, and then send the invite to friends and family. The video calling link can be used to screen share the streaming of the inauguration ceremony, which will be available at this website.\n If viewers prefer to watch the inauguration on a television, they can use their video calling services to interact with others.\n History is being made on January 20, with Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first woman vice president. The DiMenna Children's History Museum in New York City is hosting an online event for children of all ages to learn about what led the US to this historic moment.\n The virtual event, which is titled \"Living History @ Home: An American First \u2014 Women and the Vice Presidency,\" walks through the history of women running for the second-highest office in the land.\n It begins in 1984 with Geraldine Ferraro, who was the first woman to run for vice president with a major American political party. After the learning portion of the event, kids can participate in a trivia game.\n You can register for the free event here.\n To cap off the day, Tom Hanks will be hosting a prime-time inauguration special called \"Celebrating America.\"\n Biden and Harris are set to give remarks during the 90-minute television special. It will also honor health care workers, teachers and other Americans who have worked tirelessly during the pandemic.\n Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and other celebrities are slated to perform.\n The program will air on CNN and other major news networks at 8:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, January 20.",

        "body_text": "The Biden administration will make domestic terrorism a significant focus of the National Security Council, a reflection of the significant threat the country is facing as it deals with the aftermath of the Capitol Hill riots, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n President-elect Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is expected to conduct an early, comprehensive assessment of the threat to develop strategies for countering it, another source familiar with the plans told CNN.\n The incoming administration is expected to make a series of early announcements of NSC personnel focused on the threat, the first source said.\n The new administration will lean on some career staff who have worked in the Trump administration, like Russ Travers as Deputy Homeland Security Adviser, who has a deep background in the topic. Travers previously served as head of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Donald Trump but was fired last March.\n Domestic extremism was already a concern for the Biden administration before January 6 but the urgency has increased since the riot, the second source added.\n Biden's pick for DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, told lawmakers Tuesday that if confirmed he'll ensure an attack like the one on the US Capitol \"will not happen again.\"\n \"The love for this country that I learned from my parents made the January 6 attack on the Capitol all the more horrifying,\" Mayorkas is expected to say, alluding to his background as an immigrant.\n \"We still have much to learn about what happened that day and what led  up to the insurrection. If I should have the honor of being confirmed, I will do everything I can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror felt by you, your  colleagues, staff, and everyone present, will not happen again,\" he added.\n News that the Biden team plans to make this a significant area of focus early on comes as DHS, the FBI and other agencies are warning that domestic extremists pose the most likely threat to the presidential inauguration, particularly those who believe the incoming administration is illegitimate.\n CNN previously reported that federal law enforcement officials are warning that domestic extremists are likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on Biden's upcoming inauguration and throughout 2021 after seeing the success of the siege on the US Capitol.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Pompeo attacks multiculturalism, saying it is 'not who America is'",
        "body_text": "With one day left in his tenure, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to his taxpayer-funded Twitter account and denounced multiculturalism, saying it is \"not who America is.\"\n \"Woke-ism, multiculturalism, all the -isms \u2014 they're not who America is. They distort our glorious founding and what this country is all about. Our enemies stoke these divisions because they know they make us weaker,\" he wrote Tuesday.\n But Pompeo himself, who is widely believed to have 2024 presidential ambitions, has stoked those very divisions with loaded rhetoric and dog whistles decrying \"wokeness\" and an American way of life \"under attack\" during protests against racial injustice and police brutality.\n The secretary of state's assertion that \"multiculturalism\" is not part of the American ethos was swiftly denounced as a shocking and racist affront to the workforce he leads, the agency he represents and the values it is meant to espouse.\n \"Unconscionable,\" one diplomat said.\n Another diplomat asked how this is supposed to make diplomats of color, or those of non-Christian backgrounds, feel.\n Career diplomat Conrad Tribble said on Twitter that multiculturalism \"is one of our greatest strengths as a country, and I go to that well often as an American diplomat. It's hard to overstate the global soft power impact of America's cultural diversity.\"\n \"We need to do a better job of representing that, not reject it,\" he said.\n \"This is a truly unfortunate and disturbing statement for the secretary of state to make at a time when the task ahead for this country it to pull all of the diverse sectors of our country together and become the 'United' States once more,\" said retired Amb. Charles Ray, who served 30 years in the foreign service and 20 in the US Army. \"It also sends a troubling message to those countries struggling with interethnic strife and dictators who exploit the ethnic and cultural divisions within their societies.\"\n The Association of Black American Ambassadors, where Ray serves as communications director, said in a statement Tuesday that \"while it was disheartening to read outgoing Secretary of State Pompeo's tweet, we are pleased to note that Secretary-designate Blinken, in his statement for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has expressed his 'commitment to having a diplomatic corps that fully represents America in all our diversity ... who look like the country we represent.'\"\n Political strategists view Pompeo's tweet as part of a push in his final days to appeal to the Trump faction of the GOP, with the outgoing top US diplomat speaking to a very specific group of Republicans who still support President Donald Trump, his anti-immigrant policies and his attacks on the so-called \"politically correct.\"\n \"He is very clearly positioning himself to be an inheritor of the Trump base. This is a message that precisely goes along with the things that the President has said,\" said GOP strategist Douglas Heye. \"When I saw this tweet I thought, well, a lot of us hoped that this administration would have stood for conservatism, but that was all thrown out the window in favor of all things Trump.\"\n The State Department did not respond when asked for an explanation of the tweet.\n Pompeo has maintained close ties to Trump throughout a tenure marred by racist and anti-democratic actions and rhetoric. From Charlottesville to the \"Muslim ban\" to the siege on the Capitol, where rioters displayed White supremacist and anti-Semitic imagery, Pompeo has never accused the President of fanning the flames of dangerous division. Pompeo denounced the January 6 insurrection itself in a series of tweets, but did not acknowledge the ties between protesters' violent actions and Trump's incitement.\n In one of his last public speeches as secretary of state, delivered to the Voice of America news service, he claimed that \"censorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction -- authoritarianism, cloaked as moral righteousness.\"\n He has repeatedly attacked the \"The 1619 Project,\" a Pulitzer Prize-winning initiative from The New York Times Magazine \"that aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.\"\n Nikole Hannah-Jones, the creator of The 1619 Project, said Pompeo's tweet proved the thesis of the project.\n \"When you say that multiculturalism is 'not who America is' and 'distorts our glorious founding' you unwittingly confirm the argument of the 1619 Project: That though we were ... a multiracial nation from our founding, our founders set forth a government of white rule. Cool,\" she wrote on Twitter, also pointing out that the Trump administration tried to censor The 1619 Project. The Trump administration's racist rebuttal to The 1619 Project from the \"1776 Commission\" was released on Monday, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.\n In a July 2020 unveiling of a report from his \"Commission on Unalienable Rights\" that purported that \"more rights does not necessarily mean more justice,\" Pompeo fanned flames of division stoked by Trump, warning that \"the very core of what it means to be an American, indeed the American way of life itself, is under attack\" amid nationwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality.\n But on the underlying issue motivating those protests, Pompeo remained largely silent. Although he called the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, \"abhorrent,\" he initially rebuffed suggestions from his staff that he address the department on the issue of racial inequality in the US or send messages of support and empathy to the department writ large.\n \"His silence is deafening,\" one diplomat told CNN at the time.\n Nor did he condemn Trump's use of force to disperse peaceful protesters outside of the White House and when asked about the message it projected to the world, particularly to repressive regimes, Pompeo scoffed at the question.\n \"I think the question is so troubling, right,\" he said, claiming that the journalist had asked \"the question assuming there is a moral equivalency between what takes place in these countries\" and the United States. He also said the incident -- which current and former diplomats called \"scary\" and \"heartbreaking\" -- was an \"incredible opportunity to tell this important story about how America confronts challenges inside its own country in a way that reflects the finest of what our founders would have hoped America could achieve.\"",

        "title": "How Parler is trying to get back online",
        "body_text": "Parler tried to seek a hosting alternative to Amazon Web Services from at least six different potential providers once it became clear Amazon would no longer work with the social media platform \u2014 but was turned away, according to a court filing.\n CEO John Matze said in Monday's filing that Parler does not have the resources to host itself on its own servers. Amazon (AMZN)'s ban forced it to seek alternative providers, he said in the filing \u2014 which is part of an ongoing lawsuit between the two companies.\n Parler is an alternative social network favored by the far right that was removed from Google and Apple's app stores, along with Amazon's cloud hosting service, in the wake of the deadly riot at the Capitol.\n Parler's website suddenly reappeared online Sunday afternoon with a message from Matze: \"Hello world, is this thing on?\"\n The message, dated January 16, marked Parler's first signs of life since being removed from Amazon's platform a week earlier. And it touched off widespread speculation over who may now be providing services to Parler, and when the app may fully regain functionality.\n In particular, Internet sleuths have increasingly zeroed in on what company Parler may be using to defend itself from distributed denial of service attacks. DDoS attacks occur when a malicious actor seeks to overwhelm a website with bogus traffic.\n When Amazon cut off Parler's service, Amazon's DDoS protections over Parler also ceased, Matze said.\n Public records suggest Parler is now using a company headquartered in Russia, DDoS-guard, to shield itself from new DDoS attacks. Parler didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n Reached for comment, DDoS-guard confirmed to CNN Business it is based in Russia, but declined to describe what specific services it is providing to Parler. DDoS-guard denied it is hosting Parler's website.\n \"We do not provide hosting services to Parler.com,\" the company said in a statement to CNN. \"Any customer can access and use our services as long as his/her activities are not prohibited in the country and do not violate any laws. ... We do not want to be involved in the political scene in any countries around the world.\"\n Though mentions of Russia tend to inspire fears of foreign meddling by spies and trolls, there is no evidence to suggest that visitors to Parler's website currently face any risks \u2014 particularly since the company's social network still remains unavailable. Still, the fact that Parler appears to be routing visitor traffic through a company headquartered in Russia is grounds for unease due to the potential for visitor information to be passed along to a foreign government, according to some cybersecurity experts.\n \"The funneling of internet traffic, which is aimed at Parler, through a service headquartered in the Russian Federation is the entire problem,\" said  Chris Vickery, an expert at the cybersecurity firm Upguard. He said the debate over who is \"hosting\" the service is a distraction.\n As Matze's filing shows, it remains unclear who may actually wind up providing the servers on which Parler's social network will run.\n Several cybersecurity experts interviewed by CNN said there currently is no Parler product of which to speak. Although Parler's website shows a static page with status messages, the overall social network, which had boasted millions of active users before Amazon's decision, remains non-functional.\n Public records reviewed by CNN showed that visitors to Parler's website are being directed to an IP address controlled by DDoS-guard.\n The public records imply DDoS-guard is at least helping to defend Parler from DDoS attacks, the cybersecurity experts said, but there is not enough evidence to determine whether DDoS-guard is providing server space and other infrastructure for the app, or if it is simply re-routing visitors to a third-party host.\n Ron Guilmette, a technologist and internet infrastructure expert, said that DDoS-guard's protections would make it very difficult to determine where the rest of Parler may be hosted.\n \"It is not possible for someone who is viewing the thing from the outside to find the 'real IP hosting address' unless the guy running the website, or the guy running the reverse proxy, wants to tell you where it really is,\" he said.",

        "title": "Walmart CEO blames 'fiction' of fraudulent election for dividing Americans",
        "body_text": "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon lamented Tuesday that the baseless claims of a stolen election pushed by President Donald Trump and his allies have further inflamed America at a time of peril.\n \"We all find ourselves in the midst of concurrent health, economic and racial equity crises as well as facing the reality of an electorate divided in large part to the fiction of a fraudulent election,\" McMillon said Tuesday during an event hosted by the Business Roundtable.\n The insurrection at the US Capitol by Trump supporters January 6 caused major companies including Walmart to rethink their political activity. Walmart (WMT) suspended contributions to the 147 Republicans who tried, unsuccessfully, to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Other major companies such as Facebook (FB) and Coca-Cola halted political contributions altogether.\n McMillon, who also serves the Business Roundtable's chairman, said it makes sense that companies are reviewing their political giving. But he suggested big business won't remain on the sidelines for long.\n \"Not participating in the process...could create other issues,\" McMillon said. \"There is still a role for business to play. We just want to do it in a thoughtful way.\"\n Asked what business can do to encourage more bipartisan behavior, McMillon said: \"Reward the centrists.\"\n Josh Bolten, the CEO of the Business Roundtable, reiterated that the group condemns the \"inexcusable violence\" at the US Capitol and called on elected officials to work toward civility.\n Pursuing policies that will help the economy \"depends on our country's recommitment to the fundamental tenets of a strong and stable democracy,\" he said.\n The Business Roundtable generally applauded Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package designed to defeat the pandemic and revive the US economy. In particular, Bolten and McMillon expressed support for Biden's proposals to spend heavily on vaccinations, sending aid to small businesses and Americans in need.\n However, business leaders sounded a cautious tone about Biden's call to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n \"$7.25 is too low,\" McMillon said, referring to the current minimum wage, which hasn't been raised since 2009. \"A thoughtful plan that raises the federal minimum wage while considering geographic differences and small business, is something that should be done.\"\n McMillon did not specify how high he thinks the minimum wage should go, nor at what pace it should be lifted. Walmart's minimum wage is $11 an hour -- higher in certain locations across the United States.\n Bolten said the Business Roundtable hopes that Congress \"will only pursue\" a minimum wage hike on a \"bipartisan basis.\"\n \"If it cannot be done on a rapid and bipartisan basis, it's not worth slowing down or impeding the urgent relief needed,\" Bolten said.\n Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to President Obama, dismissed the notion that minimum wage hikes must only be done on a bipartisan basis.\n \"There is an irony of any groups making the argument we should only make economic policy changes on a bipartisan basis,\" Goolsbee told CNN Business, \"when they're the same groups who advocated for massive $2 trillion tax cuts for corporations and high-income people on a totally partisan basis.\"\n Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package does not call for tax hikes, suggesting it will be funded mostly through borrowing. However, Biden did reiterate last week the importance of \"asking everyone to pay their fair share\" to make investments in the economy. And as a candidate, Biden supported rolling back some of the Trump tax cuts.\n Not surprisingly, the Business Roundtable opposes corporate tax hikes, arguing it would make the United States less competitive globally in the midst of the economic crisis.\n \"It would be a step backward,\" Bolten said.",

        "title": "Biden's Covid team is nervous about what the Trump team hasn't told them",
        "body_text": "With the hours dwindling until Joe Biden is sworn in -- officially taking the helm of the US government during its worst health crisis in 100 years -- a sense of nervousness has set in among those advising the incoming President on the pandemic.\n The overarching, nagging concern: \"They don't know what they don't know,\" said a source close to the Biden Covid-19 team.\n Biden is set to inherit a nation grieving hundreds of thousands of Americans who have perished from the virus, a health care system buckling under the strain of the pandemic, new variants of the disease popping up around the world and a public that is both stressed about the prospect of when they can get vaccinated, as well as dubious about whether to trust the vaccine when it's their turn in line.\n Multiple officials familiar with the transition said the lack of full cooperation and transparency from the outgoing Trump administration has contributed to Biden's Covid team feeling frustrated and concerned about having a full understanding of the scope of the problems they will confront on Day One.\n But the President-elect's team feels ready for the fight.\n \"We're not going to hide from the fact that is going to be a tremendous effort that is going to require the hard work of millions of Americans,\" said Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat on the House coronavirus subcommittee who has participated in briefings with Biden's transition team and was describing their posture coming into office. \"It's not going to be some magical solution.\"\n The President-elect understands just how much the success of his presidency will depend on his ability to get the virus under control, the source close to Biden's Covid operation said. The President-elect is anxious and focused on the pandemic right now, which looms large over Wednesday's inauguration.\n Chief among the Biden team's concerns right now is vaccine supply and turning around the lackluster distribution effort, though new strains of the virus are another persistent worry for the incoming team.\n One source familiar with the Biden effort acknowledged a major gap the incoming team will have to confront is that there is currently no effective and trustworthy line of communication between states and the federal government.\n Ramping up federal involvement in coronavirus testing and vaccine distribution starts with building up communications with each state to better understand their infrastructure and supply challenges, something that's expected to be a focus in the early days of Biden's presidency.\n States are clamoring for the federal government to release larger batches of vaccine. But it's still not clear if there will be enough vaccine available to drastically speed up the pace at which they can be distributed and administered.\n While there is optimism that additional vaccines will be soon approved for use in the United States, including the potential of a single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, there are questions about whether it can be produced fast enough to significantly address any potential supply problems.\n Foster, the Illinois congressman, said getting information from the Trump administration on delivery schedules and production progress for vaccines \"has been like pulling teeth.\"\n \"And I understand the frustration of the Biden (team), if they were seeing the same sort of resistance we saw, on not what was contracted and promised but what the actual milestones in the vaccine production are along the way,\" he added.\n Outgoing health officials in the Trump administration, meanwhile, insist they have been cooperative with the Biden team and have had hundreds of meetings with Biden's transition team.\n Still, the Biden team likely won't get a full scope of the vaccine production landscape until he takes office Wednesday.\n The President-elect's team has expressed concerns about trying to get a grasp on exactly how the vaccine distribution is playing out -- and what's slowing it down -- across all 50 states.\n Even though Biden's team is fully aware they can't federalize the vaccine distribution process with the snap of a finger, the President-elect has vowed that the federal government will play a much more aggressive role in streamlining the vaccine distribution and Covid containment efforts.\n But even when it comes to some signature promises -- like deploying the National Guard to run vaccination sites -- it will most likely fall to each state to determine what works best for them.\n New variants of the coronavirus could prove to be another vexing problem for the incoming administration.\n The worst-case scenario for Biden's team would a variant that cannot be treated by currently approved vaccines. But America's inferior screening systems for monitoring new strains of the virus, combined with the fraught relationship with the outgoing Trump administration, adds emerging variants to the thorny list of problems a Biden administration won't be able to fully tackle until he takes office.\n Containing any new variant of the disease played into the Biden team's decision to immediately throw cold water on President Donald Trump's order lifting some travel restrictions on incoming travelers from much of Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Brazil. While the outgoing President ordered those restrictions to be lifted on January 26 -- nearly a week after Biden takes office -- Biden's team said the President-elect would block the order once he's in office.\n \"With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,\" incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted Monday. \"In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\"",

Afrasiabi claimed the move would \"strike fear in the heart of [the] enemy.\"\n If convicted on both charges, Afrasiabi faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.",

        "title": "Biden announces Rachel Levine as pick for assistant secretary at HHS, would be first transgender Senate-confirmed federal official",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden has nominated Dr. Rachel Levine to serve as assistant health secretary, and she would make history as the first out, transgender federal official to be confirmed by the United States Senate, according to a statement Tuesday.\n Levine is currently the Pennsylvania health secretary and a pediatrics and psychiatry professor at Penn State College of Medicine. She served as the state's physician general in 2015 and assistant health secretary in 2017. Levine was confirmed as the state's health secretary in 2018 under Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's administration.\n Throughout her career, Levine has written about the opioid crisis, LGBTQ medicine, medicinal marijuana, eating disorders and adolescent medicine. She graduated from Harvard College and the Tulane University School of Medicine and completed her training in Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York City.\n \"Dr. Rachel Levine will bring the steady leadership and essential expertise we need to get people through this pandemic -- no matter their zip code, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability -- and meet the public health needs of our country in this critical moment and beyond,\" Biden said in a statement. \"She is a historic and deeply qualified choice to help lead our administration's health efforts.\"\n Levine said in a statement later Tuesday that she is proud of the work she did to address health and LGBTQ equity issues in the state and that she is honored to have served Pennsylvanians.\n \"I look forward to the opportunity to continue to serve Pennsylvanians, and all Americans, as part of the Biden administration if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed to this position,\" she said.\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris praised Levine as \"a remarkable public servant with the knowledge and experience\" to help contain the coronavirus pandemic and \"protect and improve the health and well-being of the American people.\"\n Levine joins other Biden administration nominees who would make history if confirmed by the Senate to serve in top roles, including California Attorney General Xavier Becerra who has been tapped to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Becerra would be the first Latino to lead the department if confirmed by the Senate.\n In December, Biden nominated former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg to be his transportation secretary. Buttigieg would be the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet secretary should his nomination make it through the chamber.\n Biden's nomination of Levine was celebrated by leading LGBTQ advocacy groups on Tuesday, including the National Center for Transgender Equality, whose executive director, Mara Keisling, said Biden has \"made clear that transgender people are an important part of our country.\"\n Levine \"has demonstrated her commitment to public service and is highly skilled. She has earned the chance to serve our country at the highest levels,\" Keisling said in a statement.\n Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, also praised Biden's pick, writing in a tweet that Levine \"has been a model for skilled and compassionate leadership during one of our nation's greatest crises.\"\n Former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Institute, also applauded Levine's nomination as \"groundbreaking\" in a statement Tuesday, adding it \"shows the Biden administration will choose the most qualified individuals to lead our nation regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\n CNN's Kate Sullivan, Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The Biden post-election market surge is the best for a new president in modern history",
        "body_text": "Stocks have gained about 13% since Election Day as of Tuesday, a day before Joe Biden's inauguration \u2014 marking the the best post-election market performance for a new president in modern history, according to CFRA Research.\n The second-biggest surge was from late 1960 to early 1961, when John F. Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon, and the S&P 500 rose 8.8%. The market continued to rally during JFK's first 100 days in office, rising another 8.9%.\n The current Biden market surge represents the second time in a row that Wall Street has cheered a new president: Stocks gained more than 6% in the election to inauguration period after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. The market gained 5% during Trump's first 100 days as well.\n But there's one major difference: Trump was inheriting an economy that was growing at a stable rate during the long, post-Great Recession recovery. Biden is walking into the Covid-19 economy.\n Investors seem hopeful that Biden, along with a Democrat-controlled House and Senate, will work with Republicans to quickly pass another stimulus bill.\n The stimulus expectations, combined with the fact that Americans are starting to receive coronavirus vaccinations, has fueled hopes that the economy -- and corporate earnings -- will improve later this year.\n To that end, the energy and financial sectors have been the best performers since the election. Oil companies should benefit from an improving economy and rising crude prices, while banks often do better when there is increased demand for loans.\n Small cap stocks have also outperformed the S&P 500, a move that makes sense considering that smaller companies have more exposure to the US economy compared to the large multinational firms that dominate the Dow and S&P 500.\n The Biden boost is also in stark contrast to how stocks performed the previous two instances a new president was coming into power during tumultuous economic times.\n The S&P 500 fell more than 6% in late 2000 and early 2001 after George W. Bush defeated Al Gore. That election was contested as well, adding to uncertainty that was already present in the market as a result of the dot-com bubble bursting earlier in 2000.\n And stocks plummeted nearly 20% from November 2008 through mid-January 2009 after Biden's former boss Barack Obama defeated the late John McCain. Investors were still extremely nervous about the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rash of high profile bank failures at the time.\n But experts say investors need to realize that market performance between the election and the inauguration is not necessarily a harbinger of things to come for the rest of the year.\n CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall noted in the report that \"the S&P 500 is overdue for a digestion of gains that could push the index value below its 2020 closing level.\"\n In other words, the rest of the year might be bumpy. But any downturns could be brief: Stovall also predicted that any market pullbacks in 2021 will be \"set early enough in the year to allow for time to recoup all losses and go on to set even higher highs.\"",

        "title": "Janet Yellen says Treasury should focus on workers, women and minorities",
        "body_text": "Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, urged Congress during her confirmation hearing Tuesday to move swiftly on bold stimulus spending to relieve the economic suffering that the pandemic has caused.\n Yellen, who would be the first female Treasury secretary in American history, underscored the urgency of Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal. With interest rates at historic lows, she said, \"the smartest thing we can do is act big.\"\n Yellen has broad bipartisan support, and Democrats are pushing to get her confirmed this week.\n Providing relief for those in the greatest need \u2014 especially minority workers and women, who have been hit hardest by the downturn \u2014 would give the government the most bang per buck. Yellen advocated for extended unemployment insurance and investing in the vaccine rollout to accelerate the recovery.\n Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, told the Senate Finance Committee at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that she would also overtime work to get an additional stimulus package passed \"to get through these dark times before the vaccination program enables us to go back to life as we knew it.\"\n Yellen also defended Biden's plans to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, saying she believed job losses would be minimal if wages went up.\n Biden last week proposed one of the largest relief packages in history in an effort to address the economic and public health crises he will inherit when he takes office Wednesday.\n \"The pandemic has caused widespread devastation,\" Yellen said in her testimony. \"The damage has been sweeping, and as the President-elect said last Thursday, our response must be, too.\"\n Lawmakers have already enacted trillions of dollars in relief funds under President Donald Trump to address the crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic. But with job losses ticking up and millions still unemployed, Biden and congressional Democrats have made clear their first legislative priority will be a wide-ranging stimulus package.\n Yellen won't relax the United States' view on China if confirmed as Treasury secretary, she told senators.\n \"China is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers, and giving away subsidies,\" she said.\n She also said China was \"guilty of horrendous human rights abuses.\" The Trump administration agrees, announcing Tuesday that China has committed crimes against humanity and genocide against Uighurs.\n \"I believe we should try to address unfair trade practices, and the best way to do that is to work with our allies rather than unilaterally,\" Yellen said.\n She added that there would be a review of current US sanctions under her leadership of the Treasury Department, to make sure they are strategic.\n She called out the need for efficient taxation of multinational companies and said that negotiations through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development would pave the way for that.\n Yellen said US firms would have to be able to be globally competitive and better taxation \"would enable us to collect a fair share from corporations while maintaining competitiveness.\"\n Yellen also said the United States does not seek a weaker currency in order to gain a competitive advantage on the global market.\n Yellen reiterated during the hearing that the first priority of the incoming administration must be to get the nation and its people through the pandemic before addressing other concerns including the deficit and taxation.\n \"We need to relieve the suffering this pandemic has caused,\" she said.\n While more deficit spending is needed and warranted for now, lawmakers will eventually think about the need for higher taxes as a way to pay for and invest in America's economic future.\n She also said the pandemic had highlighted inequality in the economy -- in particular childcare, which in turn weighs on female labor force participation and hurts economic growth.\n Yellen spoke out in favor of the Social Security and Medicare programs and told lawmakers the United States needs to \"seriously look at assessing the risks to the financial system from climate change.\"\n During the hearing, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said he hoped to confirm Yellen by this Thursday. Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican, said that he and other GOP members would \"work expeditiously.\"\n And just before Yellen's testimony on Tuesday, all living former US Treasury secretaries released called on Congress to swiftly confirm her.\n \"We believe that delaying the confirmation of our government's principal economic official would create unnecessary risk during this critical time,\" said the endorsement, signed by Republicans like Hank Paulson and John Snow as well as Democrats Robert Rubin and Larry Summers. It was released Tuesday ahead of the hearing.\n The former officials warned that the United States faces \"unprecedented economic conditions\" that will require thoughtful engagement from the Treasury Department.\n \"Any gap in its leadership would risk setting back recovery efforts,\" according to the letter, which was also signed by James Baker, George Shultz, Tim Geithner and Jacob Lew.\n Yellen, the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, has the credentials required by the crisis, the former officials said.\n \"It is our view \u2014 based on personal experience for many of us \u2014 that Dr. Yellen's experience, knowledge, judgment, and character make her uniquely qualified for this role,\" the letter said.\n The former Treasury secretaries pointed out that Yellen was previously confirmed by the Senate, most recently in 2014.\n \"It is hard to imagine a better prepared nominee to meet this great moment of need than Dr. Yellen,\" they wrote.\n The hope is that Yellen's confirmation will reassure nervous allies overseas.\n \"Any delay in confirming Dr. Yellen will only allow concern and confusion to grow among our allies,\" the letter said.\n -- CNN's Phil Mattingly and Matt Egan contributed to this report",

        "body_text": "Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving bought a house for the family of George Floyd, who died last year at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.\n Former NBA player Stephen Jackson, who was a close friend of Floyd's, discussed the gift and the outpouring of support for Floyd's 7-year-old daughter, Gianna, on \"The Rematch\" podcast.\n Floyd, who was Black, died in May after former police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes.\n Chauvin is scheduled to be tried in March on charges of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers were fired and also face charges in connection with the incident.\n Floyd's death inspired protests across the United States and all over the world.\n Jackson said he'd known Floyd since he was a teenager and said everyone called them twins.\n \"Kyrie Irving bought them a house. Lil Wayne's manager bought them a Mercedes-Benz. Barbra Streisand gave them stock in Disney, so I think God has definitely blessed her and right now she's she's doing the best she's ever done, she's happy,\" Jackson told host Etan Thomas on the podcast.\n Irving was asked about the gift Tuesday at a Nets media availability.\n \"I just want to keep continuing to fulfill our purpose in serving a lot of the underserved communities. Those don't necessarily get the same attention from just others around,\" he said. \"So just trying to do my part with service, that's all.\"\n In a statement, Jackson said Irving had been checking in on him to see what he could do.\n \"He wanted to help George's family and I let him know that a house was what they needed at that time and he made it happen in a heartbeat,\" Jackson said.\n A GoFundMe campaign for Gianna has raised more than $2.3 million and Kanye West set up a college fund for her as part of a $2 million donation to help her family and the families of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor.\n Texas Southern University has also offered her a full scholarship if she decides to attend the school.\n CNN's Kevin Dotson and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Former Trump campaign staffers worked on National Mall rally the day of the Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "After the deadly sacking of the US Capitol this month, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has insisted it had nothing to do with the National Mall rally that preceded the riot and featured a speech from the President.\n But many of the individuals who helped put on the bombastic rally that day had worked to stage other Trump rallies just a few months earlier. Ten of the 12 people listed as onsite emergency contacts on the government permit approving the January 6 rally have previously worked for or been paid by Trump's reelection campaign, according to a CNN review of Federal Election Commission records, and several worked in the Trump White House.\n The rally, billed as a \"March for Trump,\" was organized by Women for America First, a conservative nonprofit group founded by a longtime Tea Party activist. The National Park Service approved a permit for an event that the group predicted would attract 30,000 people to The Ellipse on January 6, the day Congress certified Trump's electoral defeat to President-elect Joe Biden.\n Later that day, a mob of Trump supporters -- some of whom had attended the rally -- stormed the Capitol, killing a police officer and leaving four others dead in the mayhem.\n Trump spoke at the rally, encouraging his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and airing debunked conspiracy theories about the election. Other speakers included his sons Eric and Donald Jr., his daughter-in-law Lara, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and political allies like Reps. Mo Brooks and Madison Cawthorn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n The permit shows that numerous former Trump campaign staffers were also involved in running the rally behind the scenes, although the campaign says they were acting on their own.\n Of the 12 people listed on the permit as onsite contacts, seven were on the Trump campaign's payroll during the 2020 election, according to campaign finance records -- many of whom worked in roles that involved event planning or production.\n They include Justin Caporale, the Trump campaign's director of advance and a former director of operations for first lady Melania Trump, who was listed on the permit as the project manager for the rally; Megan Powers, who worked as director of operations for Trump's campaign through January 2021, according to her LinkedIn page, and was listed as an operations manager for the rally; and Maggie Mulvaney, the niece of former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and the director of finance operations for the Trump campaign, who was listed as the rally's VIP lead.\n In addition, two other rally staffers were paid by the campaign for event consulting last year. They include Tim Unes, whose event planning company, Event Strategies, Inc., helped produce Trump rallies and has worked on numerous Republican campaigns, and who served as stage manager for the January 6 rally.\n Unes told CNN that he and his company had nothing to do with the march to the Capitol or the riot.\n \"Our job here was to work on the rally specifically on the Ellipse -- we did not have anything to do with the march,\" Unes said. \"Like any other good American, I am disgusted by what I saw of those people breaking into the Capitol.\"\n A tenth staffer, Hannah Salem, who was listed on the permit as an operations manager for the January 6 rally, was paid by the Trump campaign for event consulting in 2018 according to campaign records and also worked as Special Assistant to the President and director of press advance, according to a biography on her event management company's website. The biography said she helped plan summits between Trump and foreign dignitaries such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, the Queen of England, and Pope Francis.\n Some of the rally staffers' previous work for the Trump campaign and the White House was first reported by the Associated Press.\n Altogether, the Trump campaign paid the 10 staffers who worked on the January 6 rally more than $1.4 million in salaries, consulting fees, and reimbursements between 2015 and November 2020, according to a CNN analysis of the FEC data.\n A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that the staffers were working on their own, and that the campaign had no ties with the rally.\n \"The Trump campaign did not organize, operate or finance the event,\" campaign spokesperson Jason Miller told CNN in a text message on Monday. \"No campaign staff was involved in the organization or operation of the event. If any former employees or independent contractors for the campaign worked on this event they did not do so at the direction of the Trump campaign.\"\n Other than Unes, none of the other staffers or contractors who worked on the Trump campaign and the rally responded to requests for comment sent to emails, LinkedIn accounts, or phone numbers listed in public records.\n One person close to the organization of the rally, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share details about the event's planning, also said that the Trump campaign had not been involved. Many of the former Trump campaign staffers were junior level employees, they said.\n \"Hiring former campaign workers was really just a matter of getting the logistics done,\" the person said. \"Young campaign staffers who were let go after the election are out of work and familiar with the work ... they're kids and they don't have paychecks, that's why they were hired.\"\n The group that planned the rally, Women for America First, did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CNN. The group was founded by Amy Kremer, who previously worked as an executive of the conservative group Tea Party Express, and her daughter Kylie Jane Kremer is listed on the permit as the \"person in charge\" of the event.\n In the permit approved days before the rally, the organizers referred to the possibility of other events at the Capitol that day but said their group wouldn't be involved.\n \"Women for America First will not conduct an organized march from the Ellipse at the conclusion of the rally,\" the permit read. \"Some participants may leave to attend rallies at the United States Capitol to hear the results of Congressional certification of the Electoral College count.\"\n Other conservative figures and groups that were involved in organizing the rally have stressed that they planned a peaceful protest and have argued that they shouldn't be held responsible for the violent actions of the rioters that followed.\n \"Any suggestion that Stop the Steal participated in, led, or breached the Capitol building, itself, is defamatory and untrue,\" Ali Alexander, an organizer with the Stop the Steal group, told CNN in an email. \"We cannot control the broader public any more than Nancy Pelosi does Antifa.\"\n Meanwhile, other prominent conservative groups also helped promote the rally. The Rule of Law Defense Fund, a nonprofit associated with the Republican Attorney Generals Association, released robocalls urging supporters to march on the Capitol.\n \"At 1:00 p.m., we will march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal,\" the robocall said, according to a recording first reported by the news website Documented. \"We are hoping patriots like you will join us to continue to fight to protect the integrity of our elections.\"\n Adam Piper, the executive director of the attorneys general group, resigned last week amid controversy over the call.\n The group's chairman, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, told the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper that he had not authorized the robocalls and the group is \"engaging in a vigorous review\" of the incident.\n Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of influential conservative group Turning Point USA, tweeted two days before the rally that his organization Students for Trump was \"sending 80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president.\" He declared that the rally supporting Trump \"will likely be one of the largest and most consequential in American history.\"\n Kirk later deleted the tweet, which was saved in a snapshot on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine and was first reported by the news website The Daily Dot. A spokesperson for Turning Point Action, a political group affiliated with Turning Point USA, told CNN that Students for Trump only sent seven buses of students to the rally, and that the buses took the attendees out of the area after Trump finished speaking.",

        "body_text": "Erin Keith is a writer and social justice attorney from Detroit. Her advocacy and political commentary focus on issues of racial equity, criminal legal system reform and empowering progressive voters of color. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.\nWith the presidential inauguration approaching, in the wake of President Donald Trump being impeached yet again, some politicians have made their proverbial cry for \"unity.\" Such calls ring especially hollow given recent events.\n When I think of the word unity, I think of Queen Latifah bellowing \"U-N-I-T-YYYYY,\" in a sing-songy tone with a touch of Newark twang. When I think of unity, I think about the way Black women endearingly call each other \"sis,\" and how Black men greet each other by throwing a nod from \"across the way.\" However, one thing that notably does not come to mind is a vision of our 50 states.\n In the spirit of truth, honesty, and fairness -- principles inherently foreign to a country that could declare \"all men are created equal\" while stealing indigenous land and trading slaves -- a brief walk down memory lane will show you that my view of unity as antithetical to America is not truly my fault; it's America's. Growing up Black in this country, you learn from an early age just how divided these United States actually are.\n You see, I was still in elementary school, pledging my allegiance to our flag each morning, when I first heard the divisive \"N-word\" used as a racial slur. In middle school, when I was \"taught\" about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his admirable dream for a unified America through non-violence, I had already been educated outside of school about his broader legacy and the activism that made him a target. So, when white teachers, on the verge of tears, hailed him a hero after reading a few cherry-picked quotes, it wasn't lost on me that it was the government of these purported United States who relentlessly surveilled him and a White man in these United States who murdered him.\n There was also that year in high school when I was the unofficial Black spokesperson in my A.P. United States History course. It was quite apropos to discuss all of America's utopian ideals of unity and its divisive truths in a classroom where nearly all of my peers were White.\n My America has never felt united. Not when I learned of the Jim Crow policies that drove my grandparents North and started my family's Midwestern saga. Not in my childhood growing up in Detroit, where I observed the stark differences between the city and the suburbs past 8 Mile Road -- even the grocery stores were more plentiful and pristine. Not in my young adult years spent marching or crying for Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Breonna Taylor and the many others whose names we don't know. And certainly, not now.\n Not even a year ago, the deadly virus we are actively battling swept through our purported United States, affecting people of all backgrounds, but disproportionately decimating Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities. When that latter fact reached mainstream media, I heard the narrative shift from viewing Covid-19 as our union's \"great equalizer,\" to stories of armed extremists demanding \"freedom\" from \"oppressive\" stay-at-home mandates. \"Liberty or death,\" some protested, while standing maskless, of course. My take on the common denominator? Some of the anti-shutdown conglomerate stopped feeling as concerned that \"the bad\" and \"the deadly\" would happen to \"them\" because they weren't Black, or Latino, or Native. A few folks even went on to form a kidnapping plot against Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, for her attempt to save their lives.\n But, united we stand, right?\n Here we are. Not even a month into 2021, and domestic terrorists --which included many White nationalists -- born and bred on our own soil have already stormed the Capitol building. They struck a Capitol Police officer -- who later died from his injuries -- with a fire extinguisher. They wielded Confederate flags and zip ties, vandalized offices, stole confidential documents, and interrupted the electoral vote count. And yet, after all of this, the President of our union tells these people that he loves them. A stark contrast from the message \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" he had for protesters for Black lives last summer.\n You see, our country's biggest failure is perpetually refusing to name, claim, and confront its White supremacy problem. Instead, it makes division its convenient scapegoat and unity its go-to rallying cry. In reality, both racism and disunity are as American as apple pie.\n Our history is full of division that many Americans conveniently dismiss or romanticize as \"behind us.\" But, the loyalists and colonialists, the Confederates and Unionists, the enslavers and abolitionists, the segregationists and integrationists, aren't really that different from the modern day have-a-lots and have-nots, the \"Blue Lives\" Matter  proponents and the Black Lives Matter activists, the MAGA fascists and the rest of us.\n For centuries, there has been division on issues of morality, but the palatable, textbook versions of these conflicts seem to be preferred, along with the unity we pretend followed as soon as the \"good guys won.\" To think critically would force us to acknowledge that unity on certain issues isn't attainable when hate is on the other end of negotiations.\n So, no, I will not unify with those who explicitly believe that I am inferior and who want to cause me harm because they really hate themselves; that would be a repugnant act of self-betrayal. And, no, I don't want some politician's empty soundbite or tweet about how \"this isn't America.\" It is America. If you're surprised, it's because you've been under a rock.\n If we want to save our democracy, false unity can no longer be our principal priority. Instead, we must bask in division if it means dismantling white supremacy's stronghold on our country, as we work towards a nation where genuine unity becomes possible after righting our wrongs.\n Until then, I'll take division if it means continuously pointing out the systemic inequalities that allow people to  starve and become homeless during a pandemic, while legislators squabble over $600 chump change. I'll take division if it leads to legislators passing tax laws that force billionaires to pay real taxes. I'll take division if it leads to policy makers acting on the need for free higher education, substantial student loan forgiveness and free health care. I'll take division if it means fighting against police brutality until \"breathing while Black\" stops being a death sentence. I'll take division if it pushes the government to implement reasonable immigration policies that ensure human decency for asylum seekers. I'll take division if it leads to commonsense gun control and the end of school shootings. I'll take division if it leads to a livable minimum wage -- and in fact, I'll revel in it. In the meantime, I'll gladly bid phony unity its overdue farewell.",

        "title": "In Kenosha, a complicated conversation must go on",
        "body_text": "Denise Lockwood has covered southeastern Wisconsin for over 20 years for CNI Newspapers, Patch, the Kenosha News and the Milwaukee Business Journal. She currently owns and operates the Racine County Eye, an independent local news website. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\nIn Kenosha, the shooting of Jacob Blake sparked massive protests -- both violent and nonviolent. Shot seven times, Blake, according to officials, refused to comply with their orders while they tried to arrest him on a warrant. In the days following the shooting, the community watched as buildings burned and businesses were looted. They watched as people grieved and the nation's anger grew.\n In one of these protests, two people died after then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed them. Earlier this month, he entered a plea of not guilty just hours before a news conference in which Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced his decision not to charge either Kenosha police officer Rusten T. Sheskey for shooting Blake, or Blake for resisting arrest while possessing a knife (as Graveley said Blake himself told authorities he did). Graveley also said there would be no charges against the other two officers involved, Vincent Arenas and Brittany Meronek.\n Blake was left paralyzed from the waist down. In an interview with ABC's Michael Strahan this month, Blake said he resisted on the night of August 23 because \"I didn't want to be the next George Floyd.\"\n Explaining to reporters his decision not to bring charges, Graveley said earlier this month, \"I insist that this conversation be a complicated conversation, that it be a real conversation, not a simplistic one and that we talk accurately and thoroughly about the law and the facts.\" He's entirely correct.\n In my years reporting on crime and law enforcement, I have heard an often-used catchphrase: \"Perception is reality.\" The actions taken by Sheskey and Blake reflect the existence of what I call a \"second America\" -- neighborhoods with high crime and low resources where problems have been left to fester for decades. And when you live there, especially as a person of color, you get treated differently because your experience there is different. That's not a perception. It's a reality.\n In the context of the Jacob Blake story, this enduring conflict between perception and reality has come to mean that many people sympathize either with Jacob Blake or Kyle Rittenhouse. And for them, that's the end of the conversation -- things stall at the questions about what happened and how it could have been prevented, how many different things went wrong to culminate in a horrific, nearly-fatal moment, why Blake resisted police arresting him, whether he knew he had a warrant for his arrest and whether implicit bias played a role in how Sheskey approached Blake in the first place.\n Blake addressed some of those questions in his interview with Strahan. According to Blake, the incident began as he was leaving his son's birthday party, when an argument with his girlfriend Laquisha Booker became heated, she called 911 and police responded.\n Blake recalled, \"I'm walking out and (I hadn't) done anything, so I felt like they (the police) weren't there for me,\" he said, adding that he thought the warrant had \"been done and over.\"\n Blake said he didn't want to be on the ground, where George Floyd had been when a police officer put his knee to Floyd's neck.\n \"That's all I was thinking, honestly,\" Blake said, adding. \"I didn't want to die.\"\n His ABC interview clarified what Blake's perceptions were that night. But according to Graveley's report, Sheskey and the other officers \"knew the man who was the subject of the call, Jacob Blake, had a warrant for his arrest from a prior incident where he was charged with domestic violence offenses and a sexual assault. Every decision the officers made during this incident, in response to this call, must be interpreted in light of those facts.\"\n In a report from his interview with investigators three days after the incident (included in Graveley's report), Sheskey said the squad area where the call was located \"is known for a lot of drug and gang violence\" and alluded to a home invasion with a shooting that had taken place nearby the previous month. Sheskey also told investigators he learned of the warrant for Blake while en route to the scene. Since \"Blake would ultimately have to be arrested\" and because of \"the heavy gang activity in the area,\" Sheskey thought Blake \"would likely try to run from law enforcement.\"\n Context matters in this story, even in the absence of charges or some other form of closure. Kenosha faces problems common to other communities of color in America: poverty, unemployment, insufficient transportation options, lack of education resources and poor access to mental health services. Any police officer will tell you these conditions often set the stage for domestic disturbance calls and violence -- an issue Graveley's report discusses in detail.\n These nuances -- especially at the national level -- need to be part of a larger conversation about the problem of trust between Black Americans and law enforcement. But that trust has to be rebuilt by acknowledging how unstable many communities and families have become, facing the fallout from a crumbling Covid economy on top of years of struggle and neglect.\n Once, I reported on a gang shooting in an apartment building just blocks away from where Blake was shot in the neighborhood of Wilson Heights. A bullet went through a little girl's leg and into her mother's leg as they slept. The next day I went to the neighborhood to get comments, but residents chased me away out of what appeared to be fear that they might be labeled as snitches. Graveley, in his decision not to bring charges, surely knew how complicated it is both to live in and police neighborhoods facing these challenges.\n Jacob Blake's children will never forget seeing their father shot. Those children deserve better from all of us.\n What happened in Wilson Heights isn't unique in this country. It is not acceptable. White and privileged Americans have a role in allowing \"second America\" to persist on our watch. We do things like send our children to private schools instead of advocating to make public schools better. We vote for officials who will allocate more dollars to the police to \"keep us safe,\" but also spend little on resources or social support mechanisms for those who live in communities where they are at risk. Too many of us back the badge over Black Lives Matter when it should never be a choice in the first place. This is not an either/or decision. It's an and.\n But too many of those same people continue to dispute that systemic racism exists, even when confronted with data that tells us otherwise. Look at it. It's there. You see it in disparate school disciplinary actions, graduation rates, wages, infant mortality statistics and even health care access. And I'm sure someone reading this will send me an email about how I'm wrong, that this is a lazy people problem, that racism is a hoax, and if \"they only got a job and raised their kids right, things would be just fine.\"\n No. It's not fine.\n If we genuinely want to see a reduction in officer-involved shootings, we need to take a good hard look at how we patrol these communities. We need to ask ourselves why people are jailed, how bail and bond work, who is allowed to have work release and who is not, and we need to look at who is allowed into things like drug courts, which provide sentencing alternatives such as drug treatment for people living with addiction and mental health disorders.\n I fear that Kenosha will remember only their version of the story. Buildings will be rebuilt. The boards on the buildings have come down. Businesses have reopened. There was no violence in the streets after Graveley announced his decision. But the racism, anger and the feelings of powerlessness will not leave this community or this country until we accept our role in creating two Americas.",

        "body_text": "The FBI on Monday alerted other law enforcement agencies that QAnon adherents discussed acting as National Guard soldiers in Washington to try and infiltrate President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, according to The Washington Post.\n The FBI, in an intelligence report obtained by the Post, said it monitored individuals downloading maps of sensitive areas around Washington and talking about how those locations could be utilized to penetrate security, the Post reported.\n The intelligence report warned that QAnon members and \"lone wolves\" indicated they plan to travel to Washington for Biden's swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday, the Post said.\n \"But the intelligence briefing did not identify any specific plots to attack the inaugural events\" that would be similar to the January 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, which some QAnon members participated in, the Post said.\n The FBI noted that it detected \"suspicious traffic\" on the communication systems used by some participants in the January 6 Capitol attack -- but \"nothing that points to any specific action,\" according to the Post.\n The newspaper said the FBI declined to \"characterize the credibility or gravity of the threats it outlined\" in its briefing report.\n Asked for comment Tuesday, the FBI pointed CNN to remarks made by FBI Director Christopher Wray last week in which he said the FBI is monitoring an \"extensive amount of concerning online chatter\" surrounding the inauguration and noted that \"one of the real challenges in this space is trying to distinguish what is aspirational and what is potential.\"\n \"We're monitoring all incoming leads -- whether calls for armed protests, potential threats that grow out of the January 6th breach of the Capitol or other kinds of potential threats leading up to Inaugural events and various other targets,\" Wray said.\n The Secret Service also declined to comment to the Post about the FBI's threat report, but told the newspaper that it \"takes all threats seriously and will continue to work with our federal, state, local and military partners to continue securing the 59th Inauguration based on the relevant intelligence available to the security community.\"\n CNN previously reported that the FBI is vetting the thousands of National Guard troops providing security at the inauguration ahead of their arrival in Washington in order to prevent any insider threats, and the US Army is working with the Secret Service to determine if there are soldiers who require additional background screening.\n Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller said Monday that there is \"no intelligence indicating an insider threat\" to Biden's inauguration, adding, \"we are leaving no stone unturned in securing the capital.\"\n \"The DC National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in D.C. that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command,\" Miller said in his statement Monday.\n In the wake of the Capitol insurrection earlier this month, there has been a massive security presence in Washington for Biden's inauguration, with more than 20,000 National Guard troops expected in the city to help secure the event.\n CNN's Jessica Schneider, Zachary Cohen and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Five of President-elect Joe Biden's national security Cabinet nominees will face Senate panels on Tuesday in the first step of the confirmation process.\n The day before Biden takes office, his nominees for secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, director of national intelligence, defense secretary and secretary of Homeland Security will appear before Senate committees to be considered for their respective roles.\n Biden is set to take office on Wednesday without key members of his Cabinet in place, as the Republican-controlled Senate has moved more slowly to schedule confirmation hearings for his nominees than it has for previous presidents.\u00a0But the timeline for confirming Biden's nominees could accelerate in the coming days, when Democrats take control of the Senate.\n Biden's Cabinet confirmation hearings could run up against the Senate's impeachment trial of outgoing President Donald Trump -- timing for which has not yet been scheduled -- and as Biden attempts to push through Congress his $1.9 trillion coronavirus vaccine and economic stimulus proposal.\n 10 a.m. ET: Janet Yellen will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to be considered for treasury secretary.10 a.m. ET: Avril Haines will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to be considered for director of national intelligence. 10 a.m. ET: Alejandro Mayorkas will appear before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to be considered for secretary of Homeland Security.\u00a02 p.m. ET: Antony Blinken will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be considered for secretary of state. 3 p.m. ET: Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee to be considered for secretary of defense.\n Tune in to CNN or CNN International to watch live coverage of the hearings or watch on mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android, and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast, Android TV and SamsungTV. You can also follow CNN's live coverage on CNN.com.\n You can watch the hearings on the Senate committees' websites too:\n Yellen - Senate Finance Committee Haines - Senate Intelligence Committee Mayorkas - Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs CommitteeBlinken - Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeAustin -  Senate Armed Services Committee\n Yellen was the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve, serving from 2014 to 2018. She would make history as the first woman to be treasury secretary if confirmed by the Senate. Yellen previously served for four years as the vice chair of the board, and president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for four years prior to that. She was also chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999.\n Haines served as assistant to the president and principal deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama. She chaired the National Security Council's Deputies Committee, which is responsible for formulating the administration's national security and foreign policy. She would become the first woman to be director of national intelligence if confirmed by the Senate.\n Haines previously served as the deputy director of the CIA. She was also legal adviser to the National Security Council. She served as deputy chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee while Biden was chairman.\n Mayorkas was deputy secretary of Homeland Security during the Obama administration and served as the director of the Department of Homeland Security's US Citizenship and Immigration Services. He would be the first Latino and immigrant to be secretary of Homeland Security if confirmed by the Senate.\n While at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mayorkas oversaw the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was an executive action under Obama that protected young undocumented immigrants who had come to the US as children from deportation. Trump moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2017 but was ultimately blocked by the Supreme Court from doing so.\n Blinken served in the Obama administration as the deputy secretary of state, assistant to the president and principal deputy national security adviser. He was the national security adviser to then-Vice President Biden and deputy assistant to the president during Obama's first term. He has been a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and was the Democratic staff director at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n During the Bill Clinton administration, Blinken served as a member of the National Security Council staff at the White House and held roles as the special assistant to the president, senior director for European affairs and senior director for speechwriting and then strategic planning. He was Clinton's chief foreign policy speechwriter.\n Austin, a retired Army general, is a former commander of the US Central Command. He would make history as the first Black person to lead the Pentagon if confirmed by the Senate. Austin would need a congressional waiver to be confirmed for this civilian post because federal law requires seven years of retirement from active duty before taking on the role, and he retired from active-duty service only four years ago. He has worked closely with Biden in the past.\n While Biden was vice president, Austin served as the vice chief of staff of the Army and commanding general of US forces in Iraq, and later the commander of CENTCOM. Biden and Austin had discussions on a range of issues, including those in the Middle East and Central and South Asia.\n Aides have told CNN it is possible the Senate moves as soon as Wednesday, hours after Biden is sworn in, to confirm some of these nominees to their posts.\n Democrats will take control of the Senate in the coming days after winning two Senate runoff elections earlier this month in Georgia. A Democratic-led Senate will be able to confirm Cabinet nominations without Republican support.\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to act as a tie-breaking vote in a chamber made up of 50 Republican and 50 Democratic senators, effectively giving Democrats control.\n Biden wants swift confirmation of all of his Cabinet nominees, particularly his national security ones, but the Senate may soon be preoccupied with an impeachment trial and working on a coronavirus relief package.\n The House of Representatives voted last week to impeach Trump for the second time.\n Talks are ongoing between incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the offices of current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about what makes the most sense for the timing of the trial.\n Biden has said he wants to split the day in half to allow his nominees to be confirmed in the morning ahead of the Senate trial, but that takes agreement from everyone.\n The President-elect has also outlined for Congress to consider a $1.9 trillion legislative package to fund his nationwide vaccination effort and provide direct economic relief to Americans who are struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n The American Rescue Plan calls for investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program, including launching community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units in difficult-to-reach areas. It would also increase federal support to vaccinate Medicaid enrollees.\n The proposal includes $1,400 stimulus checks, more aid for the unemployed, those facing food shortages and those facing eviction. It includes more money for child care and child tax credits, additional support for small businesses, state and local governments, and increased funding for vaccinations and testing.\n CNN's Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

        "title": "New York state court employee charged after allegedly threatening to kill several Democratic Congress members",
        "body_text": "Brendan Hunt, who goes by \"X-Ray Ultra\" on social media and his personal website, posted several times on various social media sites since December saying that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, US Sen. Charles Schumer and US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should be killed, and even called for a public execution, according to the complaint.\n \"And if you dont do it, the citizenry will,\" Hunt allegedly said in a Facebook post on December 6. \"We're not voting in another rigged election. Start up the firing squads, mow down these commies, and lets (sic) take america back!\"\n The complaint identifies Hunt as a part-time actor and filmmaker and a full-time employee of the New York State Office of Court Administration.\n New York State Unified Court spokesman Lucian Chalfen confirmed to CNN that Hunt worked as an assistant court analyst in the Attorney Registration Unit. He will be suspended without pay pending further administrative action, Chalfen said.\n Hunt, of Queens, New York, is also the son of New York City Family Court Judge John M. Hunt, Chalfen said.\n The complaint does not say if Brendan Hunt attended the Capitol riot on January 6.\n He was arrested Tuesday morning and in federal court was ordered to be detained until trial due to the \"nature and circumstance of the offense,\" a magistrate judge ruled.\n The charge comes amid heightened security in Washington, DC and at state capitols across the country as law enforcement officials have warned of the potential for violent unrest leading up to and on Inauguration Day, particularly among some hard-right extremists who falsely believe Joe Biden's election is illegitimate.\n Hunt allegedly advocated for just that. On January 8, two days after the takeover at the Capitol, he allegedly posted a video to the website BitChute titled \"KILL YOUR SENATORS\" that allegedly shows him speaking to the camera.\n \"We need to go back to the U.S. Capitol when all of the Senators and a lot of the Representatives are back there\" and \"slaughter these m*therf**kers,\" Hunt said, according to the complaint.\n \"[O]ur government at this point is basically a handful of traitors ... So what you need to do is take up arms, get to D.C., probably the inauguration ... so called inauguration of this m*therf**king communist Joe Biden ... [T]hat's probably the best time to do this, get your guns, show up to D.C., and literally just spray these m*therf**kers ... like, that's the only option.\"\n In federal court Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kessler argued as reasons for his detainment that Hunt is a flight risk and has limited ties to the community, as well as a history of mental illness.\n His attorney Leticia Olivera said he has no criminal record and is not a member of any militias or paramilitary groups.\n \"Without seeking to undermine the seriousness of the allegations in the complaint, there is no allegation here that Mr. Hunt has a history of abuse or ownership of weapons,\" Olivera said. \"He has no plans to travel to Washington, DC, to purchase weapons or to actually even come into contact with any federal officials much less anything that could cause them physical harm.\"\n Olivera declined to comment any further to CNN on the case.\n CNN's Brynn Gingras and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

        "title": "5 ways Biden plans to reset health care after Trump",
        "body_text": "Strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Restore abortion protections. Lower drug prices.\n President-elect Joe Biden has a long list of health care promises -- many of which center on reversing policies enacted by the Trump administration over the past four years.\n Also, lawmakers have yet to confirm Xavier Becerra, Biden's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, and the President-elect has yet to name his administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who will play a central role in putting his agenda into place.\n Among the top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of Republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the Trump administration. It revolves around Congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.\n As for shoring up and building on the Affordable Care Act, Biden has plans big and small.\n But there are many measures that would be an easier lift. They could restore the annual open enrollment period to three months, which it was before the Trump administration cut it to six weeks. And they could increase funding for marketing and enrollment assistance, both of which were deeply slashed in recent years. And they could pull back on allowing private brokers to advise consumers looking for policies, which Trump officials pushed.\n Somewhat more involved would be reversing various measures the Trump administration put in place to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. These include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing Georgia to stop using the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.\n Biden may also want to institute a special enrollment period for Obamacare to allow the uninsured to sign up, which Trump refused to do last year.\n The Supreme Court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.\n These measures run counter to Biden's promise to expand access to Medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.\n Also, Congress has limited states' ability to trim their Medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. The Biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.\n Biden has promised to revoke the Trump administration rule blocking federally funded health care providers in the Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions.\n The President-elect has also vowed to reverse the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on US government funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions or related services. The Trump administration reinstated the restriction in 2017 by presidential memorandum and extended it to all applicable US global health funding under the \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy.\n On the health insurance front, the incoming administration is expected to reinstitute guidance that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that also provide abortion-related services, such as Planned Parenthood. Medicaid funding does not cover abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is at risk, due to the 1976 Hyde Amendment.\n Biden has pledged to protect Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy. He has also indicated that his administration's Justice Department will seek to combat state laws restricting abortion access, such as requirements for parental notification, waiting periods, and ultrasounds.\n Biden appears unlikely to enforce a recent move by Trump officials to withhold $200 million in Medicaid funding from California in the first quarter of 2021 due to the state's requirement that state insurance companies provide abortion insurance coverage.\n The administration is also not expected to pursue Trump-era federal regulations that have been blocked by the courts, including measures that would have required insurers on the Obamacare exchanges that cover abortions to issue separate bills for that coverage, and the so-called conscience rule, which would have let health care workers who cite moral or religious reasons opt out of providing certain medical procedures, such as abortion, sterilization and assisted suicide.\n The Trump administration pushed through the bevy of drug price rules in recent months, including pegging Medicare reimbursements to drug costs in other countries, effectively banning drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers and establishing a path for states to import medication from abroad. Drug industry groups have already filed litigation against the first two and Canada has expressed its disapproval of the final one.\n It remains to be seen what Biden's Department of Health and Human Services will do with them.\n Biden also supports allowing consumers to import prescription drugs from other countries.\n With the rule still in place, Biden could try to reinforce it by issuing a new, more targeted rule that specifically prohibits that type of discrimination, going a step further than the department did in its 2016 regulation.\n The incoming administration has also promised to take action on LGBTQ mental health services, something that will be key for members of the transgender community, which sees uniquely high rates of suicide attempts.",

        "title": "Biden to propose sweeping immigration bill on first day in office",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden will unveil a comprehensive immigration plan on his first day in office, a source familiar with the proposal tells CNN, describing an agenda that provides a multi-year pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.\n The plan, which also would aim to address the root cause of migration from countries in Central America and improve the use of technology at the border, will be sent to Congress on Wednesday, shortly after Biden is inaugurated, the source said.\n Biden promised during the campaign that he would make immigration reform a priority as president, a move that ran directly counter to the anti-immigration rhetoric and action that defined President Donald Trump's four years in office. The President-elect also received pressure from immigration groups throughout the campaign, many of whom worried that the deportation that happened during the Obama presidency would continue in the Biden administration.\n The central tenet of Biden's plan is the pathway to citizenship, which would allow certain undocumented immigrants to achieve citizenship within eight years. The plan, according to the source, would give certain immigrants temporary status for five years, allow them to apply for green cards after that time and once they have met certain criteria, then allow them to apply for citizenship three years later.\n For recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- so-called Dreamers who were protected under a program first started by President Barack Obama -- the pathway would be streamlined, allowing them to apply for a green card immediately.\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris recently described the soon-to-be released immigration plan in an interview with Univision.\n \"It will be about creating a pathway for people to earn citizenship. We're going to reduce the time from what is now has been currently 13 years to eight years. We are going to expand protections for Dreamers and DACA recipients. \"These are some of the things that we're going to do on our immigration bill. And we believe it is a smarter and a more humane way of approaching immigration.\"\n The plan, which was first reported by the Washington Post, would also require immigrants to have been in the United States by the start of 2021, a decision made to stop any mass migration to the US-Mexico border.\n Trump made immigration one of the central tenets of his presidential bid, pledging to build a wall along the US-Mexico border as a way to curb undocumented immigrants from coming to the United States. While some of the wall has been built, Trump's actions have failed to live up to his words and he leaves office with only a handful of immigration accomplishments to tout.\n The likelihood of a sweeping immigration bill passing Congress is an open question. Previous attempts, like the concerted pushed to pass an immigration bill in 2013, failed, and the Republican Party now includes more immigration hardliners after four years under Trump.\n \"I would be privileged to work with Congress to pass immigration reform legislation that provides that path and provides a permanent solution to what is clearly a broken system,\" Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, told senators on Tuesday.\n This immigration plan will not be Biden's only action taken on the issue at the outset of his administration. Incoming chief of staff Ron Klain wrote in a memo over the weekend that Biden will begin the process of reunifying the families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border within his first ten days in office, and sources familiar with Biden's plans anticipate he will also issue an executive order aimed at halting the construction of Trump's border wall and reinstating the DACA program.",

        "title": "Washington state announces partnership with companies including Starbucks and Microsoft to boost vaccinations",
        "body_text": "Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee announced on Monday a series of new efforts to help boost the state's Covid-19 vaccinations, including partnerships with companies like Starbucks and Microsoft.\n Inslee revealed in a news conference the state has established a \"public private partnership\" between the health department and other business, health care and labor leaders, dubbed the \"Washington State Vaccine Command and Coordination Center.\"\n Members in the partnership will focus on different aspects of vaccine distribution, the governor said, and will \"coordinate all available resources to administer more vaccines in the state of Washington in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\"\n Kaiser Permanente, for example, will be responsible for helping plan for mass vaccination clinics, while Starbucks will help with operational efficiency.\n \"Now, we are not a health care company,\" Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson said during the news conference. \"But Starbucks does operate 33,000 stores at scale, serving 100 million customers a week and we have a world class team of human-centered design engineers who are working under the direction of the state and health care providers ... to help support the creation of vaccination centers that can scale and ... amplify the comfort, care and safety of every person who gets vaccinated.\"\n Microsoft President Brad Smith said they will provide technology expertise, adding he has \"confidence that we can bring vaccines to everyone faster because of this initiative.\"\n Smith added that since the company's buildings don't all have employees because of the pandemic, they will partner with local hospitals to set up vaccine administrations on their campus and provide support staff.\n \"The goal is to make this, in February, one of the mass vaccination sites,\" Smith said, clarifying that \"this is not going to be a site for Microsoft employees, this is going to be a site for people in the community.\"\n Other stakeholders in the coalition include Costco, which will help with vaccine delivery by pharmacies, as well as employee unions to help coordinate volunteer vaccinators.\n \"This is a huge undertaking -- no one can do it alone,\" Dr. Umair Shah, secretary of the state's health department said in a statement.\n \"Together, with the measures Governor Inslee and others have announced, we pledge to make the forward progress the people of Washington deserve to get COVID-19 under control and protect everyone with this life-saving vaccine,\" Shah said.\n Among other new efforts, the governor said \"effective immediately,\" people 65 and older and people 50 and older who live in a multigenerational households will now be eligible to receive the vaccine.\n \"The reason for this is clear,\" he said during a news conference. \"About 80% of all Covid deaths in the state of Washington have occurred to individuals who are 65 and older. So, our vaccine prioritization obviously reflects the need to protect these most vulnerable Washingtonians.\"\n Inslee said the state will also establish mass vaccination sites with the help of the National Guard and has also launched a new Phase Finder -- an online tool that helps residents determine their eligibility for Covid-19 vaccinations.\n Following the announcement, the state's health department announced so many residents were visiting the tool that officials were \"getting reports that it's crashing for some folks.\"\n Health officials urged residents on Twitter to \"keep trying\" to access the tool and try taking a break and coming back \"a bit later.\"\n \"We're heartened by the sheer number of people in Washington who have logged on to 'find their phase' using our tool -- this overwhelming interest demonstrates that, collectively, people are ready to get their #CovidVaccine and help us end the #COVID19 pandemic as soon as possible,\" the department wrote on Twitter.\n Inslee says the goal is to eventually be vaccinating 45,000 residents daily. That goal, he said, is higher than the state's current vaccine allocation by the federal government by \"several fold.\"\n \"We want to establish an ambitious goal of building capacity to vaccinate 45,000 people and the reason for this is we always want our capacity for vaccinations ... to match or exceed the number of doses we actually are getting from the federal government,\" he added.",

        "body_text": "The United States ambassador to Uganda was blocked by Ugandan security forces from visiting presidential candidate Bobi Wine on Monday.\n Wine -- a singer-turned-politician, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi -- has been under house arrest after the military surrounded his home on Friday.\n Uganda's longtime leader President Yoweri Museveni was declared winner for a record sixth term, amid an internet blackout and allegations of rigging.\n Ambassador Natalie E. Brown went to Wine's resident to check on his health and safety, because he has \"effectively been unable to leave his home, with security forces surrounding his residence,\" the embassy in Kampala said in a Facebook post.\n \"Uganda's election campaigns were marred by the harassment of opposition candidates, campaign staff, and supporters; suppression of the media and civil society organization activities; and a nationwide internet shutdown before, during, and after voting day,\" the post said.\n Speaking through one of his associates, Wine said he had run out of food and that Brown was unable to leave any with him.\n \"The main motivation for us to keep doing what we're doing in the face of all of this intimidation is because what we are doing is moral,\" he said in an audio message posted on Twitter on Monday.\n The 18-month old niece of Wine's wife, Barbara Itungo Kyagulanyi, is in the residence and her father has been denied access because nobody is allowed to leave or come into the compound, Wine said on Twitter.\n Wine rejects Saturday's election results, saying he has evidence of fraud and intimidation. He did not provide details of that alleged evidence, saying his team would share it when communications lines were restored.\n CNN has not received a response to requests for comment from the Ugandan government.\n Uganda's government spokesman, Ofwono Opondo, wrote in an opinion piece that Brown shouldn't \"cry for Ugandans.\"\n \"For Natalie to cast doubt that elections wouldn't be 'credible' merely because the US embassy had voluntarily pulled out of observation, is aimless shooting,\" he said in the piece, which he posted on his Twitter page.\n If US democracy was unassailable, Brown should first note President Donald Trump's false election fraud claims and the Capitol riot, he added.\n \"As of now, Natalie should be the last person giving unqualified lectures on election integrity.\"\n The US decided not to observe the elections due to the electoral commission's decision to deny more than three-quarters of its accreditation requests, said Brown in a statement on Wednesday, a day ahead of the elections.\n The embassy called on Museveni's government to respect its citizens' \"human rights and fundamental freedoms\" and to \"uphold international human rights standards.\"",

When she landed, she was given another Covid-19 test, which came back negative, and she was told to remain in isolation for two weeks. Instead, she decided to attend her Ramgeet's competition, two days later. Race attendees, who knew Mack, reported her breach of isolation and officials arrested her.\n In her interview with \"Good Morning America,\" Mack said breaking the quarantine rules was a \"selfish decision.\"\n \"I would have never been able to live with myself, knowing that I could have been the reason that somebody could have even just been sick. It eats me up,\" Mack said on GMA.\n CNN's Tina Burnside, Leah Asmelash, Jennifer Deaton and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump leaves America at its most divided since the Civil War",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump ends his tumultuous presidency with the nation confronting the greatest strain to its fundamental cohesion since the Civil War.\n The January 6 assault on the US Capitol capped four years in which Trump relentlessly stoked the nation's divisions and simultaneously provided oxygen for the growth of White nationalist extremism through his open embrace of racist language and conspiracy theories.\n In the process, Trump has not only shattered the barriers between the Republican Party and far-right extremists but also enormously intensified a trend that predated him: a growing willingness inside the GOP's mainstream to employ anti-small-d-democratic means to maintain power in a country demographically evolving away from the party.\n The result has been to raise the stakes in the ideological polarization of the parties that has been reshaping American politics for decades.\n Particularly since the 1990s, the parties have steadily pulled apart, with Republicans rallying the voters who are most uneasy with the way America is changing demographically, culturally and economically and Democrats mobilizing those most comfortable with the changes.\n The Trump presidency, especially its chaotic final months, has shown that both the leaders and rank-and-file voters of the parties are now divided not only by their policy preferences but also by their assessments of the nation's underlying realities, and even their commitment to the traditional norms of democracy.\n In one sense, the two parties are moving away from each other in mirror image: Vast majorities of voters in each party now say in polls that they view the other side as a threat to the nation's future.\n But that assessment is provoking a more extreme reaction inside the GOP than among Democrats, as different elements of the Republican coalition have embraced a succession of anti-democratic actions culminating in the widespread support among GOP elected officials for Trump's efforts to subvert the November election and in last week's unprecedented assault on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n All of this is unfolding against the backdrop of a pandemic that has staggered the economy, plunged millions of families into financial peril, overwhelmed America's health care system and widened the nation's political divisions -- as Republican-leaning jurisdictions, partly because of pressure from Trump, have resisted the measures, like masking, that public health professionals consider crucial.\n Coalescing at the transition point between the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, these pressures have produced a level of internal division and cracks in the constitutional order that most experts agree exceeds even the unrest of the 1960s -- and probably has only one full parallel in American history.\n \"It is pretty clear that this is the worst since the Civil War, and I say that without difficulty,\" says Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz, the author of \"The Rise of American Democracy,\" a monumental history of America's development in the 19th century. \"And on top of that, what happened on the 6th was the saddest day for American democracy since April 12, 1861.\"\n That was the day Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, beginning the Civil War.\n Few experts anticipate a reprise of that experience: a formal attempt at dissolving the nation accompanied by widespread armed conflict (even if they aren't quite as quick to dismiss the possibility as a few years ago). For one thing, today's lines of political conflict wouldn't allow as neat a division as the sectional North-South split over slavery in the Civil War: Our modern Mason-Dixon line separates Democratic-leaning metropolitan centers from red rural and small-town areas in every state, an impractical pattern for any actual separation.\n Susan Stokes, a political scientist who directs the Chicago Center on Democracy at the University of Chicago, notes that civil wars typically also require a split in the armed forces or the emergence of a full-scale rebel army, dynamics not yet evident in America.\n And Stokes, Wilentz and others point out that, for all of the pressure Trump imposed, the November 3 election and its aftermath demonstrated enormous resiliency in our political system, with voter turnout soaring to a record level despite the pandemic and courts and local election officials -- including Republicans in each case -- rejecting the President's groundless claims of fraud.\n \"Let's not forget we had the largest national election in American history amid the pandemic and it went off without a hitch,\" says Wilentz. \"November 3 was a day that will not in infamy but will live in fame for the exercise of democracy, and we ought not to forget that. There's a lot of strength in the system.\"\n To most experts, all of these mitigating factors make it extremely unlikely that America will follow the path of modern countries that collapsed into full-on civil war, like Yugoslavia after communism, Spain before World War II or Latin American nations during the 1980s. But a few years ago, those comparisons would have been unthinkable, and raising them now, even to dismiss them, underscores the fractures in our political structure.\n \"I think we are a long way from choose your outright civil war: We're not Yugoslavia; we're not Spain,\" says Stokes. \"But we are definitely in danger of a kind of a lower-level violence, decentralized because that's our country's middle name, constant outbreaks, for years to come.\"\n These pressures emerge from the convergence of two tectonic developments in American politics, one long-gestating, the other more recent.\n The longer-term process is the ideological separation of the two parties, a process that I called \"the great sorting out\" in my 2007 book, \"The Second Civil War.\" For most of American history, our political parties have been ramshackle coalitions of disparate ideological views. But starting in the 1960s, and accelerating since the 1990s, conservatives (especially Southern evangelical Whites and Northern working-class Whites) have migrated out of the Democratic Party, while moderates and liberals (especially college-educated Whites and secular voters) have migrated out of the Republican coalition.\n This process has both encouraged -- and been accelerated by -- the development of overtly partisan media since the 1980s, which has allowed voters on each side to retreat from a shared set of understandings about the nation's condition. The rise of social media in this century has only intensified the withdrawal from shared experience.\n All of this has narrowed the differences within each party's coalition but widened the distance between them. Both among elected officials and voters, a huge chasm now separates the parties on almost all major issues. The distance is especially foreboding on attitudes toward the big structural changes remaking American life, culturally, demographically and economically.\n Republicans now dominate among the voters who polls show are most uneasy about those changes -- particularly Whites who are non-urban, identify as evangelical Christians or lack college degrees.\n In recent polling by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, a larger share of Republicans say Whites and Christians face significant discrimination than say the same about Blacks and Hispanics; more than three-fourths of Republicans say the values of Islam are incompatible with American values; three-fifths say American society punishes men just for acting like men; and nearly three-fifths agree with the harshly worded statement that \"immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background.\"\n Democrats in the poll were far less likely to agree with any of those propositions. That reflects the composition of their competing coalition, which revolves around the groups generally most comfortable with the emerging America: people of color, young people, secular adults who don't identify with any religious tradition, and college-educated White voters, particularly women.\n This demographic divide has widened the geographic separation between the parties. The GOP has been virtually exiled from the fast-growing metro areas that are driving population growth and economic dynamism: While George H.W. Bush won 57 of the nation's 100 largest counties as recently as 1988, Trump carried just 9 of the 100 largest in November, struggling not only in heavily minority central cities but also in prosperous, well-educated inner suburbs.\n Simultaneously, the GOP has solidified its control of the nation's more uniformly White exurban, small-town and rural regions: While Bill Clinton won about half of the nation's counties in his 1992 and 1996 presidential wins, Biden carried only about one-sixth of American counties, even while comfortably winning the popular vote.\n In Congress, these hardening lines of division have made it much more difficult for presidents in either party to secure meaningful cooperation from the other; the parties now vote in lockstep against each other much more routinely than in earlier generations.\n At the grassroots level, this separation has seeded rising reciprocal antagonism. In the Public Religion Research Institute polling, about four-fifths of Democrats say the Republican Party has been taken over by racists, while a virtually identical share of Republicans say the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists. Pew polling before the election found that an even higher percentage -- roughly 9-in-10 on each side -- said that if the other party's presidential candidate won in November, it would produce \"lasting harm\" to the nation.\n This is an unusually pitched level of political antagonism, and it has unquestionably made it more difficult for Washington to make progress on big problems. But as Wilentz notes, in a country as diverse as America, \"there are always tons of divisions.\"\n And while those divisions have contributed to dysfunction in Congress, they had not until recently raised real questions about America's underlying political stability. Those doubts have emerged only since the long-standing polarization of the parties has been reinforced by a more recent second factor: the increasing willingness of the Republican Party to employ extreme and anti-democratic tactics to maintain power.\n This pattern has gathered momentum for years but it's tremendously accelerated since Trump's emergence as the party's leader. Signposts of this shift have come steadily over the past decade: the wave of voter identification and other laws in Republican states making it tougher to vote after the GOP's gains in the 2010 election; the 2013 party-line Shelby County decision by Republican appointees on the Supreme Court to gut the Voting Rights Act; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's unprecedented machinations in 2016 to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a Supreme Court justice who would have tipped the majority to liberals; and the congressional Republican acquiescence to Trump's regular threats to the rule of law, from openly extorting the government of Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Biden to attempting, for the first time in American history, to tilt the census results to the advantage of one party.\n The widespread Republican support for Trump's efforts to steal the election -- which persisted to the point of a majority of House Republicans voting to overturn the results even after the mob of his supporters ransacked the Capitol -- has placed a dramatic exclamation point on this retreat from democracy in the GOP, many experts agree.\n \"Fifty years from now when people read about [this era] they are not going to say there were two parties that were small-d democratic,\" says Stokes. \"They are going to say that this is a political party that was captured by autocrats, by not-democratic people.\"\n To Stokes, the Republican focus on alleged fraud in the 2020 election \"is sort of a big distraction\" from the underlying change that's reshaping the party. While the mass of Trump followers might accept his allegations of fraud, she notes, those claims have been disproved so thoroughly it's hard to imagine that they are believed by many of the party leaders joining his efforts to overturn the election. And that points to a deeper, and darker, meaning for the post-election maneuvering among Republican senators, House members and state attorneys general to subvert the results.\n \"Pretty clearly they are not really democrats,\" she says, referring to believers in democracy, not the opposing political party. \"They are people who think they should win no matter what. I almost want to say to them: Why don't you have the courage of your convictions and explain to us why the United States should not be a democracy now? Because what they are really saying is that no matter what happens, Trump needs to stay in power.\"\n These efforts have found widespread support among Republican voters, with three-fourths or more of them routinely telling pollsters they believe the election was stolen and a majority in last week's ABC/Washington Post survey saying GOP leaders should have done even more to try to overturn the result. Those attitudes bring to a point years of surveys showing a retreat from democratic values in a significant portion of the GOP base.\n In one recent Public Religion Research Institute study, for instance, nearly three-fifths of Republicans agreed that \"because things have gotten so far off track in this country, we need a leader who is willing to break some rules if that's what it takes to set things right.\" In another national survey organized by political scientist Larry Bartels, a majority of Republican voters agreed \"the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\"\n Many analysts believe these attitudes are inextricably linked to the anxieties about demographic and cultural change evident among GOP voters in the polling by the Public Religion Research Institute and others: At its core, the fear of demographic eclipse is eroding the commitment to democracy among both leaders and followers in the Republican Party. As Bartels, now at Vanderbilt University, noted in his paper, \"The strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism\u2014especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans, and Latinos.\"\n Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections, something no party had done since the formation of the modern party system in 1828. And, according to calculations by Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a centrist think tank, if you allocate half of each state's population to each senator, GOP senators have represented a majority of the population only once in the past 40 years despite controlling the actual Senate majority about half of that time. (Today Republicans hold exactly half the Senate seats while representing only about 44% of the population, Drutman calculates.)\n The determination to continue exercising majority power while attracting support from only a minority of the population, many experts agree, is the force that has pushed Republicans to retreat step by step from small d-democratic traditions -- a trend raised to a visceral extreme by the literal assault on the Capitol, a core symbol of American democracy.\n The widespread inroads into the GOP among the forces hostile to democratic traditions mark a key difference from the 1960s, another period of intense social discord. While America in that era also experienced enormous strain -- with massive protest movements, large-scale urban unrest and riots, and anti-war radicals who regularly set off bombs at military recruiting or corporate offices -- the radical elements on that continuum never achieved as much influence inside the Democratic Party as the Trump forces skeptical of democracy have established in the modern GOP.\n Columbia University sociologist Todd Gitlin, who participated in the student left during the 1960s and has written one of the definitive histories of the period, notes that while \"there were a lot of bombs, that's for sure,\" radicals such as the Weathermen group \"were never a threat\" to the nation's core institutions because they lacked any leverage within the political system.\n \"Imagine if the Weathermen had had a caucus of 10 Democrats in the House who basically supported them and they in turn were allied with state Democratic parties all over the place, state legislators, etc., and so on. That would have been a political danger of a different order,\" he says.\n Instead, he says, the Weathermen and other militant groups such as the Black Panthers \"were not politically central in the way that [today's extremists] are. There is now a party made up substantially of people who are either friendly toward violence ... or willing to look the other way. And nobody was willing to look the other way at those bombings.\"\n The closest American parallel to the violence unleased by Trump supporters at the Capitol -- and earlier threats like the armed protests against Covid restrictions and the subsequent plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan -- may be the pro-slavery Democratic Party around the Civil War. Especially after the conflict, White racists across the South employed a massive campaign of violence to undermine the biracial Reconstruction governments and prevent the former slaves from exercising their new freedoms, including the right to vote.\n That bitter and bloody tradition lingered through nearly a full century of lynchings and other violence to deny the vote and civil rights to Blacks across the Jim Crow South -- all with the support of the Dixiecrat Southern Democrats.\n Seen against that history, the upsurge in White nationalist violence under Trump seems less like a new phenomenon than the resurgence of an old one -- a determination to use force to maintain a clear racial hierarchy. Political scientist Alvin Tillery, director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University, says Trump's success at mobilizing an electoral coalition resistant to demographic change underscores the country's imperfect progress toward creating a true multiracial democracy. While America has formally been a democracy since its birth in the 1700s, he notes, for most of our history those democratic rights were limited solely to White men.\n Democracy, he says, is much easier to sustain when it's limited to \"a master race ... where your skin color or your gender determined your rights and your status.\" Only since the 1960s, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and immigration revisions that led to a rapid growth in the nation's racial diversity, did \"we really start trying, with much great difficulty, to be a multiracial, gender-equitable LGBTQ-plus tolerant democracy. That's why we have these struggles.\"\n Few are willing to hazard definitive predictions about whether America will pull back from this brink and restore more stability to the political system -- or spiral further into conflict and division. Biden, who will assume the presidency Wednesday, appears to be betting primarily on a strategy of narrowing divisions by providing bread-and-butter improvements in people's daily lives: more vaccine shots in their arms, more Covid relief money in their pockets -- while stepping up law enforcement efforts against White nationalist groups.\n That approach might help contain the problem, but most experts agree it is unlikely to end it. While the inclination among Democrats may be \"let's just get to the bread-and-butter issue,\" says Tillery, \"that's not necessarily the motivation of the people that sacked the Capitol.\"\n In the long run, whatever Biden and other Democrats do, the question of whether the US faces more violence and other threats to its fundamental political stability probably rests more with the choices that Republicans make. If the party continues to validate and welcome extremists at its fringe and move further toward adopting anti-democratic tactics in its mainstream, the nation could be locked into a cycle of rising disorder -- particularly because the growing racial and religious diversity that triggers so much of the alienation in the Republican coalition will only intensify in the years ahead.\n Wilentz notes there has always been a minority of Americans who embrace conspiracy theories, tolerate violence to advance their goals and are willing to ditch democracy to maintain power for their side. But for much of American history, their influence has been controlled because neither party would fully embrace their causes; that's the barrier that has cracked in the GOP, especially during the tempestuous Trump years.\n \"That 35% has always been there, let alone the really crackpot 15%,\" Wilentz says. \"The point is they were contained because both parties respected each other and respected what political representative democracy was all about. The Republican Party forgot to do that. The Republican Party stopped doing that. And that is what unleashed this force.\"\n However hard Biden tries, history suggests that one party alone is unlikely to repair the widening domestic divisions that may stand as Trump's clearest legacy. It's likely that both parties will need to commit to undoing Trump's damage to America's political stability -- or that damage won't be undone at all.",

        "title": "Joe Biden's Ronald Reagan problem",
        "body_text": "Jeffrey D. Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion on CNN.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is inheriting a national crisis that has built up over 40 years. On January 20, 1981, former President Ronald Reagan took the US on a radical course when he declared in his inaugural address, \"In the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\" He set out to weaken the federal government by slashing taxes on the rich, dismantling regulations, cutting back on public programs and turning many of the nation's problems back to the states.\n President Donald Trump continued this approach -- passing massive tax cuts in 2017, and then when calamity hit with Covid-19 in 2020, placing the burden of response on the states. It is Biden's historic task to reverse Reagan's -- and Trump's -- reckless radicalism.\n Reagan won the presidency in 1980, in part, because of two actions by Democratic presidents that had brought an end to the national consensus in favor of activist government that began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and lasted through the 1960s.\n The first action that ended the consensus was profoundly moral. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson both backed the Civil Rights Movement's call to dismantle America's racist policies, including the segregation of housing, schools and places of public accommodation, and the systemic denial of voting rights to African Americans, which had prevailed since the end of Reconstruction. They did so in the face of intense opposition by segregationist Southern Democrats -- and knowing that their actions could split their own party.\n The result was a furious backlash of White working-class voters that swept Richard Nixon into office in 1968 with the help of the \"Southern Strategy,\" a new Republican strategy to court disgruntled Southern White voters. These White voters thereafter strongly supported politicians like Nixon and Reagan who promised to cutback the enforcement powers of the federal government and stop federal programs on jobs, housing and community development that would undermine continued segregation at the local level.\n The second action was profoundly immoral. Johnson escalated the Vietnam War even though he knew the war was conducted on the basis of lies and deception. Johnson's decision was also politically disastrous because the war spending ramped up inflation and bitterly divided the nation. During his first term, Nixon further escalated the war and the inflation and unleashed years of monetary instability that lasted through the presidency of Jimmy Carter. When inflation reach 13.5% in 1980, Carter was defeated by Reagan in November that year.\n Reagan claimed that he wanted to stop deficit spending, but his 1981 tax cuts increased the deficits (from 2.5% of GDP in 1981 to 5.9% of GDP in 1983), as did the 2001 tax cut under former President George W. Bush and the 2017 tax cut under Trump. Over time, the various tax cuts were not matched by offsetting spending cuts, since broad areas of federal spending were -- and continue to be -- very strongly backed by the public. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, there were strong majorities supporting increased government spending on many domestic priorities, including education, infrastructure and the environment.\n The result has been a massive buildup of federal government debt, which was also stoked by the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The federal debt owed to the public was 25% of GDP when Reagan took office. It was around 98% of GDP at the end of 2020, and will likely soar further because of further urgent spending related to Covid-19.\n The bottom line is that the US has very low taxation as a share of GDP (in fact, the lowest among all high-income countries in the OECD except Ireland), insufficient public services, decrepit infrastructure, and massive debts and deficits -- all at the same time!\n The states are not able to step in by providing more local services and infrastructure neglected by the federal government. States compete with each other by slashing taxes to attract investments away from other states. Only the federal government has the power to raise adequate tax revenues to meet the public's needs for healthcare, education, job training, research and development, infrastructure and other needs.\n As the federal debt has grown -- and many states have struggled -- one part of American society has laughed all the way to the bank. The wealthy funders of both parties -- Wall Street financiers, big oilmen, Silicon Valley gurus, real estate developers, private-prison owners, etc. -- couldn't believe their good fortunes in receiving repeated tax breaks and even the deregulation of their polluting activities. The rich got richer year after year, while working class Whites and African Americans, social conservatives and social liberals, evangelicals and atheists, waged the pitched battle for the nation's soul.\n Reagan's failed radicalism has now run its course, and the United States, while culturally as divided as ever, is at an economic and environmental precipice.  Real hourly wages for the median male worker (at the 50th percentile of the earnings distribution) fell 3% between 1979 and 2019. Student debts are $1.68 trillion, owed by an astounding 44.7 million borrowers. And climate change has plunged the nation into crises of mega-forest fires, coastal flooding, extreme storms, droughts and heatwaves. The year 2020 tied for the world's warmest on record, an astounding 1.25\u00b0 Celsius above the pre-industrial temperature -- with worse to come.\n Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the rich have gotten much richer. Over 150 of the richest Americans, who number among the world's richest 500 people, now have a combined wealth of $3 trillion, which is up by over $600 billion from the start of 2020. With Covid-19, the very richest Americans hit the jackpot, with their wealth soaring as the result of Federal Reserve liquidity, huge budget outlays and their ownership of the digital platform monopolies on which much of the economy now operates.\n The Biden administration must now find a recovery path out of the wreckage of four decades of Reagan radicalism and the politics it created.  Reagan got us stuck on the ideas that \"government is the problem,\" cuts in federal tax cuts are necessary, environmental regulations are problematic and major national problems can be left to the states and cities. These ideas, alas, are wrong, even though they are widely believed and were politically convenient for those who disliked the federal government's policies to end racial segregation.\n Americans have learned, the painful way, that we need an effective federal government. Just as states and cities could not contain Covid-19 when the federal government shirked its duties, we will also continue to fail to create enough decent jobs, educate our children, ensure safe water for our farms and cities, protect the health of Americans, face the climate emergency and modernize our infrastructure, until we mobilize the federal government to act on behalf of all Americans and all parts of our nation.\n Next in the series: What Biden's economic rescue plan needs to do",

        "title": "For Janet Yellen and the US economy, the stakes have never been higher",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nJanet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve and President-elect Joe Biden's pick to lead the Treasury Department, faces a huge task ahead.\n What's happening: Not only does Yellen have to shepherd efforts to bring the US economy back from its sharpest contraction on record \u2014 she must also convince Congress to get on board with Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, as some lawmakers balk at the price tag.\n Yellen will make her first big pitch on Tuesday when she testifies before the Senate Finance Committee.\n \"When economists look back on the pandemic, I expect they'll conclude that Congress' actions averted a lot of suffering,\" Yellen is set to tell lawmakers, according to written testimony obtained by CNN Business. \"But more must be done. Economists don't always agree, but I think there is a consensus now:\n Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now \u2014 and long-term scarring of the economy later.\"\n Wall Street expects that Congress will back the Biden administration in passing another sizable relief bill, with millions of Americans still unemployed and new jobless claims on the rise.\n But scale could be a major sticking point, with Biden's team pushing for additional $1,400 stimulus checks, aid for state and local governments and a wave of funding for Covid-19 vaccination and testing.\n One of Yellen's biggest challenges will be persuading more conservative lawmakers that the benefits of adding to America's $27 trillion debt load will outweigh the costs.\n \"Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden,\" Yellen's prepared testimony reads. \"But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big.\"\n Yellen has a point: The United States can borrow for 10 years at roughly 1%, compared with about 3% when former President Barack Obama took office. But if interest rates were to rise, servicing the country's debt load could become trickier.\n Given Yellen's background at the Fed, she'll be able to speak to these issues \u2014 as well as any concerns about inflation triggered by additional spending \u2014 with authority. Investors will be listening.\n \"Expect lots of questions about debt sustainability and the role the Fed will likely play in that,\" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said in a note to clients Tuesday.\n A personal note: Yellen, in her prepared remarks, also cites her \"working class\" background in Brooklyn, where her father, a doctor, used to treat people from the family's basement.\n \"He was the kind of doctor who treated the whole patient,\" her prepared remarks read. \"He knew about their lives; about when they'd been fired or couldn't pay. Those remain some of the clearest moments in my childhood.\"\n Bank earnings indicate that prospects for the economy are expected to improve later this year.\n The latest: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) \u2014 which reported a record profit of $12.1 billion for the fourth quarter on Friday \u2014 said it had released $2.9 billion in reserves it had earmarked to cover bad loans.\n That's a sign that the bank thinks the economic situation is poised to get better, not worse, thanks to vaccination programs and stimulus.\n In a conference call with reporters, CEO Jamie Dimon that the country could have a \"very healthy economy\" by the summer \u2014 especially if unemployed Americans and small businesses \"who desperately need help\" get more stimulus payments from the incoming Biden administration and Congress.\n However, he emphasized that plenty of unknowns remain. The bank still has credit reserves of more than $30 billion as a cushion in case conditions deteriorate. And outside of mortgages, which are experiencing a pandemic boom, lending to consumers remains muted.\n Investor insight: JPMorgan's results looked better to investors than those from Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC). Attention now turns to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which release results on Tuesday.\n Goldman may be the one to watch given how busy investment bankers were last quarter. Companies are rushing to raise capital as they gear up for the next phase of the business cycle. Trading revenue also looks healthy.\n If you were to grade the world's biggest economies on a curve, China would be top of the class.\n The world's second largest economy expanded 2.3% in 2020 compared to a year earlier, according to government statistics released Monday, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.\n It's China's slowest annual growth rate in decades. Not since 1976 has the country had a worse year, when GDP shrunk 1.6% during a time of social and economic tumult.\n But compared to other major world economies, which were plunged into deep and prolonged recessions, China has come out on top. The expansion also beat estimates. The International Monetary Fund, for example, predicted that China's economy would grow 1.9% in 2020. It's the only major world economy the IMF expected to grow at all.\n Big picture: Economists say momentum from China's economy will be crucial to power a global recovery in 2021. On that front, too, there was good news: GDP grew 6.5% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, faster than the  4.9% growth logged during the third quarter.\n The data underscores some problems that may lie ahead, however. Industrial production has jumped, while retail sales remain fragile.\n That raises the question: Has the pandemic has sidetracked China's efforts to shift its economy from one reliant on manufacturing to one more driven by consumer spending? If so, what will that mean for long-term prospects for growth?\n Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab (SCHW) and State Street report results before US markets open.

        "body_text": "Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Work Transformed newsletter.\n It's that time of year again...review season.\n Was that a groan? I get it, performance reviews are tough during normal times. And who really wants to look back at 2020?\n While many companies are taking a different approach to evaluations this year, some experts say that having a one-on-one discussion with your boss about last year while also setting goals for the new year will help establish your priorities and continue your career growth.\n Here are some of the things they suggest you do to make the conversation worthwhile:\n Get more tips here.\n Amazon workers are set to vote on the formation of the first US-based union at the company.\n On February 8, around 6,000 Amazon warehouse workers at a facility in Alabama will begin casting their vote on whether to unionize using mail-in ballots.\n The union push comes at a time when Amazon's warehouse working conditions are under heightened scrutiny as a result of the pandemic, writes CNN Business' Sara Ashley O'Brien.\n Earlier this month, Google employees announced the formation of a union, open to all workers of parent company Alphabet.\n Some Amazon workers are unionized in Europe, and there was a union vote in 2014 at a Delaware warehouse that was unsuccessful.\n Read more about the vote here.\n Getting rid of the daily commute is one the best perks of working from home. But maybe you shouldn't give it up completely.\n For some, the commute to and from the office serves as a routine that helps signify the start and end of the workday, and separates work and home life. Without it, lines become blurred.\n To help recreate boundaries, you can fake a commute by replacing the time normally spent in a car or on a train with activities like walks, bike rides or runs.\n Read more about what people are doing during their \"fake commutes.\"\n The key to endurance is self-care. I encourage clients to select one activity from my self-care formula to incorporate. The four components of S.E.L.F are sleep, exercise, love, and fun. Focusing on sleep might mean using a new sleep app; for exercise, perhaps it's adding a daily walk. Love can look like streaming a weekly show together with friends and family. Fun is about hobbies, like learning how to play the guitar or developing your love of baking. Focusing on one activity may seem under-ambitious but it's the key to fresh starts.\n Maybe it's an unanswered Slack message. A planning meeting you weren't invited to. Or an awkward virtual exchange with your boss last month that you are still thinking about.\n We might dwell on small interactions with our colleagues that may not have caused us to think twice at the office.\n Working at home means we aren't getting the impromptu social contact and conversations that can help reassure us about our status. And little things like an unanswered message can lead to thoughts like, \"Am I about to lose my job?\"\n Check out the full story here.\n Looks like the battle over California's gig economy is still brewing.\n A labor union and a group of gig workers filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court challenging Proposition 22. The ballot measure, which passed in November, exempts companies like Uber and Lyft from having to classify drivers in the state as employees.\n That would have made drivers eligible for more job protections and benefits.\n The lawsuit claims the measure unconstitutionally limits the power of the State legislature to implement a worker's compensation program, or pass future legislation concerning certain workers' rights, reports Sara Ashley O'Brien.\n As we mentioned last week, this newsletter is coming to an end next Tuesday, January 26. I will still continue to cover the evolving workplace and the changes to when, where and how we work through our Work Transformed series so keep in touch!\n Well, here's a job posting you don't see every day.\n Oscar Mayer is hiring \"Hotdoggers\" to drive its legendary hot dog-shaped Wienermobile around the US for a year.\n The company says it's looking for outgoing, creative college graduates to represent the company.\n Read more about the job here.",

        "title": "Trump transformed the Supreme Court that mostly helped advance his agenda",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump will exit the White House on Wednesday but leave behind three of the nine Supreme Court justices and a majority that was willing to partner with him for much of his agenda.\n Trump's imprint on the Supreme Court and overall three-tier federal judiciary represents one of the most significant right-wing successes of his tenure, even as his instigation of the US Capitol assault and final destructive days appear to be leaving the most indelible mark of his legacy.\n With forceful leadership from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Republicans enabled Trump to make lifetime appointments to nearly 30% of the 870-seat federal bench. A majority of the powerful US appellate courts are now dominated by Republican appointees.\n RELATED: A four-year timeline of Donald Trump and the Supreme Court\n At the Supreme Court, the Trump administration won more than it lost during the past four years, largely prevailing as it argued against immigrants' rights and for corporate interests. The conservative majority endorsed Trump's rush to execute 13 federal defendants in recent months and last week reinstated restrictions on women trying to obtain a prescribed abortion drug.\n The justices also have delayed for months action on the latest chapter of a Manhattan district attorney's long-pending subpoena for Trump tax returns.\n The Supreme Court and lower US court judges, however, failed to give Trump what he desired most at the end. They swatted away his attempts to discard valid 2020 presidential election results. For that, Trump called the Supreme Court \"totally incompetent and weak.\"\n One person who stood between Trump and more sweeping success was Chief Justice John Roberts. The administration lost major cases at the Supreme Court when Roberts gave his decisive vote to the liberal side of the bench.\n Still, Roberts often afforded the administration some measure of victory even in its losing cases, such as a broader reading of executive discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act, or a chance to return with stronger arguments.\n When the administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and wanted to end the Obama-era \"Dreamers\" program for undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors, the Trump arguments were hurt by contrived and flawed justifications as much as anything.\n Trump responded to the Roberts' opinion in the dispute over the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by saying, \"Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me.\"\n Trump and conservative advocates effectively triumphed on a goal dating to the 2016 election campaign when Trump took the unorthodox step of issuing a list of possible candidates for the high court, and McConnell ensured that the vacancy caused by that February's death of Justice Antonin Scalia was waiting for the new president.\n Just days after taking office in January 2017, Trump nominated US appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Scalia vacancy.\n The next year, Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired after 30 years on the bench. Four months ago, a new vacancy suddenly appeared with the September 18 death of prominent liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Trump chose Amy Coney Barrett.\n McConnell had also stalled on Obama lower court nominations in 2016, ensuring that about 100 lower court vacancies also awaited Trump in 2017. After four years, the President has filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships (26%) and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships (30%), according data compiled by the Brookings Institution's Russell Wheeler.\n When Trump first came to office, four of the 13 US appeals courts had Republican majorities, Wheeler said, and today, seven of the 13 are now dominated by GOP appointees. These regional appeals courts usually have the last word on legal disputes because the Supreme Court accepts fewer than 1% of the petitions that arrive at its door.\n Of cases that were heard by the justices, Trump generally saw bigger victories at the start of its tenure than the finish, beginning with the June 2018 decision that upheld Trump's travel ban. In a 5-4 opinion written by Roberts, the majority called Trump's order \"an act that is well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other President.\"\n Over protests from dissenting liberals to consider Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric, Roberts wrote in Trump v. Hawaii that the court must consider \"the authority of the Presidency itself.\"\n In a case that drew far less attention but reinforced the Trump agenda limiting eligibility for asylum in the US, the justices in June curtailed court review for asylum seekers in an expedited removal process who claim they cannot return home because they have a credible fear of torture or death.\n The administration won several major cases favoring employers over labor. In one of the most contentious, the five-justice bloc on the right in 2018 reversed a 1977 ruling that had allowed states to require employees who declined to join a union to pay \"fair share\" fees to finance bargaining for pay and benefits but not political activities.\n \"Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\" Trump wrote on Twitter after the ruling.\n Equally consequential were some decisions that arose through Trump requests on the so-called \"shadow docket,\" which were never fully briefed and heard in oral arguments.\n Department of Justice lawyers repeatedly persuaded the conservative majority to block adverse lower court orders that would have prevented the administration from enforcing its initiatives while legal challenges were pending.\n The justices by 5-to-4 votes, conservatives over liberals, let Trump divert funds to build the wall at the US southern border; to institute a new rule disadvantaging green-card applicants who seek food stamps and other public assistance; and, most recently, to reinstate a Food and Drug Administration requirement that women prescribed mifepristone, to end a pregnancy in its early weeks, pick up the pill in person at a hospital or clinic despite the Covid-19 pandemic.\n One of Trump's most conspicuous losses appeared, at the time, to be July 2020 rulings rejecting his attempt to block subpoenas from US House committees and the Manhattan district attorney for his personal business records.\n But the compromise 7-2 court decisions offered Trump additional ways to fight the subpoenas, and by the end of 2020 Trump had relinquished none of the disputed financial documents.\n The decision in Trump v. Vance regarding a Manhattan grand jury's subpoena had appeared most lethal to Trump's desire to keep records secret. Reaching back 200 years in court history, Roberts wrote, \"No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.\"\n After that July 9 decision on the subpoena directed to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, lower court judges reviewed new Trump defenses that the subpoena was overly broad and issued in bad faith.\n The Trump claims were again spurned, and in October the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that \"there is nothing to suggest that these are anything but run-of-the-mill documents typically relevant to a grand jury investigation into possible financial or corporate misconduct.\"\n Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been seeking the financial records as he investigates any Trump or Trump Organization involvement in \"hush money\" payments to women who alleged sexual affairs with him during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has denied the affairs.\n Trump's lawyers in October asked the Supreme Court to postpone the effect of the Second Circuit decision and hear the merits of their defense. Vance's lawyers countered, \"This litigation has already substantially hampered the grand jury's investigation.\"\n For the past three months, the justices have not acted -- with no public explanation.\n Despite his many victories and what will be a transformative legacy, Trump, of course, always wanted more and suggested he was being denied the respect he deserved.\n Last July, when the Supreme Court spurned Trump's immunity claim and sent the Vance case back to lower courts, Trump wrote on Twitter, \"I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration! .... Courts in the past have given 'broad deference.' BUT NOT ME!\"",

        "title": "China is hitting back at criticism of its vaccines with a dangerous disinformation campaign",
        "body_text": "Speaking at the World Health Assembly last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for \"solidarity and cooperation\" in developing coronavirus vaccines, \"our most powerful weapon\" for tackling the pandemic.\n But with Chinese medical company Sinovac facing questions over the efficacy of its coronavirus shot, the country's propaganda apparatus has apparently forgotten Xi's comments. Instead, it is choosing to attack other vaccines -- a dangerous gambit that could risk undermining overall confidence in mass vaccinations just as the world desperately needs people to get inoculated.\n China has been widely praised for its decision to focus on providing vaccines to the developing world, with companies Sinovac and Sinopharm focusing on producing candidates that do not require expensive cold storage, unlike those released by Western drug makers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna which are being rolled out in the United States.\n Hope was particularly high when both Chinese companies said their vaccines were more than 78% effective, higher than the shot produced by the United Kingdom's Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and second only to the US-developed mRNA-based shots, which require cold storage and are more difficult to distribute.\n Then came the results from Brazil. Late-stage trials of the Sinovac candidate in the South American country reported an efficacy rate not of 78%, but 50.38% -- barely above the 50% efficacy threshold set by the World Health Organization for approval.\n The true efficacy rate of the vaccine is still unclear. As well as the initial 78% figure, Turkey, which approved the Sinovac shot for emergency use last week, reported an efficacy of 91.25%, while Indonesia reported 65.3%. Brazil's data also suggests a greater level of efficacy in some cases than others.\n Sinovac has stood by its vaccine, even as some countries have placed it under review and paused rollouts, but scientists have called on the company to release more data. The confusion has also shone a spotlight on the role Chinese authorities are playing in controlling information about the vaccines produced by domestic companies, though Sinovac -- unlike Sinopharm -- is a nominally private company.\n Chinese officials and state media have made the country's vaccine candidates a major point of national pride and a way to win global favor following a widespread backlash over the initial mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, where officials have been accused of silencing whistleblowers and failing to act in time to contain infections.\n It was perhaps inevitable, then, that any questions raised about a Chinese vaccine would be seen as an attack on the state, particularly in a climate of intense hostility between Beijing and Washington over the two countries' respective responses to the pandemic.\n \"If you look at the websites of major media in the US and the West, almost all the news you read about the Chinese-made vaccine is negative,\" Hu Xijin, the influential editor of the state-run tabloid Global Times, wrote on Saturday. \"The press is out to destroy the reputation of the Chinese vaccine, hoping that the world will wait for Pfizer and other American and Western companies to produce surplus vaccines and finally get vaccinated.\"\n Hu's paper has led the way in defending Chinese-produced vaccines, not by establishing their effectiveness, but by seeking to tear down the reputation of other candidates -- particularly those produced by US company Pfizer.\n In an editorial last week, the Global Times accused English-language media of \"downplaying\" deaths in Norway it appeared to claim were linked to vaccines, \"as if they had already reached a consensus.\" The report added that \"those major Western media will immediately hype any unfavorable information about Chinese vaccines and try to amplify their impact on public psychology.\"\n While the deaths in question did occur after vaccination -- and were reported on by CNN, among numerous other US media outlets -- the Norwegian health authorities said that given the age and frailty of those inoculated, \"it is expected that deaths close to the time (of) vaccination may occur.\"\n However, on Twitter, Liu Xin, an anchor with state broadcaster CGTN, has repeatedly -- and baselessly -- accused Western media of ignoring deaths and downplaying concerns about the Pfizer vaccine.\n In a tweet shared by senior Chinese diplomat Zhao Lijian, a top spokesman for China's foreign ministry, Liu said she could not \"independently verify\" the claims she was promoting, tagging a number of international media outlets and asking \"What about following it up? Hello???\"\n Zhao has spent much of his recent time on Twitter promoting positive coverage of China's vaccination program, as well as disinformation like that shared by Liu. His banner image on the site currently reads \"this is the time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumors. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.\"\n Journalists, whether based in China, the US, or anywhere in the world, have a very good reason for not rushing to report on deaths supposedly linked to vaccines. Indeed, some outlets have been criticized for overplaying allergic reactions to vaccines or reporting on the deaths of people recently inoculated without evidence of any link with the shot.\n Millions of people are being vaccinated against coronavirus around the world. Some will die in the wake of receiving the shot of unrelated causes, and a tiny few may die as a result of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. But neither means that the inoculation itself is unsafe.\n \"One of the things we want to make sure people understand is that they should not be unnecessarily alarmed if there are reports, once we start vaccinating, of someone or multiple people dying within a day or two of their vaccination,\" Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the US Immunization Action Coalition, told CNN last month. This is particularly the case in the initial stages of the vaccine programs, when the majority of people being inoculated are elderly or immuno-compromized.\n Derek Lowe, an expert on the pharmaceutical industry, wrote recently that \"if you take 10 million people and just wave your hand back and forth over their upper arms, in the next two months you would expect to see\" about 14,000 deaths from heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and other usual causes of mortality.\n \"But if you took those 10 million people and gave them a new vaccine instead, there's a real danger that those heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, and deaths will be attributed to the vaccine,\" he added.\n While articles about allergic reactions and deaths linked to vaccines may put the matter in proper context, it is often difficult for headlines to do so. This creates the risk that people see only that there have been fatalities and get the false impression coronavirus vaccines are dangerous.\n That is why the disinformation being put out by Chinese state media and officials -- all in the name of defending a Sinovac vaccine that everyone in the world deeply wants to succeed, and that critics of which are only asking for more information on -- is so dangerous. Vaccine hesitancy is already a major problem, thanks in large part to irresponsible media coverage of the MMR autism scare, which was pushed by a now-disgraced British doctor.\n China has among the least vaccine hesitant populations in the world, according to a recent Nature study, which may explain why the country's propaganda outlets feel freer to play fast and loose with reporting on Western vaccines.

It would be the greatest privilege of my life to return to the  Department and lead the nearly 240,000 men and women who dedicate their talent and energy to  the safety and security of our Nation.\n ...\n The principles of homeland and security have been tremendously important in shaping my life.  My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism and to provide me with  the security, opportunity, and pride that American citizenship brings to each of us. I was raised to  appreciate each day what this country has meant for our family, and the blessing it is to know it  as our homeland.\n ...\n The love for this country that I learned from my parents made the January 6 attack on the Capitol all the more horrifying. We still have much to learn about what happened that day and what led  up to the insurrection. If I should have the honor of being confirmed, I will do everything I can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror felt by you, your  colleagues, staff, and everyone present, will not happen again.\n ...\n The Department of Homeland Security bears an extraordinary weight on behalf of the American  people \u2014 the weight of grave challenges, seen and unseen. Cyber attacks that undermine our security and the integrity of our information systems. The threat of both foreign and domestic terrorism. Pandemics that throw every part of American life off of its axis. And extreme weather events that threaten lives and livelihoods. That is to say nothing of maintaining border security, providing humanitarian relief, protecting  our critical infrastructure, or the many other responsibilities that the men and women of the  Department fulfill each day.\n -\n If I have the privilege of serving as Secretary, I will work day and night to support the Department's great workforce and ensure that it is able to execute its responsibilities successfully, with honor and dignity. I will dedicate myself to equipping the Department's men  and women with the tools and resources they need and providing them with the opportunities  they deserve. I will do so in partnership with you and with the other Members of Congress, and with the Department's many other critical partners throughout the country.\n The Department of Homeland Security is, fundamentally, a department of partnerships. To combat the threat of terrorism, the Department must work with our international partners, other  federal agencies, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and our Nation's noble first responders. To enhance our cybersecurity, the Department depends upon and must strengthen its  cooperation with the private sector. To be prepared for and resilient to natural disasters, the  Department must work with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments and our brave local fire and emergency personnel. To facilitate and enhance our trade and travel, it must innovate and align its research and development with the efforts of private industry and academic  institutions. To meet the challenges and opportunities of migration, it needs to collaborate with  other nations, international organizations, and non-profit service providers. To succeed, the  Department must work with the many communities it serves.\n This Committee and your colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives are at the forefront of the Department's partners. We must work closely with you as you help determine  the funding upon which the Department relies, promulgate the laws that it is charged to enforce,  and provide the oversight that ensures its accountability to the American people. As your partner,  the Department must be collaborative, open and transparent, and at all times forthright with you  \u2014 even in times of disagreement. If I am confirmed as the next Secretary, the Department will meet its responsibilities to you.\n I began in government service as a federal prosecutor. After more than eight years of trying cases  before juries, I served more than three years as a Senate-confirmed United States Attorney. As a  prosecutor, the law and the facts of a case were my foundation and my guide, and they have remained my North Star ever since. I have worked in support of federal agents and officers, local law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians. I have worked in support of  all the men and women throughout the Department of Homeland Security and in public service  who work in, and even rush into, harm's way to protect us all. I have not for a single moment lost sight of what a privilege and honor it is to do so, nor of the obligations it carries on our Nation's behalf. I look forward to continuing that service.",

        "title": "Why Trump can't legally pardon himself",
        "body_text": "David Gray Adler is a constitutional law scholar and president of The Alturas Institute, a non-profit organization created to advance American democracy by promoting the Constitution, gender equality, civic education and equal protection of the law. He is co-author, most recently, of \"The War Power in an Age of Terrorism.\" The views expressed here are solely his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nPresident Donald Trump's hypothetical option of granting himself a pardon before leaving office effectively ended when the House of Representatives opened debate on a single article of impeachment, charging \"incitement of insurrection,\" and voted to impeach him in a bipartisan vote of 232-197 on January 13.\n The Pardon Clause of the Constitution, Article 2, Section 1, provides that the President may grant pardons for offenses against the United States \"except in Cases of impeachment.\" This clause bars a president from pardoning anyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 who is the subject of impeachment once debate on offenses set forth in the articles of impeachment begins.\n This constitutional limitation on the pardon power reflects the deep influence of English legal history on the framers' drafting of the impeachment and pardon clauses. The framers, keenly aware of the 17th Century clashes between King and Parliament on the scope of those powers, were determined to protect the power of impeachment from executive encroachment through the exercise of authority to grant pardons. Although the restrictions in the Pardon Clause seem to refer only to specific offenses being addressed in the impeachment proceedings, the English law background and history provide an overwhelming case against a presidential self-pardoning authority on any basis.\n The framers' position on the pardon and impeachment powers was fashioned by a pivotal episode in English legal history, one riddled with convulsions and crises, in the century-long battle between King and Parliament over two foundational powers that shaped the evolution of English law. It was a case in which the King's grant of a pardon to another was actually an attempt to absolve his own misdeeds.\n In 1678, Parliament was outraged by the discovery of surreptitious maneuvers by the Earl of Danby, the trusted Lord Treasurer serving England's King Charles II, to tilt England's foreign policy toward France and to solicit a pension, that is, a bribe, from King Louis XIV to pay Charles II, as part of a design to restore the influence of Roman Catholicism in England -- a move that offended the sentiments and violated the policies of Parliament.\n Lord Danby was serving King Charles II, who had laid out the scheme and provided his chief minister with instructions to follow. Danby's downfall was set in motion when he wrote a letter to Ralph Montague, an English courtier and middleman for the arrangement with King Louis. This letter bore Danby's signature, and when it became public, the House of Commons was infuriated.\n Parliament had no legal authority to impeach the King himself, so lawmakers launched impeachment proceedings against Danby instead. Danby was impeached for \"High Treason and other High Crimes, Misdemeanours and Offences.\" Charles, anxious to protect his loyal aide, tried to block the impeachment by marching to the House of Lords and declared that he had authorized Danby's acts, that he had granted a pardon to Danby, and that Danby had been dismissed.\n Parliament, however, would have none of this. Sir Francis Winnington, a former Solicitor General regarded by historians as a great lawyer, immediately grasped the existential threat to the impeachment power. He justly stated, \"An impeachment is of no purpose when a pardon shall stop our mouths.\" For a nation in which executive accountability was still in its nascent stage, monarchical pardon to derail impeachment would not be tolerated. In a century replete with constitutional crises between the Commons and the Crown, Charles had no stomach for another. He voluntarily withdrew his pardon of Danby, who was sent to the Tower of London, where he was held for five years. The legal and political convulsions that engulfed the Danby Affair were brought to an unceremonious end when King Charles dismissed Parliament.\n This refusal by Parliament to accept King Charles' pardon of Danby, followed two decades later with the enactment of the historic Settlement Act of 1700 barring the pleading of a pardon to an impeachment, left an indelible impression on the framers of the Constitution. Pennsylvania's Gouverneur Morris invoked the Danby scandal in the 1787 Constitutional Convention to punctuate his, and fellow delegates', fear that the \"president could be bribed to betray his trust.\"\n If the English Parliament had accepted the pardon, the King would have been free to screen ministers from parliamentary inquiry and impeachment \u2014 and thus put himself beyond the reach of Parliament. For members of the House of Commons who viewed the impeachment power as a means to preserve government and bring corrupt ministers to heel, the act of executive clemency could not be tolerated.\n The framers of the American Constitution were not about to allow their own newly minted executive a power denied to the King of England. There is no mention of self-pardons in the records of the debates in the Constitutional Convention or evidence of any discussion of such authority in the Federalist Papers, anti-Federalist Papers, or any document contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution. The very suggestion of such authority would have triggered accusations of monarchical sympathies.\n It's a fair bet that the notion that a specific constitutional prohibition against executive self-pardon would ever be required was a failure of the framers' imagination. When Charles II's father, Charles I, was sentenced to death in the High Court of Justice, in 1649, for treason, murder and other crimes of tyranny, he denied up until his beheading that the court had any jurisdictional authority over the monarch. But in the long sweep of English history, neither he nor any other monarch ever claimed the power to self-pardon.\n The framers of the Constitution vested in the US President less, not  more, power than that attributed to the King. But let's say that Trump, having flouted the norms so many times before, does attempt to pardon himself for any crimes he might have committed outside the purview of the ban on impeachment-related pardons.\n Such a self-pardon will have limited utility given the sorts of legal challenges that Trump may be forced to confront. A presidential  pardon does not extend to state offenses, which means he could still face charges arising from state and city investigations currently being conducted in New York.\n The Supreme Court has made clear that constitutional adjudication often requires resort to historical arguments, claims and practices. Lacking a textual statement in the Constitution of a presidential authority to self-pardon, and lacking even a scintilla of evidence in Anglo-American legal history to support the existence of such a staggering power, or any assertion to that effect by just one delegate to the convention, Trump's premise of a self-pardon should be as risible to strict and loose constructionists on any court as his assertion that the President is endowed with \"absolute\" power.\n And when Trump effectively tried to assert absolute power in Washington on January 6 by inciting his followers to overturn an election, he triggered the unpardonable impeachment charges that should -- if all else fails -- be a slam-dunk in a court of law.",

        "body_text": "Heather Tsavaris served at the US Department of State from 2002 to 2012, spending most of that time as a senior terrorism analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Subsequently, Heather served in a consulting capacity to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Community Partnerships and now works to improve community well-being at the local level. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\nAs I watched the attack on our nation's Capitol, my heart broke and I was so incredibly angry.\n But this isn't about one day of events. When I watched the people storming the Capitol, parroting talking points they have heard ceaselessly on social media feeds for months, their words matched the themes that I repeatedly saw during my 10 years working in counterterrorism at the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.\n I was an all-source analyst, which meant I spent my days reading hundreds of intelligence reports trying to understand how al Qaeda, and eventually ISIS and al-Shabab, planned their attacks and how they recruited, radicalized and retained supporters.\n Themes kept emerging. Recruitment messages were ones of strength that landed so well for people who felt they had no power. They offered a way to belong for people who felt like they were perennial outsiders, and they claimed your life may have been insignificant up to this point but, if you are willing to join the cause now, you will have meaning beyond your wildest dreams. The culmination of a very different kind of recruitment messaging that also played on themes of significance is what I saw unfolding at the Capitol, and I am haunted by the images, the words, the livestreams and interviews of people who participated in the insurrection, and probably will be forever.\n The sentiment that I heard repeated often from the rioters was that the President invited them there and told them to storm the Capitol. I saw videos of men who looked like the guys I grew up with in my small mid-Western hometown, who would be far more at ease at a Friday night high school football game than part of a group violently beating down the doors of our nation's hallowed Capitol. I heard young adults with wonderment in their voices, seemingly in disbelief that they made it inside of the Capitol. There were also the people excitedly telling one another, you have to tell your grandkids about this.\n After the Capitol was secured and so many of us continued to reel in shock, livestream footage from the lobby of the Grand Hyatt had a different feel.\n There was a palpable sense of community, connection, and belonging amongst those who had traveled to be part of a historic day. These people had come to be together with others who were like them. They chatted about where they had flown in from, how they were thrilled to be meeting other \"patriots,\" what this event meant to them -- mere hours after so much destruction and death had just occurred. One irony for me was that the last time I was in that Grand Hyatt lobby, I was receiving training from the US Department of Homeland Security on countering violent extremism.\n To be clear, while I noticed striking similarities between the messaging themes like purpose, significance, and belonging that influenced the Capitol rioters and how people are recruited to join terrorist organizations, there were differences. One main one that I saw: Terrorist groups aim to harm civilians, but the rioters intended to disrupt a cornerstone of US democracy and, for a few at least, harm elected officials because they believe unsubstantiated claims about their votes were not being counted.\n From a former terrorism analyst, who now works to improve community well-being, I know what it looks like when those ravenous for power manipulate people who feel they -- and their beliefs -- have been cast aside. Until we deeply understand and address how every human needs purpose, meaning, belonging and ways to contribute, there will always be selfish people claiming to fulfill these most basic needs towards their own narrow purposes, resulting in dire and sometimes deadly consequences.\n As I, and so many others ponder what to do next, I can't help but think about how the US government has tried for years to address violent extremism: more stringent social media terms of use, improved community awareness, deployment of credible voices pushing back against extremist messages. All of these tactics have a place.\n We are talking about a different situation here, though. A powerful tool in this instance is deeper community engagement that seeks to humanize, connect with, and profoundly understand the needs of our neighbors, including those who went to the Capitol.\n Some were intent to carry out violence, did so, and should be condemned and fully prosecuted. But it would be useful to understand how, in the propagating of violence, they found such clear purpose and meaning, and intense belonging. Importantly, there are scores more who would never consider violence but who feel exceedingly marginalized who also must be heard -- frankly, on this issue and on so many more.\n Although I no longer work in counterterrorism, my work is still very much focused on promoting belonging, purpose, meaning and ways to contribute in order to strengthen our local community.\n To do this, I have led work in partnership with incarcerated men and those recently returned home to understand and create solutions together that improve their own sense of belonging when they are released. In so doing, community power brokers have said to them -- we need your help, your expertise. We can't do this without you.\n I have engaged with formerly homeless young people to leverage their expertise and ideas about how to support youth experiencing homelessness during Covid. I have witnessed these young people step into their power when they presented their work to city councils. Realizing that they are making history in their community. That these are the stories they will tell their grandkids.\n The goal of this work is to listen without judgment, unearth new insights, and create solutions together that offer true belonging and well-being for us all. Maybe this is the kind of approach that could provide more belonging for more people in a nation that really seems to need it.",

        "title": "Trump administration leaves Biden with 'confusing' Covid-19 vaccine numbers and states in limbo",
        "body_text": "States across the country say they're running low on coronavirus vaccine supply, with many officials insisting the vaccine delivery numbers reported by the Trump administration don't align with what they are seeing on the ground.\n From New York to Tennessee to West Virginia, officials are clamoring for more doses of coronavirus vaccine. And officials in those states said that federal tallies suggesting they have thousands of doses sitting on the shelves don't accurately reflect the supply of vaccine on hand.\n The confusion around vaccine supply -- and the gap between what officials said is happening locally and the numbers the Trump administration is reporting -- presents an immediate challenge for the incoming Biden administration.\n A source close to the Biden transition team said there is enormous concern among the incoming administration about the accuracy of the numbers that have been released by the federal government. It was only within the last few days that the transition team was given access to Tiberius, the system that shows states how many doses are available to them and allows states to determine delivery locations.\n Until then, the team was working solely off numbers they received from manufacturers, unable to cross check and confirm, the source told CNN on Tuesday.\n All of this means the Biden team still isn't sure what it will be confronted with when President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Wednesday. Despite frustration, the source said Biden's team has been hesitant to broadcast just how they were left in the dark out of concern that the Trump administration would stop cooperating altogether.\n \"This is a very confusing time for understanding these numbers and as we talk more and more to the Biden administration, we're learning that they are trying to sort this out as well,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), told CNN on Tuesday. \"With the change of administration happening at this very moment, they don't appear to totally know yet what vaccine numbers we're talking about and what is the reality.\"\n Trump administration officials, meantime, said they have held hundreds of meetings with the incoming Biden coronavirus team.\n \"This is a concerted effort by the new team to down-talk where things are, so they could look like heroes when they come in and just carry forward the momentum that we have established,\" outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Fox News on Monday.\n The finger-pointing is of little use to states, which are clamoring for more vaccine and clearer numbers from the federal government about how much is truly available.\n \"Nobody knows where that number is coming from,\" Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey told CNN on Tuesday when asked why the federal government's tally of doses distributed in the state is 76,000 higher than the state's count.\n \"We don't count it on our dashboard until we have it in hand,\" Piercey said. \"We don't want to, you know, get people's hopes up.\"\n A senior administration official told CNN that the numbers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accurately reflect doses that are distributed or delivered. As of Tuesday afternoon, the CDC's website notes that the term \"distributed\" refers to the cumulative count of vaccine doses recorded as shipped in the CDC's Vaccine Tracking System.\n Yet that has not been the experience in some states.\n \"The doses distributed means that they've given us a number, we have told them where it needs to go in the system to get sent out, but that does not mean that it's been shipped,\" said Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease epidemiology, prevention and control for the Minnesota Department of Health.\n \"The doses shipped, that means we've got a FedEx tracking number and it's left the facility,\" Ehresmann said. \"The doses distributed are doses that have been promised to the state, that the state has accepted and given a location where those doses should be shipped. And the disconnect is that those doses haven't necessarily arrived in the state.\"\n And governors in Minnesota, West Virginia and New York have all said in recent days that they are running low on vaccine.\n Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Monday his state had \"a very limited supply.\"\n \"The federal government has been giving mixed messages on vaccine availability and guidance, and we need them to step up and get more vaccine to the state,\" Walz said.\n West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice echoed the need for more vaccine in a news conference Tuesday.\n \"We can't give you a vaccine shot, if we don't have the vaccines,\" Justice said. \"Today, right now -- if they send us vaccines, we will put them in somebody's arm and as soon as we put them in somebody's arm it's going to be saving somebody's life.\"\n There was always going to be a shortage of vaccine in the early months of distribution because production can't keep up with the national demand. But states have repeatedly expressed frustration that they can't get clear answers from the Trump administration about how much vaccine will become available and when.\n Hopes of a surge in vaccine shipments fizzled last week after the Trump administration announced a new policy to release second vaccine doses that had been held in reserve, only to later admit that many of those doses had already been distributed.\n \"This is making our health departments nervous and anxious that those second dose quantities -- thought to be held in protected reserve -- may have actually disappeared somehow. We need rapid transparency and clarity on overall vaccine supply in order to pivot planning and messaging on the ground in communities,\" Freeman said. \"We're just scratching our heads trying to figure out what the truth is.\"\n By the CDC's count, more than 31 million doses of vaccine have been distributed and less than half -- roughly 12.3 million shots -- have been administered, as of Friday.\n But states said there's no way half their doses are sitting on shelves or in freezers.\n A number of factors could be contributing to the confusion. The CDC's distribution numbers reflect the doses that have been shipped, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have been received yet. The federal totals also include doses that have been earmarked for nursing home residents and those vaccinations have been recorded more slowly, according to health officials.\n Some vaccines may have also been distributed to clinics or providers that are moving at a slower pace. In some cases, resource-depleted states have determined it's easier to keep those doses where they are rather than attempt the complicated process of transporting and redistributing them.\n \"It's not practical for states to consider trying to recall them or move them. It's better for states to support these providers in getting them into arms,\" said Claire Hannan, executive director for the Association of Immunization Managers.\n Unwinding exactly what's mucking up the numbers -- and speeding up the supply of vaccine -- will ultimately be a problem that falls to the incoming Biden administration.\n \"For example, in Minnesota, we're moving vaccine through as quickly as we can and our numbers for vaccination are far different than what has been described as distributed,\" Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told CNN on Tuesday. \"So that's one of the challenges -- that's where states have been frustrated because they've been getting caught in people perceiving there's a lot more vaccine available than there really is.\"\n CNN's Keri Enriquez, John Bonifield, Gregory Lemos and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday directly blamed President Donald Trump for the deadly mob that attacked the Capitol, as the Senate prepares for an impeachment trial on whether to convict the President for \"incitement of insurrection\" and potentially disqualify him from holding office in the future.\n The typically tight-lipped Senate Republican leader rarely broke from Trump in his four years as president. But he led the Senate's certification of the presidential election that the rioters pledged to overturn, and has strongly condemned the violence at the Capitol he has served in as a senator for 36 years.\n \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on the Senate floor. \"They were provoked by the President and other powerful people.\"\n The Senate Republican leader has not yet said whether he will vote to convict after the evidence is presented in the upcoming trial. McConnell has privately indicated that impeaching Trump would help remove the President's legacy from the public perception of the Republican party.\n McConnell touted that Congress did its duty despite the violence on January 6, certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n \"We'll have a safe and successful inaugural right here on the very front of the Capitol,\" said McConnell.\n LIVE UPDATES: Biden prepares for inauguration on Trump's last full day in office\n McConnell's comments came as the Senate prepares to hold an impeachment trial over the House's charge of \"incitement of insurrection.\" McConnell said on Tuesday that the Senate has received a message from the House that Trump has been impeached but noted that the House has not yet transmitted the article to the Senate.\n Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer advocated for convicting Trump and disqualifying him from holding office again.\n \"We need to set a precedent that the severest offense ever committed by a President will be met by the severest remedy provided by the Constitution \u2014 Impeachment and conviction by this chamber as well as disbarment from future office,\" Schumer said.\n McConnell touted on Tuesday that Congress did its duty despite the riot on January 6, certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n \"We'll have a safe and successful inaugural right here on the very front of the Capitol,\" said McConnell.\n McConnell said Congress would soon turn to work for the American people and asserted that no party has a broad mandate after the 2020 elections, which flipped the White House and Republican-led Senate to the Democrats.\n \"Certainly November's elections did not hand any side a mandate for sweeping ideological change,\" said McConnell. \"Americans elected a closely divided Senate, a closely divided House and a presidential candidate who said he'd represent everyone.\"\n \"So our marching orders from the American people are clear,\" said McConnell. \"We're to have a robust discussion and seek common ground. We are to pursue bipartisan agreement everywhere we can, and check and balance one another, respectfully, where we must.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",
