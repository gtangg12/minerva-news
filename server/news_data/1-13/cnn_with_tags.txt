        "body_text": "Authorities are investigating hundreds of people in connection with the deadly pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol.\n Some of the defendants are accused of bringing weapons to Capitol Hill. Others were photographed ransacking the building. Many are charged with unlawful entry or violent entry.\n Here's what we know about some of those who have been charged.\n Barnett, of Arkansas, was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during the January 6 riots, authorities say.\n Federal authorities say he was taken into custody two days later in Little Rock.\n Barnett, known as Bigo, was caught on video surveillance entering Pelosi's office area around 2:50 p.m. ET with an American flag and cell phone and leaving six minutes later with only his cell phone, according to court documents. He was photographed with his boot propped on a desk and the flag draped nearby.\n He later spoke with news media outlets and was captured on video holding an envelope from Pelosi's office. Barnett told a reporter, \"I did not steal it.\" He said he took the envelope because he had bled on it  and \"put a quarter on her desk,\" according to court filings signed by a special agent with US Capitol Police.\n Barnett was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds as well as the theft of public property, according to a criminal complaint.\n He is in FBI custody, according to the sheriff's office in Benton County, Arkansas.\n Barnett \"will answer the accusations made against him in court at the appropriate time,\" the office of his attorney, Anthony Siano, wrote in a January 14 email to CNN.\n Prosecutors say Brock, a 53-year-old retired Air Force Reserve officer from Texas, was photographed roaming the Senate chamber clutching a white flex cuff, which is used by law enforcement to restrain or detain subjects. Photos show the man sporting a military helmet, green tactical vest and black-and-camo jacket.\n In an interview with the New Yorker, Brock denied he holds racist views and repeated President Donald Trump's baseless assertions of election fraud.\n He also said that he was opposed to vandalizing the building, and was dismayed when he learned of the extent of the destruction. \"I know it looks menacing,\" he told the New Yorker. \"That was not my intent.\"\n Chansley, an Arizona man also known as Jake Angeli, was seen in photos at the Capitol, shirtless and donning face paint and a bearskin headdress with horns, according to his arrest warrant.\n He was taken into custody January 9 and was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, federal authorities said.\n An indictment filed January 11 shows Chansley is facing additional charges as well, now totaling six. He is now charged with civil disorder; obstruction of an official proceeding; entering and remaining in a restricted building; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building; violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building; and demonstrating in a Capitol building.\n A federal judge said January 15 that Chansley will remain in jail as he awaits trial, after the Justice Department portrayed him as a particularly belligerent leader among the rioters.\n US Magistrate Judge Deborah Fine said she had \"no confidence Mr. Chansley would follow any condition I set\" if he disagreed with the court's orders, and that he would be a danger to the community especially in the coming days if he were to be released. Authorities will transport him to detention in Washington, DC.\n Chansley told the FBI he came to Washington \"as a part of a group effort, with other 'patriots' from Arizona, at the request of the President that all 'patriots' come to DC on January 6, 2021,\" according to a narrative from investigators in his court record.\n Chansley had called the FBI the day after the attack and confirmed to the agency he was the person seen in photos in the vice president's chair in the Senate, a court document reads.\n In a subsequent court memorandum filed in an attempt to keep him detained, prosecutors say Chansley left a note for Vice President Mike Pence on the dais where Pence had stood that morning, and in it he wrote that \"it's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"\n Chansley told the FBI that he did not mean the note as a threat, but said Pence was a \"child-trafficking traitor,\" and went on a diatribe about President-elect Joe Biden and other politicians being traitors, the prosecutors wrote.\n Chansley's attorney, Al Watkins, told CNN on January 14 that Chansley \"wasn't violent.\"\n \"He didn't cross over any police lines. He didn't assault anyone,\" Watkins said.\n Watkins said Chansley \"loved Trump, every word.\"\n \"He listened to him. He felt like he was answering the call of our President,\" said Watkins, who said Chansley hopes for a presidential pardon.\n Known by followers as the QAnon Shaman, Chansley had a Facebook page filled with posts evoking the conspiracy theories of QAnon, whose adherents believe that there is a cabal of Satan-worshipping sexual abusers who have infiltrated the highest reaches of American government and are being opposed by Trump.\n He served in the US Navy from 2005 to October 2007, records show.\n Prosecutors say Coffman, of Falkville, Alabama, was arrested after authorities found 11 homemade bombs, an assault rifle and a handgun in his truck parked two blocks from the Capitol during the riot.\n A grand jury indicted him January 11 on 17 criminal counts, including a federal charge of unlawful possession of a destructive device. It also included charges alleging he possessed ammunition, unregistered firearms and firearms without a license in violation of District of Columbia laws.\n Coffman had parked his pickup truck on the morning of January 6 near the National Republican Club, a block from the US Capitol, according to court documents. Capitol police started searching the truck after seeing a firearm handle in a passenger seat, the documents say.\n Inside the truck were 11 Mason jars with liquid, with a hole punched in the top of each; lighters and rags; several weapons including a handgun, an assault-style rifle, a shotgun, a crossbow with bolts, a stun gun and several machetes; several large-capacity ammunition feeding devices; and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to a memorandum that prosecutors filed January 12 in support of his detention.\n When police found and searched him about a block away after dusk, Coffman was carrying a 9 mm handgun and a .22-caliber derringer-style pistol in each of his front pockets, a police complaint said. None of the weapons found in his truck or on his person were registered to him.\n Coffman told law enforcement that the jars \"contained a mixture of melted Styrofoam and gasoline,\" according to the detention memo.\n That combination could have the effect of napalm, and federal investigators concluded the 11 jars and related items were \"parts designed to create ... Molotov cocktails,\" the detention memo reads.\n Investigators also found handwritten notes in Coffman's truck that included a quote about the need \"to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution,\" according to court records.\n The notes also included the names of a Democratic member of Congress that he singled out for being Muslim, and an Obama-appointed judge. The handwritten notes also contained references to right-wing conspiracy websites, according to the records.\n Prosecutors have not accused Coffman of participating in the attack on the Capitol building. His lawyer, Tony Miles, said at a hearing on January 12 that Coffman was \"innocent\" of the charges and questioned the strength of the case. He noted that Coffman was an Army veteran who fought in Vietnam.\n A federal judge ruled January 12 that Coffman would remain in jail while he awaits trial on the weapons charges.\n Cudd, a former mayoral candidate in Midland, Texas, faces two charges, according to the US Department of Justice.\n Cudd, who posted a video on the eve of the riot in which she talked about how the next day was going to be a \"ruckus,\" is charged with knowingly entering a restricted building and knowingly impeding or disrupting the orderly conduct of government business.\n A criminal complaint states that Cudd and another person were photographed inside the Capitol and that Cudd livestreamed a video on Facebook sometime after the actual forced entry of the building.\n \"Jenny Cudd also stated in the video, the following indicating her presence inside the US Capitol, 'We did break down the Nancy Pelosi's office door and somebody stole her gavel and took a picture sitting in the chair flipping off the camera,'\" the court document says.\n Don Flanary, Cudd's lawyer, told CNN that she \"was arrested by the FBI this (Wednesday) morning and brought before a magistrate in Midland.\" She has been released on bond.\n Flanary said Cudd plans to plead not guilty.\n Evans, who at the time was a West Virginia state lawmaker, is in a video that shows him in a crowd that broke through a large, ornamental Capitol Hill door, authorities say.\n Evans was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n A federal magistrate judge in West Virginia released Evans on his personal recognizance after he appeared in court January 8, according to court records.\n Evans, who has denied taking part in destruction and violence, resigned from the West Virginia House of Delegates on January 9.\n \"I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians. I hope this action I take today can remove any cloud of distraction from the state Legislature, so my colleagues can get to work in earnest building a brighter future for our state.\"\n CNN obtained video that federal prosecutors say Evans livestreamed on Facebook -- and later deleted -- while in the crowd.\n Although he deleted the video, according to a criminal complaint, someone uploaded a copy of it to Reddit. Prosecutors claim in the criminal complaint that Evans is the man heard in the video.\n In the video, Evans is heard asking someone, at one point outside the Capitol, \"Are they still fighting the cops there?\"\n \"We're in,\" Evans yells once inside the Capitol, as others continue to enter the building.\n Evans has said he only filmed the event as an \"independent member of the media to film history,\" though it does not appear he has any experience working as one.\n However, Bryan told CNN in a statement January 7 that his client \"had no choice but to enter\" the Capitol due to the size of the crowd he was in, and that \"it wasn't apparent to Mr. Evans that he wasn't allowed to follow the crowd into this public area of the Capitol, inside which members of the public were already located.\"\n Video shows Jensen, 41, chasing a Black Capitol Police officer up some stairs during the riot, according to a CNN comparative analysis of his booking photo and posts on social media.\n On a Twitter account bearing his name, Jensen twice identified himself in one of the pictures that was circulating online after the riot. His neighbor in Des Moines, Iowa, confirmed to CNN affiliate KCCI that the man in the photos was Jensen.\n Jensen -- dressed in a QAnon T-shirt -- is also seen gesturing toward another Capitol police officer in an Associated Press photo taken by photojournalist Manuel Balce Ceneta.\n In video captured by the Huffington Post's Igor Bobic, Jensen -- wearing the same QAnon T-shirt -- is seen chasing Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman with a mob of rioters following him. Once at the top of a set of stairs, the officer glances toward a doorway to his left that leads to the Senate floor and moves away from it and toward the camera, steering the mob away from the Senate floor.\n Jensen was arrested on suspicion of being involved in a violent crowd breaking into the Capitol, according to the FBI and local authorities in Iowa.\n FBI officials presented Jensen to Polk County Jail for processing on January 9.\n He faces federal charges including unlawfully entering the Capitol, disrupting government business, violent entry and parading in a Capitol building and blocking law enforcement during the riot, according to the FBI.\n CNN's attempts to contact a lawyer for Jensen weren't immediately successful.\n Johnson, 36, was arrested in Florida days after the riot, accused of stealing the House speaker's lectern, according to a news release.\n Johnson was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; one count of theft of government property; and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n Johnson was released on a $25,000 signature bond, CNN affiliate WFTS reported. He is subject to a monitoring system and curfew, had to surrender firearms and his passport, and is due January 19 in federal court in Washington, WFTS reported.\n Attorneys for Johnson said a viral picture showing him with carrying the lectern at the Capitol could be problematic moving forward with his case, according to the affiliate.\n \"Mr. Johnson, clearly, is taking this very seriously,\" attorney David Bigney said, according to video posted by WFTS.\n \"What we're dealing with is a lot of notoriety, simply because of a photograph that was taken in an instant, a lot of judgment based on that photograph, which has led to death threats to Adam and his family.\"\n Keller, who won five Olympic swimming medals, including two relay golds, was charged January 13, according to court documents.\n Keller was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and obstructing law enforcement engaged in official duties incident to civil disorder, according to documents filed in US District Court in Washington, DC.\n It is unclear whether Keller is in custody. CNN has been unable to contact Keller for comment.\n The court documents say Keller was identified by media outlets such as SwimSwam, which covers competitive swimming.\n FBI Special Agent Matthew R. Barofsky wrote in court documents that he confirmed Keller's identity by comparing riot photos to his Colorado driver's license.\n The photos from the Capitol also show Keller is wearing a US Olympic Team jacket and \"appears to be one of the tallest individuals,\" Barofsky writes in his statement of facts. Keller is 6 feet, 6 inches tall.\n Meredith arrived in Washington, DC, from Colorado on the day of the riot with hundreds of rounds of ammunition and an assault rifle -- and he texted acquaintances on the next day that he wanted to shoot or run over Pelosi, authorities alleged in federal court records.\n He was charged with making interstate threats to Pelosi and possession of an unregistered firearm.\n In court documents, the FBI wrote that it found Meredith in a Washington hotel room after getting a tip about one of the texts. He had driven to Washington but arrived too late to attend the rally that preceded the riot, the court documents say.\n Meredith had sent a text message on January 6 that said he was headed to Washington with \"a s**t ton of ... armor piercing ammo,\" and another on January 7 saying that he was thinking of \"putting a bullet in [Pelosi's] noggin on Live TV,\" according to court documents.\n At one point, after a recipient of the texts expressed concern, Meredith replied back, 'Lol, jus havin fun,'\" the court documents read.\n Meredith let the FBI search his hotel room, phone, truck and its trailer. Inside the trailer, agents found two guns -- a 9 mm Glock 19 pistol and a Tavor X95 assault-style rifle -- and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to the court documents.\n A federal judge ruled January 14 that Meredith should remain in jail as he awaits trial.\n \"If I had a more concerning threats case come before me, I don't remember it,\" said Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey of the DC District Court.\n Meredith's attorney said Meredith simply came to Washington to take part in a rally that he believed would be a repeat of others he thought were \"a lot of fun.\" The attorney argued that Meredith was joking in the texts about assassinating officials and could safely be tracked if he were released.\n But Harvey rejected that and other arguments, including the defense attorney's assertion that the law shouldn't allow threats alone to result in detention.\n \"You took steps to come here ... you drove all the way across the country from Colorado and you brought with you the means to make good on your threats,\" the judge said after reading Meredith's texts out loud.\n Munchel, of Tennessee, was identified as the man seen in photos and videos inside the Capitol wearing paramilitary gear and carrying plastic restraints, an item in a holster on his right hip, and a cell phone mounted on his chest with the camera facing outward, according to an affidavit in the criminal complaint filed against him in US District Court in Washington, DC.\n He was arrested January 10 in Tennessee. He was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n Munchel had been first stopped by law enforcement officers on January 6 because he was carrying a Taser while attending the rally, telling them it was for self-protection, according to his charging documents.\n The FBI followed images of Munchel leaving the hotel without a face mask and carrying a drink as President Donald Trump was speaking to supporters, just before the assault on the Capitol.\n Ochs, founder of Proud Boys Hawaii, was arrested January 7 at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, authorities said.\n He was charged with one count of unlawful entry into restricted buildings or grounds and was released from jail January 11 ahead of his next court date, set for January 27.\n In a charging document, investigators cited a tweeted photo and an interview he did with CNN as evidence.\n \"Hello from the Capital lol,\" Ochs tweeted January 6, with an image of himself smoking a cigarette in the Capitol building.\n \"We didn't have to break in. I just walked in and filmed,\" Ochs told CNN in an interview the night of the riot. \"There were thousands of people in there -- they had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned.\"\n Ochs claimed in the interview with CNN that he was working as a professional journalist when he entered the Capitol, and that he didn't go into any congressional offices or the chambers.\n Packer, of Virginia, has been identified as a man who was inside the Capitol wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the phrase \"Camp Auschwitz,\" according to three sources who spoke with CNN.\n He was arrested on the morning of January 13 in Newport News, Virginia, on charges of entering the Capitol without permission and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to an arrest warrant.\n Before his arrest, Packer had not responded to CNN's requests for comment.\n An image of the sweatshirt, bearing the name of the Nazi concentration camp where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II, evoked shock and disbelief on social media. The bottom of the shirt stated, \"Work brings freedom,\" which is the rough translation of the phrase \"Arbeit\u202fmacht frei\" that was on the camp's gates.\n Robertson and Fracker, two officers with Virginia's Rocky Mount Police Department, were charged with entering restricted grounds and violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to federal court documents released January 13.\n Robertson and Fracker -- off-duty at the time -- posed for a photo in front of a statue of a Revolutionary War general in the Capitol during the riot, with one making an obscene hand sign, according to the federal complaint.\n The two appear to have been the first law enforcement officers charged with criminal violations related to the riots.\n They shared the photo with colleagues, and Robertson later posted it online, court records say.\n The photo was taken after the Capitol was in lockdown, court documents read.\n Prosecutors also found a social media post from Robertson that says he was \"f***ing PROUD\" of the photo, according to the complaint.\n The complaint says that Fracker, in his own social media post, acknowledged the photo of him inside the Capitol and wrote \"sorry I hate freedom?\"\n Robertson told CNN affiliate WSET that Capitol Police officers gave them water and asked them to stay within roped areas.\n \"There was absolutely no indication that we were anything but welcome to check out certain places,\" Robertson told WSET. \"We did not participate in any violence or property damage.\"\n The complaint cites reports that Robertson claimed he had been escorted \"in\" by Capitol police and that he made social posts that he had \"attacked the government.\"\n The CEO of Chicago-area marketing technology firm Cogensia, Rukstales breached the US Capitol and was arrested, authorities said.\n He has been charged with \"knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; or knowingly, with intent to impede government business or official functions, engaging in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds; and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds,\" the Justice Department said.\n Rukstales has been terminated from his job, according to Cogensia, whose acting CEO noted, \"Rukstales' actions were inconsistent with the core values of Cogensia.\"\n Rukstales has apologized for what he called a \"moment of extremely poor judgment,\" according to a statement posted on Twitter. \"It was the single worst personal decision of my life.\"\n \"It was great to see a whole bunch of people together in the morning and hear the speeches, but it turned into chaos,\" Rukstales told CNN affiliate WBBM, admitting he was inside the Capitol.\n \"I had nothing to do with charging anybody or anything, or any of that,\" he said. \"I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n The Utah man who was shooting video when a woman was fatally shot by Capitol Police was arrested January 14, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.\n Sullivan has been charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and interfering with law enforcement, according to a criminal complaint.\n Sullivan entered the US Capitol through a broken window and shot about 50 minutes of video that documented his journey through the landmark as it was inundated with rioters, an arrest warrant alleges. He told law enforcement, others inside and news outlets in the hours and days that followed that \"he was at the U.S. Capitol only to document and report,\" the complaint says.\n In one portion of his video, as rioters were hitting against a door inside the building, Sullivan \"can be heard saying, 'That's what I'm sayin', break that sh*t,'\" the complaint alleges.\n At another point, Sullivan \"can be heard telling officers, 'you are putting yourself in harm's way,' 'the people have spoken,' and 'there are too many people, you gotta stand down, the people out there that tried to do that sh*t, they got hurt, I saw it, I'm caring about you,'\" prosecutors allege.\n Sullivan was scheduled to have his initial appearance in a Utah federal court on January 15, according to a Department of Justice website.\n It is unclear from court records whether he has an attorney. CNN has reached out to the Utah federal public defender's office but was told they had no information on him.\n The Florida firefighter was arrested on suspicion of unlawfully entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to court documents, after a photo surfaced of him wearing a Trump 2020 hat and pointing at a placard for Pelosi inside the Capitol.\n Williams, a firefighter-paramedic with the Sanford Fire Department, appeared in federal court January 12 and was released on a $25,000 signature bond, documents show.\n Williams was placed on administrative leave without pay, according to a release from the fire department. Sanford Fire Chief Craig Radzak confirmed it was Williams in the photo and said Williams had been with the department as a firefighter-paramedic since October 2016.\n Williams' attorney blamed Trump and Capitol police for the attack.\n \"The President and the Capitol police encouraged despicable behavior,\" Vince Citro told CNN affiliate WESH.\n A man who was photographed holding a Confederate flag in the Capitol was arrested January 14 in Delaware in connection with the riot, as was his son, the Justice Department said.\n Kevin Seefried and his son, Hunter Seefried, have been charged with entering or remaining on restricted grounds and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court in Washington, DC.\n It was not immediately clear whether the two men had an attorney. CNN on January 14 attempted to reach the federal public defender in Wilmington, Delaware, to see whether it was representing them.\n Reuters and Getty photographers captured images of a man carrying the flag as he walked in the building.\n Both Seefrieds spoke to the FBI separately about being in the crowd that breached the Capitol, according to the criminal complaint.\n Prosecutors alleged that the Seefrieds \"entered the Senate Building through a broken window ... Shortly thereafter, Kevin Seefried was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag inside the Capitol building,\" the Justice Department said in a news release.\n Kevin Seefried told the FBI he had brought the Confederate flag with him to Washington from his home in Delaware, where he normally displays it outside, according to the complaint.\n The father-son duo had come to the Capitol on January 6 to hear Trump speak and they marched to the Capitol following a person with a bullhorn, they told the FBI, according to the complaint.\n The FBI learned of the men's names after one of Hunter Seefried's coworkers reported he had bragged about being inside the Capitol building with his father, the complaint says. Hunter Seefried is alleged to have punched glass out of a window in the Capitol, according to the court documents.\n CNN's Michelle Krupa, Paul P.

        "title": "Capitol riot tears GOP apart as it seeks a return to power in 2022",
        "body_text": "Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, the new chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, defended President Donald Trump on Wednesday when asked if his ally bore any responsibility for inciting a riot at the US Capitol, putting the onus of last week's death and destruction instead on the mob.\n \"He's not the one who made the decision to breach this Capitol,\" Scott said.\n Scott's comments came as the pro-Trump riot has torn apart the Republican Party, setting off a backlash among some donors, a historic second impeachment of the President and a fight over how best to build a path back to power.\n After losing the House, Senate and White House in four years, Trump remains broadly popular within the GOP. But the riot has led a small group of House Republicans -- including Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 in GOP leadership in the chamber -- to support his impeachment. Republican senators are now seriously considering whether to convict him of the charge, \"incitement of insurrection,\" after five people died in the attack.\n The Florida Republican told CNN that he wished Trump \"responded faster\" to quell the violence, calling the riot \"unacceptable\" and \"un-American\" and for some of the insurrectionists to be prosecuted.\n But he did not hold Trump accountable for the attack, even though the President urged his supporters in a speech before the riot on January 6 to march to the Capitol, to \"fight like hell\" to save the country, and to \"stop the steal.\" Trump said then that he would \"never give up\" and \"never concede.\"\n \"I think it's irresponsible and false to say the President told people to break into the Capitol,\" Scott said. \"He didn't do that.\"\n The party's divide extends to the money machine that keeps it in office.\n The US Chamber of Commerce, corporate political action committees and major conservative donors are reevaluating whether they will donate to the 147 Republican members of Congress who objected to certifying the presidential election on the day of the attack in a deluded bid to overturn the results. Those members include Scott and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who cited voter integrity concerns.\n The business community has recoiled in horror at the violence, potentially impairing Republicans' fundraising effort to flip both the House and Senate in 2022.\n The donor revolt is \"going to make every Republican's job that much harder,\" said Ken Spain, a GOP strategist. Spain said the corporate pushback now under way illustrates a fissure between corporate America and rank-and-file Republicans on issues such as free trade that has only grown wider in recent years.\n \"The party was already becoming a more populist working-class party and Trump accelerated that,\" he said. \"Republicans are at a fork in the road, and the direction that they choose to take in the coming days and weeks is going to have a profound impact on the future of the party.\"\n Scott, a former governor who voted last week against certifying Biden's win, downplayed the donors' outcry, saying that he conducted fundraising meetings between Thursday and Monday and \"everybody's excited to help.\"\n \"Corporations, individuals, they have a choice,\" the senator said. \"If you believe in a big government, less freedoms, socialism, you ought to actually put all your money into supporting the Democrats. If you want opportunity, and lower taxes and less government, you're going to support Republicans.\"\n Some major American companies, including Amazon and CNN's owner AT&T, have announced they will withhold PAC donations to those who objected to certifying the election results. Many other firms, ranging from Coca-Cola to UPS, have suspended political donations across the board.\n Business PACs are significant players in politics, accounting for more than $360 million in federal contributions during the 2020 cycle -- with about 57% of the money flowing to GOP candidates, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the influential network affiliated with Kansas industrialist Charles Koch, has warned it could withdraw financial support for lawmakers over their actions in the runup to the January 6 siege, although even before last week's insurrection, Koch officials had signaled they wanted to move away from strictly partisan politics.\n \"Lawmakers' actions leading up to and during last week's insurrection will weigh heavy in our evaluation of future support,\" said AFP CEO Emily Seidel in a statement.\n The US Chamber of Commerce also warned that some lawmakers could lose financial support over their efforts to thwart the transfer of power but declined to single them out.\n \"We will take into account the totality of what candidates and elected officials do, including the actions of last week, and importantly, the actions in the days ahead in determining whether or not we support them,\" said Neil Bradley, the chamber executive vice president, on Tuesday. \"I actually want to be very clear: There are some members, who by their actions, will have forfeited the support of the US Chamber of Commerce.\"\n But when pressed on what Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who led the objection to the certification of the election in the Senate, would have to do to earn additional donations from the Chamber, Bradley said they would evaluate how members conducted themselves last week and in the days to come.\n \"I'm not prepared to say, nor would our members say today, that you have to do X, Y and Z and not do A, B and C,\" he said.\n Some major conservative donors have also focused their ire on the individual Republicans they view as having helped to instigate last week's events, particularly Hawley. Missouri businessman Sam Fox, who donated $300,000 to a super PAC that aided Hawley's election in 2018, said in a statement that the senator \"can certainly forget about any support from me again\" after last week's events.\n \"Sen. Hawley engaged in act of reckless pandering,\" said Fox, who served as US ambassador to Belgium under President George W. Bush. \"He helped put the country on a path that has ended in five deaths and in disgrace for himself and for the nation.\"\n Hawley aides did immediately respond to a request for comment. The senator wrote an op-ed for the Southeast Missourian newspaper explaining why he continued to object after the violence in the Capitol. \"The reason is simple: I will not bow to a lawless mob, or allow criminals to drown out the legitimate concerns of my constituents,\" Hawley wrote.\n Some top donors have remained silent in the aftermath of the riot.\n A spokeswoman for Ken Griffin, a billionaire hedge-fund manager and one of the GOP's biggest donors, declined to comment on whether he would review his donation policy.\n But others said they would stand by the Republicans in Congress. Dan Eberhart, an Arizona-based energy executive considering a bid against Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly in 2022, said, \"I have been a big donor to Rick Scott in the past and plan to continue to be.\"\n Eberhart said disaffected donors will \"make up with Republicans pretty quickly\" if the Democrats, who will soon control the White House and both chambers in Congress, \"overreach\" in their agenda. \"Donors will want the counterweight that Republican provide. More money may go to the leadership PACs, but it will still go to Republicans if those are the policies donors support,\" he added.\n After House Republicans picked up seats in 2020 and with the Senate split 50-50 -- and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to be the tiebreaker -- eyes will turn to next year's midterms. The party out of power typically does well in midterms, and in 2022, Senate Republicans will have more seats to defend than the Democrats, including in battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Democratic senators could have tough races in Arizona, New Hampshire, Nevada and elsewhere.\n Scott told CNN that he has three goals: presenting a \"clear choice\" to the country on how a Republican and Democratic Senate differ, raising more money and recruiting quality candidates. He said he hoped Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson would run for reelection, and that the GOP has \"a lot of opportunities to pick up additional seats.\"\n But Trump and his legacy will continue to shape the perceptions of the party in the next election. Already, Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, announced on Wednesday that the party is going up with a six-figure ad buy that blames Johnson for inciting the riot at the Capitol.\n The Florida senator said it's up to Trump and the Senate GOP candidates whether the then-former president hits the campaign trail on their behalf in 2022.\n When asked if he blamed Trump for losing the Senate, Scott said, \"My focus is on 'how do we go forward?' \"\n CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this story.",

        "title": "This Keurig-like machine for soft serve ice cream is what the world really needs",
        "body_text": "It's a rocky road to disrupt the ice cream industry, but sundae you may get your soft serve from a pod.\n A new machine called ColdSnap, which looks and functions like a Keurig for soft serve ice cream, has emerged as one of the buzziest products of this year's all-digital CES tech show. At a time when much of the event, like much of our lives, is focused on ways to adapt to the pandemic, the ColdSnap offers the promise of something sweeter, on demand.\n The system is marketed as taking shelf-stable, recyclable ice cream pods of varying flavors and freezing them in about 90 seconds before dispensing it into a cup or cone. The company is also working on pods for smoothies, frozen coffees, protein shakes, non-dairy ice cream and frozen cocktails, such as mud slides and daiquiris. The machine reads a QR code on top of the pod's label to find the specific freezing temperature for each product.\n The product, which is only in the prototype stage with plans to launch in select locations in the second quarter of 2021 and ship direct to consumers early next year, falls under the where has this been all my life? category. But the price point is less sweet than the product: $1,000. (The company said it aims to eventually bring it down by half.)\n Matthew Fonte, the serial entrepreneur behind the product, said it's been a big undertaking to create pods that are safe, convenient (little cleanup), cost effective and sustainable; the pod containers are aluminum like a soda can. Keurig and other one-time use pod makers have long been criticized for the inability to recycle their products.\n \"This is challenging and requires significant development and engineering expertise,\" said Fonte, who has a PhD in mechanical engineering from Tufts University. \"In the beginning, a lot of people didn't think it was [scientifically] possible to create ice cream like this in about a minute or so.\"\n The company says the machine simultaneously pulls heat from the pod, creating a cooling effect on the liquid ice cream mix, and engages a part within the pod that churns the ingredients during the cooling process. Air is sucked into the can to make the required loft in the ice cream.\n The idea started years ago when Fonte and his two daughters grew tired of reading the same books at bedtime and decided to write in \"invention journals.\"\n \"We included new toys, toothbrushes and hoola hoops,\" he told CNN Business. \"One day, they asked for an ice cream machine.\"\n He explained ice cream machines for the home aren't typically efficient; many require a bucket to be frozen overnight, a consistent mixing process and are a mess to clean up. \"What about a Keurig machine for ice cream?\" one daughter asked.\n The rest is histrawberry.\n Fonte's background played a significant role in jumpstarting the process. He and his brother worked alongside their father, an Italian immigrant, for 20 years in a metal working business, producing rocket motor cases for missiles. After they sold the business, they started another focused on super elastic orthopedic implants. His team from that company later left together to start ColdSnap.\n \"It's been really fun with my daughters, who have seen the whole beginning of starting a company, purchasing a 2,500 sq. ft. building, getting patents, and they have shares in the company,\" he said. \"I've been explaining how the investors invest in us and how we can't let them down.\"\n The company has since grown to an 18-person team. Despite the high price tag, Fonte said the company has \"thousands\" of sign-ups from people to buy the product. \"Sometimes we get notes on our website that just say, 'Hurry up. I need this.'\"\n Keurig-inspired ice cream machines aren't entirely new. LG demoed a frozen yogurt pod system prototype called SnowWhite at the 2019 SXSW conference in Austin, and startup Wim Yogurt developed a $299 frozen yogurt machine but suspended operations in 2018. Meanwhile, traditional at-home ice cream machines can cost less than $100.\n The cost of the ColdSnap system may conjure up memories of Juicero, the $400 web-connected Keurig-for-pressed-juice system backed by Google and others. It received $120 million in capital, but ultimately failed largely due to the price point, with many saying Silicon Valley was out of touch with the rest of the country. There were also reports customers could get the same result by squeezing the startup's juice packs with their bare hands as with the machine.\n ColdSnap, however, was originally intended for commercial spaces like break rooms in offices, car dealerships and student unions. When Covid hit earlier last year, the company refocused. Fonte said he aims to take the price down to $500 by switching stainless steel parts for plastic fixtures. The pods will cost $2.99 each when it launches.\n Keurig-like spinoffs are plentiful, ranging from pod coffee and pod cocktails to pod cookies. ColdSnap claims its product is a much cleaner play, due to the recyclable aluminum pods, which resemble Red Bull cans, and the process of keeping ice cream cold inside of the trucks that then transport it.\n Judging from the enthusiastic response, it appears people still want a product like this to become a reality. Fonte said US interest is high but he also sees opportunity in places such as India and China where the cold supply chain is spotty and could benefit from an on-demand system like ColdSnap.\n \"We hope that maybe someday, in 20 years, people will look back and say, 'Remember when ice cream was frozen the whole time. How crazy is that?'\"\n Perhaps innovation is a dish best served cold.",

        "body_text": "Chipmakers Intel, AMD and Nvidia took to the virtual stage at this week's trade show to reveal their new processors that promise to make graphics look better, load faster and improve computer performance.\n \"Our relationship with technology has fundamentally changed,\" said AMD CEO Lisa Su during a keynote speech on Tuesday. \"The pandemic has elevated technology to become an essential part of how we live, work, play and communicate. And at the center of all this technology is high performance computing.\"\n On Tuesday, AMD announced a lineup of new mobile processors for laptops from Asus, HP, Lenovo and other manufacturers. Nvidia said its new graphics card \u2014 the $329 GeForce RTX 3060 \u2014 will be released in February.\n Hardware companies Acer, Asus, Lenovo and others unveiled their latest computers and connected displays that put the new chips to use.\n Computers also face production shortages of parts, especially chips, as Asian factories recovered from an early 2020 slowdown and demand outstripped supply.\n For Taiwanese company Acer, the pandemic did not greatly disturb the introduction of its new product line including several new laptops and displays. Similarly, Asus, also headquartered in Taiwan, announced a lengthy lineup, from laptops to a projector and monitor.\n Acer said that it's benefited from Taiwan being a coronavirus haven.\n \"Because Taiwan's been almost not affected [by the coronavirus pandemic] really, and that's our world headquarters, all the product development has been going very smoothly,\" said Acer Pan America president Gregg Prendergast. \"Our factories are mainly all in China... they were a little spotty in calendar Q2 but they've been pretty operational ever since June.\"\n Prendergast said that since Acer spun off its own factories more than 20 years ago, it can  nimbly choose what factory to work with, giving it more flexibility during the pandemic.\n Acer has a significant business in education, providing Chromebooks to students, and in gaming laptops and displays. Traditionally, the brand attracts PC gamers but it's gradually expanding to console gamers as well, offering a new display that supports gaming on the new PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X with optimized graphics.\n \"It depends on how some of these products do. If they start getting sticky and start selling well, we'll certainly expand the portfolio for sure,\" said Prendergast.\n Despite many tech companies including Acer reporting record sales, all isn't sunny for chipmakers.\n Intel debuted new processors for computers on Monday, including 11th generation Intel chips for gaming.\n On Wednesday, Intel also ousted its CEO Bob Swan, naming his replacement, Pat Gelsinger. Under Swan, Intel struggled, losing market share to competitors on important segments.\n Apple made waves last year when reports said that it would phase out using Intel chips in its Macs and make its own instead.\n Intel told CNN Business on a call last week that Apple's decision frees up the chipmaker to \"figure out how we go out and compete against those [Apple] products.\" Intel said it would focus on delivering the best experiences on Windows, Chrome and Linux, while it competes against Mac products.",

In Oklahoma, House members were told not to come to the state capitol this weekend due to concerns about possible protests. Fencing has been erected around the Arizona state capitol \"out of an abundance of caution\" and Oregon State Police will be assisted by the National Guard as they deal with possible demonstrations.\n Those concerns are bolstered by new warnings from federal officials that last Wednesday's attack on the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump will likely motivate additional follow-on attacks by extremists throughout 2021, according to an intelligence bulletin dated Wednesday and obtained by CNN.\n Warning that the people who attacked the Capitol largely viewed their efforts as a success, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the attack \"very likely will serve as a significant driver of violence\" for a diverse set of domestic extremists, according to the bulletin.\n The joint US government intelligence bulletin was first reported by The New York Times.\n \"The violent breach of the US Capitol Building is very likely part of an ongoing trend in which (extremists) exploit lawful protests, rallies, and demonstrations, and other gatherings to carry out ideologically-motivated violence and criminal activity,\" the intelligence bulletin warned.\n The range of potential future targets of attack was varied, with intelligence officials warning in the bulletin that extremists could zero-in on government officials and institutions, as well as racial and religious minorities, journalists and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n The bulletin also indicated that the January 6 attack may have served as a venue for extremists of differing ideological motivations to foster connections.\n In addition to the perceived success of the January 6 Capitol attack, intelligence officials warned that the response by law enforcement could also motivate extremists to respond with violence, including at Biden's upcoming inauguration.\n \"Since the (Capitol attack), violent online rhetoric regarding the (inauguration) has increased, with some calling for unspecified 'justice' \" for a rioter shot by police inside the Capitol, the bulletin said.\n Other motivations for possible future attacks included anti-government views held by extremists, as well as grievances associated with the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n \"The increasing prevalence and influence of conspiracy theories based on a belief in the existence of global or 'deep state' actors who work to manipulate various social, political, and/or economic conditions of the United States very likely serves as a driver of some (extremist) violence,\" the report said.\n The conspiracy theory-laden language observed by US intelligence officials has often mirrored baseless claims made by Trump. Throughout his presidency, Trump has claimed without evidence that a nefarious group of \"deep state\" actors have been secretly working to undermine his presidency, and he has continually spread disinformation about the integrity of the 2020 election.\n As law enforcement prepares to respond to upcoming protests before and during the inauguration, FBI Director Chris Wray and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli held a call Wednesday with law enforcement leaders from around the country to provide a briefing on the nationwide threat picture relating to planned protests, according to a person briefed on the call.\n The source said the FBI briefed their law enforcement partners on intelligence reporting indicating protesters planned to conduct \"peaceful, armed demonstrations\" in Washington, DC, and at state capitols around the US on January 17 to protest the results of the 2020 election.\n An FBI spokesperson confirmed the call, but did not provide additional details.\n As CNN previously reported, an internal FBI bulletin disseminated to law enforcement warned that \"armed protests\" were being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington in the days leading up to the inauguration.\n The FBI indicated federal law enforcement is currently working to identify any suspected extremists who may pose a threat at the planned armed demonstrations.\n On the call, FBI officials said they remain concerned about the prospect of extremists appearing at planned rallies and conducting violence, and that violent domestic extremists continue to pose the most significant threat to Biden's inauguration, according to another source familiar with the call.\n \"The chatter is off the charts right now,\" one official told CNN on Tuesday regarding extremists talking online about future actions.\n Federal officials stressed on the call with state, local, tribal and college campus law enforcement leaders that the FBI will not tolerate extremists using the First Amendment as a guide to incite violence, adding that they expect threats will continue past Biden's inauguration, the source said.\n In addition to the potential threats at government buildings, officials discussed seeing an increased number of threats to private companies and their executives in recent days.\n According to the source, federal officials said on the call that Russian actors have been amplifying the false narrative that members of Antifa infiltrated Trump supporters during the riot at the US Capitol, and the Chinese have seized on news stories showing chaos in the US.\n Another government report is shedding light on how law enforcement officials are monitoring the threat of potential violence in the coming days.\n According to an internal US Secret Service report dated January 11 and obtained by CNN, analysts with the Secret Service's team responsible for monitoring websites and social media for planned demonstrations note that protesters unhappy with the 2020 election results are using online platforms to organize events in the Washington area and around the country.\n In one online forum observed by investigators, the report indicated that a group calling itself \"American Patriots Nationwide\" is organizing a violent demonstration in Washington beginning on January 16. On its website, the group indicated it plans to use its members to surround the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court, and only allow the entry of people designated by Trump.\n The Secret Service report said the American Patriots Nationwide group also planned to detain Democratic politicians who \"played a role in planning or executing or supporting the attempted coup of the United States of America from 2016 to 2020.\"\n The Secret Service bulletin did not offer an assessment on the realistic nature of the planned rallies nor how much confidence investigators have in the ability of organizers to achieve their stated objectives.\n According to the report, groups associated with the Boogaloo movement planned to host an armed march from the Washington Monument to the White House, and encouraged its members to bring weapons.\n Other separate events noted in the Secret Service report similarly encouraged protest attendees to come armed, although organizers did not explicitly encourage violence.\n The District of Columbia has some of the strictest gun laws in the country and the open carrying of firearms is prohibited.\n For Inauguration Day, the Secret Service report indicated that analysts identified more than 35 rallies being planned online around Washington.\n One event dubbed the Million Militia March encouraged attendees to bring weapons. \"The group claims they will not attack, but will defend,\" the Secret Service report noted.\n As part of its protective mission, the Secret Service routinely reviews so-called \"open source intelligence\" to review planned rallies and protests staged near official events. The Secret Service report obtained by CNN indicated that recent efforts by social media companies to suspend users engaged in election-related disinformation has, in effect, hindered the ability of analysts to identify some details of planned inauguration protests.\n Not all of the planned demonstrations listed in the Secret Service report were pro-Trump.\n According to analysts, one group is planning a rally called \"Smoking to Trump's Sorrow,\" in which attendees will join to together to smoke marijuana and celebrate the end of Trump's presidency.\n Another planned DC event, dubbed the \"Lesbian U-Haul Trump Out Parade\" is being organized to help move Trump out of the White House, although the Secret Service did not indicate what logistics the group planned to employ to accomplish its stated goal.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen, Christina Carrega and Evan Perez contributed to this report",

        "title": "Trump releases video calling for calm but doesn't mention impeachment",
        "body_text": "On the day he was impeached for a history-making second time, President Donald Trump lacked a comprehensive legal strategy, had nothing on his public schedule and was without his preferred social media methods of responding -- in part because his son-in-law put a stop to efforts establishing his presence on fringe platforms after he was banned from Twitter.\n It amounted to near-invisibility for the President at the most perilous moment of his presidency, which is ending in tumult and dramatic rebuke from members of his own party.\n After the House voted 232 to 197 to impeach him -- with the support of 10 Republicans -- Trump released a video statement that did not mention the historic development that had occurred a few hours earlier.\n Instead, he delivered a call for calm as the threat of new riots -- which Trump said he'd been briefed on by the Secret Service -- casts a pall over Washington. That briefing took place on Monday and played a role in the President's decision to record the video, an official told CNN.\n \"No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,\" he said from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n \"Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers and help to promote peace in our country,\" he said.\n At the end of the spot, which was recorded by the White House and not independent television cameras, Trump decried what he called the \"unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days.\"\n \"Efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous,\" he said. \"What is needed now is for us to listen one another, not to silence one another.\"\n Aides had expected Trump to mostly watch the proceedings on television throughout the day. His only event was awarding the National Medal of Arts behind closed doors to Toby Keith, the \"Should've Been a Cowboy\" country star, and Ricky Skaggs, the bluegrass musician.\n Trump issued a statement through the White House in the afternoon that insisted \"there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind.\"\n But without Twitter, a campaign rally, a team of lawyers or Republicans willing to defend his actions, Trump weathered the historic shaming in subdued fashion.\n That's a distant cry from the first time he was impeached, when aides organized a campaign rally in the aptly named Battle Creek, Michigan, to coincide with the House vote.\n At the rally, which occurred at the same time members were impeaching him, his press secretary emerged in the crowd to hold up a placard displaying the vote total.\n \"We got every single Republican (to vote) for us!\" Trump crowed when he saw the final tally, adding at another point: \"It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached.\"\n That is not how it feels this time. A handful of Republicans voted to impeach him, including Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is said to believe impeachment will help oust Trump from the GOP for good. According to a person familiar with his reaction, Trump was particularly incensed Tuesday night by Cheney's announcement, which said he'd betrayed the office of the presidency.\n While other Republicans opposed impeachment because they said it was \"divisive,\" most did not defend Trump on the merits of what he was being impeached for: inciting an insurrection.\n Trump's venues for responding to the impeachment were similarly limited. Ordinarily, aides would look to Twitter for the President's first response to being the only president in history to be impeached twice. So, too, would Republican members of Congress fear what might appear on Trump's feed if they decided to break with him and vote for his impeachment.\n But Trump's account has been permanently suspended -- and with it his principal weapon for ensuring GOP loyalty.\n While Trump has railed against his suspension, telling reporters this week that free speech was under assault, CNN has learned of a new effort by one of his top advisers to keep him from emerging on fringe platforms in place of the major ones he was banned from.\n Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner intervened when other officials tried restoring the President's social media presence on sites that are often havens for extremists, such as Gab, following an unprecedented ban from several major platforms.\n According to an outside adviser and an administration official, Kushner and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino blocked efforts by other aides, including personnel chief Johnny McEntee, to get the President on fringe social media platforms after he was suspended in some fashion from almost every major one, including Twitter, Facebook and, now, YouTube.\n Those officials had initially attempted to use other Twitter accounts, including those run by campaign officials, to tweet in Trump's name.\n Without Twitter, Trump has turned to more traditional methods of communication. On Wednesday, as more Republicans came forward to say they would vote to impeach Trump, the President issued a statement through his press office calling for no violence \"amid reports of more demonstrations.\"\n \"That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You,\" Trump wrote in the 270 character statement, which would have fit neatly into a tweet.\n Lawmakers and senior aides had been pleading with Trump to issue a statement saying as much while bracing for more members of his own party to vote against him.\n The White House said in a statement this week it opposes impeachment, and Trump railed against the proceedings on Tuesday.\n \"It's causing tremendous anger and division and pain far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time,\" he said during his visit to Texas. The White House statement, from deputy press secretary Judd Deere, read: \"A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country.\"\n Trump's second impeachment comes at a time when he has been more isolated than ever. Several of his Cabinet secretaries -- the ones who haven't resigned in protest -- are avoiding him, his relationship with the vice president remains fractured and several of his senior staffers are scheduled to depart their posts this week.\n That included longtime adviser Hope Hicks, whose last day was Tuesday.\n Several top aides told CNN they don't plan to delay their exit because of the President's impeachment.\n At the White House, Trump's defenses are almost invisible. The mood inside the building is dark and \"everybody's angry at everyone,\" one White House adviser told CNN. The President is \"in self-pity mode\" because he believes not enough people are defending him, the White House adviser said, adding that Trump is complaining that he's been under siege for five years and he views his latest impeachment as a continuation of that criticism.\n But the view among many close to Trump is \"his actions led to here, no one else,\" the adviser said, adding, \"He instigated a mob to charge on the Capitol building to stop decertification, he's not going to find a lot of sympathetic Republicans.\"\n Two sources told CNN Trump has said he is bringing Alan Dershowitz back after his stint defending Trump during the first impeachment proceedings. Trump has told people that Dershowitz's defense of him on the Senate floor saved him during his last trial.\n Trump has told people to stop paying Rudy Giuliani's legal fees, a person familiar with the matter told CNN, though aides were not clear if the President was serious about his instructions. The Washington Post first reported the details of Giuliani's legal fees.\n Trump has been blaming his longtime attorney and many others for the predicament he now finds himself in, though he has not personally accepted any responsibility in public or in private, people familiar with his reaction told CNN. Giuliani is still expected to play a role in Trump's impeachment defense but has been left out of most conversations thus far.\n Several prominent figures from Trump's last impeachment -- including Jay Sekulow and Kenneth Starr -- have declined to get involved. The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, is also not expected to play a role, and considered resigning in the wake of last week's insurrection. Trump has been dismissive of Cipollone for months now.\n Trump has discussed issuing pardons for himself and his children with new urgency since the attack on the US Capitol, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. One person close to the President believes it's a bad idea for him to pardon himself and his kids in the wake of the riots, but that he wants to exercise what remaining power he has \"to the Nth degree.\"\n However, aides and allies are concerned over the public perception of a pardon following the Capitol riot, which led to the deaths of five people. Sources tell CNN there is dissent inside the West Wing from those appalled by the attack, many of whom are pushing up against a President whose main concern is protecting himself and his family.\n Still, Trump is hoping that a batch of pardons, which could come as early as Thursday, will distract from his historic impeachment and the fallout from the insurrection, the White House adviser said.\n While some aides have worked to organize events this week burnishing what remains of Trump's legacy -- such as Middle East diplomacy and deregulation -- he has shown little interest.\n His remarks touting border wall construction in Texas on Tuesday lasted for only 20 minutes and were overtaken by his comments blaming \"anger\" on the impeachment and his suspension from social media platforms.\n The only other event on his schedule for this week -- a Thursday Medal of Freedom ceremony honoring New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick -- is off after Belichick said he would not attend.\n CNN's Pamela Brown and Jamie Gangel contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Members of Congress are starting to express fears about the vulnerable position last week's violent breach of the US Capitol put them in, as well as concerns they have about their security going forward and some controversial new security measures.\n \"I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said on Instagram Live on Tuesday. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that many, many members of the House were nearly assassinated.\"\n But with the inauguration just a week away, all security efforts have been focused on planning ahead, giving little room for investigations to look back and decipher how security was breached and what went wrong.\n Extreme measures are being taken in light of the insurrection with thousands of National Guard members deployed to the Capitol and high fencing securing the border, but one example that has become a flashpoint for tensions around security at the Capitol are the metal detectors installed outside the House floor for all members and staff to go through.\n Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who has previously bragged about her desire to carry a weapon on Capitol Hill and was accused of disclosing Speaker Nancy Pelosi's location during the last week's raid, was involved in a standoff with Capitol Police at the newly installed metal detectors when trying to get on the floor Tuesday night.\n \"It is clear metal detectors would not have deterred the violent acts we saw; this political stunt does nothing to improve the safety of Members in the Capitol complex,\" Boebert said in a statement to CNN after the altercation.\n GOP Reps. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Steve Womack of Arkansas yelled at Capitol Police when they were forced to go through the metal detectors. Womack shouted, \"I was physically restrained,\" and Mullin said, \"it's my constitutional right\" to walk through and \"they cannot stop me.\"\n Pelosi on Wednesday proposed a new rule imposing stiff fines on members who refuse to follow new security rules. The fines -- which will be deducted from members' salaries -- will be $5,000 for the first offense and $10,000 for the second offense.\n \"It is tragic that this step is necessary, but the Chamber of the People's House must and will be safe,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n \"I'm more likely to die of Covid because I got it from a colleague than I am to die because a colleague shoots me,\" Rep. Filemon Vela, Democrat of Texas told CNN.\n Although the work of Capitol Police and law enforcement was vital to dismantling the threat against the Capitol, videos of officers wearing MAGA hats and taking selfies with rioters have raised deeper concerns about the sanctity of the police force.\n \"There were those acts of heroism, but next to that, there were also attacks of betrayal\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"And to run in the nation's Capitol and not know if an officer is there to help you or to harm you is also quite traumatizing.\"\n Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson of Indiana also shared how law enforcement failed him because he had to learn through press reports of court proceedings that he was the target of a man accused of bringing bombs and an arsenal to the Capitol last week. Prosecutors found Carson's name on a handwritten note in the possession of Lonnie Leroy Coffman whose truck was parked near the Capitol for hours last Wednesday and contained guns and bombs. Next to Carson's name, the note read, \"one of two Muslims in House of Reps.\" Carson is Muslim.\n \"It is extremely disturbing to learn from press reports that I was one of several individuals identified in a list of 'good guys' and 'bad guys' targeted for attacks,\" Carson said in a statement provided to CNN. \"As a former law enforcement officer, it is especially disappointing to see the failure of law enforcement officials, including the US Capitol Police, to notify individuals like myself that we were targeted and at risk from the indicted terrorist and his co-conspirators.\"\n As all eyes turn to preparations for the inauguration, there is still little information known about the ongoing investigation into the breakdown of intelligence that led up to January 6, giving room for members to start raising their own theories about what happened.\n Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill said on Facebook Live on Tuesday that she believes members of Congress led rioters around the Capitol the day before the violent attack.\n \"I saw on January 5, a reconnaissance for the next day,\" the New Jersey Democrat said. \"Those members of Congress that incited this violent crowd. Those members of Congress that attempted to help our President undermine our Democracy. I'm going to see that they're held accountable, and if necessary, ensure that they don't serve in Congress.\"\n Following her remarks, Sherrill told reporters on Capitol Hill she is requesting an investigation into those allegations.\n \"We're requesting an investigation right now with certain agencies\" Sherrill said Wednesday.\n Until more details about what happened are known, members continue to air out their grievances about the investigation publicly.\n Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, who was among the members to test positive for Covid after taking shelter as rioters took over the Capitol on Wednesday, told CNN he is extremely frustrated by the lack of information coming from Capitol Police as to what went wrong and what changes will be made as a result of the insurrection.\n \"I am frustrated, extremely frustrated that we have not had those briefings, not just us but to the American people. What happened, where it broke down, what we know, what we're learning from that, you get more briefings, from a local robbery than we've gotten on this,\" Schneider said.\n \"I have been a part of conversations and reports within the Democratic caucus. We have not had a full briefing. We can't have a classified briefing, at least I'm not, I don't have the technology to be a part of a classified briefing, so I haven't been a part of that.\"\n A high-level Democratic aide echoed to CNN, \"for every suspicious package on the Hill I will get 10 emails in real time.  Then when it comes to this biggest security breach in recent time, we hear very little.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.\n CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misspelled Rep. Mikie Sherrill's last name.\n CNN's Daniella Diaz and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Covid cases remain lowest among younger children, even after schools reopened, study says",
        "body_text": "A new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Covid-19 cases among younger children remained low even after schools restarted for in-person learning. To safely reopen schools, however, transmission in communities must be kept in check.\n The report, published Wednesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, considered more than 2.8 million laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases in people ages zero to 24 from March 1 through December 12. More than 57% of those cases occurred among people ages 18 to 24. Cases among children and teens paralleled cases among adults through the summer and fall -- including spikes in cases in early summer followed by a decline, and then a steep increase in October through December.\n By early December, 62% of US K-12 school districts had opened for full or partial in-person learning. Despite that, reports of school outbreaks were \"limited,\" CDC researchers wrote. Covid-19 incidence among the general population was similar in counties with in-person learning -- 401.2 cases per 100,000 people -- and those that were online only -- 418.2 per 100,000 people.\n There was no sign that increased cases among school-age children and teens preceded increases in other age groups; however, there were increases among other age groups after cases increased among people ages 18 to 24.\n To prevent coronavirus transmission in schools, transmission in the community must be controlled, the report said. Communities and schools should implement mitigation strategies such as wearing masks, and people must adhere to them. CDC recommendations already say K-12 schools should be the last to close after all other mitigation measures have been tried, and the first to reopen once it's safe to do so, the report noted.\n \"When community transmission is high, cases in schools should be expected, and as with any group setting, schools can contribute to COVID-19 transmission, especially when mitigation measures, such as universal and proper masking, are not implemented or followed,\" the report said.\n There are limitations to the report, including that Covid-19 cases are likely underestimated among young people, and case trends among teachers and school staff members are not available.\n President-elect Joe Biden has pledged that his administration will reopen most schools within 100 days of taking office.",

        "title": "Retired general: Trump needs to go",
        "body_text": "Lt. Gen. P. K. \"Ken\" Keen is a retired Army officer who previously served as military deputy commander of United States Southern Command. He is the associate dean of leadership development at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nWhen I retired from the Army in 2013 as a three-star general, I thought that retired military officers should not make public political statements. We take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, not to pledge alliance to certain political leaders. But the events of the last week have led me to reflect more deeply about what service to our country means. I can no longer remain silent because more than anything, it is a time for all citizens and leaders to stand up for our democracy. We must find ways to heal a very divided nation.\n After serving in countries where democracy and the rule of law were goals the people there could only aspire to achieve, it has been more than heartbreaking to see what I could never imagine happening in our own country. President Donald Trump must be removed from office as soon as the law allows, either by impeachment, the 25th Amendment, or best yet a voluntary resignation (as unlikely as that is).\n Like most Americans, over the last week I was horrified by the scene that unfolded in our nation's Capitol. The United States of America has been a shining light for the rest of the world when it comes to peaceful transitions of power. We are a country that, since the Civil War, even under the most challenging of times, passed power from one elected president to another in accordance with its historic Constitution. Even the losers of the closest of elections passed power with dignity and respect. That light has been dimmed during this historic crisis.\n Our leaders on both sides of the aisle should take action to hold everyone involved in the attack on our Capitol accountable. This includes not just those in the mob that killed a Capitol Police officer and vandalized the Capitol, but also those who incited the violence, including Trump.\n I have mixed feelings on which action is most appropriate. I do believe, Trump needs to step down now or Vice President Mike Pence needs to lead the effort to invoke the 25th Amendment, which would remove Trump from office.\n If the Vice President does not have the courage and leadership to take this action, then Congress should take matters into its hands. The House, which will vote on impeaching the President on Wednesday,  should send its article of impeachment, assuming it passes in the House, to the Senate after President Biden's inauguration. Leaders must lead, or they should step aside and resign if they are fearful for their personal safety or future of their political career.\n We ask our military and our young men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line every day in defense of our country. Right now, many of them are on the front line in Afghanistan and other places around the world. If political leaders are not ready to do the same and put their careers at risk by taking a stand against those whose actions may have provoked or encouraged the attack on our Capitol, resulting in the death of five Americans, they should resign. They are in the wrong role and do not deserve the honor and privilege to be our leaders. They should be held accountable and voted out of office.\n I realize many friends, some family, and others disagree with this view. I do not take it lightly. I also believe our country and institutions will endure this crisis. But now is the time for decisive action. My hope and aspirations for my children and grandchildren is that today's leaders can navigate this crisis to bring our nation together and ensure the light of democracy shines even brighter for future generations.",

        "body_text": "Hope Hicks' last day in the White House was Tuesday, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN, a final departure planned before the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.\n Hicks was one of President Donald Trump's most influential confidantes and a longtime loyalist but hasn't been at the White House much in recent weeks after she felt her influence waned after she pushed back on the President's baseless voter fraud claims, the sources said. She also urged him against pursuing legal challenges without competent lawyers in place.\n Hicks declined a CNN request for comment.\n Hicks resigned from her role as communications director in 2018, a day after she told lawmakers in closed-door testimony that she had told white lies in the course of her duties.\n Her departure also came in the wake of a scandal involving former senior aide Rob Porter, whose public defense Hicks helped craft while also dating him at the time.\n Porter resigned in disgrace after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of domestic abuse.\n Following her departure, she worked as the chief communications officer at Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News.\n She was once the recipient of Trump's repeated phone calls, the witness to his angriest moments, and, according to other campaign aides, the person who steamed wrinkles out of his pants. Hicks was also one of the few trusted aides who was often spotted in the White House residence.\n But her relationship with Trump shifted dramatically after she left the White House the first time.\n While testifying last June, Hicks told lawmakers she has only spoken to Trump between five and 10 times since she left the White House.\n However, Hicks remained in close contact with top White House adviser and the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner and other top White House aides.\n A onetime model, Hicks joined the Trump Organization working in public relations with Ivanka Trump and moved to Trump's presidential campaign early in the race. She remained one of the few aides to follow him from his political beginnings to the White House.\n Hicks maintained a close relationship not just with the President -- who called her \"Hopey\" -- but with members of his family, including Ivanka Trump and Kushner.\n This story has been updated to reflect the latest reporting.",

        "title": "20,000 National Guard troops expected in Washington for Biden's inauguration",
        "body_text": "More than 20,000 National Guard members could be in the nation's capital to help secure President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, as sources tell CNN that officials are considering raising the terrorism threat level and are worried about explosives being used in the capital city.\n The US Secret Service on Wednesday officially took charge of security for Biden's inauguration as authorities warned of new threats across the country after last week's violence at the Capitol.\n Multiple defense officials have told CNN that the National Guard and law enforcement expect improvised explosive devices (IEDs), like pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails, to be a threat in the unrest surrounding the inauguration in Washington. The planning is to assume perpetrators will come with high \"aggression,\" one senior defense official said.\n \"Their intentions are very serious,\" the official added.\n FBI Director Chris Wray and other federal officials said Wednesday on a call with nationwide law enforcement leaders they remain concerned about the prospect of extremists appearing at planned rallies and conducting violence, a source said.\n The physical security perimeter around the Capitol and other key buildings also continues to expand. Road blocks and steel barriers are extending many blocks from the Capitol. Road blocks are also being set up further out from the White House and the National Naval Observatory, where the vice president lives.\n The Secret Service is leading the overall security effort working in coordination with federal law enforcement agencies and the Pentagon. Multiple senior defense officials told CNN that there is a major interagency \"requirements\" meeting Wednesday to discuss in depth security requirements.\n Asked if he's ever seen this much law enforcement reinforcement coming to the District, the newly installed Washington, DC, Police Chief Robert Contee, who is a veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department and a lifelong DC resident, answered, \"not at this level, no.\"\n Multiple defense officials tell CNN that the total request for National Guard is close to 30,000 guardsmen to support US Capitol Police, Park Police and Washington Metropolitan Police Department but officials believe that the actual number needed is closer to 20,000. The final numbers will be provided by the Secret Service.\n The officials added that there is no concern that there will be any shortage of Guard forces to meet requirements from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n The more than 20,000 National Guard members expected for Biden's inauguration is more than three times the number of active duty US troops currently in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined, a staggering statistic that underscores just how massive the security presence will be.\n The Defense Department is meeting Trump's January 15 deadline to draw down the number of troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan to 2,500 in each country, according to the Pentagon. About 900 US troops will remain in Syria, multiple defense officials said.\n Biden has given no indication of wanting other than a small number of troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism missions.\n The numbers of US personnel in both Iraq and Afghanistan are likely higher officials said because hundreds of contractors provide services to the military in both countries.\n Discussions are underway about raising the terrorism threat level, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, though one source cautioned no changes are expected as of now.\n The National Terrorism Advisory System -- which replaced color-coded alerts of the Homeland Security Advisory System -- falls under the Department of Homeland Security. Advisories are pushed out in the event of an imminent or elevated threat to the public.\n One of the officials said the discussions began following last week's insurrection and was based on information that a similar attack by \"armed militias\" could happen at the Capitol or elsewhere.\n The latest advisory issued stemmed from an Iran-related terrorism threat to the United States last January. It's since expired. According to the DHS website, decisions about issuing an advisory, and what form it takes, are informed by \"intelligence assessments and risks to the public and critical infrastructure.\"\n DHS did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\n The Secret Service is taking the lead of inauguration security planning efforts as there is a growing concern among law enforcement officials that violent mobs' success in breaching the Capitol has increased the potential for attacks because people may be emboldened to carry out violence.\n \"The chatter is off the charts right now,\" one official said.\n CNN reported on Tuesday that thousands of armed pro-Donald Trump extremists are plotting to surround the US Capitol ahead of Biden's inauguration, according to a member of Congress who was among those briefed late Monday.\n But the Secret Service is prepared to secure the inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security's second-in-command Ken Cuccinelli told CNN, while acknowledging there are always \"problem players\" that show up.\n \"There's always problem players that talk before an inauguration, and there are always some that show up,\" Cuccinelli, the DHS senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary, when asked about threats to the upcoming event. Cuccinelli also said that the Secret Service is preparing for the possibility of a bigger security problem than the events of January 6 but added that the agency is \"thoroughly prepared to contend with it.\"\n Several officials told CNN that there is a much better feeling that things are organized and being put into place correctly because the Secret Service is in charge, with one official simply saying: \"They don't mess around.\"\n Cuccinelli, who has been the public face for the department on security issues since the Capitol attack, said the biggest change to security preparations has been moving the start date for the National Special Security Event (NSSE) up six days, with the official designation coming Wednesday morning.\n An NSSE is intended to bring in the full force of the federal government and its resources and puts the Secret Service as the lead for security operations.\n The security measures even include parking spots.\n DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said public parking garages in areas of downtown DC and near the Capitol will be closed off starting at 6:00 a.m. ET Friday through the inauguration. Any cars left in those garages will be inaccessible until after the Inauguration.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Vivian Salama, Alison Main and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The House voted Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time in a swift and bipartisan condemnation of the President's role inciting last week's riot at the US Capitol.\n RELATED: How each member of the House voted on Trump's second impeachment\n While impeachment won't force Trump from office -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said Trump won't face his trial until after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in next week -- the vote was a visceral response from lawmakers in both parties furious at Trump after a deadly pro-Trump mob overran Capitol Police, ransacked the US Capitol and put the lives of Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers in danger last week.\n \"We know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor ahead of the vote. \"He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\n The speed of the vote and the Republican support underscores the fury that lawmakers feel about Trump's role inciting the rioters who overtook the Capitol, who were fueled by Trump's months of false rhetoric about the election being stolen from him. Cheney's statement was cited by impeachment supporters and detractors alike Wednesday after she charged that Trump \"summoned this mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.\"\n LIVE UPDATES: House impeaches Trump after deadly Capitol riot\n \"There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\" Cheney said.\n House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that Trump \"bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters,\" urging the President to accept his share of responsibility and \"quell the brewing unrest.\" McCarthy, however, argued the House should create a bipartisan commission instead of impeachment.\n \"I believe impeaching the President in such a short timeframe would be a mistake,\" McCarthy said. \"No investigations have been completed. No hearings have been held.\"\n The division within the Republican Party starkly contrasts the House Democrats' 2019 impeachment of Trump, when House Republicans were united in opposition. The Republicans besides Cheney voting to impeach Trump on Wednesday were Reps. John Katko of New York, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Fred Upton of Michigan, Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, Dan Newhouse of Washington, Peter Meijer of Michigan, Tom Rice of South Carolina, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and David Valadao of California.\n Rice, a Republican from a conservative district who was not expected to vote for impeachment, said in a statement after the vote that it was the President's response to the riot that led him to cross the aisle.\n \"The President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were 'perfectly appropriate,'\" Rice said.\n \"I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable,\" the South Carolina Republican added.\n In the Senate, McConnell is not planning to bring the Senate back for a trial before January 19, meaning the trial won't begin until Trump is out of office and Biden has been sworn in.\n The majority leader said in a statement following the vote that a trial could not be completed ahead of Biden's inauguration even if it started beforehand, and he wanted Congress and the executive branch to spend the next week focused on \"facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power.\"\n In a note to his GOP colleagues Wednesday afternoon, McConnell wrote, \"I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\"\n McConnell has indicated he believes impeaching Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, sources said Tuesday. McConnell is facing a delicate balance -- a number of his GOP colleagues have made clear they oppose impeachment and the Kentucky Republican famously loathes anything that divides his conference, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n But the source says McConnell is also keenly aware of the moment in history -- and the moment for the Republican Party. McConnell's shift against Trump has been apparent for those watching him closely. He cut off contact with Trump weeks ago and has made clear he has no plans ever to speak to him again.\n For House Democrats, the disagreements that divided their caucus on impeachment in 2019 simply never materialized. Democrats quickly coalesced around using impeachment in the final days of Trump's presidency to serve as a proper response to the President's conduct and as a way to push for his removal from office before the end of his term, although that scenario looks unlikely.\n Pelosi has brushed aside Republican efforts to take a different action, such as censure, in response to Trump's role in the riot. She named impeachment managers on Tuesday evening, a team of nine Democrats who will be led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, ahead of a likely trial not long after Biden is sworn in. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said late Tuesday the House would send the articles to the Senate immediately.\n Democrats only grew more resolute in their push to impeach Trump over the riot as more information has come out about the attack on the Capitol, including violent images of Capitol Police officers being attacked, and the death of a Capitol Police officer. Wednesday's vote occurred while thousands of National Guard troops were present every nook of the Capitol complex ahead of next week's inauguration, and they slept on the floors of the Capitol building the night before the impeachment vote.\n After the House vote, Trump released a video statement calling for calm as the threat of new riots -- which Trump said he'd been briefed on by the Secret Service -- casts a pall over Washington. But he did not mention the historic impeachment that had occurred a few hours earlier.\n Trump has showed no contrition for his role in last week's Capitol riot, railing against impeachment on Tuesday in his first public remarks since the incident. A source close to the President said he's not considering resigning.\n \"It's been analyzed,\" Trump said of his remarks last week to the crowd before the riots. \"People thought what I said was totally appropriate.\"\n Wednesday's impeachment vote will complicate the opening days of the Biden administration, both in his efforts to reach out to Republicans and because the Senate is likely to be tied up with a trial just as Biden is taking office.\n In a statement Wednesday evening, the President-elect noted that \"it was a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience,\" before turning to the pandemic.\n \"This nation also remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\" Biden said. \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\"\n Biden is still awaiting word on whether the Senate will be able to do an impeachment trial alongside Cabinet confirmation hearings and Covid-19 relief legislation. Aides say Biden and his team are working behind the scenes with Senate Democrats -- and House impeachment managers -- to keep the impeachment trial as swift as possible, although the length remains an open question.\n Both Biden and Schumer have argued that the Senate will try to divide its days, so the Senate can confirm Biden's nominees and consider Covid-19 stimulus legislation while also carrying out the impeachment trial.\n House impeachment managers are just starting to lay out their strategy for the case they plan to bring and are wary about stepping on the first days of Biden's presidency.\n Several managers told CNN decisions have not been made over a key issue: Whether to seek witnesses and attempt to subpoena documents for the trial, which could prolong it.\n But McConnell indicating he's in no rush to bring the Senate back early into session, House managers have more time to begin their strategy sessions.\n Raskin told CNN that they are still assessing whether to seek witnesses.\n One possible witness is Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The article of impeachment references Trump's pressure campaign against the official to \"find\" the votes necessary to overturn Biden's win in the state.\n Asked if Raffensperger would be called as a witness, Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of nine impeachment managers, said she didn't \"want to preview\" the case and they were only just beginning organizational meetings.\n Democrats, though, seem to be wary about starting the trial on the same day Biden is sworn into office.\n \"Certainly not,\" Dean said when asked if it would be a good idea to start on January 20. \"The President and vice president deserve (their day)... We have to restore a peaceful transfer of power which Donald Trump deliberately incited people against.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.\n CNN's Daniella Diaz, Kristin Wilson, Donald Judd, Sarah Fortinsky, Pamela Brown, Jim Acosta, Jeff Zeleny and Sarah Mucha contributed to this report.",

He would tweet twice more before Twitter determined it had finally had enough and permanently suspended his account.\n YouTube said Tuesday that it is suspending Trump's channel for at least one week, and potentially longer, after his channel earned a strike under the platform's policies.",

        "title": "Questions swirl around possible 'insider' help for Capitol attack",
        "body_text": "One week after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, there are still more questions than answers on whether any lawmakers or police assisted the pro-Trump rioters.\n The idea of an insurrection is unheard of in modern US history, and the possibility that lawmakers or allies inside the Capitol were helping only contributes to the uncertainty and worry about the event and what's to come.\n At least one protest organizer said he coordinated with three House Republicans. There are unverified accusations of a \"reconnaissance\" mission one day before the attack. And more than a dozen US Capitol Police officers are under internal investigation for allegedly helping rioters.\n While President Donald Trump's role in inciting the violence is clear, there are some early indications and accusations that other insiders may have more actively aided the mob.\n Ali Alexander, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who led one of the \"Stop The Steal\" groups, claimed in a livestream video that he planned the rally that preceded the riot with three GOP lawmakers: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.\n Brooks spoke at the rally before Trump took the stage, and urged the crowd to \"start taking down names and kicking ass.\" In a 2,800-word statement about his involvement, Brooks said he was only telling the crowd to fight back at the ballot box. (Brooks also revealed that a White House official called him one day earlier and invited him to speak at the rally.)\n CNN previously reported that Gosar associated himself with Alexander's group in recent months. A spokesman for Biggs told CNN that he hasn't ever met or worked with Alexander.\n Alexander said he hoped his \"mob\" would pressure lawmakers to block President-elect Joe Biden's victory through the Electoral College. After the riot was quelled, the three lawmakers voted to throw out Biden's electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their effort failed.\n \"Those three members of Congress are going to need to lawyer up, very fast,\" former GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, a CNN contributor, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday, adding that he thinks the lawmakers will face scrutiny from federal prosecutors and the House Ethics Committee.\n Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a New Jersey Democrat, made waves Tuesday night when she accused unnamed Republican lawmakers of helping rioters by bringing them into the Capitol one day earlier for a \"reconnaissance\" mission of sorts. CNN has not yet verified those allegations.\n Sherrill said there were \"members of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on January 5th for reconnaissance for the next day.\" CNN has repeatedly asked Sherrill's office for details about her accusation, but they have not provided any additional information.\n She is a former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, and is seen as a moderate member of the Democratic caucus, and not a firebrand who would make accusations without merit. She said Wednesday that she was \"requesting an investigation\" with \"certain agencies,\" presumably to look into possible coordination between Republican lawmakers and rioters.\n Separately, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado was criticized for tweeting about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's whereabouts while the attack unfolded. Boebert, who is affiliated with the QAnon movement and regularly spreads right-wing conspiracy theories, tweeted that Pelosi had been \"removed from the (House) chambers\" while rioters were still in the building.\n More than 70 people have already been charged with federal crimes related to the attack. Most of the publicly disclosed cases involve people who fought with police officers inside the Capitol, made violent threats against Democrats, or were found near the complex with guns or bombs.\n Prosecutors haven't yet accused any of those Trump supporters of coordinating with Republican lawmakers or sympathetic police officers, but the massive investigation is still in its early stages.\n \"We're looking at significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy,\" Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney for Washington, DC, told reporters on Tuesday, without specifically saying whether any lawmakers or members of law enforcement were under investigation.\n But Sherwin added, \"Our office organized a strike force of very senior national security prosecutors and public corruption prosecutors. Their only marching orders from me are to build seditious and conspiracy charges related to the most heinous acts that occurred in the Capitol.\"\n At least two US Capitol Police officers have already been suspended, and at least 10 more are under investigation, for allegedly playing some sort of role in the insurrection, CNN reported.\n There was immediate speculation after the attack that some sympathetic police officers may have helped the rioters, given the fact that the raucous and at-times violent crowd seemed to mill about the Capitol complex with little resistance. One rioter even posed for a selfie with a cop.\n Current and former US military members also participated in the insurrection, according to news reports and court records. One of the men who infiltrated the Senate floor during the attack is a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, and the Army is reportedly investigating one psychological operations officer who led a group of North Carolinians to the Trump rally before the attack.\n Ashli Babbitt, the 35-year-old woman who was fatally shot by police while trying to breach the House chamber, was an Air Force veteran who later became consumed by conspiracy theories.\n On Wednesday, 31 members of Congress sent a letter to the acting House Sergeant of Arms, acting Senate Sergeant of Arms and Acting Chief of the US Capitol Police asking them to investigate the issue of tours further.\n Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, one of the co-signers of the letter, confirmed to CNN that she saw groups of tours of people in MAGA apparel one or two days before the attack.\n \"I had seen what appeared to be tour groups of folks dressed in MAGA attire, in the halls, in the tunnels,\" Scanlon told CNN.\n \"I don't know exactly what day it was. It was just surprising to see that happen because since Covid the building's been shut down. There aren't supposed to be any tours. So I kind of assumed it must be a new member who didn't know the rules or something. But, I mean, I can verify that it happened. There were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff.\"\n Scanlon told CNN she saw a group of 6 to 8 people.\n \"Many of the Members who signed this letter, including those of us who have served in the military and are trained to recognize suspicious activity, as well as various members of our staff, witnessed an extremely high number of outside groups in the complex on Tuesday, January 5,\" the letter states.\n It says the tours were \"unusual\" and \"concerning\" and were reported to the Sergeant at Arms on January 5. The letter says the groups \"could only have gained access to the Capitol Complex from a Member of Congress or a member of their staff.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information about congressional tours.\n CNN's Ryan Nobles, Daniella Diaz and Annie Grayer contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "A Northern California hospital was fined $43,000 after it delayed reporting a recent Covid-19 outbreak which resulted in the death of one employee.\n Santa Clara County said it issued a violation notice to Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center on January 5 \"as a result of Kaiser's failure to timely report 43 cases involving personnel who tested positive between December 27, 2020 and January 1, 2021.\" That number has since grown, according to CNN affiliate KGO.\n As of Monday, a total of 92 cases of the virus have been linked to this outbreak, according to health officials. This includes 77 staff members and 15 patients.\n \"Kaiser is responsible for complying with all applicable public health orders and work safety regulations, including timely reporting of cases and all required follow-ups,\"  the county said in an email statement to CNN.\n The initial cause of the outbreak continues to be investigated by the public health department, officials said.\n In a statement to KGO, Irene Chavez, senior vice president and area manager with Kaiser Permanente San Jose, said the outbreak \"may\" have been connected to an employee who briefly wore an \"air-powered costume\" in the emergency department on Christmas.\n \"Any exposure, if it occurred, would have been completely innocent, and quite accidental,\" said Chavez. \"As the individual had no COVID symptoms and only sought to lift the spirits of those around them during what is a very stressful time.\"\n Air-powered costumes will no longer be allowed at the facility, Chavez added.\n A public health order issued on October 5, 2020, requires the hospital to report any confirmed positive Covid-19 cases by personnel who were at the workplace to the public health department within four hours.\n The fine for each violation is $1,000.\n \"Kaiser Permanente failed to report any of these cases in the County's Worksite Case and Contact Reporting Portal as it is required to do by the Public Health Order issued on Oct. 5,\" the county said in its statement. \"Kaiser also submitted a Social Distancing Protocol to the County on Oct. 19 certifying it would comply with all reporting requirements.\"\n The county said it did not learn of the positive cases until they were confirmed in a press statement released by Kaiser Permanente on January 3.\n In a statement to CNN, Kaiser Permanente Spokeswoman Hilary Costa said its communications with state and local agencies about Covid-19 cases at its facilities has been consistent.\n \"The suggestion that we are anything other than forthcoming with our reporting is inaccurate,\" said Costa in the statement.\n The hospital is reviewing the Santa Clara County citation and plans to respond by the County's deadline on January 15, according to Costa.\n The health department continues to investigate the cause of the outbreak. It was determined that outbreak was not the new variant of COVID-19 first identified in the UK.\n CNN's Kay Jones and Jessica Flynn contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Chinese Covid-19 vaccine far less effective than initially claimed in Brazil, sparking concerns",
        "body_text": "A leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, according to a statement published by the government of Sao Paulo Tuesday.\n While the number exceeds the threshold required for regulatory approval, it falls far below the 78% previously announced, raising questions as to the veracity of the data and fueling skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.\n \"The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),\" the statement released Tuesday said.\n The razor-thin margin for regulatory approval is likely to lead to concern among scientists, given that last week the Butantan institute released partial \"clinical efficacy\" results celebrating 78% to 100% efficacy in preventing infections.\n The state body financed the phase 3 trials of the vaccine, which involved 13,000 health workers across eight Brazilian states.\n \"Regarding the overall efficacy of the analysis, we met the requirements of the World Health Organization with 50.38%,\" Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo said Tuesday during a news conference.\n However, on Tuesday, high-ranking members of the Brazilian Health Ministry told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil that \"the effectiveness is borderline,\" and that because \"It is at the limit. We have to wait for ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) to evaluate.\"\n A representative of Sinovac said the company is discussing the result but declined to give further comment. The final efficacy rate of the vaccine will be determined by China's drug regulator, the National Medical Production Administration, according to the representative.\n Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations, described the  50.38% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine as a \"disappointing\" result that had caught him by surprise.\n The results suggest Coronavac is less effective than alternative vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%.\n Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%.\n The Sinovac vaccine is also less effective than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says is 79.34% effective.\n Despite the worse than anticipated results, Huang said the Sinovac vaccine would still be \"usable\" by helping to relieve pressures on healthcare systems while reducing potential deaths, given its higher efficacy for moderate and severe cases that would require medical treatment.\n However, its low overall efficacy could hinder Sinovac's ability to expand its market share globally, Huang said.\n Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It'll also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.\n \"Since many countries are planning to order, or have already ordered Sinovac's vaccines, it might undermine people's willingness to take them, because people may question the usefulness of the vaccines,\" Huang said. \"It could be a potential stumbling block.\"\n A lack of transparency has been a major concern clouding Chinese-made vaccines, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to make \"a global public good.\"\n Both Sinovac and Sinopharm have faced questions regarding the release of data. When announcing its efficacy results, state-owned Sinopharm did not provide details on its clinical trial data. A Sinopharm executive said detailed data would be released later and published in scientific journals, without giving a timeline.\n There is also the issue of discrepancy in results from clinical trials conducted in different places.\n Having largely eliminated the coronavirus inside its borders earlier last year, Chinese drugmakers had to look abroad for places to test the efficacy of their vaccines. But the results reported so far are far from consistent.\n Sinopharm's efficacy rate of 79%, for example, is lower than the 86% announced by the United Arab Emirates for the same vaccine in December.\n Sinovac's vaccine has had wildly different results from three countries: Indonesian drug regulators say interim data from Phase 3 trials showed it is 65.3% effective and gave it the country's first emergency use approval; Turkey says it is 91.25% effective; And in Brazil, the two significantly different efficacy rates announced a week apart have further sparked questions.\n Last week, Brazil's health regulator agency ANVISA told the Butantan Institute that in order to approve the emergency use of a vaccine, the global efficacy rate had to be made publicly available -- information the Institute had not received at the time from Sinovac, according to CNN Brasil sources.\n ANVISA will meet on Sunday to decide on two requests for emergency use of both the Coronavac vaccine and the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine.\n The news could potentially hinder China's own coronavirus vaccination drive too, Huang warned.\n China has inoculated tens of thousands of people with Sinovac's vaccine since July under a government-approved emergency use program, which includes at least three Chinese vaccine candidates.\n In total, it has administered 4.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine under emergency use, and is planning to vaccinate 50 million people ahead of February's Lunar New Year celebrations.\n Chinese public health experts have repeatedly told the public they are confident that Chinese-made vaccines are at least as good as, if not better, than foreign alternatives, Huang said.\n \"If people learn about this, they might start to question the safety and efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine, or even other Chinese-made vaccines,\" Huang said. \"I think the government will need to do some convincing work, on either those who have already taken the shots, or are about to do so.\"",

        "title": "Here's how some of the leading coronavirus vaccines work",
        "body_text": "Johnson & Johnson says it plans to have data from advanced, Phase 3 trials of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of the month.\n If they're positive, the company plans to apply for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration and make the vaccine available to the public.\n Early stage trial data published Wednesday shows a single dose of the vaccine prompted an immune response in all volunteers after a few weeks and if the company wins an EUA for the single-dose approach it would be the first single dose vaccine to get an OK in the US.\n Two vaccines already have FDA and European authorization and three are authorized in the UK. Here's how some of the top coronavirus vaccines and vaccine candidates work.\n Pfizer and its German-based partner BioNTech use a new approach to making vaccines that uses messenger RNA or mRNA.\n This design was chosen for a pandemic vaccine years ago because it's one that lends itself to quick turnaround. All that is needed is the genetic sequence of the virus causing the pandemic. Vaccine makers don't even need the virus itself -- just the sequence.\n In this case, BioNTech researchers used a little piece of genetic material coding for a piece of the spike protein -- the structure that adorns the surface of the coronavirus, giving it that studded appearance.\n Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can \"read\" and use to make a protein. In the case of this vaccine, the mRNA instructs the muscle cells in the arm to make the particular piece of the virus's spike protein. Then the immune system sees it, recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs.\n \"RNA is like snapchat messages that expire. RNA vaccines do NOT become a permanent part of your body. They are temporary messages instructing cells to make one viral protein temporarily,\" Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, said on Twitter.\n \"It takes 25 different coronavirus proteins to make a coronavirus, so there is no worry about the RNA making a virus.\"\n Clinical trials showed Pfizer's vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic infections. Pfizer is working to show the vaccine can prevent all infections, including those that don't cause symptoms.\n MRNA is very fragile so it's encased in lipid nanoparticles -- a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature. That's why Pfizer's vaccine must be kept at ultracold temperatures of about minus 100 degrees F (minus 75 degrees C). That means special equipment is needed to transport and store this vaccine.\n Pfizer's vaccine won FDA EUA in December and is being delivered to millions of people in the US and UK. The US government has contracted to buy 200 million doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.\n Side-effects are rare and usually mild. They include fever and headache, although a very few people have experienced allergic reactions to the vaccine. It's not clear what causes the allergic reaction, and the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating.\n Moderna's vaccine is also based on mRNA. \"mRNA is like software for the cell\" Moderna said on its website.\n And like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, it codes for cells to make a piece of the spike protein. That was a careful choice -- scientists had to pick a piece of the virus they thought would not mutate, or change much, as time passed. The virus uses the spike protein to grapple the cells it attacks and the structure does appear to stay stable through generation after generation of viral replication.\n Like Pfizer's vaccine, the Moderna vaccine goes into the muscle cells of the arm, and perhaps to nearby immune system cells, and instructs them to make pieces of spike protein.\n Clinical trials showed Moderna's vaccine was 94% effective in preventing symptomatic infections and the company says it has data showing the vaccine also prevents all infections, including those that do not cause symptoms.\n Moderna has come up with a different formulation for the lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA in its vaccine. These formulations are corporate secrets, but Moderna thinks its approach is better and said its vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) and can be kept stable for 30 days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees C (36 to 46F), the temperature of a standard home refrigerator.\n The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine in December and the US has contracted for 200 million doses of Moderna's vaccine.\n Janssen's coronavirus vaccine is a recombinant vector vaccine. It uses a genetically engineered version of adenovirus 26, which can cause the common cold but the gene tinkering has disabled it. It also delivers the genetic instructions to make a piece of spike protein.\n This is one vaccine that has been tested on the market before. The adenovirus 26 vector was used to make the company's Ebola vaccine, which won marketing authorization from the European Commission in July.\n It's a one-shot vaccine. Phase 1-2 trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine this week show the vaccine generated an antibody response in volunteers aged 18 to 55 as well as a second batch of volunteers 65 and older. Side-effects were minimal.\n The company is also testing a two-dose regimen in volunteers to see if adding a second dose gives better protection or longer-lasting protection.\n AstraZeneca's vaccine, made with a team at Britain's Oxford University, is called a vector vaccine. It uses a common cold virus called an adenovirus to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cells.\n It also aims to make people's bodies produce their own vaccines by churning out little copies of spike protein, but the delivery method is different. This adenovirus infects chimpanzees but doesn't make people sick. It was modified so that it doesn't replicate itself -- then genetically engineered to inject cells with the DNA encoding for the full coronavirus spike protein.\n It's a cheaper way to make vaccines -- but slower than using RNA. The company has pledged to make its vaccine available inexpensively to countries around the world. The vaccine can be kept stable for six months at standard refrigerator temperatures, the company said.\n It's approved in Britain but the US FDA is waiting for data from US trials. Confusing data from trials indicated AstraZeneca's vaccine could be 70% effective on average.\n Maryland-based biotechnology company Novavax specializes in \"protein subunit\" vaccines. They use virus-like nanoparticles as a base and cover them with genetically engineered pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.\n This is also a tried and true vaccine approach. A hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns is a protein subunit vaccine, as is the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine and FluBlok, Sanofi's influenza vaccine.\n Novavax uses an insect virus called a baculovirus to get the coronavirus spike protein into moth cells, which then produce the protein. This is harvested and mixed with an adjuvant -- an immune booster --based on saponin, found in soap bark trees.\n This is also a protein subunit vaccine, using Sanofi's FluBlok technology with a GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant. It also uses a baculovirus to grow little bits of spike protein.\n Phase 1/2 trials showed the vaccine elicits an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from Covid-19 in younger adults, but the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response in older adults. The companies plan to launch a new trial in February.\n Chinese company Sinovac's CoronaVac uses an inactivated virus -- one of the oldest methods for vaccinating people. Whole batches of coronavirus are grown, \"killed\" and then made into vaccine. Likewise, Sinopharm's vaccine in an inactivated virus.\n Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is an adenoviral vector vaccine. It uses two common cold viruses called adenovirus 5 and adenovirus 26 to carry the genetic material for the spike protein into the body.",

        "body_text": "Jonathan Fahey is resigning as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a Department of Homeland Security official, only weeks after assuming the post.\n Fahey's departure is the latest in a string of leadership changes at the Department of Homeland Security, and he is the most recent acting ICE director to step down. Last month, Fahey's predecessor -- Tony Pham -- departed. Pham had assumed the post last August.\n Over the last four years, DHS has been encumbered by consistent turnover in leadership. This week, Chad Wolf, who served as acting Homeland Security secretary for 14 months, stepped down amid increasing scrutiny over the validity of his appointment.\n Wolf told CNN his decision to leave office earlier than planned was due in part to the most recent court case challenging his authority to lead the department.\n \"As I talked with the attorneys, and we've talked with the Department of Justice and others, there was no, there was no light at the end of the tunnel, there was no avenue to really fight this,\" he said.\n As a result, just days from a major security event, the department installed Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor to serve as acting secretary.\n ICE -- an agency under DHS -- has had six directors under President Donald Trump. The agency has never had a Senate confirmed director during the Trump administration.\n Fahey, a political appointee, previously served as acting principal legal adviser at the agency, overseeing ICE's legal portfolio. He took over the acting chief post at ICE on December 31. It's unclear what prompted Fahey's departure. An ICE spokesperson said Tae Johnson, the deputy director, will serve as acting director for the time being.\n In the run-up to the presidential election, the agency fielded criticism for singling out so-called sanctuary cities and signed off on putting up controversial billboards in the key swing state of Pennsylvania about immigration violators.\n This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "body_text": "Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\nHistory will record that the second impeachment of President Donald Trump branded him forever as a catastrophically immoral and divisive leader. It will also mark most of his defenders in the Republican Party as duplicitous opportunists who claimed at the last moment that the country needed unity after they had contributed to the rhetoric bringing the nation to the precipice of civil war.\n In their speeches in the House of Representatives during the impeachment debate, the 197 opponents of the measure put on a carnival of hypocrisy, a spectacle in which they tried to persuade their colleagues, the country, and perhaps themselves, that after they spent months trying to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election, suddenly they cared about unifying and healing the nation above all else.\n Who could possibly believe such a fiction?\n Perhaps they think they can convince us that they now believe nothing matters more than coming together because they spent so much time spreading a different falsehood, claiming that Trump won in November.\n In the waning days of Trump's smoldering, suppurating presidency, what's one more lie?\n Democrats described the events of Jan. 6. Rep. Jamie Raskin noted the chilling fact that Trump's mob may have been hunting Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to stage their coup, \"but every one of us in this room right now could have died.\"\n \"Let that sink in,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, \"Our president incited our citizens to attack our Capitol.\"\n Maybe facing a murderous mob does concentrate the mind. Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who tried to assume a statesmanlike tone in the debate, deserves some credit in spite of voting against impeachment. At least he acknowledged that Trump \"bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress,\" and tried to shut down some of the ridiculous lies making the rounds in a deluded Trumpistan. The riot, he said, was not caused by Antifa.\n Importantly, McCarthy finally recognized that Joe Biden won the election. But imagine that: It took him more than two months to get here. He doesn't get a pass. He doesn't get to clear his name after months of fomenting and spreading the corrosive Big Lie about the election.\n McCarthy waxed almost poetic in his exhortation to national unity. He talked about calling on our better angels and deplored the sordid events. \"What we saw last week is not the American way.\" He rejected impeachment because, \"United we can deliver peace, strength and prosperity...divided we will fail.\"\n The mind reels. This is the same McCarthy who voted against certifying the results of the election even after the coup attempt. With his vote, he supported their goals. \"We solve our disputes at the ballot box,\" McCarthy claimed, after two months of backing an effort to steal an election.\n This is the same McCarthy who told Fox News after the election Trump lost that, \"we cannot allow this to happen...join together and let's stop this.\"\n Now he wants unity, healing, lowering the temperature.  And he's hardly alone in discovering his inner compromiser.\n Pick a random name from among the 147 Republicans who voted to steal the election from the American people and you're likely to find someone saying impeachment is too divisive. People like Debbie Lesko, who voted against certifying, now finds it \"concerning\" that Democrats are pursuing impeachment just one week before Trump leaves office  and \"at a time when our country needs unity.\"\n Similarly, Rep. Ted Budd, another member who voted against certifying Biden's election, tweeted, \"If Democrats say they want unity, this isn't the way to show it.\"\n How about Rep. Jim Jordan, the fiery Trump defender, whose scorched earth politics endeared him to the President. Jordan complains that Democrats are, \"trying to cancel the President.\" He tried to cancel the Biden presidency before it started.\n \"This doesn't unite the country,\" Jordan declared of the impeachment, perhaps giggling inside at hearing himself explaining that the impeachment, \"in no way helps the nation deal with the terrible events of last week that we all condemn.\"\n All the Republicans who repeated the lie, relentlessly fueling a dangerous falsehood about the election, who enabled Trump, who failed to stand up to him until this moment -- and even now -- contributed to the \"terrible events that we all condemn.\"\n If Republicans want healing and reconciliation, it may have something to do with the threats they are receiving In what is the closest to a fascist tactic we have seen in this godforsaken presidency. Republican Rep. Peter Meijer wrote in the Detroit News of how one of his \"profoundly shaken\" colleagues had acknowledged after last week's riot that voting to certify Biden's win was a constitutional duty -- but instead voted to overturn the election result for fear of endangering family members.\n In the end, 10 brave Republicans broke with the hypocrites and voted to impeach Trump.\n As it happens, it's not just Trump-defending Republicans who worry about the country's deep and inflamed divisions. It's not just Republicans that would like to see healing and unity. Most Americans are disheartened and frightened about the depths and the dangers to which Trump has brought the nation.\n The right way to heal those divisions, the right way to unite the country, is to come together in repudiating the poisonous presidency of Donald Trump. What better way to do that than by impeaching and convicting him? Even if he completes the full four years of his term, Americans will have formally declared his presidency a grave national error, telling future generations -- and even current ones -- that Trump's values and tactics are abhorrent to this nation.\n That's the way to achieve unity. The claims we're hearing that impeachment is bad for healing are lies. They are a way to avoid responsibility, to protect the President, to sweep the filth under the rug. At a time like this, when the country should stand together, what America needs from its leaders is courage, not hypocrisy.",

        "title": "Trump has told staff not to pay Rudy Giuliani over irritation at being impeached again",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump, irritated at being impeached for a second time, has told people to stop paying Rudy Giuliani's legal fees, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN, though aides were not clear if the President was serious about his instructions given he's lashing out at nearly everyone after the day's events.\n Trump became the first president in US history to be impeached twice on Wednesday, one week after a mob stormed the US Capitol following a speech by the President that galvanized his supporters to fight against the counting of the electoral votes that would affirm President-elect Joe Biden's win. The insurrection left five people dead, including one Capitol Police officer, and has left the nation's capital and state capitols around the country preparing for potential violence as Biden is set to be inaugurated next week.\n Trump has been blaming his longtime personal attorney and many others for the predicament he now finds himself in, though he has not accepted any responsibility in public or in private, people familiar with his reaction told CNN. Giuliani is still expected to play a role in Trump's impeachment defense but has been left out of most conversations thus far.\n Trump's campaign senior adviser Jason Miller seemed to push back on reports Trump was souring on Giuliani, though did not deny the President had told associates not to pay him.\n \"Just spoke with President Trump, and he told me that @RudyGiuliani  is a great guy and a Patriot who devoted his services to the country! We all love America's Mayor!\" Miller wrote on Thursday morning.\n Meanwhile, John Eastman, the conservative attorney who falsely told Trump that Vice President Mike Pence could block the certification of Biden's win, could join Trump's legal team defending him in the upcoming impeachment trial, a person familiar with the matter said.\n The discussions are still preliminary and Eastman isn't yet formally a part of the team. Chapman University, where Eastman had been working as a professor, announced Wednesday it had \"reached an agreement pursuant to which he will retire from Chapman, effective immediately\" following discussions this week.\n \"Dr. Eastman's departure closes this challenging chapter for Chapman and provides the most immediate and certain path forward for both the Chapman community and Dr. Eastman,\" Struppa said.\"Chapman and Dr. Eastman have agreed not to engage in legal actions of any kind, including any claim of defamation that may currently exist, as both parties move forward.\"\n Another source of Trump's ire is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who incensed Trump further on Wednesday by saying he bears responsibility for last week's riot. The President had already been upset with McCarthy after the California Republican left the option of censuring Trump on the table in a letter to colleagues earlier this week.\n The details about Giuliani's legal fees were first reported by the Washington Post.\n The President is now more isolated than ever. Several of his Cabinet secretaries -- the ones who haven't resigned in protest -- are avoiding him, his relationship with the vice president remains fractured and several of his senior staffers are scheduled to depart their posts this week.\n One White House adviser told CNN that \"everybody's angry at everyone\" inside the White House, with the President being upset because he thinks people aren't defending him enough.\n \"He's in self-pity mode,\" the source said, with Trump complaining he's been under siege for five years and he views this latest impeachment as a continuation of that.\n But many people close to Trump view the current situation as different than his first impeachment, when he was charged with pressuring the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden to try and influence the presidential election.\n \"His actions led to here, no one else,\" the White House adviser said, adding, \"He instigated a mob to charge on the Capitol building to stop the certification, he's not going to find a lot of sympathetic Republicans.\"\n During the last impeachment effort, Trump allies in and out of the White House publicly defended him and sent out talking points throughout the impeachment proceeding.\n No similar effort materialized this time, with House Republican leadership deciding against pressuring their colleagues to stay in line and instead allowing them to vote their conscience. Ten Republicans voted with every Democrat to pass the single article of impeachment.\n After the House voted to impeach him, Trump released a video statement that did not mention the historic development that had occurred a few hours earlier. Instead, he delivered a call for calm as the threat of new riots -- which Trump said he'd been briefed on by the Secret Service -- casts a pall over Washington. Later, an official described the briefing as \"sobering\" and said it contributed to Trump's decision to tape the video.\n \"No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,\" he said from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n \"Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers and help to promote peace in our country,\" he said.\n Trump's Oval Office speech came only after advisers talked him into taping it, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump had seemed reluctant to tape the videos, in part because he believes they make him look like he's caving to pressure to tone down his stance on the election.\n \"Silence is not an option,\" is how one source described one of the conversations, adding \"we need to break the cycle.\"\n His first video on the day of the insurrection came partly at the urging of his daughter Ivanka Trump, but the President threw out the script his team had prepared and ad-libbed most of it, including the line telling the rioters \"we love you.\"\n The subsequent videos have been more tightly scripted, with heavy input from the White House counsel's office on the text. Trump has read them from teleprompters set up by the White House Communications Agency as senior officials look on, ensuring he does not diverge from the words as written.\n Advisers have repeatedly urged him to tape the spots, citing both the potential legal implications of inciting the riot and the desire from fellow Republicans that he show a willingness to lower the temperature among his supporters.\n Trump was also warned that if he didn't speak out he could be even more legally exposed -- with potential civil lawsuits and more, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n With his favorite mode of communication -- Twitter -- no longer available to him after Trump was banned from the social network on Friday, another person close to the White House worried that Trump may lash out further.\n \"He's been holed up in the residence, that's never a good thing. He's by himself, not a lot of people to bounce ideas off of -- whenever that happens he goes to his worst instincts,\" that person said. \"Now that Twitter isn't available God only knows what the outlet will be.\"\n CNN's Kevin Liptak and Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

Barofsky wrote in court documents that he confirmed Keller's identity by comparing photos he was in to his Colorado driver's license.\n The photos from the Capitol also show Keller is wearing a US Olympic Team jacket and \"appears to be one of the tallest individuals,\" Barofsky writes in his statement of facts. Keller is 6 feet, 6 inches tall.\n In a statement, USA Swimming told CNN, \"We respect private individuals' and groups' rights to peacefully protest but in no way condone the actions taken by those at the Capitol last week.\"\n The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said it condemned the actions of the rioters.\n \"We support the right to peacefully protest and express values and viewpoints in a respectful and lawful manner -- that is what makes our democracy strong. Sadly, that is not what happened in this case,\" the organization said in a statement.\n Correction: A previous headline on this story incorrectly stated Keller's status. He has been charged and a warrant has been issued for his arrest. CNN has not confirmed whether he has been arrested.\n CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Feds need to tell us a lot more about the Capitol riot investigation",
        "body_text": "Asha Rangappa is a senior lecturer at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. She is a former FBI special agent, specializing in counterintelligence investigations. Follow her @AshaRangappa_. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.\nSix days after the siege on the US Capitol, officials from the FBI and Department of Justice held a news conference Tuesday to give an update.\n Normally after a major event like this -- a terrorist assault on the heart of our government --  top federal law enforcement officials would step up to give the most comprehensive account of what they know. They would move quickly to inform and reassure the public -- to tell us who did what, how it happened, and what the threat is now.\n So against these standards, how did Tuesday's news conference measure up?\n Not so well.\n Perhaps the most notable part of the update was who wasn't giving it. The top officials from Justice and the FBI -- Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Director Christopher Wray --  weren't there. Nor were other senior officials from relevant agencies like the Department of Homeland Security. Instead, we saw the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington office, Steve D'Antuono, and the acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin.\n While these two officials are no doubt the ones most closely monitoring the investigations into the insurrection, the absence of their bosses -- or even their deputies -- was unexpected, given the magnitude of the attack.\n The news conference focused almost exclusively on the investigation into the attack -- on the crime-solving. It is, of course, the Justice Department's job to gather evidence, track down suspects and bring perpetrators to justice.\n We learned from D'Antuono that the FBI was treating the Capitol attack the same way it would an international terrorist incident, and that it had opened 170 \"subject files\" (referring to individuals identified as persons who potentially committed crimes), and of those has charged more than 70 individuals.\n Sherwin emphasized that each perpetrator will be charged with the most severe crime warranted, including and up to seditious conspiracy.\n But both officials appeared to skirt around explaining what federal law enforcement knew and did before that day's Trump rally and the attack that followed it, in particular how the feds had coordinated with other agencies to prepare for trouble.\n Nor did they mention the threat bulletin now issued to all 50 states warning of armed protests planned at every state's capitol and in Washington in the days leading up to the inauguration on January 20.\n Many Americans are wondering how this attack was allowed to happen. Since 9/11, law enforcement has greatly increased its abilities to sniff out and disrupt developing terrorism plots. The FBI  most recently thwarted an apparent plan by militia groups to kidnap and kill the governor of Michigan,  Gretchen Whitmer, in October.\n It is hard to understand how -- particularly in light of the many threats of violence made openly by pro-Trump groups and individuals on social media -- the FBI and its law enforcement partners were not better prepared for what took place.\n Unfortunately, neither D'Antuono nor Sherwin offered much in the way of explanation. To be sure, law enforcement is often unable to comment on  things that might compromise ongoing investigations. But if that is the case, they normally just say that. On Tuesday, however, D'Antuono puzzlingly acknowledged that the FBI had information from its Norfolk field office indicating plans for violence at the Capitol.\n This contradicted his earlier claim to reporters, Friday, that the FBI did not have any such information in its possession at all before the attack. Nor did he explain why the Norfolk tip was not followed up on after the Joint Terrorism Task Force received it.\n By not filling in these gaps, or even stating clearly that the FBI was reviewing all of the intelligence that was known beforehand, the officials invited more speculation about whether the government's flat-footed response to the Capitol assault was caused by negligence or -- far worse -- an intentional intelligence failure.\n They missed an opportunity to be as robust as possible in laying out how law enforcement approached this highly publicized rally, and potentially contributed to a further erosion of trust in law enforcement and the proliferation of unfounded conspiracy theories.\n Many members of the Capitol mob were undoubtedly watching the news conference to find out what the FBI knew. On this front, both officials sent a clear message that they would use every resource at their disposal to identify and prosecute everyone who attacked the seat of our democracy.\n Make no mistake: The people who planned and participated in this atrocity will get a knock on their doors from the FBI soon enough.\n But the domestic terror threat is not limited to that one mob. The very fact that the FBI has issued a threat bulletin to all 50 states reveals that the depraved ideology based on the lie about the \"rigged\" election spreads far and deep.\n But neither D'Antuono nor Sherwin addressed this future threat, issued a warning to anyone planning violence, or even referred to the people involved in this violence as domestic terrorists.\n This may be because they have seen how the President reacts when such language is used against his defenders and allies. After all, neither the FBI nor the DOJ can afford, in this critical moment, to lose their leadership because Trump decided to fire them. Unfortunately, if that fear is what resulted in the gaps in Tuesday's remarks, it may embolden the very people they are protecting us against.",

        "title": "Bryan Monroe, longtime journalist and former CNNPolitics.com editor, dies at 55",
        "body_text": "Bryan Monroe, a journalism professor and former CNNPolitics.com editor who once headed the National Association of Black Journalists and helped guide the Biloxi Sun Herald to a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of Hurricane Katrina, has died. He was 55.\n Monroe died Wednesday morning of a heart attack at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, where he lived with family, according to Suzanne Malveaux, a longtime friend and CNN national correspondent.\n \"He liked to connect people who were in different worlds -- whether it was the media world, Hollywood, journalism, academia,\" Malveaux told CNN. \"He loved to cook. He brought people to be at his house often -- well, not this past year, unfortunately. And he loved to bake.\"\n In a long journalism career that included stints as vice president and editorial director at Ebony and Jet magazine and assistant vice president of news at Knight Ridder Newspapers, Monroe conducted the first post-election interview with former President Barack Obama.\n Sam Feist, CNN's Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, said he first met Monroe in 2008 after the Obama interview.\n \"It was an extraordinary interview and was one of the reasons I told CNN's leadership that we should hire Bryan Monroe as our Political Editor,\" Feist said in an email. \"I've never met someone who was as comfortable in any environment -- whether with a group of politicians, students, Black journalists, or white journalists. Bryan navigated those worlds better than anybody and the bridges he built between people and between groups will be around a long long time.\"\n Monroe had the last major interview with pop legend Michael Jackson two years before the latter's death in 2009.\n \"Sure, I was shocked when I heard the news that the King of Pop had left the world,\" Monroe wrote in June 2014. \"But, in a way, I was not all that surprised. Jackson, even as troubled as he was, had given his all to the world during his 50 years on the planet. And now he was in the hands of history.\"\n Monroe was the Verizon Chair and professor at Temple University's Klein College of Media and Communication. Before Temple, he had been named editor of CNNPolitics.com, leading the editorial planning and content strategy for CNN's online and mobile political coverage from the DC Bureau.\n \"Bryan often talked about the importance of 'connecting the dots' in journalism... the concept of bridging ideas and big picture themes,\" Meredith Artley, a senior vice president and editor-in-chief of CNN Digital Worldwide, said of Monroe. \"He brought that to work and also to life. He was a connector of people within CNN and the industry at large. He was a magnet at any work or industry event, always surrounded by people and ready with a good story or an introduction. We were lucky to have him as a leader and thinker at CNN, and in the journalism community at large.\"\n \"Bryan was a very social person and he loved to bring people together,\" Malveaux said.\n \"He was really good at that. He was always at the big White House correspondents' events, the balls and the after parties. He was my partner in crime because I was too shy to approach people or introduce myself and he was like a social butterfly.\"\n Before becoming editor of CNNPolitics.com in 2011, Monroe was a visiting professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. He served as president of the National Association of Black Journalists from 2005 to 2007.\n \"I am beyond heartbroken,\" NABJ President Dorothy Tucker tweeted Wednesday, adding that an official statement was to follow. \"Bryan texted me a couple of days ago just to check in and ask if I needed anything. What I need now is to hear this is a dream. My condolences to his family.\"\n As assistant vice president of news at Knight Ridder, Monroe helped lead journalists at the Biloxi Sun Herald in Mississippi to the 2006 Pulitzer Prize Gold Medal for Public Service for coverage of Hurricane Katrina.\n Malveaux recalled speaking with Monroe on the phone on Tuesday, when they chatted about their families and excitement over the new year.\n During a tumultuous summer of racial reckoning in America after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Monroe lamented the toll the coronavirus pandemic and police violence on the Black community.\n \"It has set in stark relief how little of this is within our control,\" he wrote in a CNN Opinion piece. \"We, mostly, are not the cops on the street. We, mostly, are not the CEOs in the board rooms. We, mostly, aren't the voters electing the prosecutors and judges. We're not sitting at the dinner tables with the mildly racist cousins and uncles and in-laws who are snickered at or just tolerated.\n \"This week has shown how much of what has been happening -- and how many of the things that must change -- are on the white majority. You have the real power. You are in the positions of authority. If this has really affected you at your core, you can actually change white culture. From the inside. We can't.\"\n A connoisseur of good food, Monroe was excited about starting life as a vegan about six weeks ago, according to Malveaux.\n \"He was very happy about all these different recipes,\" she said.\n But it was socializing and entertaining and creating connections that impassioned him most, Malveaux said.\n \"He was on a number of Zoom groups and calls where he was talking to R&B and hip hop artists and journalists and he was always excited about bringing guests to speak to his class,\" she said. \"He was always about how can you be your best, and how can I help people connect to each other so they can encourage each other and support each other in being their best.\"\n Monroe was the founder and managing director of the Monroe Media Group, a Washington, DC-based media strategy, crisis communication and personal branding firm, according to LinkedIn. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University.\n Monroe was born in Germany while his father was in the military.\n He is survived by his fiancee Abrielle (Abe), his daughter Seanna, son Jackson, a sister and his father.",

        "title": "Investigators pursuing signs US Capitol riot was planned",
        "body_text": "Evidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests a level of planning that has led investigators to believe the attack on the US Capitol was not just a protest that spiraled out of control, a federal law enforcement official says.\n Among the evidence the FBI is examining are indications that some participants at the Trump rally at the Ellipse, outside the White House, left the event early, perhaps to retrieve items to be used in the assault on the Capitol.\n A team of investigators and prosecutors are also focused on the command and control aspect of the attack, looking at travel and communications records to determine if they can build a case that is similar to a counterterrorism investigation, the official said.\n The belief, early in the probe, will demand significant investigation.\n The presence of corruption prosecutors and agents is in part because of their expertise in financial investigations. \"We are following the money,\" the official said.\n By Wednesday morning, the FBI reported that it had received more than 126,000 digital tips from the public regarding the attack on the Capitol -- more than three times the number of tips received on Monday.\n Among the thousands of tips the FBI received are some that appear to show members of Congress with people who later showed up at the Capitol riot, two law enforcement officials said. This doesn't mean members of Congress and staff are under investigation, but the FBI is checking the veracity of the claims, the officials said.\n At least some of the arrests already made are part of a strategy used in counterterrorism investigations, to find even a minimal charge and try to take a person of concern off the streets. That helps ease the possible threat amid concern about possible attacks on the inauguration, officials believe.\n On January 4, for example, local police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, in Washington, DC.\n Tarrio was taken into custody for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after an earlier \"Stop the Steal\" rally. The Miami resident was charged with destruction of property related to the banner, however, federal authorities say they found Tarrio in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines, prompting them to add a charge of Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device.\n On Tuesday, federal authorities in New York City arrested Eduard Florea, 40, on at least one weapons charge after law enforcement, including the FBI and NYPD, responded to a Queens home in response to online postings about an armed caravan heading to the US Capitol, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN.\n Law enforcement sources told CNN that the man claims to be a Proud Boy and was arrested with live ammunition in the home.\n Already, the public efforts by prosecutors and the FBI to encourage people who participated In the riot to turn themselves in is yielding fruit. Some attorneys have reached out to arrange for safe surrender of their clients in order to gain a measure of leniency and lessen the chance of a police raid on their homes, two officials said.\n For instance, a counterterrorism prosecutor even appeared in court for an early hearing for one of the defendants on Tuesday, signaling how integrated the Justice Department's effort already is between the typical criminal prosecutors who handle initial criminal hearings and with the units focused on more complex crimes.\n \"With this strike force that was established to focus strictly on sedition charges, we're looking at in treating this just like a significant international counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation,\" DC US Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday.\n \"We're looking at everything: money, travel records. Looking at disposition, movement, communication records. So no resource related to the FBI, or the US Attorney's Office will be unchecked in terms of trying to determine exactly if there was a command and control how it operated and how they executed these, these activities.\"",

        "title": "'He could never tell the truth:' Trump's presidency was kneecapped by his lies",
        "body_text": "In the final week before Joe Biden takes office, the Trump presidency is in tatters. President Trump's business is being hobbled. \"That stain on the Trump brand is a blood stain,\" CNN's Jake Tapper said Wednesday afternoon, moments before a majority of House members charged Trump with \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n How did it come to this? Well, I have a media-centric brain, so I view it as partly a media story. Trump's war on the nation's news media, his war on truth, his war on REALITY ultimately caused him to become the first US president to be impeached two times.\n He relied on hyper-partisan media outlets that distorted his view of America, the world, his presidency and his own popularity. He watched and watched as his favorite TV shows deceived him and his base, further alienating Republican voters and deepening the country's divides.\n Trump followed Fox's lead. He parroted what he heard on TV. He lied and lied, but rather than suffer the consequences, his lies were excused and supported and even celebrated by his media enablers. Ultimately, I believe, those enablers harmed him: Outlets like Fox spread bogus info about Ukraine and Joe Biden, ensnaring Trump in impeachment No. 1.\n The very same outlets hyped Trump's lies about the election; denied the basic arithmetic of Biden's victory; and encouraged the radicalized Trump base to \"fight.\" It's no wonder why there were people in DC on January 6 waving One America News flags. The 1/6 attack was a riot of lies, swiftly leading to impeachment No. 2, an attempt to hold Trump accountable.\n Here's what we will never know: If his favorite media outlets had been more careful, had been more responsible, had covered the news instead of covering up the news, would Trump's presidency have ended differently? Or was Trump always so narcissistic, so delusional, that this era's war on truth was always destined to end with men in fatigues staging a war on the steps of the Capitol?\n Watching the GOP floor speeches against impeachment on Wednesday, I felt like I was watching Fox News prime time. Lawmakers like Matt Gaetz were performing for the Fox audience with predictable, cynical arguments. \"Even after all that has happened,\" CNN's Dana Bash commented, \"Republican after Republican is still defending the president and his lies about the election.\"\n But a small group of pro-impeachment Republicans showed political courage. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler talked about truth versus fear: \"My vote to impeach our sitting president is not a fear-based decision,\" she said. \"I am not choosing a side. I'm choosing truth. It's the only way to defeat fear.\"\n Speaking of truth, this bit of reporting from CNN's Jim Acosta was on my mind all day. Acosta said \"a senior Trump adviser offered a stinging assessment of this second impeachment by saying the president has destroyed everything he built politically because he could never tell the truth.\"\n \"In the end,\" the anonymous adviser said, \"it all came crashing down because he could never tell the truth. All because he couldn't accept he lost.\"\n \"This will be the story you tell your kids when you lecture them about telling the truth,\" the adviser added.\n I sure will. But will Trump's base?\n Right-wing media has made a shift from \"pro-Trump\" to \"pro-Trump-supporter.\" This week the talk shows are all about sympathizing with the voters, who are generally depicted as downcast and discriminated against. \"Right now in America it is hard to be a Trump supporter, and it is getting harder, a lot harder,\" Newsmax's Greg Kelly said Tuesday night. His message was that \"we have nothing to be ashamed of, and we should be proud.\" His colleague Rob Schmitt said \"the left wants to rip the soul out of anyone who supported Donald Trump over the last four years.\"\n On Fox Wednesday night, Tucker Carlson made a similar argument while attacking impeachment fence-sitter Mitch McConnell. Carlson said McConnell should not be focused on the future of Trump -- who he described on his show as \"elderly and retiring\" -- but instead \"the tens of millions\" of Trump voters.\n Carlson also claimed that Trump voters have been \"redefined as domestic terrorists\" in the past week. He straight up said he doesn't care about Trump: \"What I care about are his voters.\"\n Later in the evening, Laura Ingraham said impeachment was actually an attempt to \"impeach the Americans who support his policies,\" which is obviously not true. One of her first guests, Ben Domenech, said that voting for impeachment was akin to telling Trump voters, \"CNN's right about you.\" Later in the hour, guest Lara Logan imagined a new \"war on terror\" targeting Trump supporters.\n That's what Trump loyalists are hearing from their favorite media sources. Among other things, there's an increasing amount of 1/6 denialism on the airwaves. At 7 p.m. Eastern on Newsmax, Kelly said that there's \"overwhelming\" evidence that Trump \"did nothing wrong\" on the day of the attack. At 8 p.m. on One America News, host Dan Ball said the Republicans who spoke out against the \"political theater\" of impeachment were \"brave patriots.\" At 9 p.m. on Fox, Sean Hannity bashed the \"ten swamp Republicans\" that \"went along with the stunt.\" Oh, and QAnon-promoting congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said on Newsmax that she will file articles of impeachment against Biden on January 21.\n My point: Trump's brand is NOT in tatters on the channels and websites that his die-hard fans trust. Sure, some of the shine is off, but the MAGA media is much closer to Kevin McCarthy's position than Liz Cheney's. I just heard Mike Huckabee, on Fox, say that \"this was a lynching of Donald Trump.\" Some Trump voters are embarrassed by the past week's events, but many are still fully on board the cliched \"Trump train.\" Don't underestimate that.\n Oliver Darcy writes: \"Fox News purports to be a news channel, not a right-wing talk network. But Fox opted to stick with its normal programming throughout the day, instead of having its lead political anchors, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, lead a special report. When the House had the votes to impeach Trump, it fell to 4pm anchor Neil Cavuto to deliver the news to the network's viewers. Less than an hour later, Fox had already moved on, doing a typical 'The Five' segment about supposed media bias...\"\n -- Susan Glasser with a succinct summary of the last seven days: \"The bottom line is that after everything, ten House Republicans voted to impeach Trump, two Cabinet officers quit, Twitter banned Trump, Lindsey Graham got off the train and back on again, and Trump is staying in office. For a week....\" (Twitter)\n -- New reporting from the Washington Post: In private, Trump has expressed anger at \"longtime media defenders who have deserted him, including WSJ columnist Kimberley Strassel, and others he believes have not fiercely defended him,\" including Ingraham... (WaPo)\n -- The Atlantic's Yoni Appelbaum: \"The House has handed McConnell and the Senate a broom. They can now sweep Trump out of office, and consign his future ambitions to the dustbin, whenever they so choose. That, in itself, is no small thing.\" So what will McConnell do? (Twitter)\n",

I didn't sign up for that.\"\n The billionaire said he is going to focus on supporting Biden in any way he can.\n \"I'm going to do everything I can from Day One to make sure I do my part to make Joe Biden the most successful president in the history of the country,\" he said. \"If he's a great, successful president, we all win.\"\n Langone said the country is facing \"major issues,\" citing the pandemic, mounting debt, crumbling infrastructure and an underfunded public school system.\n In a CNN interview shortly before the 2016 election, Langone said that backing Trump's candidacy was \"not about Trump.\"\n \"This is the American people using Trump as a token to express their anger and disgust with the system,\" he said.\n The businessman's frustration underscores a broader message: Corporate America is breaking up with Trump. In early January, more than 170 business leaders signed a letter urging Congress to accept Biden's win.\n Some of America's biggest companies are suspending donations to Republican Congress members who objected to the Electoral College's votes. Other businesses have ceased making all political donations.\n Correction: This story and headline have been updated to clarify Ken Langone's statement that he felt \"betrayed\" by President Trump, not all Republicans.",

        "title": "Andrew Yang announces candidacy for New York mayor with surprising endorsement",
        "body_text": "Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang officially jumped into the crowded race to become the next mayor of New York City on Thursday morning.\n At a kick-off rally in Upper Manhattan, Yang promised to \"revive\" a city stricken by the coronavirus and introduced newly-elected Rep. Ritchie Torres as a co-chair on his campaign -- a striking endorsement for a candidate with no experience in city politics.\n \"I'm running for mayor for a very simple reason,\" Yang told a group of supporters in Upper Manhattan. \"I see a crisis and believe that I can help.\"\n Largely unknown outside of tech circles before the 2020 primary, Yang won the affection -- if not always the votes -- of Democrats who appreciated his happy warrior persona on the debate stage and campaign trail. And he was backed by supporters branded the \"Yang Gang,\" who helped him raise $40 million over the course of his run -- including a surprising $16.5 million as the race heated up in the final three months of 2019.\n Yang filed the paperwork to run for mayor a few weeks ago, while he was campaigning in Georgia for the Democrats who would go on to win their Senate run-off campaigns and deliver the party a majority in the upper chamber. During his speech Thursday, Yang said Sen.-elect Jon Ossoff called him the night before to thank him for his help.\n But Yang's campaign got tripped up out of the gate after Politico reported that he left the city for his second home, in New Paltz -- about 90 minutes north of where he spoke on Thursday morning -- during some of the darkest days of the pandemic in New York. His answer, when asked about the decision by The New York Times in a recent interview, didn't help matters.\n \"We live in a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan,\" Yang said. \"And so, like, can you imagine trying to have two kids on virtual school in a two-bedroom apartment, and then trying to do work yourself?\"\n Many New Yorkers can -- and in less spacious accommodations than Yang described. The comment set off blowback in the media and will surely be used by rivals to cast him as out of touch when the campaign, which has not yet spun into gear, ramps up in the coming weeks.\n Yang, who has also been criticized for his lack of engagement in the city's civic and political life before deciding to seek its top office, described his feeling when he moved here back in 1996.\n \"I felt like I was joining the center of the world,\" he said, recalling his attendance at one of the most famous New York Knicks games of the past 25 years -- no one has questioned Yang's fandom and, as often follows, frustration with the team -- and his walk north on the morning of the 9/11 attacks.\n Yang said the work of rescuing the city from the pandemic's devastation would require \"bold ideas and a fresh approach\" -- an early nod to his unique platform, which includes a localized version of the \"Universal Basic Income\" pitch that was at the center of his presidential run.\n The program, as sketched out on his campaign website, would target 500,000 people and begin by \"providing those who are living in extreme poverty with an average of $2,000 per year.\"\n \"As mayor, we will launch the largest basic income program in the history of the country. Right here in New York,\" Yang said. \"We will lift hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers out of extreme poverty, putting cash relief directly into the hands of the families who desperately need help right now.\"\n His campaign rollout, including a website that includes a characteristically rich variety of ideas and plans, has already grabbed the attention of the most online New Yorkers -- in particular, his dedication to making New York \"fun again\" and a plan to make the city more affordable for local artists and creative types.\n \"Our administration would also work to attract content creator collectives, such as TikTok Hype Houses, where young artists collaborate. We need to help create similar artist collectives that utilize new technologies,\" the site says, while on the same page that proposes a new position: \"Deputy Mayor of Entertainment, Nightlife and Culture.\"\n Yang joins a packed field of mayoral hopefuls trying to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio's two terms in office -- including Shaun Donovan, former US secretary of housing and urban development, Brooklyn Borough President and former New York Police Department Capt. Eric Adams, former Citigroup executive Ray McGuire, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, and Maya Wiley, former counsel to de Blasio.\n The contenders are vying to take charge of a pandemic-stricken city where unemployment is skyrocketing, poverty and hunger are growing, and a budget crunch on the horizon could force the next mayor to make deep cuts to public sector jobs and services. Worries over mass layoffs has eased a little, though, since Democrats won control of the Senate, upping the chances that federal aid to state and local governments will be part of the next Covid relief package.\n Yang suspended his presidential campaign last February, and he spent time as a CNN contributor after leaving the campaign trail. At the time he ended that campaign, Yang had said he had no plans to run for mayor in New York, where he has lived for nearly 25 years.\n On Thursday, Yang touted his popularizing of the universal basic income as one of driving forces behind the congressional push to deliver direct relief to Americans as part of two stimulus packages -- and likely a third, now in the works.\n \"Calling for a vote on the $2,000 stimulus checks that Joe Biden just endorsed should be one of the first moves that new Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer makes,\" he said, before talking up his relationship with Biden and his Transportation secretary pick, Pete Buttigieg, and the \"dividends\" that familiarity would play as he tries to juice the city's financial comeback.\n Yang also dug into some of the more prickly pieces of city politics. He promised to push for greater \"accountability\" from the New York Police Department, which has been criticized for its heavy-handed response to largely peaceful protests last summer, and said he would seek to take control of the city's public transit system from the governor's office.\n Perhaps the most surprising moment of the day, though, came when Torres -- less than two weeks since entering Congress -- appeared by Yang's side and endorsed him. Torres, Yang said, will be a campaign co-chair.\n \"I know those in the press are surprised to see me. I'm surprised to see me,\" Torres said. \"I've made two consequential decisions at the beginning of my congressional career. First, I voted to impeach Donald Trump. To save our country from authoritarianism. And today I have chosen to endorse Andrew Yang for mayor of the city of New York, to save our city from the failed politics of the past.\"\n On the eve of his announcement, Yang released a video produced by director Darren Aronofsky, the second world famous filmmaker to get involved in the mayoral campaign. Spike Lee did the same -- plus providing narration -- for McGuire, the former Wall Street executive who entered the race last month.\n After leaving the presidential race, Yang founded Humanity Forward, a nonprofit he used to test some of the ideas that animated his campaign. In March, he began giving hundreds of working families in New York $1,000 a month to determine the effectiveness of such a program. The organization also endorsed down-ballot candidates across the country.\n This story has been updated with background information and reporting from Thursday's event.\n CNN's Sonia Moghe, Devan Cole, Dan Merica and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Ex-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder charged with willful neglect of duty related to Flint water crisis",
        "body_text": "Former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and former Flint Public Works director Howard Croft were each charged Wednesday with two counts of willful neglect of duty as part of an investigation into the Flint water crisis, according to court documents.\n The charges are misdemeanors, punishable with up to one year in prison or a fine of up to $1,000, the state's penal code shows.\n CNN has reached out to an attorney for Snyder and an attorney for Croft for comment on the charges.\n Twelve people died and more than 80 were sickened as a result of two waves of a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Flint during the water crisis.\n Brian Lennon, an attorney for Snyder, said earlier Wednesday that his client was being made into a scapegoat by a politically driven special counsel. Lennon called reports that his client would be charged \"meritless\" and part of a \"political escapade.\"\n The Michigan Attorney General's Office had no comment about the charges Wednesday evening.\n An attorney for Croft told The Detroit News that his client was informed Monday he would be charged.\n Flint's water problems can be traced back to 2014, when city and state officials switched the city's water supply from the Detroit Water System to the contaminated Flint River in an effort to cut costs. That decision exposed residents to extremely high levels of lead and prompted more than a dozen lawsuits against those involved.\n Snyder apologized in 2016 for the state's role in the crisis.\n Court documents for Snyder show the offense date as April 25, 2014, the same day Flint switched its water source.\n The Flint Water Prosecution Team scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning to announce its findings. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud and Wayne County Prosecutor Kym L. Worthy are expected to attend.\n Last year, the state reached a $600 million settlement with victims, and a court monitored compensation fund for victims was established.\n The switch to water from the Flint River was supposed to be temporary while a new supply line to Lake Huron was completed. When the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality failed to treat the corrosive water, it ate into the city's iron and lead pipes and leached into the drinking water.\n Flint residents had been complaining about the poor quality of their water when the Environmental Protection Agency tested water going into homes there in 2015, finding dangerous levels of lead, which can cause serious health issues.\n The Legionnaires' disease outbreak led to criminal charges against state officials, including Nick Lyon, then-director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in 2017.\n Prosecutors dropped all criminal charges in 2019 and said the investigation would begin again from scratch, citing concerns about how the special counsel had conducted its probe.\n More than a dozen lawsuits, including several class-action suits, were filed against the state, the city of Flint and some state and city employees involved in the decision to switch the source of the drinking water and those responsible for monitoring water quality.\n Snyder, who was elected in 2010, served until 2018.",

        "title": "Trump's been impeached again. What's next?",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump has been impeached again -- the first leader in US history to be impeached twice by the House.\n The question now is whether he'll become the first President to be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.\n Read CNN's latest state of play here.\n Not much. The passage is pretty straightforward. Here it is:\n The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. (Article 1, Section 3)\n Yes. The Senate has a set of rules first created around the impeachment of Andrew Johnson back in 1868 and then updated in 1986. You can read them here.\n Senators take an oath before the proceedings. There's a call to order each day. The Chief Justice has specific duties. There are set time limits for arguments and rebuttals and all questions from senators for the House and Trump attorneys must be submitted in writing and read by the Chief Justice.\n That's not entirely clear. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had indicated before the vote that he will not bring senators back until the last day of Trump's term -- January 19 -- at the earliest. He said in a statement late Wednesday that the trial process will begin then.\n Almost certainly not. This will take some days or even weeks for the group of House lawmakers who will make the case against Trump and his lawyers to answer. So a trial can't practically happen until after President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20.\n Yes. The senators will vote on impeaching a former President.\n There is precedent for impeaching former officials. Read about that -- it's called a \"late impeachment\" -- here. While the main penalty for a guilty verdict in an impeachment trial is removal from office, senators could vote to bar Trump from holding office in the future -- remember, he has not ruled out running for president in 2024. He could also lose his six-figure pension and other post-presidential perks.\n Yes. Big time. They will be busy with confirmation hearings for Biden's Cabinet nominees -- at least four are already scheduled for the week of January 20, for Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary nominee Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen and Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Alejandro Mayorkas. Senators could be called on to draft legislation having to do with the pandemic or economic relief -- Biden wants to increase relief checks to $2,000.\n So impeachment won't be the only thing on their plate. And it's likely they'll only spend a portion of each day on Trump's trial. They could also, under the rules, appoint a special committee to hear the case, but this seems unlikely.\n One thing to keep in mind: While McConnell sets the schedule as Senate majority leader now, he'll lose that status as soon as the results of Georgia's January 5 Senate runoff elections are certified and the two new Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, are seated. At that point, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer will become Senate majority leader and will have more control over the proceedings.\n In a word, Republicans. In the first Trump impeachment trial, only one Republican senator -- Mitt Romney of Utah -- voted to remove him from office. This time, McConnell, rather than protecting Trump, is said to be happy about the effort as a way to excise Trump or purge him from the GOP. Will that lead to more votes to punish Trump? It's not clear.\n Great question! Conviction requires 2/3 of those present. If all 100 senators are present, that's 67 senators. Assuming those two Georgians are seated, that means there are 50 senators from each party and 17 Republicans would be required.\n However! Pay close attention to the rules, which require 2/3 of those present. If those two Democrats from Georgia are not yet seated, it might require 66 senators. If some number of Republicans didn't want to vote against Trump but also didn't want to vote to convict, they could skip the vote and change the ratio. That kind of thing has been known to happen, although not during impeachment proceedings.\n There have been three previous presidential impeachments, including Trump's first. President Andrew Johnson was impeached, but survived the Senate trial by one vote after seven Republicans broke ranks with their party. Johnson did not win election after his impeachment. President Bill Clinton was impeached in his second term and was easily acquited; less than a majority of senators supported removing him from office, far from the 2/3 required. It was a similar result for Trump's first impeachment, when only Romney joined Democrats and less than a majority of senators supported his conviction and removal from office.",

        "title": "What GOP lawmakers who refused to wear masks during Capitol lockdown need now",
        "body_text": "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \"OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.\" Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nIt's an outrage piled on a deadly incursion: After pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building, leaving five dead, Republican members of Congress, sheltering with their scared colleagues in tight quarters, launched a different sort of aggression.\n Several of them refused to wear masks, even as a potentially deadly airborne virus was ravaging the nation.\n Democratic members of Congress were captured on video imploring those Republicans to mask up. They refused. And now, three Democrats have tested positive for Covid-19.\n One of them, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, is a 75-year-old cancer survivor who underwent chemotherapy in 2018, making her case potentially serious. \"I am angry that the attack on the Capitol and my subsequent illness have the same cause: my Republican colleagues' inability to accept facts,\" Coleman wrote in the Washington Post.\n Another, Rep. Brad Schneider, said in a statement that he is \"now in strict isolation, worried that I have risked my wife's health and angry at the selfishness and arrogance of the anti-maskers who put their own contempt and disregard for decency ahead of the health and safety of their colleagues and our staff.\"\n And Rep. Pramila Jayapal told New York Magazine's Rebecca Traister last week that she feared she had been exposed in \"a superspreader event\" because, when members of Congress were brought to a secured room during the attack, \"there were over 100 people and many were Republicans not wearing masks.\"\n In an interview with McClatchy news service Friday, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that the US Capitol riot, broadly speaking, was likely a coronavirus \"surge event\" and \"is going to have public health consequences.\"\n In a statement after she tested positive for the virus, Jayapal said:  \"Only hours after President Trump incited a deadly assault on our Capitol, our country, and our democracy, many Republicans still refused to take the bare minimum Covid-19 precaution and simply wear a damn mask in a crowded room during a pandemic -- creating a superspreader event on top of a domestic terrorist attack.\"\n She called for \"serious fines to be immediately levied on every single Member who refuses to wear a mask in the Capitol\" and for \"any Member who refuses to wear a mask [to] be immediately removed from the floor by the Sergeant at Arms.\"\n House Democrats are now pushing for a rule that would fine any member $500 the first time they don't wear a mask on the House floor, and $2,500 for any subsequent offense.\n That's the absolute minimum that should happen.\n Why anyone would knowingly put other peoples' lives at risk when all that's being asked is that they wear a piece of cloth over the mouth and nose? It's such a small request, and the stakes are so high. How are we to wrap our minds around the depths of selfishness and casual malice, the utter lack of care and moral compass that is required to potentially and unnecessarily expose cancer survivors -- or anyone -- to a virus that has killed some 380,000 Americans?  The coronavirus continues to set record death tolls; it claimed more than 4,000 American lives on Tuesday alone.\n It's not like those maskless Republicans didn't have other options. There were masks on hand, and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester tried to distribute them to her colleagues. Several refused, and at the very least, they deserve to be named and shamed as the villains they are: The reported list so far includes Reps. Markwayne Mullin (Oklahoma), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Georgia), Andy Biggs (Arizona), Michael Cloud (Texas), Doug LaMalfa (California) and Scott Perry (Pennsylvania).\n (Greene's office told CNN, \"Congresswoman Greene is a healthy adult who tested negative for COVID at the White House just this week. She does not believe healthy Americans should be forced to muzzle themselves with a mask. America needs to reopen and get back to normal.\" The others did not respond to CNN's request for comment.)\n Would universal mask-wearing have definitely prevented the virus from spreading among members of Congress all trapped together in a small room? Not necessarily -- we know that being indoors without ventilation for extended periods can create the conditions to spread Covid-19, even if masks are worn. But we also know that wearing masks significantly reduces the risk of infection.\n And while we can't be certain exactly where the infected lawmakers contracted Covid, we do know that some of their colleagues didn't care either way. (The CDC says that most coronavirus infections are spread by people who have no symptoms.)\n When Republican politicians refuse to mask up, they send a devastatingly dangerous message to the American public. Throughout this pandemic some GOP governors have refused to impose the kind of shutdowns  necessary to contain the virus. They and others Republicans have politicized mask-wearing and further basic public health measures -- and they have stood by this President as he failed to handle this deadly crisis.\n Had the President and his party stepped up, many lives might have been saved.\n Republicans, members of the so-called \"party of personal responsibility,\" want to shirk theirs. Indeed, since the sacking of the Capitol they are calling for \"unity,\" and demanding Democrats forgive and forget.\n But it was the words of so many in their party, and the lies of its leader, that fueled this insurrection to begin with. And it was the feckless, willfully dangerous actions of mask-eschewing Republicans in Congress that put the health of their own colleagues at risk, even as they hid together from a rampaging mob of terrorists. These \"leaders\" are a model of selfish irresponsibility for the entire nation.\n We don't know how many more members of Congress will test positive for Covid-19, just as it's impossible to tally the number of Americans who would have avoided illness or death had all Republican leaders encouraged public health best practices.\n We do already know that the FBI is investigating information that pro-Trump forces are planning \"armed protests\" on state capitols and Washington, DC. and that many of them are talking about bringing guns.\n If we ever want to recover from these twin disasters -- a pandemic and an insurrection -- we need to understand what and who fueled them, hold wrongdoers accountable, and learn from all of these bad acts. Right now, many conservatives are asking for reconciliation. But it's impossible to have reconciliation without truth and accountability.\n Those who put lives at risk, whether they flouted simple public health guidelines or spread inflammatory rhetoric and outright lies about the American democratic system, must own up to what they've done, and must face consequences commensurate with their actions. Maybe that means being fined, per Jayapal's demand. Maybe it means they should be removed from office. For a range of bad acts there should be a range of serious ramifications.\n Right now, at least three members of Congress are sick with a potentially deadly disease that they might well have acquired while sheltering from a domestic terror attack committed by rioters who made clear they were doing the bidding of a President trying to steal an election.\n We are as vulnerable as we've ever been. If we eventually want to get to a place of safety, reconciliation, and unity, then we need to demand adherence to reality and telling of the truth -- and the Party of No Responsibility needs to finally understand that actions have consequences.",

        "title": "Netflix has doubled its Black workforce since 2017, but says it still needs to hire more Latinos",
        "body_text": "The number of Black people working at Netflix has doubled over the last three years, but the company admits it has work to do when it comes to adding Latinx staffers to its ranks.\n Those were just two of the revelations made in Netflix's first-ever inclusion report, which was released Wednesday. The company's new demographic data shows its Black US employee population grew from 3.8% of its workforce in 2017 to 8% in 2020.\n More than 18% of the US population is Latinx, but Latinos only comprised about 8% of Netflix's workforce last year, up from just 6% three years ago.\n \"We could do a much better job at recruiting Hispanic or Latinx and other underrepresented folks into all areas of our company,\" the report's authors wrote.\n Lack of Latinx representation in Hollywood and tech has been an ongoing problem. In 2019, just 5% of the speaking roles in the top 100 movies went to Latinx actors, according to the latest USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative report, which analyzes diversity in film and television every year. Latinx individuals were the only racial and ethnic group that was underrepresented in on-screen speaking roles in 2019, the report found.\n More than 9.5% of Netflix (NFLX)'s leaders were Black in 2020, up from 4.2% in 2017. The company's Latinx leadership last year was just 4.9%, up slightly from 4.5% three years ago.\n Overall, more than 46% of Netflix's US workforce and 42% of its leaders were Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, Asian or Pacific Islander in 2020. Women made up just over 47% of the Netflix's workforce last year.\n In 2018, filmmaker Rachel Morrison became the first woman in history to be nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography for her work on the Netflix original film \"Mudbound,\" which was directed by Dee Rees, a Black woman. \"Strong Island\" director Yance Ford became the first trans person to receive an Oscar nod the same year.\n And in 2019, Netflix had more NAACP Image Award and GLAAD Media Award nominations than any other studio. The company says it also released 20 films from first-time filmmakers in 2020. Twelve of those films had non-white directors and eight were directed by women.\n \"What we have learned about diversity and inclusion is that, while it's the right thing to do for sure, it's also responsible for our ability to innovate,\" Vern\u0101 Myers, Netflix's vice president of inclusion strategy, said in a company video about its inclusion efforts. \"My team's vision is to equip everyone with a diversity lens, which is to say that as they do their job, they think about who's not here.\"\n Netflix says building its talent pipeline with underrepresented population is key to its global plans.\n \"I think if we're ever to realize our ambitions around the world, we have to tell stories that reflect the population,\" said Netflix co-CEO & chief content officer Ted Sarandos.",

        "title": "Key takeaways from Wednesday's developments in the Capitol riots investigation",
        "body_text": "One week after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, federal law enforcement's dragnet to arrest the violent trespassers kicked into high gear.\n Nearly a dozen new known defendants were arrested or charged across the country, and the Justice Department made clear it was throwing its weight behind pursuing major cases that may amount to the most extensive counterterrorism probe since September 11, 2001.\n The new arrests on Wednesday brought the total number of new federal criminal cases to at least 32 by nightfall, with hundreds more individuals still being sought or investigated.\n Over the past week, investigators have tracked down some of the most notable faces from the riot. On Wednesday, a federal court made public charges against two police officers from rural Virginia who shared a photo on social media of themselves posing in front of a statue of a Revolutionary War general in the Capitol.\n Swimmer Klete Keller, who won Olympic gold medals in 2004 and 2008, was identifiable on video from the riot partly because of the Team USA jacket he wore, according to federal court records made public Wednesday. He also was charged for taking part in the violent trespass.\n Yet another infamous alleged rioter who had worn a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt on January 6, Robert Keith Packer, was arrested Wednesday in Newport News, Virginia.\n Many of the recently charged drew attention to themselves by posing in photographs that circulated on the internet or were identified (or identified themselves) on social media. Some have even admitted their involvement in the melee to the FBI.\n The unfolding new cases still largely target people caught in photo or videos.\n The attention is likely to pivot to cases with potentially more serious charges in the coming weeks.\n Evidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests a level of planning that has led investigators to believe the attack was not just a protest that spiraled out of control, a federal law enforcement official said.\n This has prompted more complex investigations, where public integrity and national security prosecutors have come together to approach the investigation like a sprawling terrorism probe.\n The presence of corruption prosecutors and agents is in part because of their expertise in financial investigations. \"We are following the money,\" the official said.\n By Wednesday morning, the FBI reported that it had received more than 126,000 digital tips from the public regarding the attack on the Capitol and was tracking online chatter.\n Among the tips the FBI received are some that appear to show members of Congress with people who later showed up at the Capitol riot, two law enforcement officials said. This doesn't mean members of Congress and staff are under investigation, but the FBI is checking the veracity of the claims, the officials said.\n A few cases have made clear the level of danger around the Capitol last week. In particular, two defendants, Cleveland Meredith Jr. and Lonnie Coffman, are alleged to have brought arsenals to the city with interest in joining a so-called war.\n Coffman received one of the first indictments from a grand jury related to the riot, and now faces 17 criminal counts, largely for possession of multiple weapons including ammunition, shotgun shells and various guns, including a shotgun, a rifle, three pistols and 11 Molotov cocktails without registration in Washington, DC, on January 6, according to the indictment.\n He is alleged to have parked his truck filled with bombs blocks from the Capitol building before Trump's rally, after living in the truck in DC for about a week. In court documents regarding Coffman, prosecutors revealed they found handwritten notes of an Abraham Lincoln quote about overthrowing \"the men who pervert the Constitution,\" phone numbers for right-wing personalities including Sen. Ted Cruz and Sean Hannity, and a list labeling a federal judge a \"bad guy\" and a member of Congress as a Muslim. He has pleaded not guilty and is in jail awaiting trial.\n Meredith is alleged to have made threats in a text message and had with him in the city 2,500 rounds of ammunition, an assault rifle and another gun.\n He arrived in Washington, DC, after the pro-Trump rally, and had allegedly gleefully texted about shooting DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He wrote about  \"war time\" against lawmakers as the congressional confirmation of Joe Biden as the President-elect neared, prosecutors say, according to court filings Wednesday.\n \"The defendant sent a text stating, 'We're gonna surround DC and slowly constrict,'\" prosecutors noted, arguing for his detention. \"Apparently under the impression that law enforcement was monitoring his communications, the defendant later sent a text stating, 'I'm harmless . . . I won't fire until ordered SIR!'\"\n Once Meredith was in town, he allegedly head butted and assaulted a person, the prosecutors added.\n \"His threats were graphic -- he threatened to shoot a public official on live television, to put a bullet in her head. His threats were vulgar and misogynistic. What is more, the defendant clearly took great pleasure in envisioning violence, which he described as 'fun' and 'target practice,'\" they wrote in his detention memo.\n At least some of the arrests already made are part of a strategy used in counterterrorism investigations -- to find even a minimal charge to take a person of concern off the streets. That could help ease concern about possible attacks on the Inauguration, officials believe.\n Authorities had already tried this once last week before the pro-Trump rally in Washington, when they arrested the leader of the right-wing group the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, for burning a Black Lives Matter banner.\n Law enforcement then said they found on him two high-capacity firearm magazines, prompting additional charges. And this week, federal authorities in New York City arrested a man on a weapons charge after investigators pursued online postings about an armed caravan heading to the US Capitol.\n The Justice Department may hit up against the potential limits of the law as they try to keep some people locked up -- with Meredith their first challenge.\n The possibility arose Wednesday when a judge pushed back on their ask to keep him detained.\n Meredith's lawyer had argued that keeping him locked up because of perceived \"dangerousness\" alone is not enough under the law.\n \"Congress restricted the government's ability to request detention,\" Meredith's lawyer wrote in a court filing Wednesday afternoon, citing Bail Reform Act limitations that reasons defendants can be kept in jail must be because they are a flight risk, potentially obstructive or charged with crimes of violence, a drug offense, or an offense that could merit a life sentence or death.\n Meredith's lawyer argued he should be released while he awaits his trial.\n Meredith has not yet been indicted, and was arrested last week on a criminal complaint alleging that he illegally possessed weapons and made the threats.\n He is still detained and is set to appear before the judge, Michael Harvey in Washington, DC, again on Thursday regarding whether he should remain in detention.\n CNN's Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump bears some responsibility for Capitol riot, ex-DHS acting Secretary Chad Wolf says ",
        "body_text": "Chad Wolf, who resigned as Homeland Security acting secretary two days ago, said Wednesday that President Donald Trump bears some responsibility for the events at the US Capitol last week.\n \"He's the President. What he says matters,\" Wolf said in an interview with CNN. \"People listen to him -- particularly supporters of his, I would say, really listen to him -- so there is responsibility there.\"\n However, it is for Congress to determine if it was an impeachable offense, Wolf said. He told CNN there is also personal responsibility for the rioters who entered the Capitol. House members, including 10 Republicans, voted 232-197 to impeach Trump on Wednesday afternoon.\n Wolf stepped down as acting secretary on Monday after a government watchdog and federal judges cast doubt on his legitimacy to lead the department, including in a court ruling last Friday blocking Trump administration asylum limits. He served in an acting capacity for 14 months in the top role, a position that now will be filled by Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor for the remaining days of the Trump administration.\n The day after the attack on the Capitol, Wolf urged Trump and all other elected officials to condemn the violence in a sharply worded statement, while vowing to stay in his position until President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\n \"I was disappointed that the President didn't speak out sooner on that. I think he had a role to do that. I think, unfortunately, the administration lost a little bit of the moral high ground on this issue by not coming out sooner on it,\" he said Wednesday of Trump not swiftly condemning the violence.\n Wolf told CNN he would like to see more from the President in terms of calling for nonviolent protests.\n \"[I]f you're going to protest, you do that in a very nonviolent way. I'd like to have him speak, have him say that and just that,\" Wolf said. \"And have that be the message that carries the day.\"\n He said it's not just the President but all politicians who need to call for nonviolence, pointing to violent protests over the summer. \"Violence is violence,\" he said.\n Trump issued a statement Wednesday afternoon calling for no violence \"amid reports of more demonstrations\" and later released a video with the same tone.\n Lawmakers and senior aides had been pleading with the President to issue such a statement while bracing for members of his own party to vote to impeach him.\n Wolf, who joined those pleas Wednesday, said his decision to leave office earlier than planned was due in part to the most recent court case challenging his authority to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\n \"As I talked with the attorneys, and we talked with the Department of Justice and others, there was no, there was no light at the end of the tunnel, there was no avenue to really fight this,\" he said.\n Wolf's legitimacy has been a struggle for the department, which has had a carousel of leadership under the Trump administration, and the issue has threatened to derail policies and other actions put in place during his tenure.\n Last Thursday, it was revealed that the White House had withdrawn Wolf's official nomination to the secretary post, sparking concerns among DHS officials about whether Wolf could legally stay, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n Wolf said Wednesday that the withdrawal triggered another legal issue, putting his authority as acting secretary \"further in jeopardy.\" He said he was unclear why the White House had taken that step. The White House previously said the withdrawal was unrelated to Wolf's criticism of the President.\n Since resigning from the top role, Wolf has remained at the department to wrap up.\n He told CNN on Wednesday that he wanted to leave the department in the \"best hands as possible.\"\n \"I wanted to make sure that they had an acting secretary that could make certain decisions. Just in the last eight days alone, there's going to be a lot of decisions that need to be made, whether internally or externally. I didn't want all those decisions to be litigated,\" Wolf said.\n Wolf's early departure fueled concerns over a department in flux as authorities brace for the possibility of more violence.\n Earlier this week, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, called the timing of Wolf's resignation \"questionable,\" citing concerns about the legality of his appointment. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who's a member of the Armed Services Committee, accused Wolf of \"shirking\" his responsibilities but said the immediate question is dealing with the widespread domestic terrorism event that was \"birthed last week.\"\n Wolf dismissed concerns that his departure so close to a major national event would impact security, saying that \"it's an operational exercise at the moment.\n \"The acting secretary has very little role in that other than to set some policy, make sure other Cabinet agencies are pulling their weight, which they are.\"\n He said law enforcement is concerned about potential attacks on soft targets in the coming days, as authorities fortify downtown Washington for the inauguration.\n \"Individuals that want to be violent, that want to take matters into their own hands. They're looking for soft targets, they're not looking for hard targets. And so obviously, the concern there is that DC is hardened, where do they go?\" Wolf said, pointing to the massive security presence rolling out in the capital.\n In one of his last acts as acting secretary, Wolf authorized the start date of the National Special Security Event designation to be moved up to January 13 from January 19. The designation, which places the US Secret Service as the lead agency, allows for a higher level of security and more law enforcement coordination. The department wanted all law enforcement assets in place for the weekend and any permitted gatherings, he said.\n Wolf said he is \"very confident about law enforcement's ability to make sure that the inauguration is safe and secure as it can be.\"\n On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called on DHS to immediately add the \"insurrectionists\" who stormed the Capitol to the Transportation Security Administration's no-fly list. Schumer said he's talked with FBI Director Christopher Wray twice in the last few days.\n Wolf, who was involved in the establishment of TSA, pushed back on the idea of adding people involved in the riot to the no-fly list. \"That is a very slippery slope, when we talk about US persons, that is a very slippery slope,\" he said, arguing that people arrested for violent acts during protests this summer would also need to be added to the list.\n He said adding people to the list is a \"very serious issue\" that should be thoroughly thought out.\n This story has been updated with additional details from the interview.\n CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "Rep. Peter Meijer, one of just 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach President Donald Trump, explained his vote Wednesday evening as a step toward \"accountability\" following the President's response to last week's US Capitol insurrection.\n \"I was in the House chamber when it was being attacked a week ago today. That was a moment that called for leadership. I was hoping to see the President rapidly try to de-escalate, try to denounce, try to stop the violence from occurring, and he abandoned his post,\" Meijer, a Michigan freshman lawmaker told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.\n \"To me that was disqualifying. My heart broke in that time, seeing folks ransacking the Capitol. And since then, the President has not accepted responsibility. I hold the seat that was held by Gerald Ford for 25 years before he was elevated to the White House. He pardoned Richard Nixon, but that was after Richard Nixon resigned and was held accountable for his actions. And here, there must be accountability.\"\n The House voted 232 to 197 to impeach Trump exactly one week after rioters forced lawmakers to flee from the very chamber in which they cast ballots in the fourth presidential impeachment in US history -- and the first time a president has been impeached twice. In all, 10 GOP lawmakers -- including the House's No. 3 Republican, Liz Cheney of Wyoming -- joined all Democrats to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n Meijer -- who replaced Justin Amash, the Republican-turned-independent former congressman who supported Trump's first impeachment -- had signaled his support for impeachment earlier in the week, telling CNN's Erin Burnett on \"Out Front\" that Trump is \"no longer qualified to hold that office.\"\n Pressed at that time on whether he'd made a definitive decision on impeachment, Meijer maintained that he would \"wait to see the additional evidence presented, but again, this is something we're strongly considering.\"\n Ultimately, though, he concluded that Trump had \"betrayed his oath of office by seeking to undermine our constitutional process,\" according to a statement released by Meijer's office earlier Wednesday.\n \"This vote is not a victory. It isn't a victory for my party, and it isn't the victory the Democrats might think it is. I'm not sure it is a victory for our country,\" the statement said. \"But it is a call to action for us to reflect on these events and seek ways to correct them.\"\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not planning to bring the chamber back for a trial before January 19, meaning it won't begin until Trump is out of office and President-elect Joe Biden has been sworn in.\n McConnell said in a statement following the vote that a Senate trial could not be completed ahead of Biden's inauguration even if it started beforehand, and he wanted Congress and the executive branch to spend the next week focused on \"facilitating a safe inauguration\" and an orderly transfer of power.\n \"I trust that Sen. McConnell will do what he thinks is best for the country,\" Meijer said Wednesday evening. \"He's shown that he cares about the institution, that he cares about the nation, and I'm sure whatever timeline he proposes will be appropriate.\"\n CNN's Jeremy Herb, Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The US just suffered its worst day ever for Covid-19 deaths. But this summer could be 'dramatically better'",
        "body_text": "Covid-19 is now killing faster than at any point in 2020. And the new year just started.\n The US reported its highest number of Covid-19 deaths in one day Tuesday: 4,327, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n In fact, the five highest daily tallies for new infections and new deaths have all occurred in 2021.\n Over the past week, the US has averaged more than 3,300 deaths every day, a jump of more than 217% from mid-November.\n More than 3 million new US cases have been reported in the first 13 days of the year. As of Wednesday, more than 23 million Americans have been infected with the virus, a million more than just four days earlier, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n Many experts aren't surprised after widespread holiday gatherings, casual get-togethers with friends and weeks of record-high hospitalization numbers.\n More than 131,300 people are now hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n In some parts of the country, hospitals have reached their breaking point.\n On Tuesday, Arizona reported a record-high 5,082 hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The same day, it broke a second record: more than 1,180 Covid-19 patients in ICU beds.\n Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards extended an order that keeps mitigation measures in place for nearly another month, saying the state was seeing a \"huge spike\" in cases and hospitalizations.\n As students return for the first semester of 2021, many college towns are seeing a new onslaught of Covid-19.\n More than a quarter of the population in 30 US counties comes from full-time enrollment at higher education institutes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n In 10 of those counties, at least 90% of staffed ICU beds are occupied, according to the NCES. Those counties include Oktibbeha County, home to Mississippi State University, where almost all ICU beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients.\n And in 26 of the counties, Covid-19 cases increased by an average of 50% over the past week.\n In Williamsburg, Virginia -- home to William & Mary -- Covid-19 cases nearly tripled in one week. But the university said most students have not yet returned to the area. As of Wednesday, the university had only two known active cases -- one is a student, and one is an employee.\n New cases doubled in both Whitman County, Washington -- home of Washington State University -- and Albany County, Wyoming -- home of the University of Wyoming.\n While vaccinations continue to lag behind predictions, health experts are begging Americans to hunker down in their bubbles for these next few months as soaring hospitalizations lead to record daily deaths.\n While those \"awful\" numbers will likely continue this winter, better months are coming, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n Mass vaccinations, warmer weather, a new presidential administration and a population building immunity could lead to a \"dramatically better\" summer, he said.\n Two \"remarkably effective\" vaccines are already being administered, and two more vaccines -- from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca -- \"are right around the corner,\" Offit said.\n An international team of researchers who tested Johnson & Johnson's vaccine wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday that early-stage trials showed that it generated an immune response in almost all volunteers, with minimal side effects, after a single dose.\n The company expects to report on more advanced trials later this month and is hoping to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA soon after.\n The incoming Biden administration \"isn't into this cult of denialism\" that has surrounded the Trump administration's coronavirus response, and it would \"take this problem head on,\" Offit said.\n If another 55% to 60% of the population can be vaccinated -- something Offit said can be done if the US gives 1 million to 1.5 million doses a day -- \"then I really do think that by June, we can stop the spread of this virus.\"\n On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the federal government will no longer hold back second doses of Covid-19 vaccines that it kept in reserve.\n \"We are telling states they should open vaccinations to all people ... 65 and over and all people under age 65 with a comorbidity with some form of medical documentation,\" Azar said.\n Second doses will still be available to those who need them, he said, noting that \"based on the science and evidence we have, it is imperative that people receive their second doses on time.\"\n The Pfizer vaccine doses should be spaced 21 days apart, and the Moderna doses should be 28 days apart.\n More than 27.6 million vaccine doses have so far been distributed, according to CDC data, and more than 9.3 million people have received their first dose -- a far cry from where some experts hoped the country would be by now.\n In many cases, it's been the rigid following of guidance on who should get the vaccines first that has slowed the vaccine rollout, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday.\n While priorities recommended by the CDC shouldn't be abandoned, Fauci said, \"When people are ready to get vaccinated, we're going to move right on to the next level, so that there are not vaccine doses that are sitting in a freezer or refrigerator where they could be getting into people's arm.\"\n Once the supply of vaccine is available, pharmacists around the country will have the capacity to give 100 million doses of vaccine in one month, Steven Anderson, the president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, told reporters on a phone call.\n And starting in two weeks, vaccines will be distributed to states based on which jurisdictions are getting the most doses into arms and where the most older adults reside.\n \"We will be allocating them based on the pace of administration as reported by states and by the size of the 65 and over population in each state,\" Azar said.\n \"We're giving states two weeks' notice of this shift to give them the time necessary to plan and to improve their reporting if they think their data is faulty.\"\n Only six states have administered more than 50% of the doses distributed to them, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Connecticut, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.\n On the opposite end, seven states have administered less than 25% of the doses they were given: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho and Virginia.\n Nearly 2.3 million children tested positive for Covid-19 from the pandemic's start through January 7, a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association shows.\n More than 171,000 of those cases were reported between December 31 and January 7, while over two weeks -- between December 24 through January 7 -- there was a 15% increase in child Covid-19 cases, the report said.\n The findings mean children now represent 12.5% of all infections in the US.\n \"At this time, it appears that severe illness due to Covid-19 is rare among children,\" the report said.\n \"However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects.\"\n Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the last name of a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. His name is Dr. Paul Offit.\n CNN's Naomi Thomas, Amanda Watts, Joe Sutton, Jacqueline Howard, Jacqueline Howard, Nick Neville, Maggie Fox, Deidre McPhillips, Jessica Firger and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.",

        "title": " Here's why we can have some hope about the Covid pandemic",
        "body_text": "The US keep breaking records in the coronavirus pandemic. The latest: 3 million new cases in the first two weeks of the year.\n But some experts say there's hope.\n Vaccines, spring weather and, surprisingly, the high number of infections all offer cause for optimism,  Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said Wednesday.\n Plus there's an expectation the incoming Biden administration will handle things better than the Trump administration has.\n While the \"awful\" numbers are likely to worsen for the next couple of months, Offit believes that the US could stop the spread of the virus by June.\n Offit believes that things \"are soon going to get dramatically better.\"\n Two Covid vaccines licensed for use in the US under emergency use authorization are \"remarkably effective,\" Offit said.\n Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, agreed. \"We can see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said, adding that vaccines \"show us a way forward.\"\n States are still struggling to get vaccines into people's arms. Only about 35% of vaccines distributed to states have been given to people, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. And the US government's Operation Warp Speed has only managed to ship about 10 million doses to state and local governments -- half what it promised to have been distributed and administered by the end of the 2020.\n \"It's still not there by any means. There's still a lot of work to do to get the vaccination program up and running,\" Benjamin said.\n But there is a steady increase in the number of people being vaccinated. States have passed 500,000 vaccinations a day on average -- something that gives Benjamin confidence that the country can reach a million a day, if not more.\n Two more vaccines --  from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca -- \"are right around the corner,\" Offit said. These will \"dramatically increase\" the options and the amount of vaccines available, according to Benjamin.\n Offit is also hopeful about the incoming Biden administration, noting that President-elect Joe Biden's team \"isn't into this cult of denialism\" that surrounded the Trump administration's coronavirus response, and would \"take this problem head on.\"\n Benjamin believes the Biden team will make more use of the Defense Production Act to ensure that there is a steady, reliable supply of vaccine. He's also looking forward to a better coordinated, all-of-government response.\n Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health security and an infectious disease physician, praised the Biden administration's plans to increase the availability of at-home testing, rejoin the World Health Organization and restore pandemic staff at the National Security Council.\n He is also hopeful that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will function independently under the Biden administration. \"The fact that we've been unable to really get a handle on this pandemic has been because the CDC has not been able to act the way they usually do during infectious diseases emergencies,\" Adalja said.\n \"The weather will get warmer, when the weather gets warmer, that makes it much more difficult for this virus,\" Offit said. When it is hot and humid, the virus, which is spread by small droplets, should spread less easily, he said.\n Benjamin also pointed out people can spend more time outdoors when the weather warms up across the US. People can stay further apart when they are outside and are not sharing the same air -- so the virus has less opportunity to pass from one person to another.\n \"The virus will find it harder to move around between person to person, especially when people are doing activities outdoors in the summer,\" Adalja said.\n \"We didn't really see the seasonality this summer because there were so many people who were not immune to the virus,\" he added. \"Even in the weather conditions of the summer, (the virus) still found it pretty easy to find new people to infect.\"\n Another reason for optimism is that huge number of Americans who likely have been infected and now have some immunity to the virus, Offit said.\n While 23 million have been diagnosed and reported, that number is an underestimate. Many people have had asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection and were never tested. The numbers of people who have been infected are probably closer to 65 or 70 million, Offit said.\n \"That's 20% of the population who, when they're re-exposed to this virus, are not going to become sick with it,\" he said. It's not clear how long immunity after infection lasts, but studies indicate it's at least eight or nine months and perhaps longer.\n If another 55 to 60% of the population can be vaccinated -- something that Offit said can be done at a million to a million and a half doses a day -- \"then I really do think that by June we can stop the spread of this virus.\"\n Benjamin agreed.\n \"History has told us that these things go away. And you have to do something to make them go away,\" Benjamin said. \"Even in 1918, 1919, people got infected and tragically the world had to go through that. We achieved some kind of equilibrium, got to herd immunity and it ended.\"\n \"I think that there's tremendous potential that this pandemic will end in 2021, before the end of the year for sure, maybe even before autumn,\" said Dr. Aaron Glatt,  spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America and chairman of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau.\n \"But it certainly will not get to that if the vaccine isn't distributed, or heaven forbid, the vaccine doesn't work in the future, doesn't work as well.\"\n Dr. Sunny Jha, an anesthesiologist at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, is also cautious.\n \"If we can scale the numbers up, if we can get rid of the hesitancy, if we can eliminate the disinformation, misinformation, I think I'd be a lot more optimistic,\" Jha said.\n \"But if you're asking me today if I feel like we're on track for summer, based on what I'm seeing now, I don't think we'll be there.\"\n \"I'm cautiously optimistic, I guess,\" he said. \"I think we have the right mindset. I think if we eliminate the hesitancy we'll be in better shape.'",

        "body_text": "Steven A. Holmes is a veteran journalist who worked at Time Magazine, The New York Times, where he was part of a team awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and The Washington Post before he joined CNN, where he was a member of the Standards and Practices team until retiring a year ago. The views expressed here are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.\nI believe Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses on January 6 and should be removed from office and barred from ever seeking public office again.\n The problem is Democrats, and those Republicans seeking to impeach the President, are focusing on the wrong charge. As we speak, an article of impeachment has been voted on to charge Trump with inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, threatening the lives of lawmakers and even his vice president. While, in some ways, this is the most emotionally satisfying charge. It is also the weakest.\n The House should've added an article charging Trump with dereliction of his oath of office for his dithering response once the rioting at the Capitol had begun.\n I realize that I am treading on legal grounds, and that I am not a lawyer. But lawyers don't render verdicts on guilt or innocence. Juries do. And in this case the Senate jurors will have to weigh the words Trump uttered when he spoke to his supporters during  his \"Save America Rally\" before they went off to commit mayhem and decide whether he encouraged them to engage in violent acts.\n Much has been made of Trump exhorting the crowd to \"march to the Capitol,\" to not be \"weak,\" and to \"fight like hell.\" But Trump's defense will probably argue that much of this rhetoric is standard Trumpian fare that hasn't resulted in riots and is probably protected by the First Amendment. More importantly, his defense will point to these remarks: \"...we're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\"\n Trump later followed that up by saying, \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"\n Some have argued that Trump knew full well he was riling his followers up and that he cannot claim he was unaware of what they might do. But it is difficult to ignore the fact that his speech contained no explicit calls for violence and two explicit exhortations for the crowd to engage in peaceful protest. How will Republican senators whose votes will be needed to sustain impeachment explain to their constituents who are still rabidly loyal to the president why they ignored such exculpatory evidence?\n A far wiser strategy is to add on an article of impeachment that charges Trump with dereliction of duty and failure to uphold his oath of office for his conduct once the attack on the Capitol had commenced.\n According to a chilling article in the Washington Post, Trump sat on his hands, watching the invasion of the Capitol on TV, ignoring pleas from current and former staff as well as from frightened Republican lawmakers hiding from the rampaging mob that he do something to call off his supporters and that he immediately order the deployment of the National Guard to expel the insurrectionists from the halls of Congress.\n The Post, citing officials, reported that \"several Republican members of Congress also called White House aides begging them to get Trump's attention and have him call for the violence to end. The lawmakers reiterated that they had been loyal Trump supporters and were even willing to vote against the Electoral College results -- but were now scared for their lives, officials said.\"\n It seems Trump could not draw his attention away from watching the scenes of devastation play out on TV to even inquire about the safety of those threatened by that devastation, perhaps because he was sympathetic to the rioters' cause. \"It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, normally a staunch Trump ally, told the Post. \"The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.\"\n It took Trump 30 minutes after the Capitol was first breached, according to the Post, for him, at the urging of key staff, to issue a mealy-mouth tweet. \"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement,\" he wrote. \"They are truly on the side of our country. Stay peaceful!\" The tweet made no mention of not harming lawmakers or congressional staff; or Vice President Pence who was also hiding from the rioters. According to the Post, Trump had not even wanted to add the plea to \"stay peaceful\" to his tweet.\n Less than an hour later Trump posted a slightly more forceful tweet. \"I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful,\" he wrote. \"No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order -- Respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!\" The White House finally released a video shortly after 4 p.m. in which Trump told the rioters, \"We have to have peace. So, go home,\" he said. \"We love you. You are very special.\"\n Neither the tweets, nor the video message contained any mention of not harming lawmakers or congressional staff. Nor did they make any mention of calling in additional police, the National Guard or active-duty troops to quell the disturbance. So far, no evidence has emerged that the president was in touch with the Pentagon about the possibility of some kind of military intervention to protect Congress.\n And while Trump could argue that he did not incite the violence, what's his defense for his failure to act to stop it? That he was too busy watching TV?\n President Dwight D. Eisenhower dispatched paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957 to protect nine black school children seeking to integrate schools. Sixty-four years later, Trump could not lift a telephone to protect hundreds of duly elected members of the first branch of government.\n This was a clear dereliction of his oath of office in which Trump pledged to \"faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States.\" What more basic duty is there for a president than to protect the people, and their representatives from all enemies, foreign and domestic?\n In declaring that she would vote for impeachment, Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the House, put it succinctly. \"The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence,\" she said. \"He did not.\"",

        "title": "Biden calls on Senate to pursue impeachment along with the nation's 'other urgent business'",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday urged the Senate to conduct the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump while simultaneously working on other critical issues, indicating a desire to settle the proceedings against Trump that are likely to remain unresolved when Biden takes office.\n While he said in a statement Wednesday that the House's vote \"to impeach and hold the president accountable\" was \"a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience,\" Biden wants to hit the ground running on a broad spectrum of economic and public health initiatives when he takes office next week. He said the Senate needs to be able to follow through on Trump's impeachment trial while working on his agenda.\n \"This nation also remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\" Biden continued. \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\"\n The House voted 232 to 197 on Wednesday to impeach Trump, with 10 GOP lawmakers joining all Democrats to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection\" exactly one week after rioters stormed the US Capitol as the House certified Biden's election victory. Marking the first time a president has been impeached twice, the process now advances to the Senate, which will conduct a trial.\n Biden has made clear he's not particularly enthusiastic for Trump's impeachment, remaining silent for several hours on the historic action. Aides had told CNN that the President-elect was planning to release a statement Wednesday night on the President's impeachment, but the timing certainly underscores that the Biden team had other priorities on Wednesday.\n Yet the reality is that impeachment will now be one more thing Biden inherits from the Trump presidency.\n He is still awaiting word on whether the Senate will be able to pursue impeachment, alongside Cabinet confirmation hearings and Covid-19 legislation he plans to outline in greater detail Thursday evening. Aides say Biden and his team are working behind the scenes with Senate Democrats -- and House impeachment managers -- to keep the impeachment trial as swift as possible, although it remains an open question how successful that might be.\n At least four confirmation hearings for Biden's Cabinet nominees are already scheduled for the week of January 20, for Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary nominee Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen and Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Alejandro Mayorkas. Senators could be called on to draft legislation having to do with the pandemic or economic relief, as Biden wants to increase relief checks to $2,000.\n CNN's Sarah Mucha and Zachary B.

        "title": "Japan expands state of emergency and bans entry of foreign nationals as coronavirus as infections climb",
        "body_text": "Japan will expand its state of emergency to seven more prefectures and ban all foreign nationals from entering the country, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday.\n The country reported 4,527 new cases and 51 deaths Tuesday, bringing the national total to almost 300,000, with a death toll of 4,158. More than 61,500 patients are in hospitals across the country, which have been struggling to deal with a spike in cases brought on in part by freezing winter temperatures.\n Tokyo, previously among the worst hit areas, reported 970 new cases Tuesday, the first time the Japanese capital's daily tally has dropped below 1,000 in over a week. The total number of confirmed cases in Tokyo now stands at 77,133.\n A state of emergency was previously declared for Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa last week, to be in place until February 7.\n The new announcement expands the order to Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu, Tochigi and Fukuoka, covering much of Japan's main island of Honshu. Eleven prefectures in total are now under emergency measures.\n The state of emergency orders companies to encourage their staff to work from home and reduce office populations by 70%. Residents of the affected areas are also urged to avoid non-essential outings and restaurants have to stop serving alcohol by 7 p.m. and close by 8 p.m.\n Sports and entertainment events in Japan are also requested to limit the number of attendees.\n Suga also said the country will temporarily ban the entry of all foreign nationals into the country amid the country's rise in Covid-19 cases, though he did not clarify when the ban would go into effect.\n Suga asked for the public's help after announcing the expanded measures Wednesday.\n \"I hope people to understand that this is an indispensable measure to improve this difficult situation. We will do everything we need to do. I apologize for the inconvenience caused your life with many restrictions, but we must overcome this,\" he said at a news conference.\n \"I would like to ask for the cooperation of the people.\"\n However, unlike a number of other countries which have introduced lockdowns and social distancing measures, Japan lacks much in the way of legal powers to force compliance with the government's orders. The country is also grappling with coronavirus fatigue, having been among the earliest hit by the pandemic, and mixed messages in recent months.\n \"Japan's response is too slow and confusing, which reflects the lack of leadership and strategy. On one hand they encouraged domestic travel and eating out, on the other they just asked people to take caution,\" Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, said earlier this month. \"The government is basically asking people voluntarily to behave properly, but does not do more than that.\"\n Speaking after the Tokyo emergency order, Satoshi Kamayachi, a physician and member of the government's expert advisory board, told CNN affiliate TV Asahi that it was \"not enough period to curb the infection surge, we need to reduce more the human contact.\"\n Japanese officials are believed to be wary of introducing a full lockdown or other more stringent emergency measures for fear of harming the economy. The country is also once again facing difficult decisions around the OIympics, which were due to take place last summer but were eventually postponed as the pandemic spread around the world.\n The Tokyo Games are scheduled to be held this summer from July 23 to August 8, according to the International Olympic Committee, with pared-back opening and closing ceremonies in keeping with an \"overall simplification of the Games.\"\n Last week, the Tokyo metropolitan government said it would be postponing the upcoming exhibitions of the Tokyo Olympics torch \"to reduce the flow of people and to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\" The torch had been on display in several municipalities from November and was due to restart this week.\n In a New Year's address to Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee staff this week, Chairman Yoshiro Mori said that preparations would proceed \"as planned,\" adding that \"I think everything would be affected if I scratch my head or show any indecisiveness.\"\n \"We will emerge from this dark tunnel in cooperation with you. I would like you all do the best until end to bring many people joy and hope in the belief that spring comes after winter and morning always comes after a long night,\" Mori said.\n A recent poll by Japanese public broadcaster NHK found that 77% of respondents felt the Games should be postponed again or completely canceled, with only 16% in favor of holding them this year.\n Speaking to CNN, former top International Olympic Committee official Dick Pound said that it was unlikely the Games could be postponed again, and so any additional delay would likely mean their cancellation.\n \"The one year postponement was a proposal by Japan, the Organizing Committee said 'look, we can hold this together for another year, but not further',\" he said. \"Postponing it for another year, for example, will come at a huge cost, which Japan may not be willing to incur. It will further complicate a crowded sports schedule ...you're going to have the World Cup and football going on, and at some point it's just there's just too much congestion in the overall system.\"\n He dismissed the suggestion that the Tokyo Olympics could be shifted to 2024, and all planned host cities moved forward in turn, as being from people \"without any conception of what that (plan) means in real life.\"\n CNN's James Griffiths contributed reporting from Hong Kong.",

        "title": "Pharmacy chains want to help as nation struggles to vaccinate people against Covid",
        "body_text": "The US may be struggling to vaccinate citizens against coronavirus, but pharmacy chains say they can help speed up the balky rollout.\n Pharmacists nationwide will have the capacity to administer 100 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine once supply is available, Steven Anderson, president and CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said Wednesday.\n \"Based on conservative assumptions, pharmacies have the capacity to meet the demand for 100 million vaccine doses in one month when that level of the vaccine supply is available,\" Anderson told reporters on a phone call Wednesday.\n So far, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US has vaccinated only about 10 million people, and distributed just over 29 million doses of vaccine. States say they are struggling to vaccinate people, in part because of lack of public health infrastructure.\n Pharmacy chains say they can help fill that gap.\n NACDS represents 40,000 pharmacies and 155,000 pharmacists, according to Anderson.  The group says 90% of Americans live within five miles of a retail drug store and the \"dormant\" Federal Pharmacy Partnership Program could open the door to harnessing the capacity of chain pharmacies.\n \"America's retail pharmacies can easily administer 100 million vaccine doses in 30 days,\" the group said in a statement.\n \"This solution could easily be ramped up even further as stores deploy more vaccinators -- pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, pharmacy interns, nurses, clinic physicians, EMTs and others.\"\n Individual chains laid out their own optimistic plans Wednesday.\n Walgreens expects to administer 30 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the US by the end of this summer, once vaccines are available to the wider population.\n The drugstore chain is hiring and training staff and increasing digital and phone booking capabilities in preparation for the wider vaccine rollout.\n \"We're making sure that everyone is ready to get after this as soon as the vaccines become available en masse, which we believe will be probably March, April,\" Walgreens Chief Operating Officer Alexander Gourlay said at the JP Morgan 39th Annual Health Care Conference.\n By the end of this summer, Gourlay estimated, 300 million doses of vaccine will have been administered across the country -- enough to vaccinate 150 million people -- and retail pharmacies will administer about 100 million of those doses.\n CVS has even more ambitious plans to administer 100 million doses.\n \"We're very hopeful that the federal program will open up soon and open a more direct distribution into pharmacies across the country, which will open up access,\" CVS Executive Vice President Karen Lynch told the JP Morgan Health Conference.\n Lynch said CVS currently has the ability to administer 25 million vaccinations a month,  or roughly a million a day, through its retail locations across the country.\n \"We have a large reach,\" Lynch said, saying the company's 10,000 stores can reach 85% of the American population.\n In this early phase of the vaccine rollout, CVS has been administering vaccines inside long-term care facilities after states allocate the doses under contract with the federal government. Lynch said the pharmacy chain is just coming up on 1 million vaccines administered this week in long-term care facilities.\n \"We can open up the aperture to get more shots in the arm as soon as the federal program is fully in play,\" she said.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n In today's business news: The Trump business backlash continues, there's a Keurig for ice cream and Las Vegas can't catch a break. Let's get into it.\n What a week. In just seven days, the Trump brand has gone from divisive to radioactive. Businesses can't sever ties fast enough and mainstream platforms have silenced the president's accounts. And today, Trump became the only president in American history to be impeached twice.\n Here are the latest developments on the business fallout:\n Officials in New York City announced plans to\u00a0end the Trump Organization's contracts to operate the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, the Central Park Carousel and the Wollman and Lasker ice skating rinks.\n \"The attacks on our Capitol killed a police officer, left four rioters dead, exposed lawmakers to Covid-19 and threatened the constitutional transfer of power,\" the city said. \"They were a national abomination.

        "title": "As sites shift from Covid-19 testing to vaccinations, health officials warn balance is needed",
        "body_text": "Many NFL and Major League Baseball stadiums, from New York to Los Angeles, have been Covid-19 testing sites -- and now some of those same facilities are being repurposed again as Covid-19 vaccination centers.\n Yet many health officials warn that balance is needed to ensure Covid-19 testing efforts continue even as the country pushes for more coronavirus vaccinations\n That balance is the crux of an issue that public health officials have grown more concerned about, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \"Converting some of those large-scale venues from testing to vaccination, at least for the time being, makes sense -- just because we do have to start to scale up the vaccination, but I think there's a balance,\" Plescia said.\n \"We can't just switch everything over to vaccinations,\" he said. \"We need to continue to have some resources where people can get tested.\"\n In Los Angeles, Dodger Stadium will transition into a Covid-19 vaccination site by the end of the week and stopped offering Covid-19 testing as of Monday, according to a statement from LA Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n The announcement noted that the shift in resources \"will temporarily reduce testing capacity\" in LA county, but \"it will more than triple the number of daily vaccines\" available for locals.\n \"From early on in this pandemic, Dodger Stadium has been home base for our testing infrastructure, a vital part of our effort to track the spread of COVID-19, try to get ahead of outbreaks, and save lives,\" Garcetti said on Monday.\n \"Vaccines are the surest route to defeating this virus and charting a course to recovery, so the City, County, and our entire team are putting our best resources on the field to get Angelenos vaccinated as quickly, safely, and efficiently as possible.\"\n In New York City, a Covid-19 vaccination mega-site will be set up at Citi Field stadium later this month, according to an announcement from Mayor Bill de Blasio. The stadium was previously used for Covid-19 testing earlier in the pandemic.\n \"We chose this site in part, because this was one of our testing sites. It was a very popular testing site,\" Dr. Ted Long, executive director of NYC Health + Hospitals Test and Trace Corps, which will be operating the vaccination center, said during a briefing on Tuesday. \"So, we've been successful testing there, we're going to be successful with the vaccine there.\"\n Major League Baseball teams reached out to county and city health officials this week to offer every MLB stadium in the country as a mass vaccination site, Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \"These stadiums are wonderful areas to be repurposed for larger, mass vaccination efforts,\" Freeman said, but she added that testing is still a priority.\n \"We have so many places across the country still experiencing high levels of transmission and resurgence of disease, that we can't afford to let down the testing right now,\" she said. \"We're too early in the vaccination process to do that, because we still need to mitigate and manage the spread of the disease, even while we're vaccinating.\"\n Stadiums aren't the only facilities morphing into vaccination sites or shifting focus from testing to vaccines. For instance, officials in Orange County, California announced on Monday that Disneyland Resort in Anaheim will become a vaccination site and will be operational later this week.\n In Philadelphia, a nonprofit called \"Philly Fighting Covid\" opened a mass vaccination clinic at the Pennsylvania Convention Center last week. The group then announced on Sunday that it was \"canceling testing until further notice to focus on vaccine operations.\"\n More mass vaccination sites are likely to pop up after the US Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday that the federal government would help states set them up.\n \"If states wish to set up mass-vaccination sites, we stand ready to help,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams posted to Twitter on Tuesday.\n After taking a dip at the end of December, testing across the United States rebounded to the record high level it had reached before the holidays. According to the Covid Tracking Project, the seven-day average of new tests has reached more than 1.9 million per day, and has never been higher.\n Covid-19 vaccinations and testing \"still have to go on simultaneously\" and are both \"equally important\" right now, Blaire Bryant, associate legislative director for health at the National Association of Counties, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \"Counties and local public health departments are going to find ways to continue to do testing and do testing on a mass scale,\" Bryant said.\n Repurposing stadiums and other large sites for vaccines will be a good thing for vaccine delivery, she said. \"As far as testing goes, we know at the local public health level that that's still very important and we wouldn't do one to sacrifice the other.\"\n Testing and vaccinations serve different purposes.\n From a public health perspective, \"testing is necessary in the short-term to be able to react quickly when cases are increasing and prevent or interrupt outbreaks whereas vaccinations are a prophylactic solution to prevent cases and end the pandemic,\" said Dr. Sadiya Khan, assistant professor of preventive medicine in epidemiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n \"In an ideal world we would have enough resources to optimize vaccine rollout, as well as continue testing at the volumes that are necessary,\" she said. \"I think there's always going to be a little bit of give and take.\"\n Plescia, of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, agrees that vaccination is the way out of the pandemic -- but it's not the way out of record-high case numbers and deaths the country is experiencing now.\n \"This issue we're in right now with rapidly rising rates of infection, with hospitals getting filled up with more and more people dying, we're not going to vaccinate our way out of that,\" Plescia said.\n \"What we do now with vaccination isn't really going to come to fruition for several months. So in order to control what's going on now we have to continue doing the testing, doing isolation and quarantine of people, having people wear masks and maintain social distance.\"\n CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.",

        "title": "How a swift impeachment was born under siege",
        "body_text": "Rioters were still ransacking the halls of the US Capitol when two Democrats stuck in lockdown together in the House office buildings across the street started drafting the impeachment resolution that led to the unprecedented second impeachment of President Donald Trump almost exactly one week later.\n California Rep. Ted Lieu was forced to evacuate his office in the Cannon Office Building as insurrectionists converged on the Capitol. Grabbing a ProBar energy bar in his office, Lieu said he and his chief of staff called the top aide to Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline while wandering the halls and asked if they could hunker down in Cicilline's office in the Rayburn House Office Building.\n Cicilline quickly agreed, and it was there that the two Democrats began watching the events unfold in the Capitol as their colleagues were forced to flee the House chamber with a mob outside. Lieu and Cicilline's aides, meanwhile, were texting with a top aide for Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who was in hiding with Raskin's family as the siege unfolded. As Trump failed to call off the mob with his tweets, the Democrats vowed to try to remove the President from power for a second time.\n Lieu quickly sent a message to a chain including the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.\n \"First it said, 'I pray everyone is safe.' And second, I said, 'The House Judiciary Committee should start drafting articles of impeachment now, regardless of what leadership says,'\" Lieu said in an interview.\n Several lawmakers, locked down elsewhere in the Capitol, quickly texted their agreement, and Lieu and Cicilline got to work with input from Raskin drafting the text that would serve as the basis of the House's 232-197 vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection.\" Ten Republicans joined with the Democrats to support Trump's impeachment, in a stark break from the first impeachment of Trump in 2019. The co-authors, Cicilline, Lieu and Raskin, are three of the nine House impeachment managers who will argue their case against Trump in the upcoming Senate trial.\n Democratic lawmakers and aides told CNN that Trump's impeachment was the only feasible option to channel the fury and terror that lawmakers felt after their lives were placed in danger by a pro-Trump mob. As the hours and days progressed, the new information that was revealed -- the rioters' desire to kill Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the violent attacks on Capitol Police leading to the death of an officer and the sinister aims of taking hostages -- only strengthened their resolve to make Trump the first president in United States history to be impeached twice.\n \"This is right in your face, easier for everyone to understand, including members of his own party, who also had to hide behind barricades and be evacuated,\" said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.\n Pelosi spent much of 2019 at odds with the wing of House Democrats pushing for impeachment, before Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political opponent -- and now President-elect -- Joe Biden pushed Pelosi and nearly the entire Democratic caucus toward impeachment.\n But Pelosi had little hesitation the second time around, after her office was ransacked and her staff at risk when rioters broke into her ornate office just off the Capitol rotunda. Pelosi was still deliberate in her actions ahead of the impeachment vote, saying she wanted Pence to use the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power. But she made clear the day after the riots the House would act if Pence did not.\n And there was no dissent in her ranks.\n \"My phone is exploding with 'impeach, impeach, impeach,\" Pelosi said of her members. \"The President must be held accountable.\"\n It was a unified front that never wavered. In fact, several members said, the steadfast desire to move forward only hardened in the days that followed in the wake of briefings from law enforcement officials that underscored just how catastrophic the events of January 6 -- already deadly -- could have been.\n \"I don't think I can make this any more clear,\" said one Democratic member who participated in several detailed briefings that outlined the possibility of a concerted and coordinated attack with a motive driven by bloodshed. \"It was far worse than any of us imagined, far more dangerous than any of us could've fathomed and positively terrifying in hindsight.\"\n For House Republicans, who were united against Trump's first impeachment, this round exposed not only the deep divisions over Trump's conduct but a real schism over how and if the party should move ahead without him.\n Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, voted to impeach Trump, charging there had \"never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\" Nine Republicans joined her to vote to impeach Trump, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leaving open the possibility he could support conviction.\n It was a small minority of the conference, but it represented the most impeachment votes a president received from within his own party in US history. Those that chose to vote yes -- a mix of mostly moderates and new members -- made clear that they viewed Trump's actions as leaving with them with no choice, even as they grappled with the repercussions.\n \"I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years,\" South Carolina GOP Rep. Tom Rice said in a statement after his vote to impeach -- one that stunned many of his colleagues. \"I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable.\"\n Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, a second-term Ohio Republican, said in a statement his process mirrored that of members across the Capitol -- one that included days of walking through memories of the events, participating in harrowing law enforcement briefings and watching videos that underscored the real severity of the moment, something many acknowledge they had no grasp of as they were rushed to undisclosed locations or their offices to shelter during the attack.\n What his vote came down to, however, was Trump's specific actions. \"These are fundamental threats not just to people's lives but to the very foundation of our Republic,\" he said.\n Those positions set the stage for the next step, and the next chamber, where Republicans have largely kept their views on impeachment close to the vest. But one has, at least somewhat, tipped his hand: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n In a message to his members just hours before the House vote, McConnell pledged he had yet to make up his mind and would listen to all the evidence presented.\n The Kentucky Republican, Trump's most ardent defender in the Senate in the first impeachment trial, has told associates he believes Trump committed impeachable offenses. He was also furious in the wake of not just the attack, but Trump and fellow Republicans' efforts to undercut Biden's electoral victory on the Senate floor.\n But McConnell, in a statement, also made clear there will be no rush toward a trial with the Senate out of session until January 19. That, largely, is due to the current security situation.\n \"I believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden Administration,\" McConnell said. By the time the trial comes to pass, McConnell will be in the minority, with Democrats set to take the majority in the days ahead.\n The backlash to those who split from Trump was quick to rise, however. Trump's defenders criticized Cheney and some urged her removal from her leadership position. Those arguing against impeachment said it was divisive, political and rushed, but few defended Trump's conduct outright. It's a position that will likely be echoed by Senate Republicans opposed to impeachment in the days ahead, aides say.\n \"I believe impeaching the President in such a short timeframe would be a mistake,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. \"No investigations have been completed. No hearings have been held,\" he added, but also said that Trump bore responsibility for the rioters.\n But while 196 Republicans joined McCarthy in opposing impeachment, several told CNN their own outrage wasn't lacking. Another element had come into play. Threats to offices, members and staff had increased in the days leading up to the vote.\n \"It may not have changed any votes, but it's hard not to weigh the potential to your family when you see some of this stuff,\" one Republican who opposed impeachment told CNN.\n Cicilline and Lieu were not on the floor when the House abruptly went into recess as hundreds of violent protesters surrounded the chamber due to to social distancing rules that limited how many lawmakers were present.\n But they kept in touch with those members who fled the chamber just steps away from the mob trying to break through the doors of the speaker's lobby onto the House floor.\n One of the members they were in touch with was Raskin, a constitutional law professor who was a leader for Democrats in the House debate to certify the Electoral College votes that the insurrectionists were trying to stop. Raskin -- who had buried his 25-year-old son the day before -- had brought family to the House to watch the debate Wednesday, who were evacuated along with the lawmakers and reporters in the chamber.\n The lawmakers continued working on the draft and consulting with Raskin as he returned to the chamber more than six hours after evacuating to finish the Electoral College debate. They looped in aides on the House Judiciary Committee, which handled the first impeachment resolution, and had buy-in from House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York.\n The impeachment resolution included both Trump's false rhetoric about the election as well as Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state where he pushed him to \"find\" votes that would make Trump the winner.\n \"I think there were some people who initially thought, 'Should we do this?\" Cicilline said. \"But I think as events became clearer and people got over the horror of the moment and reflected on it, the caucus really quickly decided we have got to do something. We can't simply allow someone who led an insurrection against the US government to disrupt the Electoral College and subvert the will of the American people.\"\n There was a similar effort afoot in another part of the Capitol, as Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota put together her own impeachment resolution while in lockdown. The effort underscored the visceral reaction to the Capitol siege throughout the caucus, though Omar's draft wasn't the one the House ultimately moved forward with as the Judiciary Committee was already focused on the resolution from Lieu, Cicilline and Raskin.\n By the time the House held its first vote last Wednesday on an objection to Arizona's votes, Cicilline was ready to show a draft to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. The lawmakers released a public draft the next day -- with a single article of \"abuse of power\" for Trump's role in the riots -- and by Friday, the article had been tweaked to charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n Unlike the 2019 impeachment push, there was almost no deviation within the House Democratic caucus on the need to impeach Trump. While there were some concerns raised about the precedent being set and the challenge posed to Biden's agenda, once Pence made clear he wouldn't try to remove Trump himself, Democrats said they were left with no choice.\n \"I've never seen our caucus so unified. I never saw It until this event,\" said one Democratic member. \"The individual needs drained out.\"\n Democrats set in motion a cumbersome process to get to the impeachment vote. First they would vote on a resolution from Raskin urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, before voting on impeachment. But that resolution became all but symbolic, after Pence released a letter saying that he would not do so. One House Democrat called it a \"total waste of time.\"\n Still, Democrats became more resolute about the need to impeach Trump as details continued to emerge about the events of January 6. The concerns, fears and determination to push forward spilled out on a nearly three-hour private caucus conference call just days before the vote. While leaders would need to move to address security concerns, there was nothing they needed to do to ensure the caucus stuck together on the vote itself.\n \"As the hours progressed and more and more people were speaking within the text threads and talking to one another by phone and every other means available, there seemed to be really broad agreement,\" said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.\n \"The momentum,\" she said, \"was powerful.\"\n CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Rep. Ted Lieu grabbed a crowbar before leaving his office. He grabbed a ProBar energy bar.",

        "title": "Some national veterans organizations vow to remove members charged in the Capitol riots",
        "body_text": "Some national veterans organizations have vowed to remove members who were charged in the Capitol riots, taking a stand against the violent attack last week.\n Current and former US military members participated in the insurrection, according to news reports and court records.\n A handful of veterans organizations told CNN they are actively checking their membership lists for veterans who have come up in the news. Organizations like the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and AMVETS said they also plan to revoke memberships of those found guilty of illegal acts or violence.\n \"We believe that our members have a very sacred right to protest,\" Dan Clare, a spokesman for DAV, told CNN. \"They fought and sacrificed to protect that freedom, but when protesters cross the line and commit illegal acts, especially in the nation's capitol, we found it to be abhorrent.\"\n The DAV has more than 1 million members and is a bipartisan organization. While the organization supports its members right to protest, it was \"disgusted that vets were involved in any way in acts of violence,\" Clare said.\n DAV National Commander Stephen \"Butch\" Whitehead said in a statement that the organization is \"saddened that any veteran would desecrate\" the nation's capitol.\n The organization \"will take immediate action to initiate the removal of any DAV member found guilty of committing illegal acts against our nation,\" Whitehead said.\n As the DAV has heard of media reports, it has checked its database, Clare said. It has not found anyone that was a member, he said.\n AMVETS, which has 250,000 members, said it was \"shocked, saddened and outraged\" by the riots at the Capitol.\n The organization's constitution includes an oath taken by members to preserve the democracy and the freedom of the country, AMVETS wrote in a statement to CNN.\n \"This mob intentionally used violence to interrupt and attempt to stop a function mandated by the U.S. Constitution,\" the statement read. \"They killed a law enforcement officer (who was a veteran), injured many more, desecrated the halls of Congress and threatened to derail democracy.\"\n United States Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick died after sustaining injuries while on duty, Capitol Police said.\n Sicknick was a staff sergeant for the New Jersey National Guard, according to a statement from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office. He served as a fire team member and a leader of the 108th Security Force Squadron, 108th Wing, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Murphy's statement said.\n AMVETS said if any of its members participated in the violence, they would be expelled from the organization by their local post. The organization said it had not seen any evidence of any of its members being involved.\n The American Legion, the country's largest veterans service organization, condemned the violence.\n \"An attack on the Capitol is an attack on all of us,\" American Legion National Commander James W. \"Bill\" Oxford said in a statement. \"Regardless of whether the violence is inflicted by right-leaning groups, left-leaning groups or unaffiliated civilians, it is never acceptable. This is not how we do things in America.\"\n John Raughter, a spokesman for American Legion, said the organization is leaving disciplinary actions up to its posts if members violated its principles.\n \"We trust the posts to determine whether or not one of its members have violated our Preamble and principles,\" Raughter wrote in an email to CNN. \"It would be unfortunate to stereotype the overwhelming majority of America's veterans due to the actions of a fringe few.\n Thus far, the organization said it has not heard of any of its nearly 2 million members being part of the violence, he said.\n The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW), which has more than 1.5 million members, told CNN that at this time, it does \"not know if any VFW members participated in last week's attack on our nation's Capitol.\"\n \"We have policies and procedures in place to take organizational action against members who engage in conduct unbecoming to the organization,\" VFW spokesman Terrence L. Hayes told CNN in an email.\n CNN reached out to the Vietnam Veterans of America and the Wounded Warrior Project for comment but has not heard back.\n Both organizations condemned the attacks in statements posted online.\n Three veterans face charges in connection with the events at the Capitol, CNN reported as of Wednesday. To date, the veterans organizations CNN spoke with said those facing charges are not on their membership lists.\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Marshall Cohen, Eric Levenson, Amir Vera and Mallika Kallingal contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Top scientists warn of 'ghastly future' for planet as leaders underestimate ecological threats ",
        "body_text": "The world is on track for a \"ghastly future,\" an international group of scientists has warned, with accelerating climate change and biodiversity loss threatening the survival of all of the planet's species unless world leaders face up to the challenge and act urgently.\n As part of a bleak \"prognosis,\" a team of 17 leading scientists on Wednesday cautioned that the future of the planet is \"more dire and dangerous than is generally understood,\" and say they have conducted the assessment to clarify the seriousness of the situation the world faces.\n Citing some 150 studies describing the world's environmental changes, the experts warn that world leaders need a \"cold shower\" wake-up call when it comes to the state of the planet, saying environmental conditions are \"far more dangerous than currently believed\" by civilians and scientists alike.\n Daniel Blumstein, professor at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles and one of the authors of the article, told CNN it was no exaggeration to talk about a potential risk to our civilization.\n \"Maybe people certainly recognize it, but they don't understand the urgency, or maybe they recognize it, but they don't want to take the individual sacrifice,\" he said.\n The time delays between ecological deterioration and its socioeconomic impacts mean people do not grasp the seriousness and timeliness of the problem, the report's authors said.\n \"The mainstream is having difficulty grasping the magnitude of this loss, despite the steady erosion of the fabric of human civilization,\" lead author professor Corey Bradshaw, of Flinders University in Australia, said in a statement. \"In fact, the scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms is so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts.\"\n Time and again, scientists, experts and environmentalists have warned that the Earth has reached a crucial tipping point -- recent research from the World Wide Fund for Nature found the world's wildlife populations have fallen by an average of 68% in just over four decades, with human consumption behind the devastating decline.\n We are in a sixth mass extinction, and humans are in the driving seat, having already wiped out hundreds of species and pushed many more to the brink of extinction through wildlife trade, pollution, habitat loss and the use of toxic substances.\n In 2010, leaders from 196 countries gathered in Japan and agreed on a list of biodiversity targets designed to save the Earth -- but in September, 10 years later, a UN panel concluded that the world had collectively failed to fully achieve a single target.\n UN experts have been clear: If we maintain our trajectory in the accelerating climate crisis, biodiversity will continue to deteriorate -- with devastating outcomes for the planet's animals, plants and people.\n But the international experts warn that no leader or political system is prepared for the disasters associated with biodiversity loss, or capable of addressing the crisis.\n \"We've said for years 'we need to do this, that and the other thing,' we know what the problems are, we just choose not to make the changes,\" Blumstein said.\n Eliminating fossil fuels, reining in corporate lobbying that influences policymaking and empowering women with access to education and reproductive control are among the steps necessary, he added.\n \"Stopping biodiversity loss is nowhere close to the top of any country's priorities, trailing far behind other concerns such as employment, healthcare, economic growth, or currency stability,\" professor Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, one of the study's authors, said.\n \"While it is positive news that President-elect Biden intends to reengage the US in (the) Paris Climate accord within his first 100 days of office, it is a minuscule gesture given the scale of the challenge,\" he added.\n Ehrlich is the author of \"The Population Bomb,\" a controversial 1968 text that warned of overpopulation, predicting millions of people would starve to death.\n He has since said that while many details and timings of events were wrong, the book was correct overall, telling the Guardian in 2018: \"Population growth, along with over-consumption per capita, is driving civilisation over the edge: billions of people are now hungry or micronutrient malnourished, and climate disruption is killing people.\"\n Blumstein said he hoped the coronavirus pandemic could serve as a warning. \"Covid, with all of the disruption that it has caused, is actually practice for the future,\" he said. \"This could actually help us move toward unifying and working together. Scientists, remarkably, have worked together. it's the lack of effective world governance or even cooperation in many ways, when we see things breaking down.\"\n In the report, published in the journal Frontiers in Conservation Science, the authors wrote: \"Our goal is not to present a fatalist perspective, because there are many examples of successful interventions to prevent extinctions, restore ecosystems, and encourage more sustainable economic activity at both local and regional scales.\n \"Instead, we contend that only a realistic appreciation of the colossal challenges facing the international community might allow it to chart a less-ravaged future,\" the team added.\n Still, they wrote, fundamental changes to global capitalism, education and equality are required to address the problem.",

        "title": "Here's why experts and lawmakers say you can't compare Black Lives Matter protesters to the US Capitol mob",
        "body_text": "Hours before President Donald Trump was impeached for his role in inciting last week's deadly attack, several lawmakers described the rioters as White supremacists.\n \"Let us be clear, this was a domestic terror attack perpetrated by riotist mobs of White supremacists, armed equipped and many skilled in police and military tactics who came to overturn an election in which their candidate Trump lost,\" Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said in the group's hearing.\n During the impeachment debate Wednesday to excoriate Trump, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, who was a veteran BLM activist before becoming a legislator, called the President \"White supremacist in chief.\"\n \"Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in support of the article of impeachment against Donald J Trump. If we fail to remove a White supremacist President who incited a white supremacist insurrection, it's communities like Missouri's First District that suffer the most,\" Bush said during her speech.\n Rioters stormed the US Capitol building last week, unleashing a wave of comparisons to last year's Black Lives Matter protests. The difference in police response was striking and there's more that sets them apart.\n People marched by the thousands in both after believing that a wrong had been done to them. The calls for racial justice across America over the summer were backed by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and the pain of following generations of anti-Blackness sentiment. Unlike BLM protests, the insurrection at the Capitol was triggered by lies and deeply rooted racist stereotypes, experts say.\n Convinced that the presidential election was stolen, rioters touted themselves as \"patriots\" and repeatedly chanted \"USA, USA\" while vandalizing and destroying the building at the heart of America's democracy. Trump, who has embraced dog whistle tactics such as calling Mexicans \"rapists\" and called the words Black Lives Matter a \"symbol of hate,\" incited them.\n \"Once something like that feels true, you can't dissuade them with the facts,\" said Ian Haney L\u00f3pez, the author of \"Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class.\"\n Here's a look what's driven the Black Lives Matter movement for nearly a decade and why Trump supporters broke into the Capitol:\n After weeks of hearing false claims that the presidential election was rigged, Trump supporters flocked to Washington to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that would confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win.\n Hours before the insurrection, Trump addressed a crowd of supporters gathered on the Ellipse near the White House, fanning false allegations of voter fraud and telling them to \"fight like hell.\"\n \"I absolutely stand 100% behind what happened here today,\" Todd Possett, who was part of last week's mob, told CNN's Donie Sullivan.  \"It's terrible how this election was stolen. I had to come here and do my patriotic duty.\"\n Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said Wednesday the mob was motivated by racial resentment and \"a conspiracy theory rooted in the effort to invalidate Black folks.\"\n \"The mob was met with empathy and deference from some in law enforcement and some in a military establishment that harbors White supremacists, let's say it, amongst its own ranks,\" Morial testified at Congressional Black Caucus hearing in response to the riots.\n After the election, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey, were among the cities the Trump campaign had falsely accused of voter fraud and corruption. These cities are either majority Black or have large Black populations.\n During a press conference in November, Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said, \"You knew if you lived in Philadelphia. Unless you're stunod -- that's an Italian expression for stupid -- unless you're stupid, you knew that a lot of people were coming over from Camden to vote,\" he said. \"They do every year. Happens all the time in Philly. ... And it's allowed to happen because it's a Democrat (sic), corrupt city, and has been for years. Many, many years. And they carried it out in places where they could get away from it.\"\n Rioters believed a narrative deeply rooted in racist stereotypes that has been consistent throughout Trump's administration and used by other politicians in the past 50 years, according to Haney L\u00f3pez, who is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n \"Mainly what they're trying to trigger is a sense that dangerous persons of color are coming to take over the country,\" Haney L\u00f3pez said.\n \"They believe it because in their hearts it feels true that this multi-racial coalition is taking power,\" he added. \"It's just wrong to them that Black people in coalition with Latinos and Asian Americans and Whites should take power.\"\n Political leaders have long used dog-whistle phrases to exploit White America's racial fears. Some of those terms are \"illegal alien,\" \"thug,\" and \"Welfare Queen,\" which was used by President Ronald Reagan when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976 to attack welfare chiselers during campaign speeches.\n In his first public remarks to reporters since the insurrection, Trump insisted his speech inciting the riot was \"totally appropriate.\"\n He claimed the \"real problem\" is what other politicians said about protests over the summer in Seattle and Portland, Oregon.\n The insurrection at the Capitol was also a stunning show of force for the fringe movements with several symbols of white supremacist and extremist groups on display.\n In 2013, the unexpected verdict in the murder trial in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black teen who had been walking in his father's Florida neighborhood, led to the birth of Black Lives Matter -- one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people.\n What started as a hashtag became a website, an organization and later grew into more than a dozen local chapters across the US and Canada. They were driven by the series of deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and vigilantes.\n According to the BLM website, its mission is \"to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.\"\n But BLM's goal isn't just about protesting police brutality. At the local level, the organization advocates for mutual aid, defunding police and access to housing and health care for Black and brown workers.\n \"We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,\" says Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network. \"Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live.\"\n Studies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black neighborhoods behind. Black communities don't have the same access as Whites to health care, quality education, good jobs and other resources.\n \"You know, for many of us in this country, we know what it is to be treated differently. And we also know what it is to be told that all of the things we experience every single day don't exist or that if they do exist that it's our fault (and) that we somehow created the conditions of inequality,\" said Alicia Garza, who co-founded the Black Lives Matter Global Network with Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi.\n In the wake of Floyd's killing last summer, large crowds took to the streets in multiple cities in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. The protests were bigger and more sustained. The BLM signs that popped up in many people's yards were just the first signs of a nationwide racial reckoning.\n People marched against police violence, systemic racism, to be seen and heard.\n \"If you don't speak up and don't say anything, you're just like the officers that stood by and watched,\" Randy Fikki, a protester in Kansas City, told CNN affiliate WDAF-TV, referring to the officers involved in Floyd's death.\n Critics have responded to the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" by coining their own slogans, such as \"All Lives Matter,\" which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and \"Blue Lives Matter,\" referring to the lives of police.\n Last week, Trump supporters were criticized on social media after using another phrase that has been known as a racial justice call for years.\n They used the hashtag #SayHerName when referring to Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old White woman who was fatally shot as the mob tried to force its way toward the House floor.\n They appeared to be oblivious to the #SayHerName campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the Black women and girls who fall victim to police brutality -- and who are often overlooked and forgotten.\n The campaign, launched in 2014 by the African American Policy Forum and Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies, has worked to highlight the cases of dozens of Black women, including Atatiana Jefferson and Michelle Cusseaux, both killed by police in their homes.",

        "title": "Circle K's owner offers $20 billion for France's biggest retailer",
        "body_text": "Convenience store operators are having a moment.\n Canada's Couche-Tard (ANCTF), the owner of Circle K, said in a statement on Wednesday that it's offering \u20ac20 ($24.35) a share to acquire France's biggest supermarket chain, Carrefour. The offer, which Couche-Tard expects to be mostly in cash, values Carrefour at \u20ac16.2 billion ($19.7 billion) and represents a 29% premium to its closing price on Tuesday.\n It's the latest play by a convenience store operator for a large supermarket group after Walmart (WMT) offloaded Asda in October to the Issa brothers, who own gas stations and convenience stores in Europe and the United Kingdom.\n Couche-Tard, which first confirmed the talks with Carrefour on Tuesday, said there was \"no certainty\" that the discussions would result in an agreement. Carrefour (CRERF) said in a statement on Wednesday that \"discussions are very preliminary.\" Shares in the French company surged 15% in Paris to nearly \u20ac18 ($21.92).\n The potential deal is already running into resistance from the French government, however, causing the stock to lose 6% in early trade on Thursday. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told France 5 television late on Wednesday that he opposed a takeover of the country's largest private employer.\n \"What is at stake is the food sovereignty of the French people. So from this point of view, the idea that Carrefour could be bought by a foreign competitor, on the face of it I am not in favor of this operation,\" he said, adding that the government has the power to block the transaction.\n Couche-Tard is the largest convenience store operator in Canada, according to its website. It employs 109,000 people in North America, where it has more than 9,000 convenience stores, most of which are attached to fuel stations.\n The deal would dramatically expand Couche-Tard's presence in Europe, where it already has 2,700 outlets, including fuel stations, in countries such as Poland, Russia and Sweden. The two groups are jointly worth more than $50 billion.\n Carrefour is France's largest retailer and the third largest grocery chain in Europe by market share, trailing only Aldi and the owner of Lidl, according to Euromonitor. It has more than 10,000 convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets across Europe. It also has a presence in Asia and South America.\n The group performed well during the pandemic, posting its best sales performance in at least two decades in the third quarter as it grew e-commerce sales and opened more convenience stores.\n Although the smaller format still accounts for less than 10% of sales, it is \"very successful\" with Carrefour customers, according to the company's website, which said it wants to open an additional 3,000 of these stores by 2022 from around 7,000 currently.\n Stay-at-home orders during the pandemic may have something to do with the growing popularity of convenience stores, which give shoppers easy access to essentials.\n Analysts have raised questions over the merits of a potential tie-up between Couche-Tard and Carrefour. Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital, said that the rationale would need to be explained for \"a deal of this magnitude.\" Carrefour has a market value of about \u20ac14.4 billion ($17.5 billion).\n \"Forecourts and convenience stores are exceptionally highly valued at the minute and are using their balance sheets to diversify,\" Black added.\n While size matters in food retail, the differences in geography and format between the two groups would mean limited synergies from a potential merger, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Xavier Le Men\u00e9 and Virginia Montorsi.\n \"We are unsure about the value creation potential here, except if Couche-Tard was to offer a significant premium to Carrefour shareholders,\" they wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Carrefour's shareholders include Groupe Arnault, the investment vehicle of LVMH (LVMHF) chairman Bernard Arnault, which holds a 5.1% stake in the company.\n With a long track record of acquisitions, Couche-Tard lost out on a bid last year to acquire the Speedway chain of gas stations from Marathon Petroleum (MPC), said Black. Marathon Petroleum sold Speedway to Japan's Seven & i Holdings (SVNDF), which owns 7-Eleven, for $21 billion in August.\n \u2014 Sandrine Amiel contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Biden aides told congressional allies to expect Covid relief package with roughly $2 trillion price tag",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden is expected to unveil a major Covid-19 relief package on Thursday and his advisers have recently told allies in Congress to expect a price tag in the ballpark of $2 trillion, according to two people briefed on the deliberations.\n The Biden team is taking a \"shoot for the moon\" approach with the package, one lawmaker in close contact with them told CNN, though they added that the price tag could still change. The proposal will include sizable direct payments to American families, significant state and local funding -- including for coronavirus vaccine distribution and other emergency spending measures -- to help those struggling during the pandemic.\n Biden is set to announce the details of his plan in Wilmington, Delaware, Thursday evening.\n Democrats hold only the slimmest of majorities in the House and the Senate, and Republicans have recently resisted efforts to pass Covid-19 relief on a multi-trillion dollar scale. But Biden's party believes it may have only a brief window to pass sweeping relief legislation and the President-elect has faced significant pressure from some Democrats to go big.\n Brian Deese, Biden's pick to lead the National Economic Council, said Wednesday at a conference that the package will include $2,000 stimulus checks, and address other relief measures like unemployment insurance.\n Biden's early focus on a sweeping relief package reflects the political reality that his first year in office will be defined by his ability to combat the virus and stave off an economic collapse.\n And with just days until he's set to take office, the pandemic is now killing faster than at any point in 2020. The US reported its highest number of Covid-19 deaths in one day Tuesday: 4,327, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n As a result, Biden is pushing to keep the upcoming Senate impeachment trial from consuming his agenda and overshadowing the early days of his administration. He's still awaiting word on whether the Senate will be able to pursue impeachment alongside Cabinet confirmation hearings and Covid-19 legislation.\n Aides say Biden and his team are working behind the scenes with Senate Democrats -- and House impeachment managers -- to keep the impeachment trial as swift as possible, although it remains an open question how successful that might be.\n In a statement Wednesday evening, Biden made clear that while the House's vote \"to impeach and hold the president accountable\" was \"a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience,\" he doesn't want the Senate trial to impede his agenda.\n \"This nation also remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\" Biden continued. \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.\n CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Dan Merica, Gregory Krieg and Caroline Kelly contributed to this report.",

It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.\nWe can all agree that health care workers on the front lines of the Covid-19 pandemic deserve all the good things in life.\n One North Carolina nurse now has the pocket change to treat herself to at least some of them.\n Terri Watkins works in the Covid unit at a long term facility in Durham. And she just won a $1 million jackpot, the North Carolina Education Lottery said this week.\n \"Just seeing some of the things that I've had to see, I am very thankful,\" she told the lottery. \"I had been praying for something to help me with this situation. It really is a great thing. I'm very blessed.\"\n It's a rough time to be a Covid unit nurse as the pandemic rages uncontrollably. Many are working grueling hours, and isolating themselves away from their families.\n So, when the lottery called her with the news, she had a hard time believing her good fortune.\n \"You're telling a story, I don't believe you,\" Watkins said in a recording of the call the lottery released.\n Then, when the reality sank in, Watkins exclaimed,  \"Oh my God! Oh my God!\"\n \"It's still something that I really don't believe, I'm still in some shock here,\" she later said.\n Given the option to take the $1 million prize as 20 annual payments of $50,000 or a lump sum of $600,000, Watkins chose the latter. She will take home $424,500 after required state and federal tax withholdings.\n Watkins said she would love a new home -- but she'll take it \"slow and easy\" to figure out what to do with the money.\n \"I've just got to take time and put it in the right place,\" she said.",

        "title": "North Korea's Kim Yo Jong calls South Korean government a 'truly weird group' as key political meeting ends",
        "body_text": "Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and one of the country's most important political figures, has criticized South Korea's \"idiot\" authorities after they called attention to an apparent military parade held in the capital Pyongyang over the weekend.\n \"We are only holding a military parade in the capital city, not military exercises targeting anybody nor launch of anything. Why do they take trouble craning their neck to follow what's happening in the north,\" Kim said in a statement published by North Korea's state-run news agency, KCNA.\n \"The southerners are a truly weird group (and) hard to understand.\"\n Kim's comments were published as an important week-long North Korean political event, the Eighth Workers' Party Congress, came to a close. The Congress is held for North Korea's rulers to gather and reflect on successes and failures in years past and set an agenda for the near future. They're typically held every five years or so, but Kim's father and predecessor -- Kim Jong Il -- stopped holding them after 1980. Kim Jong Un revived the gatherings in 2016.\n Experts had speculated that North Korea might mark the end of the Congress with a military parade, but as of Wednesday afternoon on the Korean Peninsula, North Korean state media had not released any images or video of such an event.\n South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Monday, however, that it had detected signs of a military parade taking place in North Korea on Sunday night. North Korea will often release slickly produced propaganda videos of these events rather than airing them live.\n Kim Yo Jong appeared to confirm that a parade had taken place while mocking the South for wasting its time, even though these parades offer valuable clues about the notoriously secretive country's weapons systems. Kim also argued that Seoul's spying was indicative of its \"hostile approach toward the fellow countrymen in the north.\"\n \"Do they really have nothing else to do but let their military body make 'precision tracking' of the celebrations in the north?\" she said.\n Kim was believed to be one of her brother's most powerful and trusted confidants, but experts are unsure what to make of her status following the Party Congress, which saw her removed as an alternate from North Korea's powerful politburo and demoted from \"first vice department director\" to \"vice department director.\"\n Kim was photographed attending Congress meetings, meaning it's unlikely she has been purged. North Korean state media aired peculiar footage with her wearing what appeared to be heels and a skirt in the frigid weather. However, she was seen walking off to the side -- not in a row alongside other officials and her brother, as she's often seen doing.\n All of this points to the possibility that Kim's title change will have little impact on what she does day-to-day.\n Cheong Seong-chang, a fellow at the Wilson Center's Asia Program and senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said that while Kim was effectively demoted, her statement shows that \"she is still handling and controlling issues regarding South Korea.\"\n Thae Yong Ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected and then became a lawmaker in the South, said that he does not take much stock in the mystery surrounding Kim Yo Jong's official role.\n The main focus of the Party Congress, which began last week, was improving North Korea's economy.\n North Korea's decision to completely close its borders to prevent Covid-19, sanctions and a series of natural disasters last year severely impacted the economy and the livelihood of average North Koreans, something Kim Jong Un committed to improving since his first days as North Korea's leader.\n However, Kim admitted in August that the five-year plan North Korea put in place in 2016 to improve the economy had failed. Two months later he tearfully thanked North Koreans for how they \"bravely overcame severe hardships and trials\" in 2020.\n \"This was a Congress focused on the failure of the last five years of economic development, and how to learn from that and get it right in the next five years,\" said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Relations.\n However, North Korea did not make public any specific plans on how the country will improve its economy in the medium term. The speeches and statements published include typical refrains on socialism and self-reliance, but nothing that would ameliorate the structural issues of the country's extremely inefficient command economy.\n Experts who study North Korea's economy were concerned that Kim may have hinted at a crackdown on the limited marketization inside the country, which has been key for growth.\n Ramon Pacheco Pardo, the KF-VUB Korea Chair Holder at the Institute for European Studies, said it makes sense for North Korea to rein in free trade in order to \"allow for greater control of the population,\" but cautioned that the regime \"cannot really roll back over 20 years of marketization of the economy.\"\n Kim Jong Un's economic agenda may have appeared woefully short on specifics, but his plans for upgrading and improving North Korea's conventional and nuclear weapons were anything but.\n The North Korean leader announced midway through the Congress that Pyongyang was developing several new systems, including a nuclear-powered submarine, tactical nuclear weapons and advanced reentry vehicles designed to penetrate or trick missile defense systems.\n While these projects are at various stages of development, experts are particularly concerned about new reentry vehicles, advanced warheads and tactical nuclear weapons, which are less destructive and used at a shorter range so they can be used in battle, unlike the more powerful so-called \"strategic\" nuclear weapons, which are often employed to deter enemies.\n Pyongyang would likely need to resume weapons testing in order to field new warheads or low-yield nuclear weapons, and such tests would immediately draw the ire of the international community.\n Advanced reentry vehicles, which deliver nuclear bombs to their targets, would degrade the efficacy of US missile defense systems. The low-yield nuclear bombs worry researchers because they're more palatable to use as a \"first strike\" option.\n \"Those are the capabilities that are more likely to be used in a limited conflict for coercive purposes, to cover offensive objectives,\" said Adam Mount, a senior fellow and the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n It's now up to the incoming Biden administration in the United States to prevent North Korea from developing and fielding these weapons, which Pyongyang is prohibited from doing by United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n However, prospects for renewed negotiations appear dim at the moment.\n Despite Kim's three in-person meetings with US President Donald Trump, he said he still views the US as North Korea's biggest enemy. North Koreans, Kim said, must \"do everything we can to strengthen our nuclear war deterrent and develop the strongest military capability,\" in order to stand strong in the face of Washington's so-called \"hostile policy.\"\n Mount and other experts believe that though the US should retain its ultimate goal of ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons, Washington needs to focus on more realistic achievements in the short term.\n \"It's abundantly clear that North Korea will be a nuclear nation, a nuclear armed state for the foreseeable future,\" Mount said. \"The bigger problems are these new systems that could pose a major stability risk.\"",

        "title": "Why House Republicans going through magnetometers has zero to do with the Constitution",
        "body_text": "On Tuesday, magnetometers were installed just off the House floor as a safety measure in the wake of the riot that led to the overrunning of the US Capitol last Wednesday. Members of Congress were required to go through them.\n Cue outrage.\n While there were some Democratic members who expressed frustration at the mags and the lines they cause, it was Republican House lawmakers who resisted the move most fervently.\n \"It is a shame that Nancy Pelosi is trying to disarm Members of Congress in the very place that needed more protection on January 6,\" said freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), who had boasted that she planned to carry her gun in Congress. (The District has strict gun laws and Washington's police chief has warned the congresswoman that she is subject to the same laws as everyone else in the nation's capital.)\n \"This is crap right here,\" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs (R). \"You can put that down.\"\n \"You can't stop me; I'm on my way to a vote,\" Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert told the Capitol Police as he walked around the magnetometers.\n But I think my favorite Republican response came from Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin, who said of the magnetometers: \"It's my constitutional right. They can't stop me\"\n So, let me get this right. [Takes out pocket Constitution]. Mullin doesn't need to go through magnetometers -- put in place following the first significant breach of the US Capitol since the war of 1812 -- because of the Constitution? Where, exactly, in the Constitution does it say that you don't have to wait in line if you are a member of Congress? Is that in the Snyder cut?\n HINT: It's not.\n (Sidebar: I would love for there to be something unconstitutional about being forced to wait in lines. I once lost three years of my life in a line for the \"Toy Story\" roller coaster at Disney World.)\n The reactions by Mullin and his fellow Republicans (as well as any and all Democrats who resisted the mags) speaks to the massive level of entitlement that exists in the halls of Congress.\n In my earliest days as a reporter, I would occasionally head to Capitol Hill to find a member for a quote I needed for a piece I was working on. I was struck every single time by the way that members carried themselves -- and how their staff treated them. It was as though there were 535 kings and queens moving through the Capitol, with courtiers (staff and lobbyists) falling all over themselves to gain the attention of the member or maybe even a kind word.\n Unless you spend time in the Capitol -- and given last week it might be a very long time until the public gets that chance again -- you would miss the culture of the Congress. And it might surprise you that members had such a big problem with waiting in line to go through a magnetometer (like every single one of us does before we get on a plane).\n Those who are familiar with the culture of entitlement, however, would not be surprised in the least. If there is an entire culture built around kowtowing to you and telling you how great you are, then you think you are above the rules for normal people. And cite things like your constitutional rights to not have to wait in line.\n One thing all these carping members would do well to remember is this: It's called the People's House for a reason.",

        "title": "Las Vegas, the hardest-hit metro economy in America, just suffered another blow",
        "body_text": "In the run-up to the Consumer Electronics Show last year, Gina Muoio was pulling 60-to-80-hour weeks at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas.\n Muoio worked as an event coordinator for a third-party electrical vendor and carefully choreographed the power needs for exhibitors, presenters and attendees at trade shows held in the massive hall.\n \"There are very long days, and you're on your feet the entire time,\" said Muoio, 39. \"Sometimes you don't even have time to eat.\"\n During a typical January, the presence of CES in and around Las Vegas is unmistakable. Hotel prices skyrocket, restaurants and clubs are packed, and workers like Muoio log extra hours to ensure everything goes on without a hitch for the major money-making show and related events. Last year, the 170,000 CES attendees were estimated to have generated $169 million in direct spending and a broader economic impact of $291.2 million, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\n During this atypical January, however, that flurry of activity, that money and that work is gone. CES 2021 is an all-digital affair.\n The move, meant to prioritize health and safety during the Covid-19 pandemic, serves as another blow to a city already sent reeling by the current health and economic crises.\n The job market in Las Vegas has been the hardest-hit among large US metro areas during the pandemic. The region is heavily reliant upon travel, discretionary spending, business conferences and large gatherings, but has seen those key spigots turned off.\n In April 2020, shutdowns resulted in a 34% unemployment rate in Las Vegas. Although it's improved since then, Las Vegas still has the highest unemployment rate among large metro areas, according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n As of November 2020, Las Vegas metro area's unemployment rate was 11.5%, and 128,000 people \u2014 including Muoio \u2014 remained out of work.\n After being furloughed in March, Muoio was permanently laid off in August.\n Since then, she says she's applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 including stay-at-home event coordinating roles and positions in customer service or marketing \u2014 but has yet to land anything permanent.\n Living without health insurance and awaiting a state unemployment benefit application that's been pending since August, Muoio said she's fortunate she had some money saved for an eventual down-payment on a house.\n \"That money is slowly, slowly dripping down,\" she said. \"I'm running out.\"\n Brandon Geyer is facing a similar situation. He's been out of work since March.\n \"Come March, when this first happened, I was under the impression we were going to be shut down for a couple of weeks, no big deal,\" he said. \"Another week goes by, and another week goes by, and all of a sudden, I haven't gone back to work since March.\"\n For nearly 24 years, Geyer, 49, had tended bar at the Main Street Station, a downtown Las Vegas casino, brewery and hotel that remains temporarily shuttered due to the pandemic. And while the crowds got bigger whenever CES came to town, Main Street Station attracted a loyal clientele, many of whom Geyer got to know well through the years.\n Geyer said he's grateful to be receiving unemployment benefits, that his wife still has her job, and that they had some money in savings to support themselves and their two kids. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 has also helped procure weekly food assistance and groceries.\n But the loss of full and steady income is taking its toll, Geyer said. He's hopeful that his union's push for Clark County, Nevada, to adopt a \"Right to Return\" policy will be put in place, requiring employers to offer laid-off workers the right to return to their old jobs when businesses reopen.\n \"We're just wondering when we're going to return to work,\" he said.\n The Boyd Gaming-owned Main Street Station is expected to reopen sometime in 2021, CEO Keith Smith said during the company's most-recent earnings call in October.\n This time last year, optimism was high that 2020 \u2014 and CES 2021 \u2014 would be quite prosperous for Las Vegas, said Steve Hill, the chief executive officer of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\n \"We had set [room tax dollars] records in seven of the previous 10 months,\" he said. \"It looked like that was certainly going to continue.\"\n Hotel and resort construction projects were underway, and, the city not only was scheduled to host the NFL draft in April but also would have the glitzy, $1.94 billion Allegiant Stadium filled with fans to cheer on the recently relocated Raiders NFL team.\n And for January 2021, CES was slated to be the first event held in a nearly $1-billion expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center and serve as the debut for a futuristic \"people-mover\" project from Elon Musk's The Boring Company.\n Instead, the new 1.4 million-square-foot West Hall sits eerily empty, Hill said.\n Hotels that had charged more than $400 per night for rooms during the week of CES 2020 have advertised rates in the $25 to $45 range this year, according to Hotels.com data tracked by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Some hotels including the Mirage and Encore at Wynn have even shuttered rooms midweek because of low demand.\n The expectation from both the visitors authority and CES organizers is for the event to return to Las Vegas in 2022 and beyond. Although it likely will look a bit different when it does return.\n \"The future of events will most likely include a digital component,\" officials for the Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES, said in a statement. \"The events industry has had to innovate throughout this pandemic, shift business models and adapt to our new circumstances.\"\n On Monday night, more than two dozen marquees at properties along the famed Las Vegas Strip were lit with the message: \"We miss you, CES. Can't wait to welcome you back in 2022.\"\n And on Twitter, the CES 2021 account reciprocated the sentiment, tweeting, \"Feeling homesick, but we will see you soon @Vegas.\"\n The US Travel Association, citing data from the research firm Tourism Economics, estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in $500 billion in cumulative losses for the nation's travel economy since March, causing an estimated $64.4 billion hit to federal, state and local tax revenue.\n While leisure travel is expected to fuel the travel and tourism recovery, those trips aren't expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022, Adam Sacks, Tourism Economics president said during a US Travel Association webinar in December. It will likely take until 2024 or later for business and corporate travel to fully return, he said.\n For cities such as Las Vegas to see meaningful economic improvement, people will have to feel comfortable traveling again, being indoors again, and willing to spend money, said John Restrepo, principal of Las Vegas-based RCG Economics.\n And until vaccinations are widespread \"all bets are off,\" Restrepo said.\n Nevada's lack of industry diversification likely will hinder the jobs recovery much like it did after the Great Recession, he said. Following the 2008 downturn, it took nine years for the state to surpass its pre-recession jobs numbers.\n This time around, Restrepo predicts it will take at least three years for the state to achieve the consistent annual rates of growth seen in major economic indicators before the pandemic hit. It will take even longer, he said, to get back to the actual levels of jobs, sales taxes, gaming revenues and conventioneers.\n \"It's going to be a long slog out of this rut here in southern Nevada,\" he said.",

        "title": "Federal government executes the first woman in nearly 70 years",
        "body_text": "Lisa Montgomery, 52, was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, and pronounced dead at 1:31 a.m. Wednesday.\n Montgomery was the first woman to be executed by the federal government since 1953 and was the only woman on death row.\n The Supreme Court denied a last-ditch effort late Tuesday by her defense attorneys who argued that she should have been given a competency hearing to prove her severe mental illness, which would have made her ineligible for the death penalty.\n She was the 11th federal death row inmate to be executed by the Trump administration after a 17-year hiatus in federal executions.\n \"The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,\" her attorney, Kelley Henry, said in a statement. \"Lisa Montgomery's execution was far from justice.\"\n Montgomery's attorneys, family and supporters had pleaded with President Donald Trump to read their clemency petition and make an executive decision to commute her sentence to life without the possibility of parole.\n Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2008 by a Missouri jury for the 2004 murder of a pregnant woman, cutting the fetus out and kidnapping it. The baby survived.\n A federal judge granted Montgomery a stay of execution Tuesday for a competency hearing -- just hours before she was scheduled to be executed.\n \"The Court was right to put a stop to Lisa Montgomery's execution,\" Henry said in a statement. \"As the court found, Mrs. Montgomery 'made a strong showing' of her current incompetence to be executed. Mrs. Montgomery has brain damage and severe mental illness that was exacerbated by the lifetime of sexual torture she suffered at the hands of caretakers.\"\n \"The Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of people like Mrs. Montgomery who, due to their severe mental illness or brain damage, do not understand the basis for their executions. Mrs. Montgomery is mentally deteriorating, and we are seeking an opportunity to prove her incompetence,\" Henry added.\n But the Supreme Court denied the effort and pleas to President Trump were unsuccessful.\n Two more executions are scheduled this week, for Corey Johnson on Thursday and Dustin Higgs on Friday. Both of their executions have been halted by a federal court judge as the men are still recovering from Covid-19. Prosecutors intend to appeal the ruling on Higgs and Johnson, according to court documents.",

        "body_text": "Superintendents from Texas, Florida, Washington, North Carolina and other states are pushing for an organized plan to vaccinate the country's teachers and school staff more quickly, in order to allow schools to open for more in-person learning.\n \"We are all in a race against time,\" said Mike Magee, CEO of Chiefs for Change, an advocacy group for state and local school districts, during a Zoom press conference on Wednesday.\n Magee emphasized the need to release doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to local officials who can work directly with school districts to speed up the vaccination process.\n \"We have a supply problem,\" Magee said. \"The demand is obvious, and given the proper support from federal and state governments, our members are prepared to play a pivotal role in protecting our teachers and children.\"\n Robert Runcie, superintendent of Broward County Public Schools in Florida, talked about his concern regarding the academic and social impact a lack of in-person learning is having on children.\n \"We have far too many students who are struggling and I'm very concerned that we could lose a whole generation of kids if we don't act quickly,\" Runcie said.\n Since Broward County schools reopened for some in-person learning October 9, about 30% of the district's students have opted for face-to-face instruction, according to Runcie.\n But the number of failing grades and absences is skyrocketing.\n During the first marking period of the 2020-21 school year, the number of students in Broward County receiving one or more failing grades is 11%, up from 4% during the first marking period a year ago, officials said. The number of students who have missed 15 or more days of school is currently 8,200, up from 1,700 at this point a year ago.\n \"It is absolutely imperative that we open our schools. We have demonstrated that we can do that safely,\" said Runcie.\n At a smaller district in Washington state, Superintendent Susan Enfield of Highline Public Schools says she doesn't have a good answer for her staff about vaccines because of what she calls a lack of guidance from the state.\n \"We know that making [vaccines] available to our staff will significantly accelerate our ability to bring students back into buildings,\" Enfield said.\n Highline Public Schools has so far only brought back special needs students for in-person learning -- about 150 students out of 17,000 in the district. Enfield says they have a March 1 target date to bring elementary students back for in-person learning.\n School leaders are also dealing with vaccine hesitancy among teachers, but hope that the incoming administration will be able to help calm fears with clear and consistent messaging.\n President-elect Joe Biden has said bringing back K-8 students for in-person school is a top priority for the first 100 days of his administration.\n In Tennessee, just 43% of the workforce in the Clarksville-Montgomery County School System is showing interest in getting vaccinated, according to Director of Schools Millard House.\n Runcie said he'd be happy to roll up his sleeve and set an example for any teachers or staff who have concerns about the vaccine.\n \"I'll go and be the first one along with our teachers, side by side,\" Runcie said.",

The affidavit included three two photos of the man identified as Colt in the chamber.\n Colt was photographed hanging off a balcony and landing on the floor of the Senate chambers, the FBI affidavit said. Colt claimed in a Facebook video that he was the first person to sit in the House Speaker's chair, according to the affidavit, but the FBI said he \"appears to be mistaken as he was also photographed in the seat reserved for the vice president, and not Speaker Pelosi.\"\n The Ada County Sheriff's Office in Boise, Idaho confirmed to CNN on Tuesday night that Colt was in custody on a hold for the US Marshals Service.\n \"In the moment I thought I was doing the right thing,\" Colt said in a text to CNN affiliate KBOI last week.  \"I realize now that my actions were in appropriate and I beg for forgiveness from America and my home state of Idaho.\" Colt and his family have not returned repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n According to the FBI affidavit, there is probable cause that Colt violated a federal law against entering a restricted building without lawful authority, as well as a law against entering the Capitol to disrupt a session of Congress.\n Colt is scheduled to have his first appearance before a judge Wednesday morning via videoconference.\n The FBI has opened more than 170 case files in the six days since the attack, and prosecutors have already charged more than 70 cases.\n CNN's Sonia Moghe,  Ted Barrett, Manu Raju and Peter Nickeas contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Something *very* important for our politics happened on Tuesday",
        "body_text": "While the eyes of the world were focused on the impeachment efforts against President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, Gov. Larry Hogan of neighboring Maryland did something extremely important in beginning the long process of unwinding our current political polarization.\n The Republican governor announced that via executive order he had created an independent commission he will task with redrawing the state's congressional and legislative lines following the decennial reapportionment later this year. Known as the Maryland Citizens Redistricting Commission, the nine-person group will include three Democrats, three Republicans and three independents.\n \"This commission is the first of its kind in the long history of our state,\" Hogan said in making the announcement. \"Unlike the partisan, backdoor manner in which our state's political power brokers have conducted the state's redistricting process, we want to make sure that this time the people of Maryland are actually the ones drawing these lines\u2014not the politicians or the party bosses.\"\n This may seem to you, at first glance, to be a rather minor deal. Only the most ardent political junkies closely follow the re-shuffling and re-drawing of legislative and congressional districts that follow the decennial census. (Guilty, your honor!)\n But simply because it's utterly inside baseball doesn't mean it isn't important. In fact, like many things that the general public either knows nothing about or has a decided lack of interest in, how these lines are drawn and by whom has an outsized impact on the sort of government we have -- and what the motivations of our elected officials are.\n For decades, the line-drawing process has fallen, in most states, to state legislators and governors. What that has meant, in the main, is that when Democrats control the state capitol and, therefore, the line-drawing process, they create districts that are as favorable as possible for their side. Ditto Republicans -- except that GOP gains at the state level, particularly in the 2010 midterm elections, gave them more line-drawing control over more states and, therefore, considerably more power.\n The strategy of both sides has been simple: Pack as many of the opposition party's voters into as few districts in the state as possible while spreading out their own voters to make as many districts winnable for their side as they can. Innovations in redistricting software have made this slicing and dicing of people based on their party registration or past voting history an art form -- allowing the line-drawers to literally go street by street when it comes to crafting new districts.\n This has, of course, had unintended consequences. Maps drawn over the past two decades -- by Democrats and Republicans -- in places like North Carolina, Texas and yes, Maryland -- have come under legal scrutiny for using political considerations as the sole motivator in creating legislative and congressional districts. Maps in which one party overreached have, occasionally, led to unpredictable results in which the party in power loses seats they expected to win because they tried to divide up their own voters among too many districts.\n But these exceptions notwithstanding, the dominant trend produced by partisan politicians drawing the congressional district lines is this: The vast majority of members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, represent what we would call \"safe\" districts -- meaning that their only chance of losing their job would be in a primary, not a general election.\n In 1956, for example, less than 6 in 10 House incumbents won with 60% of the vote or more, according to Vital Statistics on Congress. By 2002, the first election after the 2001 nationwide redistricting, 85% of all House incumbents seeking reelection won with 60% or higher. In 2014 and 2016, that number hovered in the mid-to-high 70s before dipping to just 63% in the tumultuous 2018 midterm election.\n The practical, political effect of this trend is simple: Members of Congress have little reason to demonstrate their ability to work across the partisan aisle and every reason to be as partisan and ideological as possible in hopes of staving off any sort of primary challenge.\n Which leads to what we've seen on display in Washington over these last many years: Constant partisan bickering and brinksmanship over matters great and small; the constant threat of government shutdowns; and a government that can barely function as its founders designed it to do.\n And yes, much of that gridlock -- not all, but much -- can be traced back to a political line-drawing process that rewards reflexive partisanship and punishes those who stray from absolute adherence to their party line.\n Independent or bipartisan commissions to redraw the maps in states -- as Hogan is trying to do in Maryland -- work to reorient the incentive structure for members by creating districts that are far more competitive between the two parties in general elections.\n Take Iowa, where since 1980, nonpartisan staff have drawn the legislative and congressional lines -- and which is widely seen as the model for how redistricting aimed at decelerating partisanship and polarization should be done.\n The state's congressional districts have regularly changed hands between the parties, with Republicans winning two previously-held Democratic seats in the 2020 election. And generally speaking,  three of the four districts in the state -- the exception being the Republican-friendly 4th in western Iowa -- are extremely competitive every two years. Check out the winning percentages for four incoming members of Congress in the state: 62%, 49%, 50% and 51.3%. In the state's 2nd District, the Republican candidate leads the Democrat candidate by six -- SIX! -- votes.\n While bipartisan -- and independent -- line-drawing commissions are on the rise in recent years, the majority of states in the country still rely on politicians to draw lines. And even under Hogan's proposal, the state legislature would retain veto power over any congressional map that the independent committee produces.\n But the step he is taking is still an important one. Until voters understand that the lines that govern who they can vote for are as important than the person who represents them, we are likely to be stuck in this same partisan morass in Washington.",

        "title": "Trump defenders seek Cheney's ouster from House leadership over impeachment vote",
        "body_text": "Several House Republicans are hammering Rep. Liz Cheney, the party's third-ranking House leader, calling for her to step down from her leadership position over her vote to impeach President Donald Trump.\n The criticism comes as congressional Republicans grapple with Trump becoming the first President to ever be impeached twice after his incitement of a violent mob that stormed the US Capitol last week.\n While House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was opposed to impeachment, House GOP leaders did not lobby their members to oppose it, and Cheney told the conference Monday it was a \"vote of conscience.\"\n Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally on Capitol Hill, told reporters he thinks Cheney should be ousted from her leadership position after she said she'd support impeaching the President.\n \"I think she's totally wrong,\" he said. \"I think there should be a conference and have a second vote on that,\" he added.\n Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, who helped sow discord in an attempt to overturn the election, also said Cheney should be removed as conference chair. Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said Tuesday that Cheney should resign from her position.\n While Trump defenders like Gosar, Jordan and Biggs have called on Cheney to resign, there have yet to be similar calls from other members of House Republican leadership for the Wyoming Republican to step down from her leadership post.\n Cheney was not the only GOP member who supported impeachment. In all, 10 Republicans voted to impeach: Reps. Peter Meijer of Michigan, Fred Upton of Michigan, Tom Rice of South Carolina, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, John Katko of New York, Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, Dan Newhouse of Washington, David Valadao of California and Cheney.\n \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" Cheney said in a statement Tuesday explaining her stance. \"Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\"\n She concluded, \"I will vote to impeach the President.\"\n Cheney, who represents Wyoming and is the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney, on Wednesday dismissed pressure for her to resign after coming out in support of impeaching Trump.\n \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Cheney told reporters at the Capitol.\n \"This is a vote of conscience. It's one where there are different views in our conference,\" she added. \"But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis. That's what we need to be focused on. That's where our efforts and attention need to be.\"\n Unlike the other two top leaders in her conference -- McCarthy and House Republican Whip Steve Scalise -- Cheney opposed Trump's efforts to overturn the election, and voted to certify the results last week.\n CNN's Alex Rogers and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "New York's Yankee Stadium is expected to join numerous sports and entertainment venues around the nation being used as mass Covid-19 vaccination sites in a bid to boost lagging vaccine numbers.\n New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday a \"plan is in motion\" to use The House that Ruth Built in the Bronx as a vaccination site. The announcement came one day after the mayor and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen said a 24-hour, vaccine mega site will be set up at Citi Field in Queens later this month.\n The Citi Field site could handle 5,000 to 7,000 people a day in the Delta Lounge, according to de Blasio spokesman Jeff Holmes. It will be the largest site in the city.\n The Delta Lounge will be split in three stations: one for intake, one to administer the vaccine, and a monitoring area where people will wait for about 30 minutes. The city will staff the site with medical professionals from the Health and Hospitals system and redeployed workers from its test and trace team.\n As of Tuesday, New York City had administered 28,599 new Covid-19 vaccine doses, de Blasio said.\n From sports stadium to sprawling fairgrounds, authorities are looking to increase inoculation efforts as the country continues to set single-day records for Covid-19 deaths.\n Just over 10 million people have received their first coronavirus shots and 29.3 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.\n Still, the US is lagging far behind its target of having vaccinated 20 million people by the end of the year, but the latest CDC numbers indicate that close to a million people got vaccinated in a day. The CDC's numbers are not reported in real time and states complain that the data is lagging.\n The Trump Administration's Operation Warp Speed announced changes Tuesday aimed at speeding up the vaccine administration process, including the release of more doses. Additionally, states are now being urged to vaccinate anyone 65 and older, and younger people with chronic conditions that might make them more vulnerable to severe disease.\n Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, will soon be the first mass Covid-19 vaccination site in Orange County, officials said Monday.\n Mass vaccination sites have opened or will soon open in other parts of California, including at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, San Diego's Petco Park, and Sacramento's Cal Expo.\n The home of the Arizona Cardinals NFL team has become a vaccination site for the foreseeable future, according to the state Department of Health Services. State Farm Stadium in Glendale was turned into a 24/7 vaccination site on Monday.\n In Houston, health officials are vaccinating hundreds at a site at Minute Maid Park, home of Major League Baseball's Astros.\n CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, Michael Nedelman, Maggie Fox and Christina Maxouris contributed.",

        "title": "Rep. Bustos: 'All you want in that moment is to live'",
        "body_text": "Cheri Bustos, a Democrat, represents Illinois' 17th District in the House of Representatives. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nBrace yourself. You're about to read a plea from a politician that has nothing to do with politics. I'm not going to throw around legislative terms or talk about parliamentary rule. Here's why:\n When there is nothing separating you from an armed mob except a door and a few brave cops, you are no longer a politician. You are simply a mom, a wife, a daughter and a citizen. Legislation is the furthest thing from your mind; all you want in that moment is to live.\n On January 6, as rioters stormed the US Capitol, heading to the House floor, my goal was to survive. It was that kind of moment. Primal.\n I did what I could to help those near me. And I also listened to people like Rep. Ruben Gallego \u2014 not because we're from the same party, but because he's a Marine Corps veteran who fought in Iraq.\n I quickly realized I was too tall to hide under the seats. I learned in a hurry how to use a gas mask. We evacuated to the safest room we could find and tried to heed the very smart advice that my husband, a sheriff, texted me. He reminded me that the Capitol Hill Police were there to protect us, and that they would do so.\n He was very right about that. I feel sure they saved countless lives. I don't think America yet fully comprehends just how close we came to seeing members of the US House and Senate kidnapped, held hostage or perhaps even murdered. But let me tell you, that was on the minds of every single member of Congress in the Capitol that day, from both parties. That mob had lethal intent.\n All around me were Congressional staffers and colleagues desperately calling loved ones. Some were saying goodbye, just in case. Some were crying. Ashli Babbit, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran who was among the mob, was shot and killed mere feet away from where I had been sitting just minutes before -- right outside the door I walk through each time I deliver a speech on the House floor.\n The next day, it was over... but not really. I still had to get home to Illinois. I walked through Reagan National Airport in Washington without my Congressional pin on. All around me were pockets of the very mob that had just threatened our lives at the Capitol. On the plane, they were vocal, chanting, fueled by hatred and dripping with rage.\n Mid-air, a woman stood up one row in front of me, took her mask off and yelled: \"Patriots! Patriots! When you get home, storm the county GOP Party just like the Communists have stormed the Democratic Party! Keep this going! Don't let it die!\"\n She demanded everyone take off their masks, and her fellow rioters were happy to oblige. They turned their target on a passenger and began berating her, calling her a \"Commie,\" accusing her of \"smothering babies,\" all at the top of their lungs.\n We were not allowed to get off the plane when we landed. The pilot announced that law enforcement would be boarding soon. As soon as I could, I deplaned, went home and hugged my family.\n I have served my congressional district for four terms, flying from Moline, Illinois, to Washington, DC, hundreds of times. Never before has it been so hard to leave my family as it has this week. But the duty I have to the people I represent and to our nation must take precedence. And so, I am returning to the place where just days ago my life was in danger.\n Impeachment is a political act. And we'll have to discuss it in those terms in the next few days. But what happened on January 6 was NOT a political act. It was a crime. Violent. Vicious. Premeditated. Lethal. Everyone who incited it and everyone who committed it are perpetrators. And calls for \"unity\" cannot be simultaneous excuses for this violence.\n To achieve unity, we must also deliver accountability and justice. I am not a prosecutor and cannot try Donald Trump in a court of law. Impeachment is the only means I have available to stop him from inciting further acts of mayhem, bloodshed and insurrection.\n That will guide my vote.\n And once it's been cast, I will board another flight back home to Illinois -- hopeful that our nation will never again be faced with the threat of death-by-mob-rule, hopeful that I can once again wear my Congressional pin in public spaces and hopeful that we are one step closer to making America safe from anti-democratic lawlessness.\n You see, ultimately, it isn't really Donald Trump we're trying to root out here.\n It's the disregard and disrespect for our democracy.\n In my view, to do so is the surest route to making America America again.",

        "title": "Nothing will be allowed to stop Joe Biden's inauguration",
        "body_text": "James A. Gagliano is a CNN law enforcement analyst and retired FBI supervisory special agent. He is also an adjunct assistant professor and doctoral candidate at St. John's University in Queens, New York, and a member of the Board of Directors for the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesAGagliano. The views expressed in this commentary are his. Read more opinion on CNN.\nLaw enforcement authorities are bracing for violence and attempts at disrupting the inauguration of our nation's 46th president, Joe Biden, on January 20. Online threats, which have become de rigueur in the current age of division and stoked partisan outrage, abound. The FBI has issued a bulletin warning of \"armed protests\" at all state capitols and aimed at the US Capitol in Washington, DC.\n On Monday, President Trump declared a state of emergency in our nation's capital, and ordered federal assistance to bolster the beleaguered District -- additional security resources in advance of our nation's 59th inauguration. Many Americans are understandably uneasy and fearful.\n To anyone in America just waking up from a four-year slumber, what an odd and incongruous presidential declaration. We fight like hell during the campaign. Then, we try to unite around the victor, a gracious predecessor attends ceremonies feting the declared winner, and a photographed handshake ensues. Our society acknowledges that as bitterly as we fought the election contest, we remain the United States of America.\n As a retired FBI agent with a quarter century of experience, I view the issued bulletin as more than perfunctory or pro forma, but as a dire warning of potentially impending security threats. The president's announced state of emergency is revelatory in just how far our country has deviated from its ideals. The direct result of last Wednesday's Capitol riots, where some Trump supporters overwhelmed Capitol Police checkpoints and occupied and defiled our national seat of government, should distress us all.\n A necessary state of emergency declaration is the antithesis of that cherished hallmark of our democracy, the peaceful transition of power.\n But what was the Capitol attack and the dark forces it embodied but an emergency? Angry protesters carrying American flags and screeching \"stop the steal\" abounded. The silly coup attempt -- exemplified by the \"QAnon Shaman,\" shirtless and replete in horned headgear, and the cad who attempted to make off with Nancy Pelosi's lectern  -- should embarrass us all. It should also serve as a warning.\n Law enforcement will not be caught as flat-footed as they were last Wednesday. There won't be as much concern for -- as the now-former chief of the Capitol Police put it to the Washington Post -- \"optics.\" A robust law enforcement presence -- local, state, and federal -- with out-of-town assets being pre-positioned, will serve as a deterrent to anyone considering disrupting the democratic process. The United States Secret Service will ensure the new administration is safely able to take the reins. Intelligence will be widely shared and quickly disseminated -- no pre-9/11 firewalls to permit gaps to threaten integrated security plans. Nothing will impede the peaceful transition of American power that has been so central to our democracy since George Washington handed over the reins to John Adams in 1797 -- 223 years ago. Nothing.\n Last Wednesday was a national disgrace, an embarrassment and an entirely preventable tragedy.\n These actions were more shameful and dangerous than theatrical. We witnessed a bearded man adorned with a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt, as well as a West Virginia legislator who resigned after he streamed a Facebook Live video of his unlawful incursion into the Capitol. Off-duty police and firefighters are also under investigation for their participation. It certainly was not our nation's finest hour.\n Make no mistake about it -- this was an insurrection. I fully understand the precision of language required by our criminal justice system. Title 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2383 defines it this way: \"Whoever incites, sets on foot, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof...\" Storming the meeting place of our nation's legislature meets this definition. The Capitol isn't just a functional building that houses elected officials. It is a symbol of our democracy. And if we narrowly define terrorism as violence or intimidation in pursuit of political aims, then this was, by the FBI's definition, a case of domestic terrorism.\n The period to raise election grievances had long passed by January 6. The Trump administration had exhausted their legal remedies. It was time to move on. But the president encouraged his supporters to descend upon our nation's capital on the 6th and whipped them into a frenzy with reckless, incendiary language that the unhinged used as a call to arms.\n The thing about mobs is that they are not precise, controllable instruments. Once you roil up an instigator or agitator or two, they act as the catalyst for mobilization -- what results then transforms into a singular, dangerous vessel -- and otherwise sober or reasonable folks get caught up in frenzy.\n It remains supremely difficult to accept at face value the pleas from some of the Trump supporters who traveled to DC equipped with firearms, Molotov cocktails, stun guns, explosive devices, tactical gear and zip ties (plastic hand restraints) as simply caught up in the momentum of events. A Capitol Police officer died as a result of his injuries in the melee. He was beaten with a fire extinguisher, his killer or killers aided and abetted, literally, by folks wrapped in or waving the American flag.\n These weren't patriots. They were part of a seditious action that resulted in a police officer's death. They were part of the rabble that included a cop killer. The murdered officer, Brian Sicknick, was also an Air National Guard veteran.\n Another Air Force veteran was killed during the assault on the Capitol. Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed that day, was a small business owner as well. The shooting remains under investigation. Her service to our country should be applauded. However, being a military veteran doesn't absolve anyone who joins with a mob to overrun those guarding the Capitol. Her death was tragic. It was also wholly preventable.\n The incitement and execution of mob violence on Congress is a horror unto itself but, sadly, disorderly crowds bent on destructive action have also become all too familiar over these paralyzingly long past eight months. Too many Americans are almost inured to the tumult, numb to its omnipresence. Black Lives Matter protests this summer, hijacked in some places by extremist groups on the left and right, have seen federal courthouses in Portland firebombed, a Seattle police precinct occupied, police assaulted, and seemingly unending destructive behavior which has continued into the New Year.\n None of this is righteous. None of this -- no matter how sacred the cause -- is how we effect change in America. Extremism isn't a cancer only detected in one side's political adherents. But it is something we should have been better prepared to confront in its most noxious form last Wednesday.\n Here's hoping we learned some necessary lessons from the Capitol riots.",

        "title": "Why I lost it on live TV",
        "body_text": "I felt raw and exposed and embarrassed all at once. I have long been taught as a woman \"never let them see you cry\" -- not in public and especially not at work. But I did that Tuesday.\n I cried. I couldn't control my tears. I couldn't use my words.\n It happened not just in public, but on CNN, in front of America and the world.\n What moved me to tears was, at first, simply rage. Rage at those who won't take our ills seriously and those who are actively fighting against the truth. They are putting people's lives in danger.\n I was on air to talk about Juliana Jimenez Sesma. Her story knocked me down. She left her job in real estate to take care of her mother, who was dealing with a lung condition. She didn't want to do anything to expose her mom and stepfather to the coronavirus.\n But in a deprived area of Los Angeles, the whole family became infected, including Sesma's brother and his family who lived next door. The younger ones survived but Sesma lost her stepfather and then her mother in the space of 11 days.\n I met her at her mother's funeral. It was a most disturbing scene. An open casket in the corner of a parking lot -- the only place available and safe for people to gather -- with flowers perched on the asphalt below.\n Sesma stood in front of me, a stranger, and told me her story. She was trying to be brave at her mom's funeral, but how can you say goodbye to the most important person in your life in a parking lot? Then, I would not let myself cry, I was working. But I did let myself see, feel and hear it as the mariachi band played \"Amor Eterno,\" or \"Love Eternal.\"\n I can't tell you what a hard slap in the face it is to constantly experience two distinctly different worlds in one beautiful but imperfect America: One based on reality, the other on conspiracy and tribalism.\n I've now been to 10 hospitals trying to deal with the pandemic. I've witnessed people writhing in pain, gasping for breath and near death from Covid-19 in ICUs across the country. I've seen doctors and nurses with exhaustion written all over their faces still battling like the pandemic just began, though we are 12 months in.\n And then, as I make my way home and stop to pump gas, someone rolls their eyes at me and asks, \"Why are you wearing a mask?\" Like it's me that's bonkers.\n Listening to Sesma's voice as the story played on air well before the LA dawn, I realized that she would wake up without her mom and stepdad because of coronavirus. She will do this every day for the rest of her life.  A double shot of pain every day. Pain that may go from a searing agony to a dull ache, but it will never leave.\n And then I thought about where she would wake up. In South Los Angeles, there are no convenient urgent care clinics. The community has 10 times fewer doctors per resident than the rest of California, I was told by the head of the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital -- the one facility that stands out in a health care desert.\n The major grocery chains that saturate other neighborhoods are absent in South LA. The branches of national pharmacies have no sugar-free candy options, no low-sugar health bars. Just the stuff that rots your teeth and contributes to diabetes.\n That may seem like an inconsequential thing. It isn't. The most frequently done surgery at the community hospital is amputation due to diabetes.\n Sesma's stepfather had diabetes and asthma. Her mother, a lung condition. Covid devours people who have those kinds of comorbidities. When coronavirus turned up, it found the perfect victims. But premature death is not new in South LA. The life expectancy there is 10 years -- TEN YEARS! -- less than the rest of the City of Los Angeles, the hospital chief told us.\n When I get home these days, there is no one to hug or to hold. I am self-isolating to keep any infection out of the lungs of my husband the best way I know how -- staying in another room, wearing a mask at home, and taking a coronavirus test a few days after going to hospitals.\n It's lonely. But not as lonely as having a family member die, infected because I was nonchalant about the dangers.\n This is not a joke and not a hoax. Before meeting Sesma, I had been to St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley, a little outside the city. It was yet another hospital filled with Covid patients and gracious but exhausted doctors and nurses. I heard one patient coughing and struggling to breathe -- each sip of air a painful event. I didn't see the patient, but my heart raced and my eyes watered.\n As I got the footage back to work, thinking again about how to tell this hospital's story, to make people believe, I turned on CNN to see our whole world change.\n It was January 6 and across the country in Washington was another deadly battle fueled by lies. A violent ill-informed mob was beating down the doors to the US Capitol, and they succeeded.\n For years I have covered hate in this country. I've been attacked by a neo-Nazi, and talked to several members of the KKK as well as white nationalists and the men who call themselves the Proud Boys.\n For years I have been saying some of these guys are talking about a civil war and they are going to act at some point. People would look at me the same way the maskless guy at the gas station did. I was met with an eye roll or push back that I was exaggerating. And yet there, in front of my eyes, an insurrection was unfolding. Stark. Violent. And real.\n I just wanted to scream. If few thought this could ever happen in modern America, I always feared it would. And I know it is not over. Just as sure as coronavirus is poised to deal another destructive blow because of the Christmas and New Year's revelry, militia members, white nationalists, Trump insurrectionists, conspiracy theorists and their supporters may deal yet another blow to American democracy as we know it.\n So when you saw me cry, you witnessed my rage. I care about my country. I worry about the new and old ills facing us. And I feel like my country is on life support.",

        "title": "Trump's actions in last days as President increase his legal jeopardy",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's actions during his final days in office have significantly increased his exposure to potential criminal prosecution, lawyers say, complicating his life after the White House.\n Over five days last week -- beginning with a phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State directing him to \"find\" votes to overturn the election to encouraging the pro-Trump crowd to \"show strength\" in their march to the Capitol -- lawyers say the President has put himself under the microscope of state and federal prosecutors.\n \"There are potential state and federal crimes that he can be prosecuted for just for the things he's done this past week and what's troubling for him is he won't have the immunity from prosecution that DOJ say says a sitting president has as of next Wednesday,\" said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor.\n The new possible criminal exposure comes on top of ongoing New York state investigations into the President's finances and multiple defamation lawsuits related to Trump denying sexual assault accusations by women. The Manhattan district attorney's office has a broad criminal investigation looking into allegations of insurance fraud and tax fraud. The New York attorney general has a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of its assets.\n The New York criminal investigation has been slowed by a fight over the President's tax records, a scrum that is again before the Supreme Court. The wait has stopped prosecutors from contacting Trump's private banker or seeking interviews with employees of the Trump Organization, people familiar with the matter say. Lawyers have speculated the court may be waiting for Trump's term to end next week before ruling.\n Sandick and other lawyers, however, say that as alarming as Trump's recent statements have been, there are multiple hurdles for prosecutors to prove that the President violated election laws or those relating to incitement or sedition.\n \"The incitement ones are challenging if you only have evidence of his own words because they're sufficiently ambiguous that it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,\" said Sandick.\n \"But the evidence is not only his own words. He organized this event, he invited [Rudy] Giuliani and Congressman [Mo] Brooks to speak. They made statements that were far more expressive than Trump's own,\" said Sandick. \"If you add into the case the fact that there may have been some coordination with the rioters and other speakers, then prosecutors could build a case against Trump,\" he added.\n On Tuesday, Trump defended his remarks, saying lawyers vetted them and said they were \"appropriate.\" Speaking at Joint Base Andrews before departing for Texas, Trump falsely said those who'd analyzed his remarks had found no fault in them.\n \"It's been analyzed,\" he said. \"People thought what I said was totally appropriate.\"\n \"They've analyzed my speech, my words,\" he continued. \"Everybody to a T thought it was appropriate.\"\n The new exposure Trump faces as he leaves office comes as the President is already part of a wide-ranging criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorneys' office, which is looking into a range of potential state crimes.\n He is also facing a civil investigation from the New York attorney general's office, which is looking at whether the President improperly inflated the value of his assets to obtain loans or favorable tax benefits. And, then, there are defamation lawsuits sparked by Trump denying accusations made by women who have alleged he assaulted them, including E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who has accused him of rape and Summer Zervos, who claims the President sexually assaulted her in 2007. Those cases have been delayed in the courts largely because of Trump's position -- that will no longer be the case next week.\n Manhattan prosecutors have been interviewing individuals and examining evidence, but their investigation has been slowed as they wait for the Supreme Court to rule on a subpoena issued 16 months ago to Trump's accountant for the President's personal and business tax records.\n Cary Dunne, general counsel for Vance's office, told a judge in July that the subpoena delay has led to \"continuing concerns about the potential loss of critical evidence and expiration of statutes of limitations.\"\n In October, a federal appeals court found the subpoena was not overly broad or issued in bad faith, but the Supreme Court has not ruled for three months on Trump's request for a stay of the decision.\n As the dispute has lingered in the courts, key investigative steps have been on hold, those people say say. Prosecutors can't confront key witnesses without the documents or determine whether there is evidence that any laws have been broken, people familiar with the matter say.\n Investigators subpoenaed Trump lender Deutsche Bank for records in late 2019 and interviewed employees about underwriting practices after the election, but they were not involved in the Trump loans.\n Prosecutors have also not been in contact with Rosemary Vrablic, Trump's private banker at Deutsche Bank, which has loaned the President more than $300 million dollars, people familiar with the investigation said. Last month, Vrablic's lawyer said she is \"committed to cooperating with authorities if asked.\" Investigators also have not sought interviews with any employees of the Trump Organization, the people say.\n Lawyers for the New York attorney general's office, which has a lower burden of proof in civil investigations, have also dealt with delays. Eric Trump, the President's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, fought a subpoena for his testimony for four months until a judge ordered him to be deposed in October. One of Trump's tax attorneys is also in a back and forth with the state over the disclosure of certain records.\n The President's actions this past week have already cost him financially -- the PGA of America said on Sunday night it would not hold its championship in 2022 at the Trump golf course in New Jersey and Deutsche Bank said it would not do business with him -- and the specter of ongoing criminal investigations may have a longer-term impact on his business prospects. New York City announced Wednesday that it is taking steps to cancel contracts with Trump Org for the Ferry Point golf course and carousel and ice skating rink in Central Park.\n Trump's recent statements will present the Biden administration, which has made calls for unity, and his Justice Department with the dilemma of potentially prosecuting a former president.\n Biden's nominee for Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland, has a reputation for even handedness. He also has experience with domestic terrorism cases having prosecuted the Oklahoma City bombers.\n \"There's a long precedent of not prosecuting former presidents over policy differences,\" said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. \"The difference is we're not talking about policy difference here, and this is perhaps the most egregious conduct we've ever seen from a president while in office. If they have chargeable offenses there's a really strong case to be made for pursuing them against President Trump.\"\n Some former prosecutors say that a lot of the conduct is morally reprehensible, but it isn't clear if it will cross the line into violating the law. Investigators will need to prove the President intended to commit crimes, a high bar in criminal cases, not that he was encouraging lawful protests or truly believed that he won the election.\n This weekend, in an interview with NPR, acting US attorney for Washington, DC, Michael Sherwin doubled down on his earlier statements that investigators are \"looking\" at any and all actors, including the President, Giuliani and others who revved up the crowd.\n \"Look, I meant what I said before. In any criminal investigation, I don't care if it's a drug trafficking conspiracy case, a human trafficking case or the Capitol, all persons will be looked at,\" Sherwin told NPR. \"If the evidence leads to any actor that may have had a role in this and if that evidence meets the four corners of a federal charge or a local charge, we're going to pursue it,\" he said.\n Like the riot, the legal liability for Trump's call to Georgia election officials will turn on his statements. Trump called the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, imploring him to \"find\" 11,780 votes to give him the edge to overturn the election. It followed a call in December in which Trump told a Georgia elections investigator he would be a \"national hero\" if he would \"find the fraud,\" a source told CNN.\n The calls have prompted letters and calls for state and federal investigations into Trump's conduct. It isn't clear if there is an active investigation. Former prosecutors say the outreach is worth federal prosecutors' scrutiny even if Trump wasn't successful because of the intimidation and threats the officials have faced.\n As the end of Trump's presidency nears, sources tell CNN Trump has considered pardoning himself, his family members and other allies from federal charges. Lawyers say it is not clear whether a self-pardon would hold up in court, but a presidential pardon has no bearing on state investigations.\n If Trump escapes his presidency without any criminal charges, lawyers say, his last weeks in office have assured him a place in history.\n \"Even if prosecutors don't end up charging him, the fact is that there's a basis here for investigating multiple different federal crimes at once,\" said Williams, adding, \"there are a lot of mobsters who don't even have that many criminal investigations open involving them at one time.\"",

        "title": "A global chip shortage is hitting carmakers at the worst possible time",
        "body_text": "The world's largest carmakers are facing a critical shortage of semiconductors that threatens to hamstring production just as the industry tries to stage a comeback from a sales slump caused by the pandemic.\n Volkswagen (VLKAF), Ford (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Nissan (NSANF) are among major automakers suffering from the global shortage of chips, which are used in a growing number of applications, including driver assistance systems and navigation control. The average car has between 50 to 150 chips.\n Volkswagen said in a statement last month that it will need to adapt production at plants in China, North America and Europe this quarter. The changes will affect production of the bestselling VW Golf, as well as models from its Audi, Skoda and Seat brands.\n According to UBS analysts, the world's largest carmaker could lose out on production of 100,000 units in the first three months of the year, or roughly 4% of global quarterly output, as a result of the components shortages.\n \"We are doing everything in our power to minimize lost production and to ensure that normal deliveries to customers can be resumed as rapidly as possible,\" Volkswagen Group purchasing manager Murat Aksel said in a statement on December 18.\n A Volkswagen spokesperson told CNN Business on Tuesday that the situation remains difficult. But it's not possible to quantify the impact at this stage, the spokesperson added.\n Ford halted production this week at its Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant, which builds the Escape and Corsair, as a result of the semiconductor shortage. The company said in a statement on Monday that it is working closely with suppliers and prioritizing \"key vehicle lines for production.\"\n Fiat Chrysler said it will delay the restart of production following a scheduled break at its Toluca, Mexico plant, which builds the Jeep Compass. It will also schedule downtime at its Canadian plant in Ontario, which produces the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger.\n \"This will minimize the impact of the current semiconductor shortage while ensuring we maintain production at our other North American plants,\" the company, which is set to merge with PSA Group (PUGOY) this month, said in a statement.\n Japanese carmakers Honda (HMC) and Nissan confirmed that they too are facing supply issues, but declined to quantify the impact. Nikkei, a Japanese business publication, reported last week that Honda will slash production by about 4,000 units this month, mainly affecting the Fit subcompact manufactured at its Suzuka plant. Honda said in a statement on Tuesday that the factory is running normally at present.\n The disruption comes at a crucial time for carmakers, which suffered a collapse in sales in the early months of the pandemic, yet remain under intense pressure from global regulators to invest heavily in electric cars. Research firm Bernstein estimates global light vehicle sales will grow 9% in 2021, following an expected 15% decline last year.\n The supply chain bottleneck could end up hurting business. A much stronger than expected recovery in sales and production volumes has contributed to the crunch, but carmakers risk missing out on the demand uplift if assembly lines slow.\n When the pandemic forced automakers to temporarily shutter factories last year, leading semiconductor manufacturers reassigned production capacity to companies making smartphones, laptops and gaming devices.\n \"With lead times of six to nine months, the semiconductor industry has not been able to scale up fast enough to meet this unexpected growth in automotive demand,\" parts supplier Continental (CTTAF) said in a statement sent to CNN Business on Tuesday.\n The bottlenecks are expected to continue \"well into 2021, causing major disruptions in Continental's production.\" The company said that an internal task force supervised by senior management is managing the \"critical situation.\"\n Automakers account for only about 12% of all semiconductor demand globally, putting them in relatively weak purchasing position, said Arndt Ellinghorst, a senior analyst at Bernstein.\n Bosch, the world's largest car parts supplier, said in a statement Tuesday that it is doing \"all it can\" to keep customers supplied. \"In this respect, we are in close daily contact with our suppliers and customers,\" it added.\n The supply crunch should be alleviated by the second quarter, Ellinghorst told CNN Business. But it will take longer for the industry to recover from the pandemic.\n Global vehicle production is not expected to return to its 2019 level before 2022, Ellinghorst said.\n \u2014 Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",

        "body_text": "A Florida firefighter was arrested for unlawful entry of a restricted building and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to court documents, after a photo surfaced of him wearing a Trump 2020 hat and pointing at a placard for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi inside the US Capitol.\n Andrew Williams, a firefighter-paramedic with the Sanford Fire Department, appeared in federal court Tuesday and was released on a $25,000 signature bond, according to the court documents.\n The Sanford Fire Department launched an investigation into Williams' involvement after the photo circulated online. Fire Chief Craig Radzak confirmed it was Williams in the photo and said that Williams had been with the department as a firefighter-paramedic since October 2016.\n Williams has been placed on administrative leave without pay, according to an  updated release from the fire department.\n As one of the bail conditions, Williams must appear at all court proceedings. In addition, he is not allowed to possess firearms, ammunition or dangerous weapons, and must surrender his passport by Friday.\n Records from federal court in Florida show that Williams' case is being transferred to the District of Columbia.\n He is allowed to travel to DC as necessary for court appearances, according to the conditions.\n Vince Citro, an attorney for Williams, told CNN affiliate WESH TV that President Donald Trump and the Capitol police are to blame for the attack.\n \"The President and the Capitol police encouraged despicable behavior,\" Citro said, speaking outside of court. \"Mr. Williams took part in none of it. In fact, you'll notice in the complaint there are no allegations that Mr. Williams did any of those things.\"\n The Sanford Fire Department has suspended its investigation pending the conclusion of the federal investigation, according to its statement.\n \"We hold the men and women in this department to the highest standards,\" Chief Radzak said in the release. \"It saddens me that the actions of one individual have tarnished the hard work and dedication that the rest of the department puts forth on a daily basis.\"",

        "title": "If he wins Uganda election, Museveni will work with his seventh US president. Here's how the US has helped him stay in power",
        "body_text": "During a live virtual press conference on Thursday, a stunned global audience watched as singer-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi, known as Bobi Wine, was forcibly removed from his vehicle by Ugandan police as gunshots were fired.\n \"I have regularly been beaten and pepper-sprayed on the campaign trail,\" Wine, who escaped unhurt from the incident, told CNN in a phone conversation two days prior to the incident.\n \"The military has taken control, and this was never a fair and free election.\"\n Following the incident, the conference organizers, Vanguard Africa, a nonprofit promoting democracy in African countries, filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court against Museveni and other high-ranking Ugandan officials for \"violations of international law governing human rights and crimes against humanity.\"\n Ugandans go to the polls on January 14, with Wine and nine other candidates challenging incumbent President Yoweri Museveni, commander-in-chief of the military, who has been in power since 1986, a tenure marked by an assault on democracy, critics say.\n In 2005, the Ugandan parliament removed presidential term limits to allow Museveni to remain in office. During the 2016 election his closest competitor, opposition leader Kizza Besigye, was put under \"preventive arrest\" at his home in Kampala, along with six officials from his party.\n Like Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and others in recent history, Museveni, 76, does not appear eager to let a fair and free democratic election unfold after more than three decades in power. In 2017, he changed the constitution to remove the age limit to allow him to extend his iron grip on power. This led to an outcry and street protests among Uganda's youth.\n Wine, who regularly wears a helmet and flak jacket on the campaign trail, is seen as the most prominent challenger, \u200band his message has struck a chord with Uganda's young people.\n World Bank data shows three-quarters of Ugandans are under the age of 30 and have never known another president.\n Senior US politicians and human rights groups have expressed concern over what they describe as Uganda's slide toward authoritarianism as Museveni prepares to work with his seventh US President.\n They have accused him of attacking the press, allowing military and police brutality, suspending opposition campaigning, and arresting activists in a bid to cling to power.\n On Tuesday, two days ahead of the polls, internet service providers were ordered to block access to social media platforms, according to Reuters.\n In an address to the nation on the same day, Museveni confirmed that Facebook and other social media was blocked, accusing them of \"arrogance\".\n Facebook told CNN on Monday it had removed accounts linked to the Government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda for using \"fake and duplicate accounts\" to make the government \"appear more popular\" than they were.\n The President said that any state interference in Bobi Wine's attempts to campaign was because he has been violating health measures during the pandemic, saying that the virus \"has killed very many people in Europe and in the United States.\n In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, he said that Wine ran into \"conflicts with the law,\" because he defied bans on public gatherings.\n However, Museveni himself has held campaign events and there have been calls from opposition candidates for Uganda's Electoral Commission to sanction all parties who flout Covid-19 campaign guidelines, including the President's.\n The President added in the interview that he would \"accept the results\" if he lost.\n \"Uganda is not my house... if the people of Uganda don't want me to help them with their issues, I go and deal with my personal issues very happily.\"\n Museveni has maintained an iron grip on power in Uganda for nearly 35 years with help from Western allies and many say that the US is complicit in the anti-democratic tendencies of their staunch military ally.\n \"The United States helps Museveni stay in power,\" Wine told CNN on January 5. \"If democracy is important, they should reconsider giving Uganda money used to murder and oppress.\"\n The longstanding relationship between the US and Uganda has meant that the East African country has received nearly $800m a year in aid between 2016 and 2019, according to USAID figures. While other countries like Kenya and Nigeria received more in the same time period for various reasons, the aid to Uganda from the US has still offered legitimacy to an undemocratic regime, commentators say.\n \"Museveni is a smart player,\" said Ken Opalo, an assistant professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, who has written on Museveni's foreign policy. \"He realized he could be a useful ally to the US in the war on terror but also in stabilizing the Great Lakes region [of East Africa].\"\n This partnership means the US government plays a key role in \"professionalizing\" the military, the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF), says the State Department on its website. It has also received hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hardware from the US, said Opalo.\n Museveni has proved useful, particularly in the fight against terror, added Opalo. Since he seized power following a guerrilla struggle against the government, Uganda has been a source of regional stability, committing troops and working closely with successive US administrations.\n Human rights groups and opposition candidates often accuse the security forces of abuse and blurring the line between military and police enforcement.\n Arbitrary arrests, detentions, and beatings are common in Uganda.\n \"UPDF has been involved in incidents alongside the police,\" Otsieno Namwaya, the East Africa director of Human Rights Watch, an NGO that advocates for human rights, told CNN.\n Neither the UPDF nor Ugandan police responded to CNN's requests for comment on these allegations.\n At least 45 were killed in protests in November sparked by the arrest of Wine and another opposition candidate, Patrick Oboi Amuriat, for breaking coronavirus regulations.\n Since then, Wine has said he has been blocked from holding campaign activities several times. He has also accused security forces of shooting at and teargassing him.\n Human rights lawyer Nicholas Opiyo was arrested on December 22 by a \"security and financial intelligence\" team for \"money laundering and related malicious acts.\" He helped Wine out of military detention in 2018, and has since been granted bail but the arrest was met with international condemnation.\n The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized Opiyo's arrest and said it reflected \"the dangerous environment\" created to \"marginalize and repress civil society.\"\n Wine's bodyguard was run over and killed by a UPDF military-police truck, but a spokesperson for the Ugandan military denied it was a targeted attack.\n High-ranking US officials were vocal about the outbreak of violence in the country late last year. On December 9, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs asked the State Department to \"review all non-humanitarian assistance to Uganda.\"\n The next day\u200b, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet the US was \"paying close attention to the actions of individuals who seek to impede the ongoing democratic process.\"\n Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a Senate resolution on December 17 calling on Museveni's government to \"create conditions for credible democratic elections.\"\n Yet military aid has not been withdrawn, and the US continues to train Uganda's soldiers, Opalo told CNN.\n When contacted by CNN, Menendez urged Museveni to \"allow the people of Uganda to participate in a transparent election and respect their will.\"\n \"I am deeply concerned about the long-term consequences of this crisis for our nation's credibility as we continue to support democracy around the world,\" he told CNN in a statement. \"On January 14, the Ugandan people must be given an opportunity to have their voices heard. The Museveni regime's continued assault on political opposition, media and dissenting voices must stop,\" Menendez added.\n The US and Uganda have had diplomatic relations since 1962, following the East African country's independence from the United Kingdom.\n After Museveni seized power, Uganda became relatively stable and experienced economic growth.  Uganda is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and US exports include machinery, optical and medical instruments, wheat, and aircraft, says the State Department on its website.\n Despite the rampant corruption, economic mismanagement, misuse of public funds, and discriminatory legal systems listed by the State Department, Uganda received at least $434 million in US foreign assistance in 2020.\n A State Department Spokesperson told CNN that the department is \"paying close attention to the actions of individuals and organizations who seek to impede the ongoing democratic process...\"\n Wine says he has a five-point plan which pledges to reduce corruption, but he knows he faces an uphill task. Museveni has seen off many worthy challengers during his tenure, and this time might be no different.\n \"Part of Museveni's strategy is to leverage all the instability around him and it's worked for him; he's stayed in power for 35 years. But it has been terrible for Uganda,\" said Opalo.",

A microphone and amplifier enhance muffled speech.\n And wearers can customize their look by activating two lighting zones with a choice of 16.8 million colors and a variety of dynamic lighting effects.\n \"The Project Hazel smart mask concept is intended to be functional, yet comfortable and useful for interacting with the world, while maintaining a sociable aesthetic,\" Min-Liang Tan, Razer's co-founder and CEO, said in the release.\n There is no set release date for the mask as it is still being fine-tuned, a spokesperson for Razer told CNN.\n Earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, Razer converted manufacturing facilities in China to make face masks.\n And in May the company, which is headquartered in both Singapore and Las Vegas, said it would give out millions of free face masks in Singapore as the country grappled with a surge in coronavirus cases.",

        "title": "Why America's military leaders felt they had to take a stand ",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump finally did it. His incitement of a deadly riot at the Capitol in Washington ultimately dragged America's most senior military leaders, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, into an unprecedented political crisis. Throughout his presidency, the four-star top brass have been adamant that the Pentagon wouldn't get involved in politics -- even as Trump repeatedly tried to bring it into his partisan orbit.\n But after the shocking violence at the Capitol last week and the images of insurrection were shown around the world, the chiefs felt they had to speak, especially to get their message to American troops. Top aides to Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, began to draft what is known as a \"Memorandum for the Joint Force,\" and early on Tuesday the chiefs met to finalize their message. It was their second key meeting in less than a week. After the riot they had met to talk about what happened and a way ahead.\n On the face of it, it is a reminder to troops around the world. The message: \"We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values and oath, it is against the law.\"\n But the chiefs well knew the memo would be read across the globe, several defense officials say. They had plenty to say and each word was carefully selected. The chiefs are not partisan, but they have a fine-tuned antenna to the political climate. They know when it is time for them to speak out, as they did after racial unrest last year. And they knew that this memo would put them at odds with Trump days before he left office as commander in chief.\n On Tuesday Trump defended his remarks that had inspired his supporters to march on and riot at the Capitol. But the chiefs made their stand by calling out the rioters, saying that \"the rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection\" -- a statement their commander in chief has refused to make.\n The memo also made the critical point that \"the US military will obey lawful orders\" from civilian leadership. This may be the most important line to remember. The chiefs and combat commanders around the world have given thought to what they'd do if Trump issued an illegal order, and the answer is simple: They would not follow it, according to several Pentagon officials directly familiar with their thinking.\n All US troops are trained to follow only legal orders. But in this charged environment, nobody will openly talk about how the chiefs would turn down an illegal order in the still unlikely event Trump were to issue one. But inside senior military circles, it is well understood. To be legal, an order for military action must have a valid target, it must be moral and ethical, and it must use proportional force.\n Commanders simply don't launch nuclear strikes, launch bombs and missiles, or send troops into harm's way without a valid reason for military action. Presidential orders have multiple layers of legal review to ensure commanders can carry out those orders.\n But if an order is illegal, what happens? The lawyers and the Pentagon leadership explain to the president why the order is not legal. If the president still does not back down, then there is no choice. Commanders must resign. The law prohibits them from carrying out illegal orders.\n By issuing their statement, the Joint Chiefs have made it both privately and publicly clear what is at stake. But what is unsettling is that nobody knows if the President is listening.",

        "title": "The ongoing challenge of pandemic fatigue is hitting people hard",
        "body_text": "Nearly a year of ever-changing public safety guidelines with long days cooped up at home are wearing on many people.\n People have been social distancing, wearing masks and skipping gatherings with friends and family in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n The pandemic, however, didn't stop many from traveling for the holidays despite guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to keep up with social distancing. At least 1,327,289 people passed through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on January 3, the highest since March 15 of last year.\n Dr. Neelima Denduluri says pandemic fatigue has negatively impacted her everyday life, whether it's worrying that she's an asymptomatic carrier when seeing her patients or struggling to facilitate online learning for her children.\n \"By the time I got home late, I wasn't necessarily the most mentally alert, nor were (my children), to help them make sure that their stuff got done,\" said Denduluri, a medical oncologist at Virginia Cancer Specialists in Arlington.\n Pandemic fatigue also can make people feel isolated, which is how Sarah Tallent, a pediatric critical care nurse practitioner in North Carolina, felt after giving birth in July. There is an added challenge to giving birth during a pandemic, she said, and Tallent felt the most alone in the weeks after giving birth.\n \"I was on maternity leave with the newborn, which is normally a time where your family is coming and your friends are coming to meet your new baby, and it was such an isolating and alone time because we couldn't do any of those things,\" Tallent said.\n Most visitors had to wait until six weeks after her daughter was born until Tallent felt comfortable enough for them to visit, and all visitors had to isolate themselves for two weeks prior to their visits.\n Pandemic fatigue happens when people are asked to make behavior changes over a long period of time, which is much harder than short-term changes, said Dr. Itai Danovitch, chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n It's similar to other lifestyle changes people try to make, like eating healthier and working out to lose weight, Danovitch said. Most people can follow the new rules for a short period of time, but sustaining the new behaviors can be tough.\n \"We get tired and we resort to our usual behaviors, and when the requirements are coming from sources outside themselves, it adds a whole other layer of complexity,\" Danovitch said.\n Young adults are especially susceptible to pandemic fatigue, according to a news release published by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n The fatigue could be explained by taking a peek inside their brains. The frontal lobe, which is in charge of decision-making, Danovitch said, is not fully developed until age 25.\n He attributes it as one of the main reasons why young adults make impulsive decisions and are \"less inclined to weigh the risks and consequences over the long term of a given behavior.\"\n Research psychologist Jeffrey Arnett of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, is skeptical of that theory, mainly because young adults throughout history have had to make important decisions at young ages.\n One hundred years ago, people were \"married by the time they're in their late teens, maybe early 20s, and having children of their own and doing adult work,\" Arnett said.\n Instead, he describes the brain as being shaped by a person's circumstances. In the United States, many young adults are not required to exercise much mature thinking where they are responsible for others, he said.\n Because these young adults are less likely to have people to answer to or take care of, their independent thinking doesn't always look at how their actions affect others. In the case of the virus, Arnett said, young people might not be thinking how their actions could make others ill.\n Despite the steep rise in coronavirus cases in recent months, people are optimistic that with the Covid vaccine rolling out, there are better times ahead in sight.\n Tallent has taken the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and believes it will take at least a year for life to start looking normal again.\n In recent months, she noticed that there have been issues with vaccine distribution, so she signed up to administer the vaccine so she could \"pull us together and help get everyone immune to this thing.\"\n Others are hoping herd immunity ends Covid-19, but no one knows exactly how many people would need to be immune to the virus, said Dr. Leana Wen, CNN medical analyst, in an earlier story. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, most recently estimated that 85% of Americans would need to be vaccinated.\n So far, getting to 85% has been a challenge. Some people are hesitant to receive the vaccine, and those that do want it have trouble getting it due to distribution issues.\n The Trump administration is hoping to solve this by releasing the second vaccine dose immediately instead of reserving it. The new strategy, which mimics President-elect Joe Biden's proposed plan, would also allow anyone 65 years and older to receive the vaccine. The Department of Health and Human Services announced the new plan Tuesday, according to earlier CNN reporting.\n Denduluri has received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and believes that by the fall of 2021, people will mostly be able to return to their normal lives -- while still wearing masks.\n Whether people are at the grocery store, a physician's office or a dentist's office, she hopes they \"feel more comfortable to do what they need to do and carry on with their lives.\"\n Additional reporting by CNN's Katia Hetter and Kristen Holmes",

        "title": "The big winners from Tesla stock surge: lithium miners and battery makers",
        "body_text": "The incredible stock market surge for Tesla isn't just making Elon Musk and Tesla investors rich. Traders betting on lithium miners and battery makers are also benefiting from Tesla's success.\n Lithium is a key component for batteries in electric cars. The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT),  a fund that owns Tesla (TSLA) and other companies in the electric battery business, is up 15% in 2021 and it has soared more than 65% in just the past three months.\n \"You can't have electric cars without batteries and you cant have batteries without lithium,\" said Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium (PLL), a lithium miner whose stock has surged nearly 35% so far in 2021.\n Although electric car batteries have other metals that can be interchangeable, such as nickel, cobalt and manganese, \"you're always going to need the same amount of lithium,\" Philips told CNN Business.\n Lithium is the lightest metal in the universe and also has a high energy density, which means it is able to store more energy -- which is key for an electric battery.\n \"Nothing can do what lithium does for portable charging,\" Phillips said.\n The growing global demand for electric cars is helping companies that mine and produce lithium as well as the manufacturers of the lithium-ion batteries that are needed for cars and trucks made by Tesla and its rivals.\n \"There is still a huge opportunity for companies across the electric vehicle supply chain. Investors need to think more about that and not just about Tesla. Electric vehicle penetration could reach 50% of the auto market by 2030,\" said Pedro Palandrani, disruptive technology analyst at Global X.\n Shares of American specialty chemicals company Albemarle (ALB), which has lithium production facilities in Nevada and is the top stock in the lithium ETF, has surged nearly 25% this year alone and has almost doubled in the past three months.\n Albemarle said last week it plans to invest $30 million to $50 million to double the current production at its Silver Peak, Nevada site by 2025.\n The world's top lithium mines are in Australia, Chile and Argentina. So US car companies are looking for more local sources of the metal.\n \"As global demand for electric vehicles grows, North American automotive manufacturers are seeking to regionalize their supply chain for greater security and sustainability,\" Albemarle said in a press release.\n The electrification of the automotive industry isn't just for consumer sedans and SUVs. There could be an even bigger opportunity in providing lithium-ion batteries to big industrial firms that make trucks for large corporate fleets, according to Lionel Selwood, Jr., CEO of Romeo Power.\n Romeo Power makes batteries for commercial vehicles. It went public at the the end of last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company and the stock has doubled since the deal was announced in October.\n Selwood said he has no interest in getting into the more competitive business of making batteries for consumer vehicles, but he said the growing demand for electric cars -- thanks to companies like Tesla -- is helping his firm because that makes it cheaper to produce lithium-ion batteries.\n \"We're building a business for commercial customers so we can get bigger contracts,\" Selwood told CNN Business. \"We're piggybacking off of global consumer demand for electric vehicles since that brings prices down to make batteries.\"\n Global X's Palandrani told CNN Business that Tesla deserves a lot of credit for helping to make the electric car business go mainstream with both consumers and investors. With that in mind, his firm also runs the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV), which counts Tesla as its top holding.\n But he added that investors can't ignore the other companies in the industry that are benefiting from the trend, especially in China. As such, the lithium ETF also owns electric car maker BYD, battery manufacturer CATL and miner Ganfeng.\n \"We're talking about the disruption of transportation,\" Palandrani said. \"It would be myopic to think that Tesla is the only important company in the industry,\"",

        "title": "Intel ousts CEO and names successor",
        "body_text": "Intel has named Pat Gelsinger as its new chief executive officer, replacing Bob Swan after a rocky two-year run.\n The chipmaker recruited Gelsinger from software firm VMWare, calling him a \"highly respected CEO and industry veteran\" in a release. Gelsinger, who has been VMWare's CEO for about the past decade, will take the helm at Intel on February 15.\n Intel (INTC) shares rose nearly 8% following the news, while VMWare (VMW) shares slipped almost 8%. CNBC first reported the news.\n Swan was named Intel's permanent CEO in January 2019 following the departure of its previous CEO Brian Krzanich, who was forced to resign in June 2018 because of a \"past consensual relationship with an Intel employee.\"\n Under Swan, the company has struggled, losing market share to competitors in key business segments and dealing with manufacturing delays.\n In its press release, Intel said the move \"is unrelated to Intel's 2020 financial performance.\"\n But \"there have been a lot of questions about Bob Swan's leadership\" after execution problems have raised questions over the past year about Intel's position as the market leader, said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research.\n He called Swan \"a very capable CEO,\" but noted that \"people were hoping [for] someone with more technical background\" at the helm of Intel -- someone like Gelsinger.\n And the leadership change comes after a letter to Intel from activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point, calling on the company chairman to hire an investment adviser to explore \"strategic alternatives\" aimed at regaining market share from competitors. The suggestions in the letter included calls for the company to consider whether to continue making all of its chips in-house and divesting from \"failed acquisitions.\"\n In Wednesday's release, Intel said its board \"concluded that now is the right time to make this leadership change to draw on Pat's technology and engineering expertise during this critical period of transformation at Intel,\" adding that the change will \"ensure strong execution\" of the company's new future.\n Among Intel's biggest challenges at the moment: The company has fallen behind competitors in producing the most advanced microprocessors.\n Intel in recent years struggled to move from a 14-nanometer to a 10-nanometer chip, and it said in July that its 7-nanometer chips (which some of its rivals already have) would also be delayed. Meanwhile, rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) continue to move ahead with developing even smaller, more powerful processors.\n As it grapples with the manufacturing difficulties, Intel also faces greater competition than it's \"ever had in the past\" in its core business areas, said Alan Priestley, vice president analyst for Gartner.\n AMD (AMD) has stolen market share in the key PC and data center markets, and Nvidia (NVDA) has been investing heavily in the AI sector. Intel's PC business also recently took a blow when Apple announced it will use its own processors, rather than Intel's, in its new series of Macs.\n Such issues have meant Intel's stock has also lagged behind competitors. The company's shares are down nearly 4% from a year ago, despite the bump they received from the news Wednesday. AMD's stock, by contrast, is up 87% over the past year, and TSMC's has grown nearly 99%.\n \"I hope that they'll come out with a real clear strategy about how they'll address the manufacturing issues, the competitive issues they face going forward,\" Gartner's Priestley said of Intel. He added that Gelsinger will need to address Intel's loss of technology leadership and decide how much of its technology to continue manufacturing in-house.\n \"(Gelsinger has) got to come out with a real clear strategy there,\"  Priestly said, \"something that gives the industry confidence that they're going to recover.\"\n Gelsinger brings to the top job a deep well of experience, both from within Intel and the broader business ecosystem in which the company operates.\n Prior to his role at VMWare Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, becoming became the company's first-ever chief technology officer and helped establish Intel's position as a market leader.\n He then served as President and COO of Dell EMC, which sells IT infrastructure solutions such as data storage, cloud computing and analytics, before taking on the top job at VMWare.\n At VMWare, Gelsinger oversaw massive growth. VMWare posted $10.8 billion in 2020 revenue, more than double the $4.6 billion it earned in 2012, the year Gelsinger became CEO. Both companies rely on innovations from chipmakers, insight that analysts say Gelsinger will bring as he returns to the chip giant.\n \"He understands the way Intel works and the technologies it has,\" Priestley said. \"Because he's been at EMC and subsequently VMWare, I should hope he'll bring some interesting insights to the senior management team inside Intel, from an (equipment manufacturer) perspective and a major (software vendor) perspective ... he's seen it from the other side of the table.\"\n Gelsinger also has a technical background \u2014 he architected the original 80486 processor at Intel and has associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering \u2014 which has proven helpful to other Intel leaders in the past, as well as competitors like AMD CEO Lisa Su. Swan, by contrast, has a background in business management and finance; he was Intel's chief financial officer before becoming CEO.\n \"Intel has had a history of engineers becoming CEOs,\" Krewell said. \"There's been exceptions of course, but in general, there's been a strong preference to have a technical CEO.\"",

        "title": "There may be fewer galaxies in the universe than we thought",
        "body_text": "The universe may be a little darker after a recent discovery has shown that there could be fewer galaxies populating it.\n A previous measurement by Hubble Space Telescope suggested there were 2 trillion galaxies spread across the universe. Now, the latest research points to only hundreds of billions of galaxies instead.\n After NASA's New Horizons mission flew by Pluto and the distant object Arrokoth on the edge of our solar system 4 billion miles from Earth in 2015 and 2019, it looked across the vastness of black space.\n The New Horizons spacecraft was at such a distance that the sky it surveyed was 10 times darker than the darkest sky observed by Hubble.\n Hubble only orbits the Earth from a distance of 340 miles and it has to contend with light pollution from an effect called zodiacal light. Our corner of the solar system is full of dust shed by asteroids and comets and those dust particles reflect sunlight, which creates zodiacal light.\n The previous estimate of galaxies was determined by astronomers counting every galaxy visible in Hubble's deep field and multiplying it based on the total area of the sky.\n \"Deep field observations are long-lasting observations of a particular region of the sky intended to reveal faint objects by collecting the light from them for an appropriately long time,\" according to the European Space Agency's Hubble site.\n However, that doesn't account for distant or faint galaxies that couldn't be seen.\n While space may appear absolutely black in its vast darkness, it's actually illuminated by the diffuse glow of distant stars and galaxies.\n Leaving the illuminated inner solar system is the best way to determine just how many galaxies may exist in the unseen distance -- which is exactly what New Horizons did.\n New Horizons found that distant galaxies are less plentiful than previously believed because the cosmic glow they cause is so weak.\n The study has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal and was presented Wednesday at the 237th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, which is occurring virtually due to the pandemic.\n \"It's an important number to know -- how many galaxies are there?\" said study coauthor Marc Postman, a distinguished astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement. \"We simply don't see the light from two trillion galaxies.\"\n Previously, astronomers believed that 90% of the galaxies in the universe remained hidden from Hubble's view. But the new calculation is much less.\n \"Take all the galaxies Hubble can see, double that number, and that's what we see -- but nothing more,\" said lead study author Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, in a statement.\n The background glow in the universe, called the cosmic optical background, is the visible light counterpart of the afterglow associated with the Big Bang, which is called the cosmic microwave background.\n \"While the cosmic microwave background tells us about the first 450,000 years after the big bang, the cosmic optical background tells us something about the sum total of all the stars that have ever formed since then,\" Postman said. \"It puts a constraint on the total number of galaxies that have been created, and where they might be in time.\"\n \"New Horizons provided us with a vantage point to measure the cosmic optical background better than anyone has been able to do it,\" Lauer said.\n There is still a sort of leftover glow that remains unaccounted for, which could belong to yet unknown stars or galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in October, could reveal the source.",

        "title": "Mitch McConnell has one more card to play against Donald Trump",
        "body_text": "On Wednesday afternoon, the House will impeach President Donald Trump for a second time. It is known. The only real drama will be to see how many House Republicans cross the aisle to vote with Democrats to impeach the President.\n But once that vote happens, the real drama begins, as the House is expected to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, where a trial will be conducted. (It's not yet clear whether the House will send the articles immediately or whether they will wait.)\n And it's in the Senate where Republicans will be faced with a very clear choice: Will they vote to convict Trump or, as they did in 2019, acquit him?\n What we know is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that impeachment is actually a good thing for his party because it opens the possibility that the GOP can make a very public break from the outgoing President.\n McConnell hinted at his openness in a note to his Republican colleagues Tuesday afternoon, saying, \"While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\" (Contrast that to how quickly McConnell came out in opposition to the 2019 impeachment of Trump over his conduct in regard to his action toward Ukraine).\n But McConnell has yet to commit to voting to convict Trump. He should. Here's why.\n If McConnell votes to convict Trump for his role in inciting a riot at the US Capitol, it's very likely that he would bring enough of his Republican colleagues along with him to ensure the 67 votes necessary for Trump's removal. (\"If Mitch is a yes, he's done,\" one Senate GOP source who asked not to be named told CNN on Tuesday night.) The removal of Trump from office wouldn't mean that all of the capitulation that McConnell and other Republicans did to Trump over the past four years would be forgotten, of course. But it would sure make it easier to begin putting Trump in the rear-view mirror -- and make sure that every single Republican elected official didn't have to respond to every norm-breaching thing the President does in his last week in office and after he leaves the White House.\n McConnell -- not to mention House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California) -- need a way to go to these corporations with something to get them back on board. What better way than to say that the Republican-controlled Senate convicted and removed Trump from office -- a sort of mea culpa for the Electoral College objection votes cast earlier this month?\n Yes, as you can tell from the points above, McConnell (and the Republican-led Senate) voting at some point soon to remove Trump from office would be a largely symbolic gesture. But in politics as in life, symbolism matters! Words matter!\n As then-candidate for president Barack Obama said in 2008: \"It's true that speeches don't solve all problems. But what is also true is if we cannot inspire the country to believe again, then it doesn't matter how many policies and plans we have.\"\n What McConnell and the Republican Party need is a clear (and, yes, symbolic) break from the last four years of Trump. That won't fix all the damage Trump -- and complicit Republicans -- have done to the Republican brand. But what a vote to convict Trump led by McConnell could do is send a signal to both the public and the Republican Party that Trump is not who the GOP is -- not now and certainly not going forward.\n CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president.",

        "body_text": "The White House coronavirus task force again suggested the existence of \"more transmissible\" strains of Covid-19 and a \"much more rapid\" spread of the virus in its weekly reports to states, stressing the importance of \"aggressive mitigation.\"\n \"This fall/winter surge has been at nearly twice the rate of rise of cases as the spring and summer surges. This acceleration and the epidemiologic data suggest the possibility that some strains of the US COVID-19 virus may have evolved into a more transmissible virus,\" reports sent to states dated January 10 and obtained by CNN said.\n The report continued, \"Given that possibility, and the presence of the UK variant that is already spreading in our communities and may be 50% more transmissible, we must be ready for and mitigate a much more rapid transmission.\"\n Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shot down an item included in the January 3 task force state reports that suggested there was a homegrown \"USA variant\" of coronavirus, a misperception that began on a call with governors, an administration official told CNN.\n But the official made it very clear US health officials have not determined that a US variant of the virus exists. There has been discussion about whether US health officials should investigate whether such a variant exists and make that identification but, so far, the official cautioned no such identification has occurred.\n After the holiday season and unstable data reporting, the reports said that the US is now seeing \"clear continuation of the pre-holiday high rate of spread as measured by rising test positivity, increased cases, increased hospitalization rates, and rising fatalities.\"\n There is \"full resurgence\" of viral spread in \"nearly all metro areas,\" the reports said, calling for \"aggressive action.\" The task force outlined measures including the use of masks that are \"two or three ply and well-fitting,\" \"strict physical distancing\" and more proactive testing of young adults.\n This week's reports raised concerns about \"significant, continued deterioration from California across the Sunbelt and up into the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast\" -- essentially, the entire continental US.\n And as the nation lags in administering vaccinations, the task force emphasized the need to \"put (vaccines) in arms now,\" noting that \"active and aggressive immunization in the face of this surge would save lives.\"\n Rhode Island is the state with the most new cases per 100,000 population this week, followed by Arizona, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Utah, California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Arkansas and North Carolina in the top 10.\n Oklahoma has the highest test positivity rate this week, over 25.1%, followed by Utah, Nevada, Virginia, Arizona, Idaho, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Texas, all of which have test positivity rates between 20.1% and 25.0%.\n Arizona has the highest number of admissions per 100 available inpatient hospital beds, followed by Arkansas, Maryland, Georgia, Oklahoma, California, South Carolina, Kentucky, District of Columbia, and Alabama.\n And Rhode Island ranks highest in new deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Rhode Island, Arizona, West Virginia, Tennessee, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Kansas, Connecticut and Michigan.",

        "body_text": "National Guard members supporting US Capitol security in Washington, DC, ahead of Inauguration Day will be armed, the Department of Defense announced Tuesday.\n The decision comes as law enforcement in the nation's capital and around the country brace for more extremist violence after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol last week. The first wave of National Guard troops who arrived at the Capitol were unarmed, and the Army has been reviewing whether National Guardsmen should be armed for the inauguration with lethal or nonlethal weapons.\n Capt. Chelsi Johnson, spokesperson for the DC National Guard, said in a statement to CNN that the move was requested by federal authorities and authorized by Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy.\n \"National Guard members are postured to meet the requirements of the supported civil authorities, up to and including protective equipment and being armed if necessary,\" Johnson said.\n The National Guard has planned to have up to 15,000 National Guard troops to meet current and future requests for the inauguration, Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Monday.\n The New York Times first reported the Pentagon's decision to arm National Guard troops deploying to Washington for security ahead of the inauguration.\n The US Army is working with the Secret Service to determine if there are soldiers who will be part of the National Guard contingent providing security at Biden's inauguration who require additional background screening, CNN previously reported.\n The DC National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in Washington to stress that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command, an Army spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN.\n \"There is no place for extremism in the military and we will investigate each report individually and take appropriate action,\" the spokesperson said.\n \"The Army is committed to working closely with the F.B.I. as they identify people who participated in the violent attack on the Capitol to determine if the individuals have any connection to the Army,\" the statement said while adding that any type of activity that \"involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace,\" may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state and federal law.\n Current Defense Department policy requires all service members be trained annually under a program that requires department personnel to report \"any information regarding known or suspected extremist behavior that could be a threat to the department or the United States,\" the statement said.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed",

        "title": "Americans already hurt by the pandemic are paying more in bank fees",
        "body_text": "People who have taken a financial hit during the pandemic are paying four times more per month in bank fees than those who have not, according to a new report from Bankrate.com.\n The majority of people, 72%, don't pay any bank fees at all, but those who do tend to be those who can least afford it, the report found. Overall, the average US checking account holder reports paying less than $8 in fees, including service charges, ATM fees and overdraft penalties a month.\n However, households that have suffered a setback in income during the pandemic -- whether it be job loss or cut hours -- pay a monthly average of more than $11 a month in checking account fees. Meanwhile, account holders who say their household income has not been hurt by the pandemic report paying an average of less than $3 per month.\n \"Those whose personal finances have been adversely affected by the pandemic have been hit with a double whammy of higher banking fees,\" said Bankrate.com senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick. \"Unemployment or loss of income can be devastating, but one should try to avoid adding financial insult to injury by paying too much in banking fees when so many less expensive options abound.\"\n Those already disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, in particular people of color, are also paying higher bank fees.\n While White checking account holders report paying $5 per month in fees, Blacks and Hispanics pay more than twice that amount, at $12 and $14 per month, respectively. White checking account holders are also much more likely to say that they pay nothing in monthly fees, with 79% paying zero monthly for checking while only 56% of Blacks and 50% of Hispanics pay nothing per month.\n Younger people pay more for their checking accounts than older people. Millennial checking account holders, people who are between 24 and 39 years old, report paying $15 per month in fees. Gen Xers -- aged 40 to 55 -- pay $6 a month, while Baby Boomers, ages 56 and 74, pay just $2 a month.\n The average monthly fee for interest checking accounts is $15.50 and the balance requirement to avoid paying a fee is $7,550, according to a separate report from Bankrate.com. Both are at record highs, despite historically low yields.\n The average overdraft fee hit a record of $33.47, while the average total cost of using out-of-network ATMs fell slightly to $4.64, the report found.\n More people have turned to mobile banking in 2020, with 64% reporting that they have adjusted their payment practices to using online methods more frequently as a direct result of the pandemic.\n \"Many consumers are playing it smart by, in effect, engaging in social distancing with their banking and payments technologies,\" Hamrick added. \"Once we've emerged from the pandemic and the economic downturn, it will still be wise to take advantage of newer mobile banking technologies not only to save time, but to help stay on top of account balances and fees as well as potentially costly overdrafts and fraud.\"\n The report found that the average account holder has been with their institution for more than 14 years. There are now more options to explore when banking, with many regional banks, online banks and credit unions as well as big banks offering checking accounts with low or no fees.",

        "title": "Biden to nominate ex-UN Ambassador Samantha Power to lead US humanitarian aid agency",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate former US diplomat and longtime human rights advocate Samantha Power to lead the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the nation's primary agency overseeing global US humanitarian aid.\n The Biden transition team also announced that the USAID administrator position will be elevated as a member of the National Security Council.\n Power was US Ambassador to the United Nations during former President Barack Obama's second term in office. She was confirmed to the role in 2013 with a 87-10 vote to succeed Susan Rice, who became Obama's national security adviser.\n As the US envoy to the UN, she memorably delivered a scathing rebuke against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies for the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, helped the UN battle Ebola and pushed the Obama administration's advocacy for global LGBTQ rights. She helped hold the first-ever UN Security Council session focused on an LGBTQ issue and create a UN Human Rights Council watchdog to prevent violence and discrimination for gay and transgender people.\n Before she was named US ambassador, she served on Obama's National Security Council as a senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights and a former special assistant to the president. Power was reportedly among those who urged Obama and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to militarily intervene in Libya in 2011.\n Power won a Pulitzer Prize for her book, \"A Problem from Hell: America in the Age of Genocide,\" in which she criticized the global failure to respond to genocides, and was a war correspondent in Bosnia in the 90s.\n In his statement Wednesday, Biden lauded Power as a \"world-renowned voice of conscience and moral clarity.\"\n \"I know firsthand the unparalleled knowledge and tireless commitment to principled American engagement she brings to the table, and her expertise and perspective will be essential as our country reasserts its role as a leader on the world stage,\" the President-elect added.\n In a video released later Wednesday by the Biden presidential transition team, Power said that throughout her career she has witnessed what USAID \"does on the ground for vulnerable people. \"\n \"I have seen the partnerships that that they have forged with other countries who are pursuing economic development. I have seen the ingenuity, the determination, the curiosity and the humanity of USAID staff, and I couldn't be more excited to work with them,\" she said.\n The USAID administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role. If confirmed, Power will take over leadership of the agency from controversial Trump appointee John Barsa, who in May pushed for the UN to remove abortion as an \"essential service\" from its humanitarian response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n Under the Trump administration, the agency had a number of controversial political appointees join its ranks and repeatedly faced the threat of proposed budget cuts, which Congress rejected.\n Biden has chosen several historic nominees for Cabinet positions and other top roles, including many who have decades of experience in their field or have served in Obama's administration and have familiarity with working with Biden.\n On Wednesday, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also announced additional staff appointments for their National Security Council, restoring two positions eliminated from the NSC during the Trump administration and creating a new cyber advisory role. These positions will not require Senate confirmation.\n Former Obama officials Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Russ Travers will serve as Biden's homeland security adviser and deputy homeland security adviser, respectively.\n Sherwood-Randall has longtime ties to Biden, having first worked for him in the Senate decades ago as an adviser for foreign and defense policy. She later served in several positions in the Obama administration, including deputy secretary of energy and senior director for European affairs at the NSC.\n Travers was a decades-long career counterterrorism official and the former acting director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center under the Trump administration. Travers was reportedly pushed into retirement in March by the Trump administration after resisting pressure to make personnel cuts, according to the Washington Post.\n Anne Neuberger, the National Security Agency's director of cybersecurity, will take on the new position of NSC deputy national security adviser on cyber and emerging technology -- a sign that the Biden administration will prioritize cybersecurity in the wake of a massive data breach of government agencies.\n The New York Times was first to report on Sherwood-Randall's appointment while Politico first reported Neuberger's new role.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Nicole Gaouette and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Investors bet on a rapid vaccine rollout. That's now at risk ",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nFaith in massive Covid-19 vaccination efforts has been a key reason stocks have kicked off 2021 by notching a string of record highs.\n But early evidence shows that the vaccination drive in many countries is stumbling out of the gate, posing a risk to market expectations that the economy \u2014 and therefore corporate earnings \u2014 can rebound strongly after the first three months of the year.\n What's happening: In the United States and across Europe, the rollout has been slower and bumpier than expected.\n US officials have struggled to explain why just 9 million people have received the first shot of their coronavirus vaccine when three times that number of doses have been distributed. They had promised 20 million people would be inoculated by the end of 2020.\n Many of Europe's biggest economies are also struggling to get shots in arms. While the United Kingdom, which is in crisis thanks to the emergence of a more contagious Covid-19 variant, has administered nearly 2.5 million shots, Italy, Germany and Spain have each vaccinated fewer than 1 million people.\n The situation in France is particularly dire. The country has administered vaccines to just 189,834 people, according to its health ministry.\n So far, investors don't seem to be alarmed by these numbers and remain assured that the recovery is still on track.\n \"The rollout of vaccines is off to a slow start, yet we believe once vaccination becomes widespread it will allow a more forceful restart due to the pent-up demand,\" analysts at the BlackRock Investment Institute told clients earlier this week.\n They advised \"[looking] through any market volatility triggered by evolving virus dynamics.\"\n There's certainly good reason to think that vaccination efforts will ramp up as those involved in distribution get more experience. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said Tuesday that he expects pacing will improve in the next few weeks.\n \"We're going to be seeing much more efficient administration of the vaccine, namely getting it into people's arms,\" Fauci said.\n But for now, Wall Street should be watching the data closely, given how central vaccination is to its forecasts.\n Watch this space: Distribution of vaccines in less developed countries also remains a huge question mark, complicating investor bets on strong rebounds in emerging markets.\n \"Though [the vaccine rollout] has given hope to the global recovery in the second half of the year, any positive effects will be felt predominantly in [developed markets],\" Simon Macadam of Capital Economics told clients Tuesday. \"This is because the vaccine rollout could be hindered in [emerging markets] by greater procurement and logistical issues.\"\n News that a leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, is also a concern. Vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have an efficacy rate of about 95%.\n Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil and 50 million doses to Turkey, as well as 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong.\n President-elect Joe Biden's reported pick to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission is a warning for Wall Street.\n The latest: News organizations including Reuters and the Wall Street Journal report that Biden will tap Gary Gensler to lead the agency. Gensler served as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission between 2009 and 2014.\n Among the major Obama-era regulators, Gensler was the most aggressive in implementing the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that Wall Street opposed. He also took on big banks for rigging Libor, a crucial benchmark for lending.\n Since the election, he's led the Biden transition team's review of financial industry oversight.\n \"Gary Gensler undoubtedly brings back some bad memories,\" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, said when he was tapped for the transition team in November.\n Though Gensler is a former Goldman Sachs banker, he's now viewed as a tough-on-Wall-Street ally of progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n \"As chair of the CFTC during the Obama administration, Gensler earned a reputation as an aggressive regulator following the financial crises, particularly in his pursuit of the Libor manipulation cases,\" said Paul Hastings partner Nicolas Morgan.\n What it means: If Gensler is confirmed, it could set up the SEC to move ahead on progressive priorities. This includes reversing Trump-era moves to limit shareholder proposals and requiring companies to issue more detailed disclosures on climate risks.\n The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a reckoning in the business world, forcing a rapid reassessment of political giving that has long been a norm.\n Remember: Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Facebook and Microsoft announced this week that they've suspended all political donations. Airbnb, Amazon, Verizon and CNN owner AT&T vowed not to give money to the 147 Republicans who tried unsuccessfully to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n But the real test will come when Democrats, who will soon control the US Senate, attempt to hike corporate tax rates and move to introduce new regulations, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan writes.\n Companies that have publicized taking a timeout may feel compelled to turn the spigots back on to influence major legislation that impacts their bottom lines. And that may include donating to some Republicans who objected to the Electoral College votes, but also oppose higher taxes and more red tape.\n Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments, predicts that Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, who led the Senate effort to overturn the election, will be \"pariahs for the rest of their careers.\" But in the long run, the party as a whole may not suffer, he said.\n \"Republicans for decades have been anti-tax and anti-regulation,\" Valliere said. \"Corporate America will be very reluctant to give money to Cruz and Hawley, but other Republicans who are not identified with this will do okay.\"\n Data on US consumer prices in December posts at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n Coming tomorrow: Earnings season kicks off in earnest with results from BlackRock and Delta Air Lines.",

        "body_text": "Taylor J. Swift (@Taylor_J_Swift) helps write the First Branch Forecast weekly newsletter that focuses on Congress and is a policy advisor for Demand Progress, a nonprofit group advocating for civil liberties, civil rights, and government reform.David B. Cohen (@POTUSProf) is a professor of political science and interim director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at The University of Akron.Robert Alexander (@onuprof) is a professor of political science and founding director of the Institute for Civics and Public Policy at Ohio Northern University. He is also the author of \"Representation and the Electoral College.\"  The views expressed in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion at CNN.\nJust as Covid-19 began wreaking havoc on the United States' public health, economy and election administration, we made the case that Congress should adopt procedures to carry on the business of the country through remote means if necessary.\n Doing so has become even more important and has taken on greater urgency due to the recent events at the Capitol.\n There have always been risks of working at the Capitol. Over the decades, the grounds regularly hosted protests, and bomb threats have been commonplace. But the siege by a pro-Trump mob on January 6 was unprecedented, preventing members of Congress from completing their constitutional duties and forcing lawmakers to flee for their safety while rioters roamed throughout the Capitol building.\n The events were jarring to witness and could have been much worse. Federal investigators are looking into whether there was a plan to hold people hostage, including members of Congress like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- whose name was being chanted by the mob -- or the vice president, since some yelled  \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n As harrowing as the attack was, it is clear that the threat to Congress of physical attack is not over. Twitter announced on January 8 that the platform had permanently suspended President Donald Trump's account, citing risk of further incitement of violence. The FBI has received information that other attacks may occur in the coming days or weeks, both at the US Capitol and state capitols.\n Despite clear warning signs, key bodies in charge of security failed to properly prepare for the possibility. This catastrophic failure in securing the Capitol complex has also telegraphed to the world -- including America's enemiesjus -- the stark reality that it remains unprepared for additional, more attacks. The warning lights about continuity have been flashing brightly for almost two decades. Simply put, there are no formal laws or procedures in place for Congress to hold remote deliberations or otherwise conduct its business if it becomes impossible for members to gather face-to-face in the Capitol or at another location.\n After the 9/11 attacks, Congress created a Continuity of Government Commission which issued three reports on the continuity of Congress, presidential succession, and the continuity of the Supreme Court.\n The commission held several hearings and reported out a constitutional amendment that sought to temporarily appoint members in both chambers of Congress to ensure quorum during an emergency.\n Unfortunately, none of the commission's recommendations were adopted, and Congress moved forward without any formal contingency plans.\n It is clear that the legislative branch of government is ill-equipped to continue its operations --mmuch less its role as a co-equal branch -- if lawmakers are unable to physically assemble. We witnessed this less than a year ago as Congress, and most of the country, shut down in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The failure of Congress to address this challenge since 9/11 has made our democracy more vulnerable and less resilient.\n Notably, the risks associated with Covid-19 were compounded by the riot. Three members of Congress have tested positive after sheltering with fellow members -- several of  whom refused to wear masks --during the siege. This has endangered their health and subsequently forced them into quarantine protocols.\n As soon as possible, both chambers must pass resolutions that allow for a \"virtual Congress,\" an idea that has been pushed by organizations and various lawmakers to deal with Covid-19. Last year, the House successfully implemented proxy voting, which enables members designated as proxies to cast votes on behalf of other members. While this was a step in the right direction, it still requires members who are casting votes to be physically present on the House floor. The Senate failed to alter its floor voting procedures but did alter the rules so committees could meet remotely.\n Both chambers proved that changing the rules for voting and committee deliberations are not only possible, but effective. A fully remote voting system would ensure the safety and security of lawmakers, staffers, and Capitol Hill workers in the event of a national security or public health threat. A House Administration Committee staff report already provided guidelines on the feasibility of implementing secure remote voting in the chamber.\n Congress has the capacity to guarantee continuity; it must simply choose to act. Covid-19 demonstrated the necessity to consider alternate ways for Congress to conduct its business, and the attack on the Capitol made clear how important it is that plans for a virtual Congress be implemented as soon as possible. Should the Capitol be the target of another terrorist attack -- foreign or domestic -- ensuring that Congress can continue to convene is a national security imperative. The country can ill-afford to wait any longer.",

        "title": "Australian company renames racially offensive cheese brand",
        "body_text": "An Australian food company has officially renamed a famous snack brand after years of complaints that it shared its name with a racial slur.\n \"Coon Cheese,\" which has been sold in Australia for more than 80 years, will now be known as \"Cheer Cheese,\" its manufacturer said Wednesday. The new brand will roll out to Australian supermarkets in July.\n Owner Saputo Dairy Australia bills itself as the country's largest dairy processor. It made the decision to rebrand its cheese line last summer, joining other major food companies that were forced to revisit the titles of some of their most well-known products.\n Several big brands, such as Quaker Oats' Aunt Jemima and Mars-owned Uncle Ben's, also announced last year they would change or retire branding that was considered racially offensive.\n In Australia, Nestl\u00e9 (NSRGF) has rebranded its Red Skins and Chicos sweets, saying that their names were out of step with the company's values. The candy is now sold under the names \"Red Ripper\" and \"Cheekies.\"\n For Saputo, \"Coon\" cheese had been the focus of criticism for decades. The company has insisted that the brand name paid homage to its founder, Edward William Coon. But the word is also a deeply insulting racial slur directed at people of color.\n The change came after more than two decades of campaigning by Indigenous activist Stephen Hagan, according to CNN affiliate 9News. Saputo called the decision an attempt to \"eliminate racism\" from its brand.\n The new name aims to align \"with current attitudes and perspectives,\" the company said in a statement Wednesday.\n \"Cheer Cheese is a cheese for everyone, and we trust our valued consumers and those who are new to our products will embrace this new name,\" Cam Bruce, the company's commercial director, said in the statement.\n \u2014 CNN's Amy Woodyatt contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The US Capitol attack fits into the history of White backlash",
        "body_text": "A pro-Trump mob in thrall to White supremacy and incited by President Donald Trump laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6. With their Confederate flags and zip ties in hand, rioters sought to overturn the legitimate election that President-elect Joe Biden won two months ago.\n Trump faces his second impeachment vote on Wednesday as a result of his role in the insurrection.\n On top of so much else, the election in November made clear the political might of Black voters, who saw the ballot box as a means of protesting against Trump and the racial animus that he and his acolytes embody.\n White backlash to racial equality -- including an empowered Black electorate -- isn't unusual. In fact, what makes the dynamic disturbing is how common it's been throughout US history. And the issue isn't just the backlash itself. It's also the fear (real or alleged) of backlash -- fear that might hold back progress.\n And while the attack on the Capitol was horrifying, it wasn't the first manifestation of White backlash. In important ways, this episode echoed the past.\n The years immediately following the end of the Civil War in 1865 saw the ratification of the three Reconstruction amendments. The 13th Amendment ended slavery; the 14th Amendment made it such that all people could be US citizens, regardless of race; and the 15th Amendment prohibited racial discrimination in voting.\n By the mid-1870s, though, the country had essentially abandoned its equal rights efforts, as Supreme Court decisions as well as Jim Crow laws and revanchist campaigns in the South eroded the civil, economic and political progress that Black Americans had gained.\n White backlash was also apparent during the struggle for Black freedom in the mid-20th century.\n As Black Americans fought to dismantle their country's abiding system of racial caste -- a battle that secured, among other things, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 -- many of their White counterparts assailed such actions as excessive.\n \"For many White backlashers in the 1960s, the era of what the historian C. Vann Woodward called the 'second Reconstruction,' the first Reconstruction remained a negative model,\" the Cornell University professor Lawrence Glickman wrote for The Atlantic last year. \"They viewed its reform as overly fast-paced, and felt that it foregrounded Black civil rights at the cost of White people's peace of mind.\"\n The rioters who violently took over the Capitol last week had a lot in common with their forebears, particularly in their expressions of White grievance and entitlement and in their zero-sum belief that sharing rights and resources isn't a gain for everyone but, instead, a loss that White Americans shouldn't have to endure.\n It was no coincidence that \"Stop the Steal\" was one of the mob's rallying cries. It referred to cities with high Black populations that broke for Biden and was said in support of Trump, whom the journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates in 2017 called the country's \"first White president.\"\n Crucially, while Trump's loss in November -- and more precisely, the outgoing President's false claims that a free and fair election was fraudulent -- was the most immediate catalyst of last week's iteration of White backlash, Trump didn't create the underlying racial resentment.\n \"It was White backlash, but the seeds were already there,\" Seyward Darby, the editor in chief of The Atavist Magazine and the author of the 2020 book \"Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism,\" told CNN.\n Last July, Darby warned of possible backlash to the reenergized Black Lives Matter protests.\n \"Once Trump is no longer President, I worry that people are going to attempt to move past this faster than they should, that they're going to say: Now back to some semblance of normalcy. But the unrest had been growing even before Trump,\" she added in a recent interview.\n The deadly assault on the Capitol has fit into the history of White backlash in another way, too: in how it has influenced -- or really, circumscribed -- conversations on what an \"acceptable\" path forward looks like.\n Consider that while some Republican lawmakers have called on Trump to resign over inciting the mob, others have asked Democrats not to pursue impeachment, fretting that such a move would be divisive and cause havoc.\n It's the sort of thinking that prizes reconciliation over justice.\n \"For some in power, the reason not to impeach isn't an argument based on politics or on justice but on the notion that if you want to stay out of trouble, then you shouldn't impeach. This sentiment is common,\" Glickman told CNN. \"In other words, White backlash can obstruct progress, but it's not always the backlash itself but the threat of backlash that impedes progress in US history.\"\n That said, Glickman detected something of a silver lining to the events of the past week.\n While the seizure of the Capitol demonstrated anew that White backlash can lead to a brutal end, Georgia's runoff elections on January 5 illustrated that it's possible to thwart weaponized racial grievance.\n In those races, voters elected Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff -- a Black man and a Jewish man -- to the US Senate. Their victories, propelled by Black organizers' efforts, evoked the poignant history of the civil rights movement.\n \"(Republican opponents) Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue tried very hard to make traditional backlash arguments the centerpieces of their campaigns, but it didn't work,\" Glickman said, referring to Republican attacks on Warnock, especially, as \"dangerous\" and \"radical.\"\n In this wider context, Democrats' recent political triumphs feel all the more significant.\n \"I think that it's important not to predict that we're fated to be controlled by White backlash,\" Glickman said. \"Because that doesn't give Americans enough credit for their own agency in determining our future.\"",

        "body_text": "Before suiting up as Marvel's Falcon again on Disney+, Anthony Mackie produces and stars in \"Outside the Wire,\" a futuristic action vehicle that thinks inside the box and feels as generic as its title. Netflix has found an eager audience for such adrenaline-rush movies -- perhaps especially with theaters hobbled -- but this is a wire-thin addition to the \"You might like\" tier.\n Set in 2036, the film uses shorthand to set up just about everything, as if racing past the plot to get to the automatic-weapons fire. (Although the project centers on a remarkably human-like android, the production design looks like it's from at best the day after tomorrow, but let's not sweat the details.)\n Said android -- a next-generation biotech prototype -- is Leo (Mackie), who has requested help from a drone pilot named Harp (\"Snowfall's\" Damson Idris) to thwart insurgents seeking nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe. The two head out into a perilous militarized zone on their mission, where the vaguely defined threat allows for a lot of violence that's part war movie, part espionage thriller.\n Harp, who is introduced getting in trouble for defying direct orders, seems understandably confused why he's been drafted for this James Bond-style exercise, but Leo assures him, \"I'm special enough for both of us.\" Still, other than revealing that he's different when his shirt comes off, nothing about Leo feels particularly artificial, superhuman or android-y.\n Yes, there's a lot of shooting and jumping and fighting, but other than the deployment of more conventional robot soldiers, those waiting for Leo to do something fantastic will likely come away disappointed -- Mackie basically plays him as a tough guy in a bad mood -- leaving behind pretty standard action material.\n The vibe is thus closer to a buddy action movie (the squabbling pairs are often somehow mismatched) than something like \"Robocop,\" which is what the description brings to mind. The ostensible villain and supporting cast -- including \"House of Cards'\" Michael Kelly as Harp's commander -- proves mostly an afterthought.\n Directed by Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m, \"Outside the Wire\" can charitably be compared to the kind of \"B\" movies that studios used to churn out, and is best consumed by tempering expectations accordingly. Because unlike its futuristic hero, there's nothing special about it.\n \"Outside the Wire\" premieres Jan. 15 on Netflix.",

        "body_text": "Congress has made the Paycheck Protection Program more flexible and given priority to the smallest, hardest-hit businesses, but the long-awaited second round of loans will still serve as little more than a stopgap as the pandemic rages on.\n Retail businesses like Georgie Lou's Retro Candy store in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, will likely receive the same amount of money they did in the spring -- which lasted Georgie Lou's only a few months, leaving owner Stephanie Patterson Gilbert to piece things together on her own ever since.\n \"It's helpful, but none of this is going to save a business at the end of the day,\" said Gilbert.\n Her revenue is down 75% compared with 2019, likely making 2020 her worst year since she first opened more than a decade ago. She's kept her business closed to walk-in customers throughout the pandemic and is taking orders online only.\n \"The only thing that's going to save small businesses is getting past Covid,\" Gilbert added.\n The first round of forgivable loans were disbursed between April and August. Lawmakers designed the Paycheck Protection Program to help small business owners stay afloat while some states and cities imposed shutdown restrictions to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n The program closed to new applications in August, even as coronavirus cases began to resurge. It had been extended after the initial rush for funding turned into an effort to find takers, in part because of the rules surrounding loan forgiveness.\n Local organizations in communities across the country attempted to help fill the gap over the past several months by soliciting donations. In Carlisle, a merchant group is raising money to buy gift cards from borough businesses, which are in turn donated to front-line workers or local charities.\n Several changes proposed by both Republicans and Democrats, including President-elect Joe Biden, made it into the final bill that passed in December, creating a program that targets those business owners most in need. Employers with more than 300 workers are excluded from the second round. Lawmakers also carved out $12 billion for minority-owned businesses. Restaurants and lodging businesses may now apply for bigger loans, equal to 3.5 times monthly payrolls.\n But for others, the sizes of the loans will remain the same, based on 2.5 times average monthly payroll expenses as they were before, even though it remains unlikely that the economy will be back to normal by the spring.\n Since the summer, revenue for small businesses has continued to fall. It's currently down 32% compared with a year ago, and the number of small businesses open and operating is down nearly 30%, according to Opportunity Insights, a project at Harvard University tracking the recovery.\n The lending program reopened to some lenders Monday, about three weeks after Congress passed the bill. During the first few days, only community financial institutions, which mostly work with very small and often minority-owned businesses, will be able to make loans.\n Other lenders will likely have to wait until next week, in an attempt to give mom-and-pop shops a leg up they didn't receive last time, when the system was overrun by large businesses at the start.\n \"It's not a silver bullet for smaller businesses. But they hopefully can get a bunch of their applications in before the system is overwhelmed,\" said Jeannine Jacokes, CEO of the Community Development Bankers Association.",

Respondents see the impact of low incomes and living in a rural community on a person's health, but race isn't viewed with the same gravity,\" Katherine Grace Carman, a senior economist at RAND Corporation and the lead author of the report said in a statement.\n Researchers noted that Black respondents (72.5%) are much more likely than White respondents, (33.2%) to believe that systemic racism affects the health of people of color.\n \"Our leaders need to understand that we have a lot more work to do to educate people about the root causes of inequities and then enact policies to ensure better health for all,\" Carman added.\n Medical professionals and public health leaders have previously said that racism, whether intentional or implicit, can help drive racial disparities in health.\n Last month, Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, chair of President-elect Joe Biden's Covid-19 equity task force, said that Covid-19 has exacerbated existing health disparities.\n \"It is time for us to respond to the crisis of discrimination in healthcare,\" Nunez-Smith said.\n Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Black, Latino and Native Americans have disproportionately been hospitalized and died from the virus.\n Several studies have previously suggested that experiences of racism or discrimination raise the risk of emotional and physical health problems, including depression, cardiovascular disease, hypertension -- more than 40% of Black adults have high blood pressure -- and even death.\n The RAND Corporation survey also shows more than 70% of respondents see the pandemic as a moment for positive change and they \"believe society should prioritize expanding access to health care and reducing income inequality.\"\n Nearly two-thirds of respondents also believe the government should ensure health care as a fundamental right, researchers said. White respondents are less likely (60.4%) than all other races and ethnicities (74.1%) to endorse that idea.",

        "title": "Life may get back to normal this year. But the economy probably won't",
        "body_text": "It's tempting to think now that 2020 is over, the economy will soon snap back to normal. But that's still far off: Americans aren't spending as much as they used to.  Millions remain unemployed. For an economy that runs on consumer spending, that's a huge issue.\n The recovery \u2014 and the return to public life \u2014 hinges on the coronavirus vaccine rollout. It could take much of 2021 for most Americans to get inoculated, however, and that means life won't change for many households any time soon as people who can continue to work from home and some schools remain shuttered.\n Those restrictions aimed at slowing the spread weigh heavily on consumer spending, which drives roughly two-thirds of the US economy. The reason is simple: if you mostly stay at home, you spend less money.\n For the overall economy, that likely means more sluggishness before the great return to normal that is hoped for after the vaccine has been sufficiently doled out.\n The Back-to-Normal index from CNN and Moody's Analytics has declined in recent weeks and now stands at 74%. It reached its peak at the low-80% level in October before rolling back.\n The weakened economic activity will continue through the first quarter of 2021, expects Simon MacAdam, senior global economist at Capital Economics.\n Even those who were lucky enough to stay employed through this crisis have mostly ramped up their savings rather than spend money, according to James Pomeroy and Henry Ward, economists at HSBC.\n More spending in addition to vaccinations could \"unlock a wave of reopening and a resurgence in services demand will be the key driver of the global economy in 2021,\" they said in a note to clients.\n It's a challenging situation: The American economy can't recover without the support of healthy consumer spending, but people can't spend all their cash in the midst of a jobs crisis.\n Millions of workers have lost their livelihoods in the pandemic, making them reliant on government help to make ends meet. And many others have seen their pay or hours cut.\n More than 19 million Americans received some form of federal benefits in the week ending December 19, according to the Department of Labor. That means that more than 19 million people cannot participate fully in the economy and certainly can't spend more money.\n Making matters worse, the jobs recovery has come to a standstill in December, after months of slowing down.\n The US registered a net 140,000 job losses last month, driven by steep declines in the hospitality industry as restaurants and bars are closing again to comply with virus-containing measures.\n Worse still, all of the jobs lost last month had been held by women.\n Although the jobless will receive some support through the recently signed second stimulus package, which extends pandemic-specific programs and adds $300 per week to state benefits, the crisis naturally weighs on consumer spending, which in turn slows the recovery.\n That's why it's so important for the incoming administration of to get a handle on the crisis in the labor market.\n President-elect Joe Biden has promised to create new jobs and help the unemployed with additional stimulus. But woes in Washington following the violence on Capitol Hill and the renewed effort to impeach President Donald Trump could incite more partisan disagreement rather than getting lawmakers on the same page about the economy.",

        "title": "Trump's turbulent and lawless presidency will end with historic second impeachment",
        "body_text": "The fateful moment when the House of Representatives on Wednesday impeaches President Donald Trump for a second time will rank among the defining moments of America's story long after the citizens enduring these harrowing, tragic days are gone.\n Fast-moving developments in the run-up to the vote have left Trump more politically vulnerable than he has ever been.\n At least a handful of House Republicans plan to vote with Democrats to impeach.\n In another startling sign that Trump's incitement of a mob assault on Congress has shattered rigid political alignments right at the end of his term, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he believes that impeachment will make it easier to rid the party of Trumpism.\n By the end of the day, Trump will be saddled with a stain he will never be able to erase, as the first President to be impeached twice after his refusal to admit his election defeat shattered assumptions on the unassailability of stable government and the previously unbroken chain of peaceful US transfers of power. Save for the fracturing of the union before the Civil War, this country's system of political checks and balances has never before been under the kind of strain imposed by an autocratic President desperate to cling to power.\n A sense of unfolding history is magnified by growing evidence that America is fighting for democracy itself in a struggle that will endure after Trump leaves office next week at the latest. New warnings of violence by pro-Trump extremists in 50 states and militias on the march toward Washington are instigating the most oppressive sense since 9/11 that the homeland is under threat. But this time the danger to US freedom comes not from a foreign terrorist group but radicalized Americans.\n The sole article of impeachment that the House is expected to pass Wednesday charging Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors is damning. Its simple clarity explains why this impeachment is no mere futile partisan ritual in the waning days of the most aberrant presidency in history.\n \"Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law,\" the article reads\n It is an extraordinary mark of turbulent times and a lawless term that Trump will become the first president to be impeached twice -- only 13 months after the House first resolved that his abuses of power merited removal from office.\n In a poetic twist, the vote will take place in the very same chamber that lawmakers fled a week ago in fear of their lives from an invading mob seeking to harm Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and to thwart the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden.\n In time, the events of this disorienting week will take their place alongside milestones -- including the Declaration of Independence, the abolition of slavery, Pearl Harbor and the assassination of President John Kennedy -- that make up America's sweeping narrative. But history is experienced in retrospect. Current events are lived forward in all their alarming intensity and are frightening because no one knows how they will end. And the country's nerves were already at a breaking point nearly a year into a once-in-a-century pandemic that has brought death and sickness and further deepened stark political divides.\n The formal impeachment vote in the House is far from the only barely believable twist leading up to Biden's inauguration in seven days.\n The horror of last week's events and their grave implications are becoming even clearer as more details emerge about the day when a sitting President incited partisans to assault another branch of government in the act of finalizing his election defeat.\n The idea that the rampage in which five people died was just a political outburst that got out of control was debunked Tuesday by the serious tone of a news conference held by the acting district attorney in Washington.\n \"I think people are going to be shocked with some of the egregious contact that happened within the Capitol,\" Michael Sherwin said, referencing \"mind-blowing\" cases and charges including sedition and conspiracy. He said that some of those charged had military backgrounds.\n One federal law enforcement official said the videos and other information viewed by investigators paint a scary picture of events inside the Capitol as police and federal agents battled to save lawmakers and staff.\n \"It was armed combat in that building,\" the official said.\n Some of the hardening of opinion among lawmakers against Trump may be attributed to briefings on those events and the pending threats to the inauguration.\n After emerging from an all-senators briefing on inauguration security, Sen. Chris Van Hollen raised the specter of a \"million militia march\" on Washington.\n \"We have no idea how many will come. We need to be prepared,\" the Maryland Democrat said.\n In another unfathomable moment on Tuesday, America's most senior military leaders warned there was no place for extremism in the ranks and that the troops must support and defend the Constitution. The statement was remarkable in itself. But that the Joint Chiefs decided it needed to be issued in the first place was one of the more frightening events of recent days.\n In a simultaneous political earthquake, McConnell, who tethered his now-destroyed Republican majority to the bucking bronco of Trump's presidency, made it known he was glad the President would be impeached.\n McConnell's unexpected move, first reported by The New York Times, came amid his disgust at the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters and in the belief that another impeachment would help Republicans purge the stain of this presidency from the party.\n McConnell didn't say how he would vote in a Senate trial. But his shift keeps open the long-shot chance that sufficient Republicans could join a two-thirds majority to secure the first-ever conviction in a presidential impeachment.\n In the House, Wyoming's Rep. Liz Cheney, a staunch conservative, announced that she would vote for Trump's impeachment, enshrining the split with her fellow members of the GOP House leadership.\n \"There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\" Cheney said.\n Two other Republicans, Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and John Katko of New York, also said they would vote to impeach, with a number of their GOP colleagues expected to follow suit in a vote that will echo through history, sources told CNN.\n In another development that exacerbated the feeling of history unspooling at a breakneck pace, Pence wrote to the House to formally refuse to join the Cabinet in invoking the 25th Amendment to declare Trump no longer able to fulfill the duties of his office.\n \"I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution,\" Pence wrote, after Democratic leaders had warned that an intervention by the vice president would be the only step that could hold off Wednesday's impeachment vote.\n Action inside the Capitol came as security forces poured into Washington to secure Biden's inauguration and Trump noticeably dodged an opportunity to cool tensions.\n While he said he never wants violence, the President used a trip to his border wall in Texas on Tuesday to reinforce the falsehoods and inflammatory language that ultimately led to his second impeachment.\n He branded the process \"a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics\" and warned it was \"causing tremendous anger\" and was \"dangerous\" for America at a \"very tender time.\"\n In more ominous comments, Trump said talk of using the 25th Amendment to oust him from office bore no peril for him but could come back to haunt Biden.\n \"Be careful what you wish for,\" the President warned.\n Trump also defended his remarks last week at a rally close to the White House that ended with his crowd marching on the Capitol.\n With only seven days left in office, the President's mind is also turning again to a controversial raft of pardons that would constitute yet another abuse of power.\n CNN's Jamie Gangel, Pamela Brown and Kara Scannell reported Tuesday that the President is continuing to discuss pardons for himself and his adult children. One source said such a move was considered even more likely since last week's events, although there was concern among some aides and allies about the public perception of pardons after the deaths of five people in the riot.\n Such a move by the President would be seen in the United States and around the world as yet another insult to democracy. The historic damage that Trump has already inflicted upon America's reputation in this regard is incalculable.\n But the stakes surrounding Wednesday's vote and what will be a prolonged struggle during the Biden administration to bolster US political institutions can be seen in remarks coming out of authoritarian Russia -- the American adversary that interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to help Trump.\n \"Following the events that unfolded after the presidential elections, it is meaningless to refer to America as the example of democracy,\" said Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian Parliament and a supporter of President Vladimir Putin.\n \"We are on the verge of reevaluating the standards that are being promoted by the United States of America, that is exporting its vision of democracy and political systems around the world. Those in our country who love to cite their example as leading will also have to reconsider their views.\"",

        "body_text": "Corporate America may be running away from President Donald Trump but at least one of his international business partners is standing by him.\n Hussain Sajwani, the chairman of property developer DAMAC, said he wants to expand his relationship with the Trump Organization despite the president's role in stoking a violent siege last week of the US Capitol. DAMAC is Trump's partner on an 18-hole golf course and club in Dubai, which opened in 2017.\n DAMAC is also building a second 18-hole golf course, the Trump World Golf Club, Dubai, the Trump Organization says on its website.\n \"We have a great relationship with the Trump Organisation and be assured, we have absolutely no intention to cancel our agreement,\" Sajwani said in a statement to CNN Business on Wednesday.\n Many companies are seeking to distance themselves from the president and his company following the insurrection on Capitol Hill. Deutsche Bank (DB) has ruled out doing more business with Trump, for example, and Signature Bank has started closing Trump's personal accounts. New York City is seeking to end the Trump Organization's contracts to operate the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, the Central Park Carousel and the Wollman and Lasker ice skating rinks.\n Social media platforms including Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB) have suspended the president's accounts, and the PGA has canceled plans to play its 2022 championship at Trump's Bedminster golf course.\n But Sajwani said DAMAC is interested in expanding its partnership with Trump.\n \"I will go further, as the [Trump] organisation will no longer be restricted to doing additional deals overseas in the future, I would welcome the opportunity of expanding our relationship with the brand and looking for more ways where we can collaborate,\" Sajwani said.\n The Dubai businessman has stood by Trump at difficult moments in the past, including during the backlash against his call to ban all Muslim travel to the United States.\n \"He had a strong brand \u2014 and no question in the last 12 months, his brand became stronger and more global. I think it will have a positive impact on sales,\" he told CNN in November 2016. \"He's in no way discriminative. He doesn't discriminate against sex, religion or anything else.\"\n Sajwani has been dubbed \"The Donald of Dubai\" and their families have a close relationship. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump jetted to Dubai to attend a wedding for Sajwani's daughter, Amira, in 2018.",

        "title": "Can America still promote democracy? Yes, and it should start with Ukraine",
        "body_text": "Michael Bociurkiw (@WorldAffairsPro) is a global affairs analyst and host of the podcast \"Global Impact.\" He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nLast week, as the smoke cleared from the shocking pro-Trump mob attack on the US Capitol, America's global reputation as a stable, strong democracy emerged badly damaged. Now, many are questioning whether it can ever regain the moral authority necessary to lead the world's democracies, fledgling or otherwise.\n From Beijing to Caracas to Moscow, governments, state-controlled media and online commentators reacted with schadenfreude, accusing Washington of hypocrisy and double standards.\n \"The United States lost all the rights to pursue the democratic path and lost their rights to impose it on other countries,\" said an anchor on the state-owned Russia 24 news channel.\n And in Beijing, Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the country's Foreign Ministry, took a swipe at US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, citing his comments from 2019 in support of pro-democracy protests-- a movement that eventually included the storming of the Hong Kong Legislative Council building. \"I hope he will open his eyes and see how the people in Hong Kong and the rest of China are leading perfectly happy lives,\" said Hua.\n The images of mobs attacking sacred institutions of government or coup attempts are familiar to people living in states ruled by dictators and autocrats. But overseas television viewers are certainly not accustomed to seeing such images beamed live from the capital of the world's chief guarantor of democracy, good governance and human rights.\n In fairness, even before the election of President Donald Trump, America's powers of persuasion were on the wane, with former President Barack Obama having allowed rogue leaders -- such as Bashar al-Assad of Syria (who used chemical weapons on innocent civilians) and Vladimir Putin of Russia (who invaded Crimea) -- to cross red lines, stated or implied, with a penalty of mere sanctions, the diplomatic equivalent these days of a slap on the wrist.\n But those foreign policy failures pale in comparison to the damage done by Trump in the four years that preceded last Wednesday's violence. The real estate mogul has often dressed down allies with the tone of an angry mafia boss, and he has either cheered on or turned a blind eye to the nefarious actions of our enemies -- neither of which has helped US global standing.\n Trump's administration has repeatedly attacked the rules-based multilateral system, on the basis that America has been shortchanged by unfair rules and a disproportionate burden of cost. In keeping with that sentiment, Trump's America has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO and other international bodies in which the US formerly took a leading role.\n So, after four years of Trump, the US stands weakened on every front, undoubtedly to the delight of all its adversaries and to the dismay of all its allies. Last Wednesday's violence added an exclamation point to the Trump era's message to the world: The US no longer lives by the values it has preached for decades.\n In his final days in office, there is no telling what Trump might do, as his legal protections are about to be lifted and legal jeopardy could arrive at his doorstep.\n But as for US foreign policy, once in office President-elect Joe Biden can move quickly down the list and cancel out the damaging foreign policies Trump has instituted, reversing the \"America first\" -- or, in some cases, \"Trump first\" -- attitude the current President has taken toward a host of global issues and hotspots.\n An early test of Biden's foreign policy savviness -- as well as his ability to turn the page from Trump's agenda -- could be in a country he handled as the point man for President Obama: Ukraine.\n The large European country of 44.3 million was drawn into a bruising US domestic fight that, in some ways, came to epitomize the anti-democratic excesses of the Trump era. It remains an important country in an important region for the US, sitting as it does on the dangerous fault line between Putin's Russia and US-allied Europe.\n Since Trump was impeached for attempting to lure Ukraine into opening an investigation that would tarnish the reputation of Biden, his domestic political rival, Ukraine has been in crisis. Almost two years since President Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide victory, the country has fallen into an alarming backslide, witnessing the erosion of the very reforms then-Vice President Biden pushed for as the Obama administration sought to transition Ukraine away from its dependence on Russia and toward EU-style governance standards.\n Traditionally, the US has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, and now more than ever, Ukraine needs American assistance -- military, political, and cultural -- to prevent it from slipping back into the Russian embrace, or worse, from becoming a failed state.\n Amid the world's myriad problems, the prospect of a failed Ukraine is a real danger to the US-led Western alliance. Giving up on Ukraine would almost certainly bring the frontline with Russia farther westward, and that is a scenario which should shake up Americans of all political stripes.\n If Biden is to exorcise the demons of Trump's foreign policies and anti-democratic behavior, the culmination of which we all witnessed on January 6, Ukraine would be an appropriate place to start.\n Aside from boosting America's global credibility, there's another Trump-era trend that Biden should seek to reverse: American policies that benefit Putin.\n As the attack on the US Capitol took place, it is not hard to imagine Putin looking on with glee. And it came after four years of Trump seeming to fulfill Putin's wish list, from publicly casting doubt on Putin's meddling in the 2016 US election (which was aimed at sweeping Trump into power), weakening NATO and perpetually attacking the US media to discrediting the American electoral process.\n And it has been alleged by some that Russia's boldest move to date against the US during the Trump years was a massive cyberattack in December, which some have suspected emanated from Russia; that alleged action passed without any serious rebuke from the White House.\n Even on Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, Trump has contradicted US policy. Instead of insisting the peninsula is part of Ukraine's territory, he has instead embraced a Kremlin talking point that \"the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\" He stunned foreign policy observers last June in a joint V-E Day statement.\n What Trump did in a mere four years to advance Putin's objectives must have exceeded the Russian President's wildest dreams.\n In some ways, rivalry with Russia has been the US foreign policy story of the last four years.\n The relationship deteriorated into open enmity with Putin's 2014 incursion into Crimea, and it came to dominate American domestic politics after Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election and during the yearslong Mueller investigation, the infamous Trump-Zelensky phone call and the impeachment saga that followed.\n If Biden wants to return to the source of all those ills, Ukraine is the place to start.\n Here's what needs to be done.\n First, an Oval Office meeting, long sought-after by Zelensky but blocked by Trump, should occur in Biden's first 100 days -- providing the Covid-19 situation allows it -- and only if Ukraine can show concrete progress on reintroducing reforms.\n Aside from providing a \"good housekeeping\" seal, such a meeting would send an unambiguous signal to Putin that the US has Ukraine's back. After Trump gave Putin a free pass to do almost whatever he wants, Biden needs to send a clear signal to the Kremlin that further adventurism and meddling will not be tolerated.\n US diplomatic heft should be deployed to accelerate the stalled peace process in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has become one of the bloodiest in Europe. To that end, Biden could appoint an experienced career diplomat as ambassador; the embassy in Kiev has been without one since May 2019.\n Biden could go further by naming a special envoy for the troubled region, to handle Ukraine but with the added mandate of bolstering the pro-democracy movement in Belarus and lending support to the newly elected, pro-Western government of Maia Sandu in Moldova. What better way to reassert US influence in the region than by reasserting the US commitment to fostering democracy there?\n Over the years, I have seen American muscle flexed in many regions of the world: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expertise at work to eradicate measles in Central and South America and polio in Pakistan, the heavy-lift capacity the US military employed to rescue victims of a volcanic eruption in the Philippines and the poisonous rhetoric of dictators being beaten back on the airwaves via the US-supported Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n The November election was anything but a mass repudiation of Trumpism and his America-first policies- - in a way, it is most notable that so many Americans chose Trumpism again after four years of it -- but I find it difficult to believe that the majority of Americans are prepared to see the US exit from the world stage.\n Biden needs to act quickly to salvage America's reputation overseas, lest the void be filled by other world leaders less interested in the promotion of values we hold so dear.\n Care to wager a guess as to which foreign leaders might want to seize on that vacuum?",

        "body_text": "The US has banned imports of cotton products and tomatoes produced in China's Xinjiang region over forced labor concerns, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said on Wednesday.\n The agency said the region-wide ban was \"based on information that reasonably indicates the use of detainee or prison labor and situations of forced labor,\" saying it had found examples of debt bondage, restriction of movement, isolation, intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive living and working conditions.\n The State Department estimates that more than 1 million Uyghurs, as well as members of other Muslim minority groups, have been detained in a sprawling network of internment camps in Xinjiang. Accounts of abuse at the camps are numerous.\n Beijing has denied accusations of mistreatment, and says it's providing vocational training and helping to deradicalize segments of the population to combat alleged Islamic terrorism and violence.\n \"CBP will not tolerate the Chinese government's exploitation of modern slavery to import goods into the United States below fair market value,\" the agency's Acting Commissioner Mark A. Morgan said in a statement.\n \"Imports made on the cheap by using forced labor hurt American businesses that respect human rights and also expose unsuspecting consumers to unethical purchases,\" he added.\n The ban will be effective at all US ports of entry.\n The Trump administration has previously issued import restrictions against companies it accuses of using forced labor in the region, including blocking cotton shipments from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a major cotton producer.\n Eighty-five percent of the cotton produced in China comes from Xinjiang, according to CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner Brenda Smith.\n In July, the US issued an advisory warning businesses about the risks of forced labor in Xinjiang, where the \"Chinese government continues to execute a campaign of repression targeting the Uyghur people and other ethnic and religious minority groups,\" CBP said.\n Several countries have condemned China's treatment of Uyghurs, but critics have urged the international community to purse a more aggressive regime of sanctions over the issue.\n The American move came into effect one day after the British government said it will fine companies which hide connections to the Xinjiang region.\n UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday announced the new measures, which the Foreign Office says are designed to ensure that British organizations \"are not complicit in, nor profiting from, the human rights violations in Xinjiang.\"\n The UK government will also review which British products can be exported to Xinjiang, and issue new guidance \"setting out the specific risks faced by companies with links to Xinjiang ... underlining the challenges of effective due diligence there.\"\n Reporting contributed by Radina Gigova and Geneva Sands.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 13 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nAgainst the backdrop of a mounting death toll, the Trump administration reversed course on its vaccine policy Tuesday, instructing states to begin vaccinating every American 65 and older and release reserved second doses in an effort to boost a sluggish rollout -- effectively adopting the approach proposed by President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration.\n \"This next phase reflects the urgency of the situation we face,\" Alex Azar, the health secretary, said Tuesday. \"Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse rather than going into an arm could mean one more life lost or one more hospital bed occupied.\"\n Opening up vaccinations to those 65 and older, as well the most vulnerable people under 65, could help in areas where there have been more doses than people eligible or willing to receive them -- in some cases leading to extra doses expiring and being tossed away. And releasing reserved second doses could benefit areas where there has not been enough vaccine for everyone eligible and willing.\n Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines require two rounds of injection, and while releasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up availability, it also runs the risk of depleting resources that are necessary to make sure people are fully vaccinated.\n During Tuesday's news briefing, Azar said that second doses would still be available to those who need them. But the announcement came with a warning: States will lose allocations if they don't use them. In two weeks, states' vaccine allocations will be based on the pace of administration and the size of the 65 and over population.\n Local health officials told CNN Tuesday that the changes to the rollout policy may be too little too late. City and county health departments say they're already running at a deficit and will continue to struggle to get vaccines out to people.\n \"The release of all of the second doses and removing that hold back is not necessarily seen as a solution to getting the vaccine out faster. We have existing issues still -- logistical issues -- with how to plan and staff this mass vaccination effort,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN.\n More than 9 million Americans have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and more than 27 million doses have been distributed, the CDC said Tuesday.\n Some states have acknowledged on-the-ground issues that delayed vaccinations, but many have said for months they need more federal funding to execute complex rollout plans. States that have seen success so far have set up significant infrastructure -- like stadiums -- to administer vaccines.\n Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19? Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415.\n The CDC said Tuesday it will require a negative Covid-19 test from all air passengers entering the US. Without proof, passengers will not be allowed to board.\n Air passengers will be required to get a viral test within three days before their flight to the US departs, and to provide written documentation of their lab results, or documentation of having recovered from Covid-19, the agency said in a statement to CNN.\n \"Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continue to emerge in countries around the world, and there is evidence of increased transmissibility of some of these variants,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"With the US already in surge status, the testing requirement for air passengers will help slow the spread of the virus as we work to vaccinate the American public.\"\n A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech was just 50.4% effective at preventing infections in a Brazilian trial, the government of S\u00e3o Paulo said Tuesday, significantly lower than earlier results showed and barely enough for regulatory approval.\n The efficacy rate of Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine in Brazil -- the lowest among its global competitors -- is a big blow for China. Analysts said it could affect international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines and hamper Beijing's effort to repair its image from its early mishandling of the initial outbreak by providing Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries. It's also a blow for nations who secured doses of the shot.\n While the results meet the World Health Organization's 50% threshold for approval, they fall far short of the partial data released by Butantan biomedical center last week, which suggested that the vaccine might have much higher efficacy: 78% to 100%. Confusion over the results has raised questions about the veracity of the data and fueled skepticism about the Chinese vaccine in Brazil, which President Jair Bolsonaro has criticized.\n British authorities are considering putting Covid patients in hotels as a \"backup plan,\" as surging cases in the United Kingdom risk overwhelming the National Health Service (NHS). Health secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC that hotels could help alleviate mounting pressure on the NHS and provide an option for patients \"who no longer need the full hospital treatment but aren't quite ready to go home.\"\n The news comes amid concerns that the spiraling crisis in the UK is placing an undue burden on the mental health of NHS staff, who were already overstretched before the pandemic began after a decade of austerity measures. According to a study published Wednesday in the journal Occupational Medicine, an online survey of staff working in several intensive care units in England during the pandemic found nearly half reported symptoms of severe anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, with more than one in seven reporting repeated ideas of self-harming or suicidal thoughts in the previous two weeks. The research was carried out in June and July, before the latest surge of infections.\n Scientists fear an \"escape mutant\" identified in the coronavirus variant first spotted in South Africa might decrease vaccine efficacy. Meanwhile, the variant first discovered in the UK has now been found in at least 50 countries.AstraZeneca's vaccine may be authorized in the US \"towards the latter part\" of March; it has already been authorized in Britain.Europe is continuing to ramp up coronavirus restrictions. Italy will extend its Covid-19 state of emergency until the end of April. In Germany, high-protection \"FFP2\" masks have been made mandatory for public transport and shopping by the Bavarian state government.Armenia's president is in hospital with severe Covid-19 after visiting his family in London over the Christmas holiday, his assistant tells CNN.China recorded its highest daily increase in Covid-19 cases in more than five months on Tuesday, following a recent cluster of infections in the northern Hebei province.The tourists who say travel restrictions don't apply to them are facing punishment.\n On December 18, a San Diego emergency room nurse was given a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine. A week later, he tested positive for the virus, CNN affiliate KGTV reported.\n Stories like this will become more common as millions of Americans are administered the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines over the coming months. The efficacy of both vaccines is around 95% -- not 100% -- meaning some people will still get infected with the coronavirus.\n Eric Levenson explains why, and what you can do to stay safe.\n \"We are being put in these untenable situations where we have so many more patients than we can take care of, where we have so many fewer resources than we need to take care of them.\" -- Dr. Megan Ranney, emergency physician",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 14 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\nIt took more than 200 years for America to rack up its first two presidential impeachments. Now the most lawless commander in chief ever is leading the country toward its second presidential impeachment in just 13 months.\n Sometime on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives will vote to hand Donald Trump the dubious historical distinction of first US President to be impeached twice. The charge that he committed a constitutional transgression of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" is simple and damning, and will pass one week after he incited a violent insurrection at the Capitol.\n \"Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law,\" the Article of Impeachment reads. \"Donald John Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\"\n Trump still has a hold on the Republican Party's fervent grassroots supporters, so conventional wisdom suggests he need not worry about being convicted in a Senate trial, which requires a two-thirds majority. But the political winds may be shifting. In a stunning move, Mitch McConnell \u2014 the hardline Senate majority leader who enabled Trump's wrecking ball presidency \u2014 has made it known that he is glad Trump will be impeached. Some Republican senators might see that as a signal to vote freely to convict, though viral footage of frenzied MAGA supporters haranguing GOP lawmakers at airports reflects the risk of such a decision.\n There is a palpable sense of history unfolding behind the high iron fences now ringing the Capitol in eloquent witness to a democracy under siege. But as the last week's unprecedented events show, no one knows how America's internal battle will end.\n The heads of each US military branch on Tuesday issued a joint statement condemning last week's insurrection and reminding service members of their duty. \"We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection. As Service Members, we must embody the embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law,\" it said. Read the whole statement here.\n The Republican Party's dilemma on how or whether to defend Trump is tearing it in two.\n House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy says Trump bore some responsibility for the riot but is staying loyal. His number three, Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of the former vice president, says she will vote to impeach Trump in a \"vote of conscience.\" In the Senate, Trump's co-conspirators in trashing a fair election, like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, are playing to his base as they eye future career moves. Holdouts like Sens. Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska say they're disgusted with such craven pandering in their party.\n Some conservatives hope that Trump fever will pass once he's out of office. But the radical pro-Trump fringe is not going anywhere, and punishing the President may not be good politics: A Quinnipiac University poll shows that only 17% of Republican voters think Trump deserves blame for last week's riot.\n In one hint of the party's future, one of the most visible figures in Washington this week has been Marjorie Taylor Greene, a new House member from Georgia who previously embraced QAnon conspiracies. When news broke that major companies unsettled by the riot had halted donations to the GOP \u2014 a potentially crippling blow in a system awash in corporate lobbying cash \u2014 Greene tweeted: \"I work for the people, not the communists.\"\n House Republican leaders must find a new path that appeases the President's supporters but doesn't scare less radical suburban voters, who are key to retaining a shot at winning back the chamber in 2022. But Trumpism is a hard drug to quit. \"Count me out,\" swore the President's loyal Senate golf buddy Lindsey Graham last week after the violence in Washington. Yet who was that hitching a ride on Air Force One on Wednesday, as Trump went to admire his border wall?\n Concern is growing among law enforcement agencies that rioters' success in breaching the Capitol has emboldened more potentially violent actors, report CNN's Evan Perez and Shimon Prokupecz. \"The chatter is off the charts right now,\" one federal law enforcement official said. But investigations into the planning of potential attacks in all 50 states are extra complicated by First Amendment protections of political speech.",

        "title": "Pinduoduo under fire as China turns on its tech titans",
        "body_text": "One of China's most prominent e-commerce companies is facing intense public backlash over allegations that it overworks its employees. It's a sign that scrutiny of the country's tech champions is broadening, and could become even more intense.\n Pinduoduo (PDD) \u2014 the country's third largest e-commerce firm after Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) \u2014 became a target of public outrage after two of its employees unexpectedly died during the holiday season.\n First, a worker in her twenties collapsed in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang region, while walking home with colleagues during the early hours of Dec. 29. The company confirmed her death, but did not disclose the cause.\n \"We feel profound sadness that we lost one of our employees to suicide,\" the company said in the statement. \"We are doing everything we can to support his family and loved ones during this difficult time.\"\n Chinese social media users had already started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture at Pinduoduo when a former software engineer at the company catapulted awareness of the problem to new highs.\n In a 15-minute video published Sunday on Weibo that garnered millions of likes and thousands of comments, the user Wang Taixu claimed that Pinduoduo fired him after he posted a photo he said showed an ambulance taking away another company employee.  (Wang is his surname, and he goes by the nickname \"Taixu\" on Weibo and used that name during his time at Pinduoduo.)\n In additional posts on Weibo and other Chinese social media platforms, Wang accused the company of forcing workers at its Shanghai headquarters to work in excess of 300 hours per month, and not providing enough toilets for its employees.\n \"I don't think the world should work this way,\" Wang said in the video. He described Pinduoduo as a company that \"forces the smartest people in the country to work\" long hours, and expressed his disappointment that the stock has been trading at record levels on Wall Street despite the recent controversies.\n Pinduoduo denied that Wang was fired because of the photo he posted, telling CNN Business that his termination was due to \"extreme comments\" he made on social media with \"notable ill intentions,\" in violation of the company's rules.\n The company didn't respond to questions about the allegations made against its work culture. It did say, however, that it has set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of its worker last week.\n The firestorm surrounding Pinduoduo has reignited a long-running debate in China about the tech industry's controversial \"996\" work culture \u2014 a term referring to the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week that is said to be common among the country's big technology companies and startups.\n Public backlash against the practice isn't new. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, for example, was heavily criticized in China two years ago after he called 996 culture a \"huge blessing.\"\n But this latest fallout comes at a precarious time for China's tech titans, which are facing intense regulatory scrutiny, including accusations that some of them are putting profits above their customers and crowding out competition. Ma himself hasn't been seen in public for months as Alibaba faces an antitrust investigation and its financial affiliate, Ant Group, has been ordered to overhaul its operations.\n Chinese state media has picked up on the recent controversies, further suggesting that the government is willing to stoke criticism of these tech companies. (Such outlets are a powerful tool in the country's propaganda machine, and they are often looked upon as barometers of sentiment among senior officials.)\n \"People are concerned about the matter [the sudden death of the Pinduoduo employee] because they feel the pain of abnormal overtime work culture,\" read an unbylined commentary piece published on Weibo last week by the state-owned Xinhua News Agency. The article added that workers' rights and interests must be strengthened.\n Xinhua interviewed Wang, the former Pinduoduo worker, on Tuesday. He told the publication that while his remarks were drastic, he did not regret publishing his photo.\n \"It is the Chinese government which allowed Wang Taixu's video to be so widely circulated and generate such heated discussions,\" said Jack Qiu Linchuan, professor of communications at the National University of Singapore and an expert on Chinese labor issues. \"One of the fundamental reasons for the huge public backlash is that the government did not censor it, despite having the full ability to do so.\"\n Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital who is based in Hong Kong, also said the recent backlash against the 996 culture appeared to carry \"political overtones.\"\n \"Beijing is busily trying to assert new levels of control upon tech giants and their massively wealthy leaders. Recent worker tragedies at Pinduoduo have provided those authorities with another potential arrow in their quiver,\" Silvers said.\n He added, though, that the environment for workers might not change much, even after the tech sector \"regains a regulator equilibrium.\"\n \"Ambitious workers looking for better lives will likely still be toiling under the influence of 996,\" Silvers said.\n To get help, call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

        "body_text": "A rioter who stormed the US Capitol last week wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the phrase \"Camp Auschwitz\" was arrested Wednesday morning in Virginia, according to a law enforcement official.\n CNN was first to report that the man in the sweatshirt was identified as Robert Keith Packer of Virginia. A law enforcement official told CNN that Packer was picked up in Newport News, Virginia.\n An image of Packer inside the Capitol, whose sweatshirt bore the name of the Nazi concentration camp where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II, has evoked shock and disbelief on social media. The bottom of his shirt stated, \"Work brings freedom,\" which is the rough translation of the phrase \"Arbeit\u202fmacht frei\" that was on the concentration camp's gates.\n Packer has a criminal history including three convictions for driving under the influence and a felony conviction for forging public records, according to Virginia court records. He was charged in 2016 for allegedly trespassing. The case was later dismissed.\n Packer was among the mob of President Donald Trump's supporters who unlawfully broke into the US Capitol building on January 6 as Congress was in the process of counting the Electoral College votes and certifying President-elect Joe Biden's win.\n Wrongly convinced the election was stolen from Trump, the rioters fought with police officers and attacked members of the media, smashed windows, vandalized and ransacked offices, and stole federal property.\n Five people -- including US Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick -- have died, and many more were injured, as a result of the insurrection. One woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police as the crowd breached the building and three others suffered medical emergencies that proved fatal.\n Washington, DC, police made 61 arrests that day while many more have been arrested in the days since then, with at least 20 facing federal charges.\n On Tuesday, the Justice Department said it has charged over 70 cases and opened more than 170 case files \u2014 \"with the numbers expected to grow into the hundreds\" \u2014 in its federal investigation.\n This story has been updated with additional background information.\n CNN's Curt Devine, Scott Bronstein, Drew Griffin, Paul Murphy and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

        "title": "New York City moves to end contracts with the Trump Organization",
        "body_text": "New York City is seeking to terminate its business relationships with the Trump Organization in response to last week's attack on the US Capitol.\n On the day President Donald Trump faces a second impeachment for his role inciting the rioters who ransacked the Capitol, officials in New York City announced plans to immediately end the Trump Organization's contracts to operate the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, the Central Park Carousel and the Wollman and Lasker ice skating rinks.\n \"The attacks on our Capitol killed a police officer, left four rioters dead, exposed lawmakers to Covid-19 and threatened the constitutional transfer of power,\" the city said in a  statement issued Wednesday morning. \"They were a national abomination. We're reviewing whether legal grounds exist in light of these new circumstances to terminate concessions with the Trump Organization.\"\n A number of private businesses have also announced they would no longer do business with the Trump organization because of the president's comments to supporters before the attack on the Capitol. They include two of his banks, Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank, credit card processor Stripe, which is no longer processing credit card payments for the Trump campaign, Shopify, which stopped operating online stores for both the Trump Organization and the campaign and the PGA of America, which announced it is pulling a major golf tournament from one of Trump's courses.\n On Wednesday, global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield (CWK) said it \"has made the decision to no longer do business with The Trump Organization,\" according to a company spokesperson.\n Over the years, Cushman has handled several office and retail properties for the Trump Organization including New York City's Trump Tower, Trump Plaza, the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.\n De Blasio said the city is on firm ground to terminate the contracts because of the president's conduct last week.\n \"Inciting an insurrection against the US government clearly constitutes criminal activity,\" de Blasio told MSNBC on Wednesday. \"The City of New York will no longer have anything to do with the Trump Organization.\"\n The Trump Organization vowed to fight the city's action.\n \"Yet another example of Mayor de Blasio's incompetence and blatant disregard for the facts,\" the company said in a statement. \"The City of New York has no legal right to end our contracts and if they elect to proceed they will owe The Trump Organization over $30 million. This is nothing more than political discrimination and we plan to fight it vigorously.\"\n The contracts for the four properties earned Trump $17.9 million in income in 2019 according to his most recent federal financial disclosure filing. The most lucrative is the contract for the ice skating rinks, which brought in a combined $9.4 million.\n The contracts give the city the right to terminate the agreements \"at will,\" and state that the decision to terminate is at the city's \"sole and absolute discretion.\" So de Blasio appears to have enough legal leverage to pull the plug. But the contracts also stipulate that the reason for termination cannot be \"arbitrary or capricious.\"\n Wollman Rink is the longest-running Trump Organization contract with the city and once served as a cornerstone of Trump's reputation as a businessman who could get things done. After several failed attempts by the city to rebuild and reopen the rink in the 1980's, Trump landed the contract to renovate and run the facility in 1986.\n His company's site says the renovation was completed for $2 million in four months, which it said was below budget and ahead of schedule.\n At the time he was only 40 years old and still making a name for himself. The revitalized rink opened a year before the publication of his book \"The Art of the Deal.\" It also came before a series of business bankruptcies starting in 1991 that tarnished his reputation, and well before his casting on the reality show \"The Apprentice,\" which made him an even bigger celebrity.",

        "body_text": "Dollar General wants its employees to get Covid-19 vaccines, so it's offering to pay them to do it.\n The chain said Wednesday that it will give its workers a one-time payment equivalent to four hours of pay after receiving a completed vaccination.\n \"We do not want our employees to have to choose between receiving a vaccine or coming to work,\" Dollar General (DG) said in a press release, noting that its hourly workers face hurdles to getting vaccinated, such as travel time, gas mileage or childcare needs.\n The company, which had 157,000 employees as of Oct. 30, called getting a vaccine a \"personal decision\" and said it wouldn't require it.\n Its announcement comes as the vaccine rollout is off to a slow start in the United States. More than 27.6 million vaccine doses have so far been distributed, according to CDC data, and more than 9.3 million people have received their first dose. Federal officials had said 20 million people would have received first doses by the end of December.\n Dollar General was deemed an essential retailer and has remained open throughout the pandemic. Most states are still only vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, according to Kaiser. Essential workers, such as retail and grocery store workers, are set to be vaccinated in later phases of the rollout, but their eligibility to receive the vaccine varies by states.\n Dollar General isn't the only employer to offer financial incentives to workers to get a Covid-19 vaccine. Houston Methodist, a Texas hospital system with more than 26,000 employees, will also offer a $500 bonus to workers if they get vaccinated.\n CNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this article.",

        "title": "Private practice doctors flag concerns on when they and their patients will receive Covid-19 vaccine",
        "body_text": "(KHN)Dr. Andrew Carroll \u2014 a family doctor in Chandler, Arizona \u2014 wants to help his patients get immunized against Covid-19, so he paid more than $4,000 to buy an ultra-low-temperature freezer from eBay needed to store the Pfizer vaccine.\n But he's not sure he'll get a chance to use it, given health officials have so far not said when private doctor's offices will get vaccine.\n \"I'm really angry,\" Carroll said.\n Not only are doctors having trouble getting vaccine for patients, but many of the community-based physicians and medical staff that aren't employed by hospitals or health systems also report mixed results in getting inoculated. Some have had their shots, yet others are still waiting, even though health workers providing direct care to patients are in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's top-priority group.\n Many of these doctors say they don't know when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will get doses for their patients, which will soon become a bigger issue as states attempt to vaccinate more people.\n \"The reason that's important is patients trust their doctors when it comes to the vaccine,\" said Carroll, who has complained on social media that his county hasn't yet released plans on how primary care doctors will be brought into the loop.\n Collectively, physicians in the county could vaccinate thousands of patients a day, he said, and might draw some who would otherwise be hesitant if they had to go to a large hospital, a fairground or another central site.\n His concern comes as, nationally, the rollout of the vaccine is off to a slower start than expected, lagging far behind the initial goal of giving 20 million doses before the new year.\n But Dr. Jen Brull, a family practice doctor in Plainville, Kansas, said her rural area has made good progress on the first phase of vaccinations, crediting close working relationships formed well before the pandemic.\n This fall, before any doses became available, the local hospital, the health department and physician offices coordinated a sign-up list for medical workers who wanted the vaccine. So, when their county, with a population of 5,000, got its first 70 doses, they were ready to go. Another 80 doses came a week later.\n \"We'll be able to vaccinate almost all the health care-associated folks who wanted it in the county\" Brull said recently.\n But that's not the case everywhere.\n Dr. Jason Goldman, an internist in Coral Springs, Florida, said he was able to get vaccinated at a local hospital that received the bulk of vaccines in his county and oversaw distribution.\n In the weeks since, however, he said several of his front-line staff members still \"don't have access to the vaccine.\"\n Additionally, \"a tremendous number\" of patients are calling his office because Florida has relaxed distribution guidelines to include anyone over age 65, Goldman said, asking when they can get the vaccine. He's applied to officials about distributing the vaccines through his practice but has heard nothing back.\n Patients \"are frustrated that they do not have clear answers and that I am not being given clear answers to provide them,\" he said. \"We have no choice but to direct them to the health department and some of the hospital systems.\"\n Another troubling point for Goldman, who served as a liaison between the American College of Physicians and the expert panel drawing up the CDC distribution guidelines, is the tremendous variation in how those recommendations are being implemented in the states.\n The CDC recommends several phases, with front-line health care workers and nursing home residents and staff in the initial group. Then, in the second part of that phase, come people over 75 and non-health care front-line workers, which could include first responders, teachers and other designated essential workers.\n States have the flexibility to design their own rollout schedule and priority groups. Florida, for example, is offering doses to anyone 65 and up. In some counties, older folks were told vaccines were available on a first-come, first-served basis, a move that has resulted in long lines.\n \"To say right now, 65-plus, when you haven't even appropriately vaccinated all the health care workers, is negating the phasing,\" said Goldman. \"There needs to be a national standard. We have those guidelines. We need to come up with some oversight.\"\n On Thursday, the American Hospital Association echoed that concern in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Hospitals \u2014 along with health departments and large pharmacy chains \u2014 are doing the bulk of the vaccinations.\n Calling for additional coordination by federal officials, the letter outlined what it would take to reach the goal of vaccinating 75% of Americans by the end of May: 1.8 million vaccinations every day. Noting there are 64 different rollout plans from states, cities and other jurisdictions, the letter asked whether HHS has \"assessed whether these plans, taken as a whole, are capable of achieving this level of vaccination?\"\n Lack of direct national support or strategy means each county is essentially on its own, with success or failure affected by available resources and the experience of local officials. Most state and local health departments are underfunded and are under intense pressure because of the surging pandemic.\n Still, the success of vaccination efforts depends on planning, preparation and clear communication.\n In Lorain County, Ohio, population 310,000, local officials started practicing in October, said Mark Adams, deputy health commissioner. They set up mass vaccination clinics for influenza to study what would be needed for a Covid-19 vaccination effort. How many staff? What would the traffic flow be like? Could patients be kept 6 feet apart?\n \"That gave us an idea of what is good, what is bad and what needs to change,\" said Adams, who has had previous experience coordinating mass vaccination efforts at a county level.\n So, when the county got its first shipment of 500 doses December 21, Adams had his plan ready. He called the fire chiefs to invite all emergency medical technicians and affiliated personnel to an ad hoc vaccination center set up at a large entertainment venue staffed by his health department. Upon arrival, people were greeted at the door and directed to spaced-apart \"lanes\" where they would get their shots, then to a monitoring area where they could wait for 15 minutes to make sure they didn't have a reaction.\n Right after Christmas, another 400 doses arrived \u2014 and the makeshift clinic opened again. This time, doses went to community-based physicians, dentists and other hands-on medical practitioners, 600 of whom had previously signed up. (Hospital workers and nursing home staff and residents are getting their vaccinations through their own institutions.)\n As they move into the next phase \u2014 recipients include residents over 80, people with developmental disorders and school staff \u2014 the challenges will grow, he said. The county plans a multipronged approach to notify people when it's their turn, including use of a website, the local media, churches, other organizations and word-of-mouth.\n Adams shares the concerns of medical providers nationwide: He gets only two days' notice of how many doses he's going to receive and, at the current pace of 400 or 500 doses a week, it's going to take a while before most residents in the county have a chance to get a shot, including the estimated 33,000 people 65 and older.\n With 10 nurses, his clinic can inject about 1,200 people a day. But many other health professionals have volunteered to administer the shots if he gets more doses.\n \"If I were to run three clinics, five days a week, I could do 15,000 vaccinations a week,\" Adams said. \"With all the volunteers, I could do almost six clinics, or 30,000 a week.\"\n Still, for those in the last public group, those age 18 and up without underlying medical conditions, \"it could be summer,\" Adams said.\n Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated Dr. Jason Goldman's specialty, city and liaison work. Goldman is an internist in Coral Springs, Fla., and served as a liaison between the American College of Physicians and the expert panel drawing up the CDC vaccine distribution guidelines.\n KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden's team is producing a celebrity-filled prime-time special for the night of his inauguration in lieu of the traditional celebrations, which have been significantly pared down due to the pandemic, a Presidential Inaugural Committee official confirms to CNN.\n The special, hosted by Tom Hanks, is set to air live on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. EST on January 20. It will feature performances from Jon Bon Jovi, who campaigned with Biden in Pennsylvania, Demi Lovato, Justin Timberlake and Ant Clemons.\n The 90-minute program, titled, \"Celebrating America,\" will also feature remarks from the President-elect and the Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and will celebrate \"American heroes\" like frontline workers, teachers and health care workers, among others.\n \"Our first priority is safety -- so while many of us will be watching safely from our homes, we are creating real moments of connection that highlight a new inclusive American era of leadership that works for and represents all Americans,\" said\u00a0PIC CEO Tony Allen.\n Politico was first to report the news of the special.\n The special comes as Biden's inaugural committee has urged Americans not to travel to Washington, DC, to partake in the inaugural festivities as part of efforts to keep crowds to a minimum amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\n It also comes as law enforcement in the nation's capital and around the country\u00a0brace for further extremist violence\u00a0during the transition of power, after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol building in a deadly riot last week. The Pentagon has authorized up to 15,000 National Guard troops to meet current and future requests for Biden's inauguration next week, and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has urged Americans to avoid the city.\n Much like the virtual program at the Democratic National Convention, which was forced to go online over the summer in efforts to keep the virus from spreading, the inauguration will feature virtual events across the country. After Biden and Harris are sworn in to office next Wednesday at a significantly scaled-down ceremony, there will be a virtual parade that features performances in communities across the country, the inaugural committee has said.\n The committee has brought on Stephanie Cutter and Ricky Kirshner as executive producers, and Rod O'Connor as a senior adviser for the virtual programming. They will work with other professionals who also helped produce the Democratic convention, as well as past presidential inaugurations, Super Bowl halftime shows and the Tony Awards.\n The special will be streamed live on PIC social media channels: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Twitch. Amazon Prime Video, Microsoft Bing, NewsNOW from Fox, and AT&T DIRECTV and U-verse, will also be carrying the program live.\n The committee is also hosting a national memorial on January 19 to remember and honor the lives lost to Covid-19 and is asking cities and towns around the country to participate. More than 380,800 Americans have died from the virus as of Wednesday morning.\n The inaugural committee will also promote the national day of service on Martin Luther King Jr. Day as part of the inaugural festivities, and will encourage the majority of events be held in a virtual format.",

        "title": "What to watch at Wednesday's impeachment vote",
        "body_text": "A week after the mob stormed the US Capitol leaving staff and members cowering in their offices, in their chambers and waiting out the siege in secure locations, the House will vote -- for the first time in history -- to impeach a sitting President twice.\n This time around, a handful of Republicans will be with them as the GOP reckons with its future, the man they allowed to lead their party and whether it is too late to de-tangle themselves and their voters from his legacy.\n LIVE UPDATES: House moves to impeach Trump after deadly Capitol riot\n There are now five Republicans who have come out publicly for impeachment. There may be a few more in the hours ahead. That's not many. It's not even close to overwhelming, but it sends a message that at least some in the Republican Party believe leaving President Donald Trump in power in his waning days in office would be a mistake.\n Bottom line: Whatever judges, tax cuts and electoral victories Trump bestowed on Republicans over the last four years isn't enough right now to keep Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney quietly tethered to him. They're signaling they're done. They're over him. And we can't emphasize enough that we are just at the beginning of the story of what the Republican Party becomes without Trump.\n At 9 a.m. ET, the House will convene to begin consideration of impeachment. The first debate will last about an hour and it will revolve around the rules governing the impeachment article.\n After that, the House votes on the rule.\n Reminder that voting in the House takes time because of coronavirus protocols (and now metal detectors, which was its own scene Tuesday night as Republicans lashed out at police and fellow members when they were asked to go through them to get to the House floor).\n Once the House passes the rule in the early afternoon, the House will proceed to a two-hour debate.\n Final vote will begin between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. ET. As with all important votes in times of coronavirus, these things are a bit fluid in terms of timing. The resolution is expected to pass.\n Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney coming out in support of impeachment Tuesday ignited the first signal that the Republican Party might try to be something else after Trump. And she didn't just say she backed impeachment -- she put the blame of the events last week squarely on Trump's shoulders.\n \"The President of the U.S. summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President,\" she wrote.\n The divide, the differences, the revisionism that we could see in upcoming months and years is just beginning. Little cracks are playing out across Capitol Hill right now. Staff for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy are calling on their boss to explain himself. The communications director for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas resigned. Those who disavow Trump both before and because of this moment won't necessarily win this ideological contest that is going to play out in the days and years ahead. Some are going to get on this bandwagon late, many months and years after they walked in lockstep with the President.\n And many may never disavow him at all. Trump's support is still strong. There's a reason that his followers took him seriously when he tweeted, when he made promises, when he gave instructions. We still expect just a handful of Republicans to vote with Democrats to impeach Wednesday. One aide put that estimate -- even after Cheney -- at no more than 20.\n Here's who we have so far:\n Rep. John Katko of New YorkRep. Jamie Herrera Beutler of WashingtonRep. Adam Kinzinger of IllinoisRep. Fred Upton of MichiganRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming\n McConnell has not spoken to Trump since December, when he acknowledged that Biden had won the election, and the Kentucky Republican has no intention to talk to him again. McConnell's silence over impeachment is purposeful, sending a signal to his conference that is being heard loud and wide that if they want to vote to convict Trump when a trial unfolds in their chamber, they are free to do so. Long gone are the days when McConnell was trying to keep his conference together as they weathered the impeachment trial in 2020. There will be no conversations to try and keep more moderate Republican senators such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Mitt Romney of Utah or anyone else from voting however they want.\n McConnell had been slowly distancing the GOP conference from Trump for weeks. First by recognizing Biden won. Then by making it clear he wasn't going to renegotiate a stimulus proposal the President's own staff had helped draft. In his final days, McConnell led the first veto override of Trump's Presidency and now, McConnell is going to sit back and let his members do whatever they want to Trump's future.\n McConnell has tried -- as he often does -- to give his members room. Some members like Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina have rebuffed impeachment. Others, like Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have said they'll take a look.\n Despite the unexpected move to impeach Trump for the second time, four confirmation hearings are already scheduled for Tuesday, a sign that Republicans and Democrats are finding some consensus to move forward despite the inflamed political environment right now. Reminder, these committees are still chaired by Republicans until Wednesday, meaning Republicans had to notice these hearings. Four Senate Committees -- Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Finance and Homeland Security -- have announced they will hold confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary nominee Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.\n The Biden team is also having conversations with key committees and leadership about his first legislative priority, ensuring they can pass another stimulus bill. CNN has been told by one source familiar with those talks that Biden is eying legislation that will include $2,000 checks, an extension of federal unemployment benefits, more money for vaccine distribution as well as state and local funding that was dropped from the last package. The plan, according to the source, is for Democrats to try and introduce the bill without using reconciliation first. If Republicans object, aides tell CNN, they could use the arcane reconciliation process to try and pass the stimulus with a simple majority vote. While there is still likely to be plenty of time between now and then, Biden's team isn't letting impeachment stop them from beginning their legislative work.",

        "title": "Donald Trump is going home a loser",
        "body_text": "David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of \"The Axe Files,\" was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN.\nBiographers tell us that, early on, a cutthroat New York real estate developer imparted a dark lesson to the son who would become president of the United States.\n There are two kinds of people in the world, Fred Trump explained to his apprentice child. There are killers, and there are losers.\n The message was clear: You play to win, whatever it takes. Rules? Norms? Those are for losers. And Fred Trump had no time for losers.\n It's a lesson Donald Trump learned all too well.\n Throughout his life, the President has seemingly operated with that conviction -- that the world is a jungle, where you kill or be killed. The strong -- the winners -- get what they want, however they need to take it. Only the weak -- the losers -- play by the rules.\n In Trump's world, there seems to be little wrong with lying to get the advantage. In fact, it's almost wrong not to, because if you don't screw the other guys, they sure as hell are going to screw you.\n That's how Trump appears to have run his businesses -- burning bridges almost everywhere he's gone; leaving an endless trail of lawsuits from embittered partners; allegedly dodging creditors, regulators and taxes; facing accusations of short-changing contractors and swindling customers. (Trump has denied any wrongdoing in his businesses dealings or tax filings.)\n And that's the philosophy he's brought to the presidency, flagrantly defying rules and norms and undermining institutions that are the bulwark of a functioning democracy.\n From the moment he descended the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015 and entered national politics with a barrage of incendiary, racist tripe, Trump has routinely and scurrilously lied and sold his self-serving version of events and conspiracy theories. He has willfully and cynically divided and inflamed the country he was elected to lead to suit his own ends.\n Trump -- whose rise to power was built on an inflated, reality-show depiction of himself as a business titan -- has made a practice of exaggerating his own feats. The biggest! The best! No one's ever seen anything like this before!, he promised us.\n Well, this time, Trump's finally right.\n No president, in the long history of our republic, has ever been impeached twice. It is a record for ignominy that we can only hope will never be eclipsed, and the emblem of this most corrupt, chaotic and destructive of presidencies.\n Likely driven by his desperate need to fulfill his father's mandate, Fred Trump's son committed egregious sins against our democracy as he attempted to retain power.\n Twice he was cited for trying to interfere in the 2020 election. Last year, it was for the unthinkable act of pressuring a foreign leader -- the Ukrainian president -- to falsely open and announce a corruption investigation into the potential opponent Trump feared the most, Joe Biden, in 2019.\n Trump cynically and effectively depicted that earlier impeachment as partisan and remained in office, as only one Republican US senator, Mitt Romney, dared to defy the vengeful president.\n Far from chastened, the President was emboldened to believe that he could by legislative or judicial fiat overturn the results of the 2020 election -- a free and fair vote in which he was soundly defeated.\n Now five people are dead and our democracy wounded by the coup attempt the President of the United States incited in a last, desperate bid to stop the Congress from doing its constitutional duty and affirming Biden's electoral college victory.\n Even some members of Trump's tribe, who witnessed the siege, had seen enough. Ten joined in the vote to impeach him and moved one step closer to banning him from holding federal office again.\n There should have been more Republicans who crossed party lines, but Trump retains the loyalty of an implacable corps of believers among his base, and too many Republicans succumbed to fears of Trump and his devout followers in future primary elections. Kudos to those who did not.\n There is a lot more to learn about how we got to the point of this attempted coup and why so many Americans have bought Trump's fraudulent narrative about an election he plainly lost.\n But however and whenever the US Senate acts on Trump's historic second impeachment, this much we know: He will leave office within a week, not as an honored former president but as the disgraced and selfish provocateur of a seditious uprising. The violent insurrection against the US Capitol and our democracy will be his epitaph.\n The threat of legal action and disbarment from public office in the future still looms. But the President already has suffered the most painful penalty of all: Fred Trump's boy will go home a loser.",

        "body_text": "On Monday, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump in his fight against the 2020 election results, received the Medal of Freedom from Trump. The next day, Jordan was back in Congress arguing that he never said the election was stolen.\n During a congressional debate Tuesday, Jordan claimed he never said \"this election was stolen\" -- seemingly distancing himself from the January 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally that turned into a deadly attack on the US Capitol.\n \"I've never said that this election was stolen,\" Jordan said during a debate in the House Rules Committee over a resolution calling for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.\n Criticizing a decision from the Supreme Court allowing mail-in ballots received up to three days after election day in Pennsylvania to be counted, Jordan tweeted on October 19 that \"Democrats are trying to steal the election, after the election.\"\n On November 18, Jordan called for Congress to investigate the election \"amid troubling reports of irregularities and improprieties\" despite the fact that there is no evidence of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n During a Fox interview on December 9, Jordan said \"I don't know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn't actually win this thing based on all the things you see.\" On the program, he also made the argument that because some Americans believe the election was rigged \"we should do everything we can to get to the bottom of\" their allegations.\n During his speech on January 6 objecting to Arizona's electoral results, -- moments before rioters invaded the Capitol --  Jordan implied that the results of the election were incorrect and that Trump should have won.\n Trump, Jordan argued \"got 11 million more votes than he did in 2016, and House Republicans won 27 of 27 toss-up races, but somehow the guy who never left his house wins the election?\"\n A spokesperson for Jordan told CNN the congressman \"stands [by] his comments. He has never said that the election was stolen.\"\n In remarks Wednesday, as the House prepared to impeach Trump, Jordan objected to the impeachment resolution, defended his objections last week to the electoral college results and again criticized Pennsylvania election rules.",

Table reads for the season began in September, according to Rae's social media.\n Though a release date for the final season has yet to be announced, Rae told CNN in June that fans can expect the season \"to be different in a great way.\"\n \"I think different in a way that the audience will expect and won't expect,\" Rae said. \"It's definitely going to showcase some different sides to our characters.

        "title": "'Locked Down' turns quarantine into a romantic heist movie for the Covid time capsule",
        "body_text": "Anyone who has felt their relationship tested by quarantine (no need to raise hands, we see you) will at least partially relate to \"Locked Down,\" which takes the idea of a couple trapped by those circumstances, then builds an improbable heist plot around it. Thanks to Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway it's mildly watchable, but mostly an artifact that might look better after a few years in the Covid time capsule.\n The film is notably just the latest attempt to corral the strangeness of the pandemic and turn that into drama, including a number of limited series and specials made for TV and streaming. The main difference here involves the marquee stars (plus some amusing Zoom-call cameos), working with \"The Bourne Identity\" director Doug Liman (whose most germane credit here might be \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\") and writer Steven Knight (\"Peaky Blinders\").\n Living together in London, Ejiofor's Paxton has just been furloughed from his van-driving gig, while his partner Linda (Hathaway) is forced to lay off some of her company's workers. That only adds to the shared sense of malaise and discomfort, since Linda -- first seen screaming into a pillow -- had been \"planning to end our thing\" before the lockdown kept them at least physically together.\n The tension in the relationship comes spewing out in a lot of rapid-fire dialogue, almost like an Aaron Sorkin movie, only there's not much room to walk while talking.\n \"I'm not normal lately, I know that,\" Paxton admits, before going out into the street to read poetry, loudly, as a means of \"entertaining our fellow inmates.\"\n Like most shot-under-quarantine productions, it's intriguing for about 30 minutes or so, thanks in part to the charismatic leads. For the next half-hour, most viewers -- like their predicament -- will probably have seen enough and just want to get out.\n The second half, though, takes a marked turn, as an opportunity presents itself for the two to collaborate on absconding with a priceless (OK, extremely valuable) piece of merchandise. The scenario creates uncertainty about whether they'll actually go through with the scheme, if they'll get away with it, and whether sharing such an endeavor can repair the damage done between them.\n Along the way, the pair chat with various friends and co-workers played by the likes of Ben Stiller, Ben Kingsley and Dule Hill, but this is mostly a two-handed card game.\n Once again, it's possible to admire the ingenuity -- and in this case, the central performances -- without finding the result particularly satisfying. Seeing glamorous people engaging in mundane, getting-under-each-other's-skin bickering doesn't necessarily make that a whole lot more fun.\n Distributed by Warner Bros. amid the studio's strategy of launching its 2021 slate on HBO Max (like CNN, both units of WarnerMedia), \"Locked Down\" is the kind of small-boned movie that doesn't lose anything on a streaming platform. Creatively speaking, it actually might gain something after a few years in the vault, but for now, it falls somewhere in the realms of \"Not enough\" and \"Too soon,\" take your pick.\n \"Locked Down\" premieres Jan. 14 on HBO Max.",

        "body_text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rejecting Democratic calls to bring the Senate back immediately to convict President Donald Trump, a decision that is likely to allow the President to serve out his final days in office.\n McConnell's office made that clear to Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's aides on Wednesday, according to Republican officials. The majority leader also sent a note to Republican senators telling them the chamber won't return until January 19, according to a person who has seen it, meaning an impeachment trial won't begin until the early days of Joe Biden's presidency.\n In a statement released after the House voted to impeach, McConnell said, \"Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week.\"\n The House impeachment vote on Wednesday over Trump's incitement of the riot at the Capitol last week stands as a swift and bipartisan condemnation that makes Trump the first president in United States history to be impeached twice.\n McConnell has privately indicated that he believes impeaching Trump would be the way to rid him from the party, a dramatic break between the top Republican who has worked in tandem with the Republican President over the last four years.\n In the note to his Republican colleagues Wednesday afternoon on impeachment, he wrote that \"while the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\"\n But McConnell is furious, sources say, over Trump's incitement of the violent riots that turned deadly at the US Capitol last week, and he also blames Trump for the party's failure to hold the two Georgia Senate seats that went to runoffs earlier this month, losses that will send him and Republicans into the minority in the Senate for the next two years.\n In a memo a few days ago to Republican senators, McConnell had suggested the trial wouldn't start until Biden becomes president, saying all 100 senators would need to consent to change the Senate's schedule. He indicated that the earliest the Senate could take up any House-passed articles of impeachment against Trump would most likely be right after his term ends.\n \"The Senate trial would therefore begin after President Trump's term has expired,\" the memo states.\n But since then, Schumer has called on McConnell to invoke emergency authority created in 2004 to reconvene the Senate if the two leaders agree to bring the chamber back.\n Democrats are calling on McConnell to immediately act.\n Schumer kept up the pressure with a statement on Wednesday following the impeachment vote, saying, \"A Senate trial can begin immediately, with agreement from the current Senate Majority Leader to reconvene the Senate for an emergency session, or it will begin after January 19th. But make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again.\"\n House Democrats had signaled they planned to send the article of impeachment over to the Senate later Wednesday following the impeachment vote, which was joined by 10 Republicans.\n The President's second impeachment comes after he repeatedly made false claims that the election had been stolen from him and riled supporters who ransacked the Capitol.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

        "body_text": "Samsung is set to update its Galaxy smartphone line about a month ahead of its typical launch schedule.\n The company, which typically updates new Galaxy S phones in February, is hosting a press conference on Thursday to show off new 5G-capable flagship devices and Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds that may better compete with Apple AirPods.\n If the product leaks are to be believed, we'll see three smartphones in varying sizes -- a 6.2-inch Galaxy S21, 6.7-inch S21+ and 6.8-inch Ultra -- featuring an AI-powered camera, faster processor and a bolder design with new colors. The premium Ultra model, expected to be the star of the presentation, will likely come with four rear cameras -- compared to three back cameras on the other devices -- feature a bright super high-resolution display (3200 x 1400 resolution) and support the S Pen stylus used in its Note series phones.\n Meanwhile, Samsung is expected to introduce a premium version of its wireless earbuds called the Galaxy Buds Pro with enhanced noise cancellation at $50 less than the $249 Apple AirPods Pro.\n The product launch event comes at a time when growth in the smartphone market has become saturated as people hold onto their devices longer. To make matters more challenging, smartphone makers like Samsung must convince consumers to pay for pricey products at a time of economic uncertainty due to the pandemic.\n Beyond the phones, it's possible we could also see a few surprises, including a long rumored Tile-like tracker that attaches to items like car keys to find them if they go missing.",

        "title": "How much of 'Bridgerton' is forgivable?",
        "body_text": "Kate Maltby is a broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics, and a theater critic for The Guardian newspaper. She is also completing a doctorate in Renaissance literature. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\"Bridgerton,\" the first TV series made by Shondaland for Netflix, hit both Britain and the USA on December 25, 2020. A period drama set in London of 1813, the show is based on bestselling American novels, and offers a vision of Britain as only Americans could see it. Yet Brits, as enthusiastically as American viewers, have lapped up this soapy fantasy.\n The show was lucky with its launch date. By late December, America was reeling from post-election crisis to pre-inauguration crisis, its citizens desperate for escapism. But on Christmas Day itself, Brits were in particular need of the magic \"Bridgerton \"offers. Five days earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had abruptly canceled the nation's promised Christmas relaxation of quarantine regulations. Young people living in London were disproportionately affected, prevented by overnight changes in quarantine zoning from traveling to their families outside the city. So instead of turkey and charades, Britain's millennials kicked back with Netflix.\n \"Bridgerton\" offers viewers eight hours of candy-colored entertainment. (For some Brits of my acquaintance, that eight hours constituted their sole Christmas Day activity.) The story of Daphne, a beautiful debutante in Regency London, this is milquetoast Jane Austen fan fiction. There is some weeping and wailing about the possibility of spinsterhood or scandal, but nothing disquieting happens for long to anyone we care about. The chief crisis of our heroine's life involves her having to choose between a Prince and a Duke.\n Like the heroine of a fairy tale, Daphne is introduced from the opener as the fairest in the land, singled out by the Queen \"of 200 young ladies\" as the winner of the debutante beauty pageant, and declared \"the incomparable\" by the anonymous gossip columnist Lady Whistledown. She will face challenges -- both these fairy tale deities will temporarily withdraw their favor -- but we know that beauty and charm will always win.\n Across the street we meet an evil stepmother, Lady Featherington, who primps up her two charmless elder daughters in lurid feathers and belittles her intellectual youngest, Penelope. We know, as surely as we know that only Cinderella's foot will fit the glass slipper, that these ugly sisters will end the season unmarried.\n At times of economic pain, big media sells us fairy tales. The 1937 Disney film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" released to wild success during one of the worst years of the Great Depression, is regularly cited as an example of this phenomenon. When the theorists Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term \"culture industry\", they were writing about the ways that big corporates shape our imagination: the Walt Disney Company sold the song \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" to millions of young working class women struggling for a better life.\n For women in 1937, that better life meant marriage and a male breadwinner. Like \"Snow White,\" \"Bridgerton\" finds British and American viewers at our most despairing. Like \"Snow White,\" it peddles dreams to a target audience of working class women. Some of the cast and crew of \"Bridgerton\" have tried to claim progressive credentials for their show. Certainly, its racially diverse casting is to be applauded: a major step toward black British actors finally getting a chance to play the great period drama roles they deserve. (Adjoa Andoh, for example, was born to play a Regency Grande Dame). But the happy-ever-after \"Bridgerton\" sells to its female viewers still consists of marriage and men. This is \"Snow White\" with added orgasms; social conservatism dressed up in progressive breeches.\n As for breeches and orgasms, why does the Regency world carry such appeal as a period backdrop? There is something culturally specific about this era which is deeply ingrained in contemporary female fantasy. The \"Bridgerton\" TV series is based on Julia Quinn's bestselling romance novels of the same name. The eight stories which follow Daphne and her siblings form only a part of the expansive Quinn universe. Her devoted fanbase has produced a rich and varied archive of its own fan fiction, much of it more nuanced and perspicacious than the frothy show you'll find on Netflix.\n If there is a \"female gaze,\" \"Bridgerton\" is looking to define and cater to it. Sex scenes are shot to appeal to women who date men; they focus almost exclusively on the heaving torsos of Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, who plays Daphne's love interest Simon, and Jonathan Bailey, who pursues his own panting storylines as Daphne's promiscuous brother Anthony. Simon is conveniently given a confidante in the person of his muscular boxing trainer, which offers ample opportunity for the two men to bounce about a boxing ring, shirtless and sweating. Is this feminism, or just female friendly?\n Contemporary culture has long fetishized men in Regency dress (or undress). When the BBC adapted \"Pride and Prejudice\" in 1995, they invented the iconic scene in which Colin Firth, as Mr. Darcy, strips down to his undershirt and dives into a lake on his grounds. As recently as 2016, women lined up in Washington, DC, to view the very same shirt in a display at the Folger Shakespeare Library. What any of it had to do with Shakespeare was unclear. It is a truth universally acknowledged that men who dress like Austen's heroes are dreamy.\n Yet if Austen's heroes are dreamy, they don't emerge from fairy tales. Women tend to identify with Austen's heroines, and thus it's an easy step to find themselves loving Austen's men. But much of the reason modern women identify with Austen's heroines that they face real challenges to which 21st century women can still relate. For Austen's women, marriage is an economic prospect, and often the only economic prospect which allows an escape from poverty -- or at best, lifelong financial dependence on a reluctant relative. That is no longer true for women in the developed world, but their marital and sexual choices still face pressures and scrutiny unique to their sex.\n \"Bridgerton,\" as a cultural phenomenon encompassing both novels and TV series, seizes on women's great affection for Austen's books and shamelessly targets her fan base. Perhaps if you've ever identified with Elizabeth Bennett, you'll fall for any actor in Regency uniform. But while the landscape of Austen is peppered with tragic figures of women who've lost out in life, in \"Bridgerton,\" no one we like ever makes a long-term mistake. Marina Thompson, a Featherington country cousin with more wealth than first appears, does have to settle for respectable marriage in the absence of passion. But as she's already attempted to entrap a naive young man into falsely accepting paternity of her baby, our sympathy is limited. There is cosmic order in her story's neat ending, far happier than the messy lives of most unmarried pregnant women in the era.\n Meanwhile Daphne is a more fiscally naive heroine than any in Austen. In the first episode, she scolds her sisters for mocking her social success: \"my success on the marriage mart influences all of your prospects. We will all need to find love one day.\" In two sentences, this script has rejected every observation Austen ever made about Regency social norms. For Austen, marriage is an economic bargain in which love has little to do with worldly success; for Daphne it is a popularity contest in which worldly success and love will naturally come together.\n Daphne does get everything she wants. This includes cajoling her Duke, the dashing Simon, into embracing fatherhood, despite his lifelong wish not to have children. \"Bridgerton\" presents this development as an act of psychological healing by Daphne -- for who would actively choose childlessness, this show suggests, except as a symptom of unresolved childhood trauma? Yet this seeming cure involves a bedroom act that at worst can be called rape, at best reproductive coercion. She forcibly violates his expressed wish to use the (unreliable) withdrawal method.\n Sexual consent doesn't cease to matter when it is violated by an attractive young woman. Daphne's justifications and Simon's eventual forgiveness send a poor message to anyone trapped in an abusive sexual relationship. None of this is feminist. Daphne's act perpetuates old stereotypes of women as seed-stealing succubae. Marina's treatment of Colin similarly signals that men should be careful of women's deceit.\n Such conservatism would not have been out of place in the 1930s. Nor would \"Bridgerton\"'s solid heterosexuality. There's a token gay character who features in a sub-plot to a subplot. When Daphne's brother Benedict explores London's art scene, he makes a friend and fleetingly walks in on the man embracing his lover in the side-room of an orgy. But Benedict rushes away to partake instead in a two-woman threesome -- a classic heterosexual male fantasy. Some \"Bridgerton\" fans are hopeful that Daphne's rebellious sister Eloise may turn out to be a lesbian in later series -- if so, it will be a departure from the novel series.\n Nonetheless, \"Bridgerton\" gives us escapism, and we need escapism today. If you're British, the anti-naturalism of this fantasy is particularly obvious. In the show's opening shots, we are presented with the most famous vistas of the city of Bath -- and yet we're told we're in the city of London. Buckingham Palace is shown with unsubtly CGI'd scaffolding. Anachronistic names pop up everywhere -- \"Nigel\" for a Regency aristocrat? Really? -- and instead of period music, Daphne and Simon's sex scenes are set to stringed orchestrations of Taylor Swift. These aren't errors, or the business of pedantic historians to dispute. They are features, not bugs.\n This antipathy towards accuracy doesn't preclude a sense of historicism. Like the Quinn novels, the dialogue of TV adaptation is peppered with references to popular myths about the Regency era -- in the opening lines, one character suggests the use of lead and arsenic as effective makeup. A handful of genuine references to Regency social history are used and reused over and again:  there incessant mentions of immature characters being 'barely out of leading strings', i.e. Regency baby-walkers. The purpose of such clangers is not historical accuracy: it is to hang a sign reading: We are not in 2020 anymore.\n \"Bridgerton\" revels in the fantastical nature of its own world building: this is a world of extravagant wigs and crowded parties; a world in catering for a glamorous wedding can be laid on at three days notice; a world which has achieved racial restitution and equality, without any indication of the struggle and trauma taken to achieve this. In a brief expository scene, never referenced once in the rest of the series, Simon's godmother tells him that racial harmony arrived in Britain after King George chose to marry a black woman. It is as simplistic an idea as any fairy tale -- whatever your view of Queen Charlotte, whose distant African ancestry has in recent years put her cultural identity under the microscope, no racial progress is ever made that fast. One doubts Meghan Markle shares its confidence in royal open-mindedness. But what a wonderful fairy tale for us momentarily to believe possible.\n But this is an American fantasy of Britain. Unlike the historical members of the Regency \"ton,\" who reveled in informal nicknames and scatological jokes, our aristocratic siblings use cold and formal language with each other. Fathers and sons perpetuate in cycles of emotional abuse; no one is capable of communicating their emotions. Even the hopeful vision of racial diversity is limited by an American lens: there are no lead actors of South Asian heritage, which is contemporary Britain's largest ethnic minority.\n It is also, like most American fantasies of Britain, a conservative fantasy. Our heroines are aristocrats: there are no storylines for servants, no lead character drawn from the working class. As in a fairy tale, happiness is granted to the beautiful and innocent: Lady Featherington and her \"ugly\" daughters end the show outplayed and unhappy. Perhaps this is what we need to get us through 2021, but if so, we are in a very bad place.\n An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly referred to a character on \"Bridgerton\" as Andrew. The character's name is Anthony.",

        "body_text": "A storm system has pounded parts of the Pacific Northwest with strong  winds and rain, leaving hundreds of thousands of utility customers without power in Washington and Oregon on Wednesday and saturating the ground -- which could cause more trees to fall.\n The storms Tuesday through Wednesday morning were part of an atmospheric river event -- involving rivers of moisture high in the atmosphere -- that has drenched the region for days and caused parts of western Washington their wettest start to a year, according to the National Weather Service.\n Flood warnings or advisories were in effect Wednesday morning for ares of western Washington and western Oregon, parts of which received more than 8 inches of rain over the last three days alone.\n Strong winds -- including gusts above 60 mph in places -- knocked down trees and power lines. More than 650,000 utility customers were without power Wednesday morning in Washington and Oregon, according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us.\n Because one customer can be an entire household, the number of people without power service was likely much higher than 650,000.\n \"There's a lot of tree and powerline debris on roadways, not to mention standing water, \" the National Weather Service's Seattle office said Wednesday morning. \"Power outages are causing dark intersections. If you don't have to travel this morning, might be safest to stay home!\"\n By Wednesday morning, strong winds were pushing through central Washington and Oregon, and more areas were expected to experience them soon.\n More than 11 million people were under high-wind warnings or advisories Wednesday morning, from Washington to the Dakotas and as far south as Nebraska.\n High-wind watches are scheduled for millions more people through the Plains for Thursday, the weather service said.\n CNN's Joe Sutton and Jennifer Gray contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \"Burning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\" Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nThis is an historic day for the United States. President Donald J. Trump is now the first president in American history to be impeached twice -- this time for his role in inciting an insurrection on the US Capitol, an abuse of power so egregious that somewhere former President Richard Nixon, disgraced over Watergate, is shaking his head in disbelief.\n Wednesday's vote should not be taken lightly. Only three US presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and now Trump. But, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at the start of the afternoon's proceedings, \"He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\n Although some Republicans will argue that both impeachments were driven by partisanship, in neither instance were Democrats particularly excited about having to spend their time rebuking a sitting president. In 2019, Pelosi had resisted pursuing the first impeachment process, fearing that voting to punish Trump would only embolden his supporters and improve his chances for reelection in 2020. She and many other Democrats further worried that impeaching over findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's meddling in our election or other potential abuses of power would ultimately hurt the party's standing politically -- even if it was the right thing to do.\n Yet, when the details emerged of Trump's call to the Ukrainian president asking for political dirt on his rival Joe Biden, Pelosi made a difficult decision to pursue charges. She did so knowing that there was little chance of conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate and that the GOP would politicize it for months to come.\n The second impeachment was not politically convenient either. The vote came at a time when the party would much rather be focused on preparing to help President-elect Joe Biden enact his ambitious economic agenda during his first months in office. Taking on impeachment in the final days of a one-term presidency is just about the last thing that Pelosi or likely any Democrat had in mind as a top priority.\n Nonetheless, once again believing it was the only right thing to do, they moved forward.\n Impeachment serves many purposes. Most important, this constitutional process provides a mechanism for Congress to remove a sitting president who has abused his power and poses a danger to the republic he leads.\n Trump's abuse of power, which placed and continues to place every member of Congress in grave danger -- as we saw, horrifyingly, last week -- is simply unacceptable.\n But impeachment is also a way for Congress to make a firm statement on the historical record about the limits of presidential power. The outrage that drove Wednesday's vote did not come from partisan anger, at least not exclusively. It came from the feeling that the President's role in the violent attack on the Capitol was a flagrant abuse of his authority -- and one for which he continues to deny any responsibility.\n Sadly, even as House members voted, an ongoing threat of further violence loomed. Military and security personnel are stationed in and around Capitol Hill to protect members of Congress from potential future attacks. Meanwhile, FBI reports indicate that more violent protests are being planned at all 50 state capitals and Washington DC.\n Wednesday's vote for impeachment creates a precedent for future elected officials when another politician tries to trample constitutional norms and undermine democracy. But, perhaps, most significantly, it marks a turning point: Now we, as a nation, can start to heal from the nightmare that was the Trump presidency.\n As for the 197 Republicans who voted against impeachment, they will forever have to defend their records. The GOP can talk about the problems with a rushed impeachment process, but in the end their vote represents an acceptance of the erratic and dangerous behavior the President has engaged in since the November election.\n If party members want to talk about separating themselves from Trumpism, this vote confirms that they have done just the opposite. Trumpism is Republicanism -- pure and simple. As the presidential train veered off the rails, most Republicans sat right next to Trump and, whether in action  or in silence, encouraged him to speed along.\n Each impeachment is remembered in different ways. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson generates conversations about the collapse of Reconstruction and the subversion of efforts to achieve racial justice after the Civil War. The near impeachment of Nixon (who resigned instead) has stimulated dialogue about how presidents can dangerously misuse their authority in pursuit of self-interest. And the impeachment of Bill Clinton has become a basis for conversations about the weaponization of the process.\n Trump's dual impeachments will likely go down as an acknowledgement of the immense dangers that our republic has found itself in after the radicalization of the Republican Party resulted in a near total abandonment of norms and institutional restraints. When partisanship triumphed over the needs of governance and the health of our democratic institutions, violence ensued. Trump was a president who was willing to say and do almost anything in pursuit of power -- and a majority of the GOP supported him every step of the way.\n Although the President will likely complete his final days in office -- as a Senate trial date has yet to be set and it remains unclear if enough Senate Republicans would vote to convict him -- the action by the House won't be forgotten. Under the direction of Pelosi, a bipartisan majority delineated a much-needed marker for what is not permissible in presidential politics and why certain actions will not be tolerated.\n The problem is that this won't be enough. The impeachment is an historic step in the effort to improve the political health of the nation, but it can't be the last one. The process of strengthening and restoring the system of checks and balances must be a top priority in coming years. Congress must tackle the broken structures and broken norms that allowed Trump to do what he did. Otherwise, we are bound to find ourselves right back where this started just one week ago.",

The motive for the attack is unclear and police declined to comment further, citing the ongoing court case.\n After his court appearance, the man was bailed to a secure mental health unit, and has been seen by a forensic nurse and mental health professional, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand (RNZ). He is scheduled to return to court on January 28.\n The front entrance, where the smashed panels are located, will be closed until further notice, and a second entrance with rubber doors would be used instead, RNZ reported.\n The Parliamentary Service, which oversees the buildings, grounds and administration, is now carrying out a full review of the attack -- including whether more stringent security measures are necessary.\n Threats to New Zealand's Parliament are relatively rare, and there is minimal security around the legislature. The grounds are open to the public -- office workers frequently have lunch on the grass in front of the building, and children play in the nearby playground.",

        "title": "Abortion drug ruling highlights Trump's wins on the Supreme Court 'shadow docket'",
        "body_text": "The Supreme Court's action Tuesday limiting access to an abortion drug highlights its pattern of letting the Trump administration enforce highly charged priorities before legal challenges have been resolved.\n The conservative court majority swept aside a lower court injunction and reinstated a requirement that women prescribed mifepristone, to end a pregnancy in its early weeks, pick up the pill in person despite the Covid-19 pandemic.\n With President Donald Trump having just a week left in office, the justices' decision in the abortion-drug case stands for one of the last of a four-year pattern that allowed, among other Trump agenda items, a limit on transgender people in the military; funding for a wall at the US southern border; and a new rule disadvantaging green-card applicants who seek food stamps or other non-cash public benefits.\n All of these cases emerged from the justices so-called \"shadow docket,\" involving government requests for high court intervention after a lower court judge blocked a Trump policy but before a legal challenge has been fully aired and resolved.\n They were decided along ideological lines, with the right wing prevailing. And they all demonstrated that while the Trump administration is ending with a mixed record at the Supreme Court on cases fully argued and briefed, it has largely succeeded on \"emergency\" requests for early intervention.\n A question for the months ahead is whether the high court under Chief Justice John Roberts, and more lopsidedly conservative than it has been in decades, will be similarly ready to let any challenged policies of the Democratic Joe Biden administration go forward.\n Prior Trump disputes, such as over his diversion of funds to pay for the wall along the southern border or to make immigrants who apply for food stamps ineligible for green cards, were resolved by 5-4 splits. But in this first abortion case since the October succession of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett for the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the vote was apparently 6-3.\n The court often does not make clear the precise votes among the nine, in these cases decided without full briefing and oral arguments. On Tuesday, only the court's three remaining liberal justices, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, announced their dissenting votes.\n Roberts, concurring in the decision to reinstate the Trump regulation, emphasized deference for an administration.\n \"The question before us is not whether the requirements for dispensing mifepristone impose an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion as a general matter,\" Roberts asserted. \"The question is instead whether the District Court properly ordered the Food and Drug Administration to lift those established requirements because of the court's own evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here as in related contexts concerning government responses to the pandemic, my view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health.\"\n Dissenting, Sotomayor, joined by Kagan, countered that \"patients' health vulnerabilities, public transportation risks, susceptible older family members at home, and clinic closures ... pose substantial, sometimes insurmountable, obstacles for women seeking medication abortions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n Sotomayor stressed the \"substantial\" burden on women and violation of their constitutional right to end a pregnancy.\n In the abortion-drug case, as in previous \"shadow docket\" disputes, Sotomayor has targeted her conservative colleagues' willingness to accept the administration's arguments.\n Last year, when she objected to the court majority's lifting of an injunction against the new Trump policy for green-card applicants, she suggested the majority was unfairly benefitting the administration over other litigants who request speedy intervention and stays of lower-court orders.\n \"It's hard to say what is more troubling,\" she wrote, \"that the Government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the Court would grant it.\"\n In Tuesday's dispute, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had sought a Covid-19 exemption from the FDA mandate that women needing the drug mifepristone (taken in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy to induce a medication abortion) obtain the drug in person from a hospital or other medical office and sign a disclosure form.\n Last summer, a US district court judge blocked that requirement, saying that forcing women to travel to a hospital, clinic or other medical office would impinge their constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court first declared that women have a right to end a pregnancy in 1973, with the Roe v. Wade decision. That landmark has been affirmed times since then, by narrow votes in courts less conservative than today's.\n In their appeal, Justice Department lawyers emphasized that the regulation covering medication abortions did not affect surgical abortions. \"The challenged safety requirements impose no obstacle whatsoever to other commonly used and generally accepted methods of abortion,\" they wrote, \"and thus cannot be said to construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right.\"\n Sotomayor's dissent ran 12 pages and recalled prior instances when Sotomayor has derided the Trump administration position and the conservative majority's endorsement of it.\n With evident sarcasm, she referred to the administration's stance that if women cannot pick up the medication for an early abortion, other options exist. \"What rejoinder does the Government have to the possibility that refusing to suspend the FDA's in-person requirements for mifepristone during the COVID--19 pandemic will cause some women to miss the 10-week window altogether? No cause for concern, the Government assures this Court, because even if the FDA's in-person requirements cause women to lose the opportunity for a medication abortion, they can still seek out a surgical abortion. What a callous response.\"\n Addressing Roberts' position about the importance of deferring to the FDA, she insisted, \"There simply is no reasoned decision here to which this Court can defer.\" She said administration health officials had failed to document why women must continue to pick up mifepristone in person when the administration has exempted many other drugs because of pandemic health risks.",

        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden will no longer take the Amtrak to Washington next week to be sworn in as president, two officials familiar with the planning tell CNN, a sudden change that comes amid dramatically heightened security surrounding the inauguration.\n A decision was made this week for Biden not to take the 90-minute ride from his namesake station in Wilmington, Delaware, officials said, with at least some of the concerns hinging on his arrival at Union Station in Washington, which is only blocks from the now heavily fortified US Capitol.\n Biden previously had instructed his team to keep moving forward with the plans for inauguration, including taking the Amtrak, and to not be deterred by the deadly riot at the US Capitol last week or by complications caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n But since then, the security concerns have intensified, as more has been learned about the attack on the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, which left five people dead, and the potential threats surrounding the January 20 inauguration.\n Biden on Wednesday received a briefing from senior officials at the FBI, the Secret Service and key members of his national security team about the potential for additional extremist violence in the coming days, the President-elect's transition team said in a statement.\n \"In the week since the attack on Congress by a mob that included domestic terrorists and violent extremists, the nation has continued to learn more about the threat to our democracy and about the potential for additional violence in the coming days, both in the National Capital Region and in cities across the country,\" the statement from the transition team reads. \"This is a challenge that the President-elect and his team take incredibly seriously.\"\n Biden's transition team is engaging with the Trump administration to \"gain as much information as possible on the threat picture, and on the preparations being put in place to deter and defend against violent disruptions or attacks,\" according to the statement.\n Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol at a significantly scaled-down event. Biden said this week that he was \"not afraid of taking the\u00a0oath outside\" and that his team had been receiving briefings in the wake of the violence.\n More than 20,000 National Guard troops could be in Washington to help secure Biden's inauguration, Washington Police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday, and sources tell CNN that officials are considering raising the terrorism threat level. The US Secret Service on Wednesday officially took charge of security for\u00a0Biden's inauguration, working in coordination with federal law enforcement agencies and the Pentagon.\n The transition has called for swift Senate hearings and confirmations for Biden's national security nominees, stressing the importance of \"continuous command and control across the homeland security and law enforcement components of the U.S. government.\"\n The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing for Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick for Homeland Security secretary, next Tuesday. Biden's pick for defense secretary, retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, also has a confirmation hearing scheduled for next Tuesday. Austin will require a congressional waiver before he is confirmed.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen and Geneva Sands contributed to this report.",

        "title": "How Ted Cruz wasted his intellect to back Donald Trump's fraud",
        "body_text": "James Moore is a political analyst, author and business communications consultant who has been writing and reporting on Texas politics since 1975. He is the founder of Big Bend Strategies and publishes regularly at Texas to the World. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.\nHe might have been the best of us. He is the worst of us.\n The manifest tragedy of the life of Texas' junior US Sen. Ted Cruz is what he might have accomplished had he not wasted a fine intellect to serve his craven political ambitions instead of the country he professes to love. Nearly every clever phrase he has turned in public discourse appears to have been designed to disrupt, not repair, and to turn the focus to Cruz, instead of the issue at hand.\n The first Hispanic American elected to the US Senate from Texas, and a graduate of Harvard Law School and Princeton University, Cruz had argued nine cases before the US Supreme Court by the time he ran for Senate -- more than any practicing Texas lawyer or member of Congress. Anyone who has authored 70 Supreme Court briefs, which Cruz did as solicitor general of Texas, surely must have skills to marshal the power of facts.\n Instead, he has spent much of his time leveraging falsehoods for his political benefit. More specifically, the senator has used his Ivy League education to promote election fraud theories that inspired rioting insurrectionists and QAnon quackery when he could have been at work creating policies to improve American lives.\n Compromise appears to be of little interest to Cruz, though. There are no cameras on the crowd in the middle. The television lights are shining at the fringe.\n What exactly happened to Cruz is difficult to fully assess. A man who had called President Donald Trump a \"pathological liar\" during their presidential primary in 2016 embraced the President's falsehoods about a stolen election four years later -- and, in doing so, may have destroyed his political prospects.\n Just consider the day of the insurrection on Capitol Hill. Cruz was on the floor of the Senate arguing for a commission to investigate claims of fraudulent electoral results, and he justified his rhetoric by saying, \"Thirty-nine percent of Americans believe the election that just occurred was, quote, rigged.\"\n But he knew it was an honest election. Cruz has always been an artful dodger of details that do not facilitate his desired outcomes. Consequently, aside from misrepresenting the actual polling figure he cited, he ignored the truth that some voters acquired a conviction the election was stolen from the words of a President famous for lying and empowered by the conservative media that proliferates his deceptions as actualities.\n Further, the senator failed to mention that more than 80 judges in state and federal courts had considered evidentiary pleadings regarding dead voters casting ballots, hacked voting machines, ballot dumps and backroom tallies, but did not find sufficient evidence to order further action be taken.\n Still, Cruz maliciously fed the mass delusion leading to the attempted coup in Washington, DC.\n The linguistic cues from the President to \"stop the steal\" and take over the Capitol were also constantly ringing in Cruz's ears. There are more than 74 million Trump voters, and the senator wanted them to all know he was their guy if Trump opted out -- or was unable -- to run in 2024.\n Putting lives at risk -- along with the very citadel at the center of American democracy -- was of seemingly little concern to Cruz. Democratic norms could be abandoned if it advanced his personal political causes. In fact, while the mob was beating a police officer to death and defacing congressional offices, Cruz was sending out a fundraising tweet, which aides later insisted was an automated coincidence. His tweet said he wanted financial help to stop the counting of electors.\n Not even all of his staff was willing to tolerate the senator's behavior. This week, Cruz's communications director, Lauren Blair Bianchi, resigned because of the January 6 attack.\n Cruz cannot possibly think his language played no role in the Capitol invasion; he is simply denying it. This is one of his greatest political skills. In an interview with a Houston TV station after the riot, he said he had not supported the President's incendiary claims about the election and had even spent Trump's entire term in conflict with the White House.\n \"I have disagreed with the President's language and rhetoric for the last four years,\" he told KTRK. \"If you looked to what I have said, you will not find me say the same language or rhetoric.\"\n However, that generally seemed to happen only when Trump was standing between Cruz and the presidency.\n His foulest disagreements with the President occurred in the primaries. The exchanges between the two men went well beyond what passes for standard campaign language. \"This guy Ted Cruz is the single biggest liar I have ever dealt with in my life,\" Trump said. \"I mean it. He will lie about anything.\"\n The Texan then referred to Trump as a \"sniveling coward\" after he attacked Cruz's wife by sharing an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz next to Melania Trump. Their mutual insults defiled the low standards of even the rankest political campaigns.\n Ultimately, though, Cruz and Trump became confederates, and the senator offered to argue in front of the US Supreme Court for Trump and the state of Texas in a lawsuit claiming swing state results had to be invalidated. More recently, Cruz began a recent campaign speech in Georgia with, \"God bless Donald J. Trump.\"\n The simplest explanation for the base behavior of Cruz is that he will say and do anything to achieve his goal of becoming president, and he has demonstrated that he is willing to put at risk the very democracy of the country that he dreams of leading. That ought to earn him a lifetime ban from getting anywhere near the White House.",

        "source": "cnn",
        "title": "How the news media should cover impeachment 2.0",
        "body_text": "The news media (once again) finds itself covering a moment unlike any other in history. President Trump is set to become the first president in US history to have been impeached twice \u2014 this time for inciting a deadly riot on Capitol Hill after weeks of peddling disinfo and promoting conspiracy theories aimed at undermining the results of a free and fair election.\n But unlike last time, Trump is starting to see some cracks in his stronghold over the GOP. Meanwhile, Trump's allies in right-wing media aren't putting up nearly as aggressive of a defense they did the last time he faced impeachment. (Last time, you'll remember, Trump's most prominent propagandists constructed an alternate reality in which Democrats did what he was accused of. This time the argument mostly amounts to impeachment being divisive.)\n So how should the press cover this monumental moment? I reached out to WaPo's Margaret Sullivan, NBC's Ben Collins, Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik, Politico's Jack Shafer, and Princeton history professor Julian Zelizer to solicit some advice...\n Sullivan stressed the importance of offering audiences clear-eyed coverage of what they are watching. \"It will be important not to fall into the trap of false equivalence, but rather to stick as close as possible to substance rather than the partisan politics of what's at stake,\" Sullivan wrote by email. \"And to use plain, descriptive language that doesn't tiptoe around reality. A First Amendment-protected protest is one thing; a mob of marauders is quite another. And anybody who's seen the video knows what happened on Jan. 6.\"\n Zurawik said he believes the number one element the press should focus on is framing the events unfolding with clear context. \"It needs heavy analysis woven into reportorial coverage,\" Zurawik said. \"That analysis will provide the context that gives the coverage the stature this moment deserves.\" Zurawik added that a \"sense of moral authority\" should be conveyed. \"There is not enough discussion of moral authority in mainstream media ... Use it in the coverage. Constantly remind viewers that what Trump did last Wednesday led to the deaths of five people and the desecration of one of the most sacred symbols in American history and life.\"\n \"In the past half-decade, a news ecosystem has appeared where logical consistency and reality simply do not matter. Every once in a while, it presents itself to the wider public, and it's jarring,\" Collins wrote me. \"This happened last week, for example, when Matt Gaetz attempted to pin the Capitol riots on Antifa hours after Trump supporters stormed the room he was speaking in. Telling the truth is not the point. The point is to never lose the argument in the moment, and never look back.\"\n \"It will happen again this week with impeachment, as some Congresspeople who pushed election fraud lies for two months will be voting on impeaching the president for inciting insurrection fueled by people angry about those very same election fraud lies,\" Collins added. \"Healthy news consumers will be aghast at this development, that more excuses will likely be made for insurrectionists on the House floor. But it's a good time for straight news agencies to call this out: Some people seem more concerned with protecting a system that rewards constant lies and shifting excuses than protecting our democracy. So are they a victim of that ecosystem, and captured by that mob, or are they happily a part of it themselves?\"\n Zelizer said that the press should highlight the point of this impeachment: \"To draw lines in the sand as to what kinds of actions go beyond the realm of acceptable uses of presidential power.\" Zelizer said, \"The debate over the impeachment matters as many Americans are trying to process what happened.\"\n \"In talking about what happened the press should be thoughtful in its language,\" Zelizer added. \"Reporters should not describe this as merely a consequence of intense polarization and a divided America. This is about an act of violence against Congress, the building and the people, after the president and the GOP had been fueling the 'Stop the Seal' movement for weeks right up until the final moment. To talk about the insurrection this way is to be accurate, not biased.\"\n When I emailed Shafer for his thoughts, he (unsurprisingly) had a bit of a contrarian take: \"No special instructions for coverage are needed or desired. Journalists should try to break stories, expand them where they go, do it accurately, and prepare their mea culpas for where they err...\"",

        "body_text": "Mississippi has raised its new flag over the state Capitol for the first time. Gone is the Confederate imagery, and in its place, a white magnolia.\n (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n The House is set to vote today to impeach President Trump for the second time. The single article of impeachment charges Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" following last week's Capitol breach. With the House's Democratic majority and the votes of at least five Republican members who have said they will join the impeachment effort, the measure is certain to pass. That will make Trump the first US President to be impeached twice. Just like before, the article will then move to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far been silent on its prospects in his chamber, but he has indicated he believes impeaching Trump will make it easier to rid the Republican Party of his influence. The House also voted last night to approve a resolution calling for Trump to be removed from office through the 25th Amendment, but Vice President Mike Pence, whose power is needed for such a move, has made it clear he will not invoke it.\n Officials have opened more than 170 subject files and charged over 70 cases in their expansive investigation into the Capitol riot, according to yesterday's stunning Justice Department news conference. The acting US attorney in Washington said the scope of the crimes is \"mind-blowing\" and could include charges of sedition and conspiracy -- serious crimes that could result in up to 20 years in prison. Other officials described rioters engaging in open-handed combat with police officers and confirmed there were pipe bombs planted outside Republican and Democratic headquarters. New threats of terrorism are also rolling in ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration, including a plot described by a member of Congress in which thousands of armed extremists would surround the Capitol and prevent Democrats from entering. Meanwhile, YouTube has suspended President Trump's channel, the latest social media company to discipline the President for a post it said had incited violence.\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced it will require a negative Covid-19 test from all air passengers entering the United States starting January 26. The measure is intended to curb rising coronavirus numbers, which seem to be setting new records every day. The US yesterday recorded more than 4,300 coronavirus deaths -- a new daily high. Things are so bad in Ontario, Canada, the province is under a stay-at-home order, and officials have warned of a total collapse of health care systems. Japan has increased its state of emergency to seven more regions, and Ireland now has the world's highest Covid-19 rate. How did it happen? Irish health officials say the seasonality of the virus, plus holiday gatherings, have led to inconceivable numbers of cases and deaths.\n The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to reinstate longstanding restrictions for patients seeking a drug used for abortions early in pregnancy. This was the first abortion-related case to come before new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and it all but confirms abortion rights activists' fears that she will be a deciding conservative factor in such cases. The FDA restrictions require an in-person visit with a medical professional to pick up the medication, a measure federal courts previously blocked, citing pandemic concerns. Courts have been fighting over the medication abortion rule since last summer.\n A landmark report out of Ireland reveals thousands of mothers and babies died in church-run institutions known as \"mother and baby homes\" between 1922 and 1998. Such homes were places where unwed women and girls were sent, often against their will, to deliver their children in secret. In all, around 56,000 people, sometimes as young as 12, were sent to the 18 institutions investigated in the report. One in seven of some 57,000 children born in these institutions didn't survive long enough to leave. Irish Prime Minister Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said the report \"opens a window onto a deeply misogynistic culture in Ireland over several decades\" and said he is planning an official state apology to survivors.\n Now we don't even need to expend energy deciding what to watch. Just take us away, Netflix!\n Living room, or Star Wars command center? Who knows!\n Guess everyone's feeling lucky.\n Same, baby shark. Same.\n PROTECT THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS.\n The Russian opposition politician announced he plans to return to Russia on Sunday from Germany, where he's been recovering after being poisoned. \"There was never a question for me whether to return or not, never,\" Navalny tweeted today.\n \"The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman. Lisa Montgomery's execution was far from justice.\"\n That was the hotel occupancy rate in Washington DC during President Trump's inauguration in 2017. The rate for President Obama's inauguration was 96.8%. This year, Washington hotels and tourism sources are urging people to stay home instead of flocking to the capital to observe inauguration festivities.\n Cleaning is a LOT more interesting and satisfying when you're not the one who has to do it, don't you think?

        "title": "The tech industry used 'the nuclear option' to crack down on violent groups organizing online",
        "body_text": "Twitter's decision to ban President Donald Trump from its platform on Friday sent shock waves through the political and tech worlds. But a different tech crackdown that began later that night and continued through the weekend arguably has the potential to shift how people think about the internet and the companies that power it.\n Citing insufficient content moderation policies, Google removed Parler, an alternative social network favored by the far right, from its app store on Friday in the wake of the deadly riot at the Capitol last week. The next day, Apple followed suit, pointing to the same reason. Then the biggest blow: Amazon removed Parler from its cloud hosting service, Amazon Web Services, effectively making it homeless on the web.\n Okta and Zendesk, which provide back-end business services, both said they'd stopped working with Parler on Sunday.\n While it's become commonplace for social networks such as Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) to engage in some content moderation, it's much rarer to see comparable action from the companies that support the nuts and bolts of the internet. The companies that provide everything from web hosting services and domain registrations to cloud computing technology are still largely seen as neutral parties.\n \"It was the nuclear option,\" said Katie Fallow, senior staff attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute. Fallow said tech companies reacted with such strong actions, including the ban on Trump's account, in response to the \"extraordinary circumstance\" of violence at the Capitol.\n Amazon, for example, said it took action because it's seen a \"steady increase\" in violent content on Parler's platform, which violates the AWS terms of service. But the fact that these companies took such drastic steps raises some potential concerns.\n \"I see it as a shift from Silicon Valley cracking down on a lot of other violent groups around the world, like Islamist extremists, to cracking down on white domestic extremists,\" said Daphne Keller, platform regulation director at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center. But, she said, \"when you take down a whole platform, then you're affecting all of its users, including presumably some who weren't violating the law or Amazon's policies. It's a very, very blunt instrument when a service provider like AWS takes down a whole service.\"\n Keller added that it's troubling when internet infrastructure providers start engaging in content moderation because \"there just aren't as many of them.\" As a result, she said, \"it's much more consequential to lose access to internet infrastructure, especially if it means de facto that you're not on the internet at all.\"\n In a statement, Amazon said the lawsuit has \"no merit.\" The company said it had made its \"concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.\"\n Gab, another controversial alternative social network, was banned from Apple and Google's app stores and various payment processors after it was reported that the suspected shooter behind 2018's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre had a profile on the app and expressed virulently anti-Semitic views. (At the time, Gab said it had been unfairly \"smeared\" and was \"under attack\" for defending free speech.) It has boasted of having self-built much of the infrastructure it now operates on, making it theoretically immune from what's happening to Parler.\n \"There is a broader question that all of this raises about the fact that control over the speech of billions of people is in the hands ... of only a few corporate companies, and what does that mean,\" said Fallow of the Knight First Amendment Institute.\n Internet experts believe there could be more of these actions in the future. Keller said Amazon's move, for example, to kick Parler off AWS has set precedent for itself.\n \"Once you do it once, it is much harder to resist doing it again,\" she said.\n CNN Business' Brian Fung contributed to this report",

        "title": "Refinance applications spike 20% as homeowners rush to get low rates",
        "body_text": "In the past 12 months, mortgage rates fell to new record lows more than 15 times. But with an expectation that rates may soon begin ticking up, homeowners are racing to refinance.\n Refinance applications rose 20% for the week ending January 8 compared to the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. That's 93% higher than a year ago and the highest rate since March.\n Both conventional and government refinance applications were up, with applications for government loans having their biggest week since June 2012.\n \"Booming refinance activity in the first full week of 2021 caused mortgage applications to surge to their highest level since March 2020, despite most mortgage rates in the survey rising last week,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting.\n In MBA's survey of interest rates last week, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate climbed two basis points to 2.88%. But the 15-year fixed rate ticked down to 2.39% -- a record low.\n The share of mortgage activity that were refinances increased to 74.8% of total applications from 73.5% the previous week.\n With rates so low, the share of people who could benefit from refinancing is among the largest ever, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.\n Some 19.4 million homeowners are in a position to save an average of $309 per month by refinancing, according to a report by Black Knight in November when the average rate for a 30-year-fixed rate mortgage was at 2.72%. Those are just the homeowners who hold 30-year mortgages and have at least 20% equity in their homes, credit scores of 720 or higher, are current on their payments and who stand to cut their payments by at least 0.75% by refinancing.\n Purchase applications are up, too, increasing 60% from the previous week, and they are 10% higher than a year ago.\n \"Sustained housing demand continued to support purchase growth, with activity up nearly 10% from a year ago,\" said Kan. \"The lower average loan balance observed was partly due to a 9.2% increase in FHA applications, which is a positive sign of more lower-income and first-time buyers returning to the market.\"\n A combination of economic, political and pandemic-related factors suggest mortgage rates will slowly move higher this year. Kan said the expectation of additional fiscal stimulus from the incoming administration and the rollout of vaccines drove Treasury yields and rates higher last week.\n Mortgage rates typically follow the movement of long-term bonds, like the 10-year Treasury. But the Federal Reserve has kept its short-term interest rate near zero, acknowledging a fragile recovery.",

Now, after decades of fighting, he has been exonerated.\n Howard, who is Black, was sentenced to death in 1994, after being wrongfully convicted for the murder and rape of 84-year-old Georgia Kemp, who is White, in Columbus, Mississippi, according to the Innocence Project, which represented Howard.\n Howard was initially tied to the crime by a doctor who compared bite marks on Kemp's body to Howard's teeth. But in August, the Mississippi Supreme Court recognized that bite-mark comparisons were not enough to tie him to the murder, and stated that \"an individual perpetrator cannot be reliably identified through bite-mark comparison.\"\n \"After reviewing the record, we conclude that Howard's evidence as to the change in the scientific understanding of the reliability of identification through bite-mark comparisons was almost uncontested. Based on this record, we agree with Howard that a forensic dentist would not be permitted to identify Howard as the biter today as Dr. West did at Howard's trial in 2000,\" the court wrote in August.\n As a result, the case was reversed, rendered and remanded. Howard was released from Mississippi's death row in December, and he was exonerated on Friday, the Innocence Project said.\n \"I want to say many thanks to the many people who are responsible for helping to make my dream of freedom a reality,\" Howard said in a statement. \"I thank you with all my heart, because without your hard work on my behalf, I would still be confined in that terrible place called the Mississippi Department of Corrections, on death row, waiting to be executed.\"\n The United States has some of the highest incarceration rates in the world. By the end of 2019, more than 1.4 million people were incarcerated in the nation, according to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n Black Americans are disproportionately affected, and in Mississippi more than half of the prison population is Black, according to a report by the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit criminal justice research organization.",

        "body_text": "A SpaceX Dragon capsule started its journey back to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) Tuesday with an unusual cargo: 12 bottles of wine and 320 grapevines.\n They were taken into space in November 2019 and March 2020, respectively, as part of an experiment organized by European startup Space Cargo Unlimited (SCU), it said in a statement published Monday.\n The SpaceX capsule is scheduled to land Wednesday, according to a tweet from the ISS, and will splash down off Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n The research, known as Mission Wise, is exploring how to develop \"new ways of growing plants on the Earth and scale up to feed more people on the planet.\"\n The vines will be analyzed to see how they have changed during their time in space, where the effects of microgravity and a higher radiation exposure than on Earth accelerate genetic changes.\n Scientists will then compare them to specimens that remained on Earth, with the aim of adapting vines to grow in harsher environments.\n Expert tasters will also taste the 12 bottles of Bordeaux to see what effects its time in space has had on the wine.\n \"Space Cargo Unlimited will investigate how space radiation and microgravity affect wine components during the ageing process,\" the company said in a statement back in November 2019. \"This could yield results that help in understanding taste enhancement and food conservation.\"\n Researchers believe that vines and wine are \"ideal study materials\" to assess the future of agriculture as climate change continues to change growing conditions.\n Woody plants such as vines are crucial to feeding the human population, say researchers, but they have never been studied in space.\n \"This could be a game-changer in unlocking the agriculture of tomorrow,\" said Michael Lebert, SCU's chief scientific officer.\n Planned future experiments include measuring the effect of space conditions on the fermentation of bacteria and yeast, SCU said.",

        "title": "Fact-checking Trump's impeachment debate in the House",
        "body_text": "Only 13 months after the House first impeached President Donald Trump, lawmakers were back on Wednesday voting to impeach Trump an unprecedented second time for a US president. During the debate on the resolution, which charges that Trump incited a violent insurrection against the government on January 6, some of Trump's allies were still using many of the same arguments they did a year ago to criticize Democrats and defend Trump's actions. They also perpetuated misleading narratives about the events that led up to the attack on the Capitol.\n Here is a selection of false and misleading claims from Wednesday's impeachment proceedings.\n California Republican Rep. Tom McClintock said that Trump's remarks at the Washington, DC, rally that preceded the Capitol insurrection were overly confrontational and sometimes inaccurate -- but that Trump's words do not amount to impeachable conduct.\n \"But what did he actually say? His exact words were: 'I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.' That's impeachable? That's called freedom of speech,\" McClintock said.\n Trump, for example, urged Republicans to stop fighting like a boxer \"with his hands tied behind his back,\" saying, \"We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.\" Trump told marchers, \"You'll never take back our country with weakness.\" After urging congressional Republicans and Vice President Mike Pence to reject the Electoral College results, Trump said, \"And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.\"\n Trump alleged that there would be dire consequences if his supporters did not take immediate action -- saying that, if Biden took office, \"You will have an illegitimate president. That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen.\" And he said, \"We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\n Trump also spent much of the speech laying out a false case that the election was marred by massive fraud. And he falsely claimed, \"We won this election and we won it by a landslide.\"\n In sum: McClintock and other Trump allies are entitled to argue that all of these Trump comments are not impeachable, even that they are not incendiary. But he left a misleading impression when he posed the question, \"but what did he actually say?\" and did not mention the most contentious things Trump actually said.\n Texas Republican Rep. Lance Gooden said, \"And I also want to thank my Democratic colleagues for finally joining Republicans in condemning mob violence after six months of refusing to acknowledge it.\"\n Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon later made a similar claim, saying that, if the riot had any \"silver lining,\" it was that Democrats have now \"come to realize that riots are bad.\"\n Republicans are entitled to argue that Democrats should have issued such condemnations more forcefully or frequently, but it's just inaccurate to say or suggest they didn't issue the condemnations at all.\n Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan claimed the investigation from special counsel Robert Mueller cost $40 million and found nothing.\n Mueller never said Trump did nothing wrong. In fact, Mueller's final report explains that there was strong evidence that Trump obstructed justice, on several occasions. But Mueller decided not to make a decision on whether to charge Trump, for many reasons, including Department of Justice policy that a president \"cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office.\"\n The Mueller report also stated if his office \"had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"\n And according to figures released by the Justice Department, the investigation actually cost $32 million, not $40 million.\n Jordan also said, as he has as far back as 2019, that the whistleblower who filed the primary 2019 complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine \"worked for Joe Biden.\"\n It's possible the whistleblower interacted with Biden in the course of their job duties in the government, but that's substantially different than working for Biden himself. The whistleblower's lawyers said in 2019 that \"our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch\" and that \"in these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials -- not as candidates.\"\n CNN's Melissa Tapia contributed to this article.",

        "title": "Volkswagen and Audi are starting to challenge Tesla",
        "body_text": "The world's largest carmaker is starting to gain ground on Tesla.\n Volkswagen (VLKAF) sold 231,600 battery electric vehicles in 2020, according to figures published by the company on Wednesday. While that's still less than half the number of sales Tesla (TSLA) made, it represents an increase of 214% on the previous year and shows Germany's huge auto industry is beginning to mount a challenge to the leader in electric cars.\n \"We are well on track to achieve our aim of becoming the market leader in battery electric vehicles,\" Ralf Brandst\u00e4tter, CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n Volkswagen's most popular battery electric vehicle was the new ID.3, which sold 56,500 units. Sales of the compact e-Golf and even smaller e-up! were 41,300 and 22,200, respectively. Audi, the group's luxury brand, sold 47,300 e-tron SUV and sportback models, while customers purchased 20,000 electric Porsche Taycans.\n Sales of hybrid vehicles, which are powered by electricity and conventional fuels, also increased. Volkswagen sold 190,500 plug-in hybrids last year, a jump of 175% over 2019.\n \"2020 was a turning point for Volkswagen and marked a breakthrough in electric mobility,\" Brandst\u00e4tter said.\n Tesla still poses a formidable challenge, however. The company led by Elon Musk hit its goal of building 500,000 cars in 2020, it reported earlier this month. Production and deliveries rose by more than a third from 2019 levels, an impressive gain, especially considering that the company's factory in Fremont, California, was shut for nearly two months due to the pandemic. It's building a plant in Germany after opening another in China in 2019.\n Investors have rewarded Tesla by making it one of the world's most valuable companies. At $805 billion, Tesla's market value is more than eight times that of Volkswagen even though the German company makes roughly 19 times as many vehicles.\n Volkswagen has said it plans to invest \u20ac35 billion ($43 billion) in electric vehicles by 2025, and the sales figures for 2020 suggest that customers are beginning to respond. The manufacturing giant intends to launch roughly 70 pure electric models by 2030 as it races to catch up with Tesla.\n Other German carmakers are joining the race. BMW (BMWYY) sold 44,530 battery electric vehicles in 2020, a 13% increase over the previous year, and over 148,000 plug-in hybrids. Daimler's (DMLRY) Mercedes-Benz sold more than 160,000 plug-in hybrids and pure electric vehicles last year.\n The electric boom came even as the pandemic pushed overall industry sales into reverse. Volkswagen Group sold 9.3 million cars in 2020, a 15% decline over the previous year, but it said that deliveries were down just 3.2% in December as demand rebounded.\n Volkswagen is trying to prove that a carmaker that just a few years back was cheating regulators to sell polluting diesels can produce electric vehicles people want to buy and policymakers will embrace as they tackle the climate crisis.\n It's making significant inroads in some markets. In Norway, where financial incentives make most electric vehicle models cheaper to buy than similar petrol models, the Audi e-tron was the 2020 sales leader, surpassing Tesla's Model 3.",

        "body_text": "David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents of both parties and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-founded its Center for Public Leadership. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\nDonald Trump chose to focus on the wrong fence this week. Instead of calling our attention to the barrier he has been struggling to build on our southern border, he should have been focusing on the fence now surrounding our nation's Capitol in Washington, DC.\n The new fence, 7-feet-tall and considered \"non-scalable,\" should eventually find a home in the Smithsonian. Pieces of it would be an appropriate remembrance of just how dangerous and frightening the Trump years have been.\n Massive protests are nothing new in Washington, of course. In the 1970s, when I was working in the White House, protests against the Vietnam War reached a crescendo. I remember walking through a courtyard at the Old Executive Office Building and finding military tanks secretly stationed there, ready to move if trouble got out of hand.\n But those protests were wholly legitimate \u2014 citizens rising up to demand changes in government policy. In this past week, by contrast, we were watching as the leader of the executive branch of government incited mob violence in an attempted takeover of the legislative branch.  Through all of our history, although there have been attacks on our Capitol, we have never seen American citizens try to bring down our central government. Attempted overthrows by civilians have been rare as well among major Western democracies.\n The closest parallel to the Trump years for many has been the Hitler years in Germany. But even there, mobs weren't marching on the Reichstag. Instead the similarity to today is really more about clever deployment of disinformation by both men. As World War I ended, Hitler and his followers invented \"The Big Lie\": Germany did not lose the war on the battlefields, they argued; rather, its democratically elected leaders undermined the war effort back home. They convinced the electorate that opponents of the war, especially Jews, had delivered a \"stab in the back\" to German soldiers.  That was a huge lie, but its proponents rode it to power. Just as Trump has with his cynical narrative about Biden's election victory.\n Trump's greatest strength is perhaps his ability to convince large swaths of people that what is true is false and what is false is true.  He has become a master of \"The Big Lie\" \u2014 namely, that he won the election and Joe Biden lost. A majority of Americans don't believe him, but opinion polls show that roughly a third are still on his side, even after the bloody assault on Congress.  It will be extremely difficult for Biden to govern as long as large portions of our electorate believe his presidency is illegitimate.\n It is disturbing but true that Trump has become even more threatening to our democracy in the past few weeks. With the FBI warning that insurrectionists may stage new marches across 50 state capitols and are personally targeting Biden, Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi, one would think that Trump would have the decency and good sense to tell his followers to back off, put down your guns, and stay home. How can he continue to be so blind to his own self-interest?  Does he really want to leave office with more blood on his hands?\n Actually, the biggest test at the moment is not about Trump. It is whether the Republican Party will assume serious responsibility for keeping the peace in coming days. That third of the electorate still in Trump's corner won't listen to Biden or any other Democrat, but they might listen if a big chorus of conservative Republicans as well as business leaders now stand up and speak up \u2014 just as Rep. Liz Cheney has done in the House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is signaling in the Senate.\n As a people, we are staring into an abyss; things could well get worse before they get better. It is hugely important to the country now that we de-escalate and search for higher ground. If we can just get through the first hundred days of a Biden presidency with our democracy intact, perhaps we can all catch our breath, welcome in a little sunshine, and send pieces of that fence to the Smithsonian.",

        "title": "Here's what you need to know about impeachment",
        "body_text": "This explainer previously ran on January 12, 2021. On Wednesday, the House is voting on a resolution to impeach President Donald Trump a second time and may send it immediately to the Senate.\nThe overall impeachment process laid out in the Constitution is relatively simple: President commits \"high Crime or Misdemeanor,\" House votes to impeach, Senate conducts a trial.\n Those overall contours are constant. But there's no such thing as a routine impeachment.\n The one President Donald Trump faces now, after inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol, is unprecedented in all sorts of ways, which means the process will feel entirely new and different from the one we saw in late 2019 around the Ukraine investigation.\n Specifically, this House impeachment vote is likely to be done Wednesday, and the Senate trial is expected to occur after Trump leaves office.\n Here's another look at the impeachment process as it is spelled out in the Constitution and how it applies to this second impeachment of Trump, in which a US President is accused for the first time of inciting violence against another branch of government.\n The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Article 2, Section 4)\n There was a lot of debate during Trump's first impeachment and trial about whether the pressure he exerted on the President of Ukraine amounted to \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" or simply a set of policies.\n This time, while there's an argument he committed treason, Democrats in the House have alleged Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\"\n The Article argues that Trump incited his supporters by repeatedly denying the election results in the lead-up to the counting of the electoral votes, that he pressured Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" additional votes for him, and in doing so he \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,\" \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\"\n Read the entire thing here. It's short.\n The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. (Article 1, Section 2)\n Getting from Trump's misdeed to impeachment proceedings in the House took 86 days in 2019.\n It's going to take just a week in 2021.\n The House can essentially impeach at will. While there are precedents in place around instigating the impeachment process and utilizing House committees to investigate whether impeachable offenses occurred, none of that is necessarily required. And Democrats, moving quickly, aren't going to burden themselves by dragging this out.\n And why bother with an investigation when this time Trump did it on TV? In that first effort, the details of Trump's pressure on Ukraine leaked out over the course of weeks and built into Democratic support to launch and conduct an investigation and, ultimately, to impeach him.\n With Trump's time in office set to expire at noon on January 20, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also gave Trump and Vice President Mike Pence the option of avoiding impeachment if either Trump resigned or Pence mobilized the Cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n When those two offramps were ignored, Democrats in the House moved quickly toward impeachment and the first post-presidential impeachment trial in US history.\n Impeaching Trump in the House requires only a simple majority and Democrats hope to gain at least some support from Republicans.\n The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. (Article 1, Section 3)\n It took 48 days to get from Trump's December 19, 2019 impeachment to his February 5, 2020 acquittal. That process was slowed by a break over the holidays. The trial actually began January 16.\n This time it could be slowed by the fact that Trump won't be in office any more by the time the trial starts and new President Joe Biden will be asking the Senate to vote on his Cabinet nominees and act on legislation to address the Covid pandemic as well as relief for Americans hurt by the troubled economy.\n In 2020, Senate business ground to a complete halt during the trial. This time, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is hoping to pursue a half-day schedule to conduct the trial part of the day and business the rest of the day.\n The charges this time are much simpler to convey and understand, however. It should still take some number of days with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding and senators sitting in judgment. When both of the new Democratic senators from Georgia are seated, it will take 17 Republicans voting with Democrats to reach a two-thirds majority and convict Trump.\n Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. (Article 2, Section 3)\n The most unconventional aspect of this second impeachment effort is that Trump will be a former President by the time it concludes. There is precedent for former officials facing impeachment both in US history and in England, from whence the Founders imported the idea of impeachment. Read here about what's technically called a \"late impeachment\" from the scholars Frank Bowman and Brian Kalt.\n The swift effort to impeach him certainly puts Trump in the position of wanting to keep Republican senators on his side. In that regard, it would keep him in check during the last week of his presidency.\n Beyond the stain of being a President who a majority of Congress feels it's worth impeaching for a second time, conviction could mean he can't run for office again in 2024. Barring him from further office would require a second vote by senators, although it probably would not require two-thirds agreement. It could also cost him his more-than $200,000 per year pension if the Senate wants to take that way.\n ...he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. (Article 2, Section 2)\n Trump is widely thought to be considering the never-before-attempted self-pardon, to inoculate himself from future legal jeopardy related to his time in office and running for office. What's not clear is whether a late impeachment would have any bearing on his power to pardon himself. As the impeachment scholars Kalt and Bowman point out, the text of the Constitution doesn't mention pardons in terms of impeachment. It certainly seems like a successful impeachment would come up if and when a potential self pardon is challenged in court.",

        "title": "Metal detectors infuriate lawmakers as some Republicans erupt over new measures",
        "body_text": "The decision to require members of Congress to walk through metal detectors in the wake of last week's deadly siege has further inflamed tensions on Capitol Hill, at times prompting shouting matches between Republicans and Capitol Police.\n Members of both parties expressed frustration Tuesday night at the long lines ahead of the entrance to the House floor. Many Republicans view the measure as invasive, but several Democrats called them necessary as they increasingly view their colleagues across the aisle as security threats.\n And it all contributed to a sense of roiling fury in Congress ahead of the rancorous impeachment vote Wednesday.\n Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, a newly sworn-in Republican who ran in large part on a message emphasizing her commitment to Second Amendment rights and has bragged about her desire to carry a weapon on Capitol Hill, got into an altercation with police officers and initially refused to show police what was in her bag Tuesday night. She was eventually allowed into the chamber.\n \"It is a shame that Nancy Pelosi is trying to disarm Members of Congress in the very place that needed more protection on January 6,\" she said in a statement. \"It is clear metal detectors would not have deterred the violent acts we saw; this political stunt does nothing to improve the safety of Members in the Capitol complex.\"\n \"This is crap right here. You can put that down,\" said Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, who called the metal detectors the \"stupidest thing\" as he walked through them.\n Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, both Republicans, erupted at Capitol Police.\n \"I was physically restrained!\" Womack shouted. \"It's my constitutional right!\" cried Mullin.\n Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, also a Republican, told Mullin not to shout at Capitol Police.\n \"This is not their fault, they're doing their job,\" Davis said.\n But Davis, a top Republican on the House administration committee, told CNN he's \"pissed\" that the magnetometers have gone up without any consultation. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise told CNN the situation is \"untenable\" because it \"impedes the ability of members to come and vote. This is our job.\"\n Capitol Police eventually waved several lawmakers through without making them go through the magnetometers.\n House Democrats, however, have told CNN they are worried about some of their Republican colleagues and that there have been multiple conversations about the need for every member of Congress and their guests to start going through metal detectors. Several worry lawmakers are ignoring House rules regarding firearms.\n Referring to Boebert, freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina and others, one House Democrat described to CNN \"increasing tensions with certain incoming freshmen for months, who have been insistent on bringing firearms in violation of law and guidelines.\"\n \"There are concerns about the gun-toting members, but also we don't know who they're going to bring to the inauguration who can bypass the metal detectors,\" another House Democrat said. \"Until there's an investigation and until we understand our colleagues' level of complicity in the attack, we don't know how involved they really were. Until we have answers, I don't think we should trust them -- not all of them of course, but some of them.\"\n That Democrat noted that some of the House Republicans went onto the chamber's floor after last week's attack and continued to share debunked conspiracies about the 2020 election. That Democrat added that some refused to wear masks while they were sheltering in place and now at least three Democrats have tested positive for Covid-19.\n Some Democrats aren't happy about the metal detectors, either.\n \"I'm more likely to die of Covid because I got it from a colleague than I am to die because a colleague shoots me,\" Texas Rep. Filemon Vela, a Democrat, told CNN.\n CNN's Jake Tapper and Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine generates immune response, few side effects, in early trials",
        "body_text": "Early stage trials of Johnson & Johnson's experimental coronavirus vaccine show it generated an immune response in nearly all volunteers, with minimal side-effects, after a single dose.\n The company expects to report details of more advanced trials later this month and is hoping to apply for authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after.\n Researchers who tested the vaccine in a combined Phase 1-2 trial -- mostly meant to show safety -- found either one or two doses of the vaccine generated both antibody and T-cell responses against the coronavirus. The trials were not designed to show whether the vaccine protected people against either infection or symptoms of coronavirus -- that's what the ongoing Phase 3 trials are designed to do.\n Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, an international team of researchers who tested the vaccine in around 800 volunteers said the early stage trials showed it was safe and probably should work.\n The researchers -- in the Netherlands, the United States and Belgium -- tested the vaccine in a group of people 65 and older and a group ages 18 to 55.\n Vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies -- expected to stop the virus from infecting cells --  in 90% of all participants by the 29th day after the first dose of vaccine and in all of them by two months after the first dose. The levels of these antibodies stayed stable for at least 71 days, they reported.\n The FDA has given emergency use authorization to two coronavirus vaccines -- one made by Pfizer with its partner BioNTech, and another by Moderna. Both were about 95% effective in preventing symptomatic disease in their Phase 3 trials. They use messenger RNA or mRNA -- a new vaccine technology.\n Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm, Janssen, uses a different approach for its vaccine, called for now by its experimental name, Ad26.COV2.S. It uses a weakened version of a common cold virus called adenovirus 26 to carry genetic material from the virus into the body, prompting human cells to produce pieces of the virus which are then recognized by the immune system.\n \"A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S elicited a strong humoral response in a majority of vaccine recipients, with the presence of S-binding and neutralizing antibodies in more than 90% of participants, regardless of either age group or vaccine dose,\" the researchers wrote.\n \"An efficacious single-dose Covid-19 vaccine have obvious logistic advantages over a two-dose vaccine, especially during a pandemic.\" The company is studying whether a second dose increases efficacy or durability of the immune response.\n Side effects included headache, body ache and, more rarely, fever.\n \"The Company anticipates announcing topline Phase 3 data for its single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate in late January 2021; however, as this trial is dependent on disease events, the timing is approximate,\" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. But with the pandemic raging in the US and Europe, vaccine experts say, answers are coming quickly for vaccine trials.\n \"If the single-dose vaccine is shown to be safe and effective, the Company expects to submit an application for Emergency Use Authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration shortly afterwards, with other regulatory applications around the world to be made subsequently,\" Johnson & Johnson added.\n All of the companies making coronavirus vaccine have been manufacturing doses even as they test them, so they can roll them straight out to people should they get FDA authorization. Johnson & Johnson is contracted to deliver 100 million doses to the US government if it wins EUA from the FDA.\n The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Johnson & Johnson was behind schedule in its production, however.\n \"The pandemic shows no signs of slowing, and we, like everyone, are eager for more tools to help stop it. At the same time, it is premature to get into the specifics of the supply of our vaccine candidate, as we do not yet have Phase 3 data, nor have we filed for or been granted Emergency Use Authorization,\" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement Wednesday.\n \"We remain in active discussions with regulators, including on the approval and validation of our manufacturing processes.\"",

        "body_text": "His days as president of the United States may be numbered, but Donald Trump is going out of his way to light a string of wildfires for his successor to put out.\n While President-elect Joe Biden's immediate focus will likely be on the troubled domestic situation, with the Covid-19 pandemic and the political divide in the US, the Trump administration has also opted, as part of its final act, to hand him a series of new international diplomatic dilemmas. In some instances, these are life-or-death situations.\n In recent days, the Trump administration has named Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism, said it will designate Yemen's Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization, and upended decades of US-China diplomacy by lifting restrictions on contacts between American officials and representatives from the self-governing island of Taiwan.\n These moves, announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, mean Biden will start his presidential term with several key foreign relationships mired in controversy, thanks to the policies set by his predecessor.\n \"The Trump administration is locking in place a series of conflicts that change the starting point for Biden walking into office on the world stage,\" said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n Potentially the most difficult of the three, on a diplomatic level, comes from the change in relations with Taiwan.\n The US has walked a tightrope on this issue, maintaining a close relationship with Taiwan ever since it split from China in 1949 after the end of a bloody civil war, even going so far as providing weapons to the island.\n However, since Washington established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979, it has resisted having official diplomatic relations with Taipei in order to avoid a confrontation with the Communist leadership on the mainland, which still sees the island -- home to around 24 million people -- as part of China.\n Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that he wants to \"reunite\" Taiwan with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n Critics fear this week's move by the Trump administration will hand Beijing leverage over the incoming Biden administration, even though strengthened US support for Taiwan against an increasingly assertive China has largely been a bipartisan consensus in Washington.\n \"If the US decides it wants to work with China on climate change, for example, China can demand that the US reverses its position on Taiwan,\" said Pantucci.\n And whether China hawks in the US like it or not, Biden might well have to work with China to tackle climate change, global terrorism and all sorts of other issues.\n Analysts had long expected Biden to retain a hawkish position on China, but they believed he would work with international allies to build a coherent coalition, rather than maintaining Trump's maximum pressure approach.\n \"What Biden should do is work with European allies to have an aligned strategy towards China, but in order to do that you need some time to build that,\" said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the US and the Americas program at Chatham House. \"You don't need more immediate issues getting in the way.\"\n Getting partners -- especially those in Europe -- to share a unified position on China was already a difficult task.\n \"European nations have very different attitudes to China, with some -- like the UK -- very concerned and others -- like Italy and Germany -- more focused on China as an export market,\" says Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the UK's Foreign Affairs Select Committee.\n While it's tempting to suggest Biden could simply reverse the policy once he takes office, that ignores the lose-lose situation in which Trump has left the President-elect.\n As Pantucci points out, capitulation would \"cost Biden political capital at home,\" where anti-China sentiment is pretty strong across the political aisle. If Biden reimposes restrictions on contacts with Taiwan, it would also allow Beijing to claim that the US had accepted its status as a province of China.\n This \"could have major implications in Taiwan's democracy itself, as Xi and his allies have not been hesitant to assert their authority when given the space to do so,\" Pantucci added. While China is \"very unlikely to attack Taipei,\" Pantucci warned there could be \"more meddling [by Beijing] in politics, meddling economically\" if Trump's policy remains in place.\n The situation in Yemen is equally fraught and, as a result of the Trump administration's actions, potentially more deadly.\n The war in Yemen has dragged on since 2014. Diplomatic paths to ending the conflict between the Saudi-backed government and Iran-backed Houthi rebels have thus far failed.\n It has been described by UNICEF as the \"largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with more than 24 million people -- some 80 percent of the population -- in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 12 million children.\"\n \"The designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization will not help this conflict be resolved in any sense, and actually risks prolonging it,\" said Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding.\n \"There are risks that the Houthi hardliners will feel empowered to turn towards Iran more. They will be unwilling to engage in diplomatic processes or backchannels to Saudi Arabia.\"\n The longer the crisis goes on, the worse things will get for those in need of humanitarian assistance, analysts said.\n The terrorism designation will only make it harder for aid groups to deliver food and medical supplies to the country. It will also \"make it hard for aid organizations to have staff on the ground, as the Houthis can control the two main entry points to Yemen,\" Doyle said.\n \"By picking one side in a conflict, you can really harm the civilian populations and it's very irresponsible,\" Doyle added. \"The idea that you can bully the Houthis into softening their stance is a fantasy.\"\n Pompeo's redesignation of Cuba as a sponsor of state terror will probably have the least material impact, but it represents a personal loss to Biden and a significant political win for Trumpism.\n In doing so, Trump is hammering the final nail in the coffin of Barack Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba.\n Stories have and will continue to be written about how Trump's hard line on Cuba's Communist leaders played well with the Latino vote in Florida. This final act could well leave a legacy for whoever carries the Trump torch in 2024.\n \"If the US now goes to Cuba and says they want to reset back to where things were at the end of the Obama administration, Cuba can legitimately ask why it should bother when it's possible that someone like Trump could be elected again in 2024,\" said Pantucci.\n And a reset, while not top of his list of priorities, might have been something Biden would consider, given he was Obama's vice president.\n The legacy issue is something Vinjamuri to which is paying particularly close attention to.\n \"These really are the dying days of the Trump administration and they really seem to be laying the groundwork for something they can build on,\" she said, suggesting that Pompeo's final moves could be an attempt to burnish his hardline credentials for a run at the 2024 presidential election.\n Biden will be sworn into office on January 20. Trump will be gone -- at least for now -- but his impact on the world will be felt for years to come.\n And it could take an entire term for the new administration to untangle the eleventh-hour decisions made by its predecessor.",

He'll stay on for 30 days to \"ensure a smooth transition,\" a Biden transition official tells CNN.\n Slaoui said on a call with reporters last week that he had been in contact with the Biden administration and has been asked to become a consultant when the transition happens, to which he's agreed, CNN previously reported.\n It's common for a political appointee such as Slaoui to step down as part of the transition from one administration to another. It was not immediately clear if the Biden administration plans to appoint a successor.\n During his appearance on CNBC, Slaoui touted the success of Operation Warp Speed in getting two vaccines authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration and said it was always his intention to return to private life once that was achieved. He said he decided to \"prolong\" his \"tenure in order to support the new team as they come in.\"\n \"As you know, I'm very supportive of this upcoming administration and really, of course, of the operation and its mission and I will be doing everything I can to help them succeed,\" Slaoui said.\n Slaoui said he would continue to support the leadership of Operation Warp Speed \"in every possible way\" and expressed \"hope and confidence\" in the Biden administration's ability to take over the nation's vaccination effort.\n It's not clear whether Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, will stay in his role.\n Slaoui has been the most visible official leading the Trump administration's vaccine effort and was a notable voice of cooperation at a time when President Donald Trump refused efforts to begin a transition following his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden.",
