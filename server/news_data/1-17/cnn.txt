        "body_text": "It could be the first sunny Inauguration Day since President Bill Clinton was sworn in for his first term -- nearly three decades ago. However, a 20% chance of snow showers could keep a sunny swearing in from happening.\n \"Best timing for this (flurries) would be mid-morning into early afternoon,\" the National Weather Service said.\n That falls within the time period of the inauguration ceremonies. Joe Biden is scheduled to be sworn in as President at noon.\n If these snow showers don't materialize, it will be sunny. The forecast for Washington, DC on Wednesday calls for sunny skies with a noon temperature around 40 degrees. It is expected to be blustery, with sustained winds from the northwest at 10 to 20 mph, with gusts up to 38 mph.\n The afternoon high temperature should warm a few more degrees, peaking at around 41. Still, wind gusts will keep the \"feels like\" temperatures in the upper-20s to mid-30s for most of the ceremonies.\n Compared to the last few inaugurations, the upcoming one looks like it will have some of the most ideal weather conditions in the 21st century.\n Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration: Temperature of 48 degrees at noon. Cloudy. Sprinkles at swearing in ceremony; light rain at start of parade. South winds around 5 mph.Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration: Cloudy. South wind 7 mph. Temperature of 45 degrees at noon.Obama's 2009 inauguration: Filtered sun through cirrus clouds. Breezy winds gusting around 20 to 25 mph. Temperature of 28 degrees at noon with wind chill values as low as the mid teens.George W. Bush's 2005 inauguration: Mostly cloudy skies with a temperature of 35 degrees at noon. Around 1 inch of snow was already on the ground.Bush's 2001 inauguration:  A cool dreary day, with rain and fog -- visibility down to 2 miles, and a temperature of 36 degrees at noon. Bill Clinton's 1997 inauguration: Temperature of 34 degrees at noon with mostly cloudy skies. Clinton's 1993 inauguration: Sunny and pleasant with a noon high of 40 degrees.\n By far the worst weather belongs to the two inaugurations that led to fatalities of those living in the White House.\n In 1841, President William Henry Harrison was sworn into office on a miserable cloudy, cold and windy day. He stood outside for nearly two hours without a hat or overcoat. He wound up catching a cold which developed into pneumonia and he died just one month later.\n Then, in 1853, outgoing first lady Abigail Fillmore, who was attending President Franklin Pierce's very cold and snowy inauguration, sat on a cold, wet, and exposed platform during the ceremony. She ended up developing a cold as a result, which then turned into pneumonia, and she died at the end of the month.\n However, it is probably not fair to consider many of the Inauguration Days prior to 1937 since the seasons do not match.\n In 1937 Inauguration Day was moved from March 4 to January 20 as a way to shorten the lame duck transition period.\n For example, Woodrow Wilson in 1913 (first term) and Ronald Reagan in 1981 (first term) both had Inauguration Day weather consisting of cloudy skies and temperatures of 55 degrees. But one of those 55 degree days was in March (when the normal high is 52 degrees), and the other was in January (when the normal high is 43 degrees). So it is a bigger deal for Reagan than it was for Wilson.\n The snowiest month of the year for DC is actually February, right in the middle of both inauguration dates.",

        "body_text": "California could be facing the strongest wind event of the season this week, forecasters say.\n Strong, damaging winds began across portions of Northern and central California Sunday night and are expected to last through Wednesday.\n High-wind alerts were in effect late Monday afternoon for more than 30 million people from north-central California down to Southern California.\n A strong area of high pressure will build across the Northwest on Monday and this area of high pressure will shift into the Great Basin by Tuesday. While this area builds, an area of low pressure will develop off the southern coast of California.\n The proximity and strength of the two systems is important. This is known as the pressure gradient, which is forecast to be quite strong and will cause these intense winds to develop early this week.\n Winds flow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, so in this instance the winds for this event are expected to be offshore winds, when the wind moves from land out to sea. Locally across different areas of California these wind events are often referred to as \"Diablo winds,\" \"Mono winds,\" or \"Santa Ana winds.\"\n Areas of north-central California are already experiencing these strong winds, which will last through Tuesday.\n \"Gusts in populated areas may reach into the 30 mph range while in the hills and mountains, gusts into 40s and possible 50 mph range. Prepare now,\" the National Weather Service office in San Francisco said on Saturday evening.\n The strongest winds across Northern and Central California are expected to develop into Tuesday morning.\n \"We are gaining more confidence that widespread sustained NE winds of 35 to 55 mph will be possible with gusts of 70 to 80 mph, strongest below and through passes and canyons,\" the NWS office in Los Angeles said Saturday afternoon.\n The strongest winds across Southern California are expected on Tuesday.\n Winds this strong could lead to downed trees and power lines, power outages and potentially widespread critical fire weather conditions across much of the state.\n Typical fire weather conditions across areas of Southern California are fueled by a combination of above average temperatures, low humidity values, dry vegetation, and strong winds. The developing low pressure off the Southern California coast could limit some of these factors, bringing with it cooler temperatures and higher humidity values.\n Due to this, fire weather conditions could be somewhat limited early this week.\n However, many locations across Southern California, including Los Angeles, have not seen measurable rain since the end of December, meaning the vegetation across the region has had over two weeks to dry out.\n Southern California has also experienced record heat over the last several days, in addition to the growing drought across the region.\n When you factor in dry vegetation, drought conditions, and strong winds all it takes is one spark for a fire to begin and spread rapidly. The Storm Prediction Center has not ruled out the chance for critical fire weather conditions, especially on Monday.\n \"Confidence in the wind forecast remains fairly high, but colder air advecting into the region will begin a cooling trend that will improve RH (relative humidity) values during the forecast period,\"  the Storm Prediction Center said on Sunday morning.\n The SPC also said these humidity values could fall into the teens in some locations due to downsloping winds -- dry winds that flow from east to west through the mountain passes in California -- which could lead to a few hours of critical fire weather conditions on Monday afternoon.\n This area of low pressure will however bring some much needed rain and snow to portions of the Southwest over the next few days, which will help toward lowering the widespread drought conditions across the region.",

        "title": "A nation on edge braces for this week's transfer of power ",
        "body_text": "The nation is entering inauguration week with an unnerving police and military presence guarding the vestiges of democracy -- with Americans holding their breath as federal officials warn about threats of violence and potential unrest fueled by President Donald Trump's corrosive and dangerous lies that the election was stolen from him.\n Normally the inauguration of a president is a joyful event that brings thousands of people to Washington to celebrate. But with authorities determined to stave off the terrifying scene that unfolded during the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, Washington, DC -- once the crown jewel of democracy admired around the world -- now resembles a police state as authorities try to ensure a peaceful transfer of power when President-elect Joe Biden takes the oath of office on Wednesday. Some 25,000 National Guard troops have been deployed, military vehicles are blocking some of DC's streets, the National Mall is closed, and tall fences and barricades protect this country's sacred buildings as movement is restricted.\n Deep within the fortressed capital city, Trump remained out of public view during his last weekend in power -- unrepentant for the violence he incited and unwilling to abandon the false election claims that have riled up his supporters. In that absence of leadership, Biden tried to get Americans focused on a more hopeful future as his team outlined the first steps he will take in office to try to aid struggling Americans amid the pandemic and fulfill campaign promises on issues like climate change, criminal justice and immigration.\n But with fewer than four days left in the Trump presidency, the nation remains on edge.\n In another unsettling sign of the potential threats posed by homemade bombs or explosives -- like the ones planted outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters earlier this month that didn't go off -- the US Postal Service has removed blue mail collection boxes from certain jurisdictions in 18 states as a security precaution.\n With America forced into that security state by the actions of a careless and autocratic commander in chief, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager in the House, argued Sunday morning that Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate should convict the President in the upcoming impeachment trial to make it clear that there are consequences for his actions that led to the siege at the Capitol.\n \"I don't think anybody would seriously argue that we should establish a precedent, where every president on the way out the door has two weeks, or three weeks, or four weeks, to try to incite an armed insurrection against the union or organize a coup against the union \u2014 and if it succeeds, he becomes a dictator and if it fails, he's not subject to impeachment or conviction, because we just want to let bygones be bygones,\" the Maryland Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\" \"This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America. The most dangerous crime by a president ever committed against the United States, and there are Republicans who are recognizing it, as well as Democrats.\"\n Though Democrats have argued that the President presents a \"clear and present danger\" to the nation, Raskin said he did not know when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would transfer the article of impeachment to the Senate, which has been out of session.\n Biden has said that impeachment will be up to Congress and he has declined to offer his opinion about the upcoming trial in the Senate. But his incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told Tapper on Sunday that it is clear that Trump \"did incite this mob on January 6\" and Biden officials remain concerned about the broader threats surrounding this week's ceremonies -- even though they believe that the Secret Service, with assistance from the National Guard, will \"keep the inauguration itself safe.\"\n Klain noted that Biden decided to run for president after hearing Trump's remarks following the demonstrations by White supremacists in Charlottesville and the murder of 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer, who was part of a group of counter-protesters opposing the presence of the alt-right groups that day.\n \"The events of the past few weeks have proven out just how damaged the soul of America has been, and how important it is to restore it. That work starts on Wednesday,\" Klain said.\n In these final days of the Trump presidency, the National Guard presence in Washington is a stronger military footprint than the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined -- a scenario that would have once seemed unthinkable in the nation's seat of democracy. But Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Saturday the added security was \"necessary and warranted.\"\n \"This is as if we were under attack from a foreign enemy,\" Van Hollen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\" \"What's so sad about it is that it's an attack on our democracy from within, instigated by the President of the United States.\"\n Many state capitols are also ramping up security to avoid being caught flat-footed as US Capitol Police were on January 6. With the FBI warning last week that \"armed protests\" are being planned in all 50 states, Michigan State Police, for example, have mobilized personnel from across the state to secure the state Capitol in Lansing in coordination with the FBI and the National Guard.\n Michigan, in particular, is familiar with the threats posed by armed protesters, who gathered last spring to demonstrate against restrictions related to Covid-19. With demonstrations expected Sunday, a fence has been erected around the state Capitol, and Lansing Mayor Andy Schor asked Michiganders to stay out of the downtown area and avoid engaging \"with demonstrators who come to our city with ill intentions.\"\n The Michigan House and Senate have canceled sessions Tuesday through Thursday because of \"credible threats.\" And Airbnb is also reviewing reservations booked around Lansing during inauguration week, saying they will cancel reservations booked by guests associated with violent hate groups.\n Unwilling to take responsibility for the fear that has rippled across the nation after watching the January 6 attacks, Trump remained out of sight at the White House this weekend -- still stripped of the ability to communicate with his followers via major social media channels like Facebook and Twitter.\n But in what appeared to be another overtly political move at the 11th hour, his administration tried install a Trump loyalist as the top lawyer at the National Security Agency -- a civil servant job, not a political appointment -- who would be harder to fire after Biden takes office, sources told CNN.\n Eschewing the customary handoff between presidents on Inauguration Day, Trump plans to head to Palm Beach, Florida, hours before Biden takes the oath of office. But Trump remains keenly interested in how he will be celebrated when he leaves the White House for the last time, contemplating a departure ceremony that could include a red carpet, a color guard, a military band and even a 21-gun salute, an administration official told CNN's Jim Acosta.\n Trump is also preoccupied in these final days with building a legal team to defend him during his upcoming impeachment trial, as a number of high-profile advisers who defended him the last time he faced a Senate trial make it clear they are not interested in this second round.\n Though the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was seen Saturday at the White House, a Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley tweeted that the President has not yet selected the team that will represent him \"for the disgraceful attack on our Constitution and democracy, known as the 'impeachment hoax.'\" The President is leaving office with the lowest approval rating of his presidency (34%), according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, and 54% of Americans say he should be removed from office because of his role inciting violence at the Capitol on January 6.\n The President has resisted calls from his aides to give a final speech recounting the accomplishments of the administration. Instead, Pence -- who will be attending Biden's inauguration -- continues to be the public-facing leader of the administration, traveling to Naval Air Station Lemoore in California on Saturday to give a speech touting the administration's national security achievements.\n \"The American people are grateful,\" Pence told sailors as he thanked them for their service on behalf of the Trump administration. \"And I want to assure you that you have our deepest respects for the selflessness and courage that you personify every day.\"\n The vice president argued that the military is now \"more equipped than ever\" and added -- with no irony, even though parts of the nation are currently locked down under heavy guard -- that he was \"proud to say, with just a few days left in this administration, this is the first administration in decades not to get America into a new war.\"\n While it has been hard for Biden to capture the nation's attention after the security breach at the Capitol, Klain penned a memo detailing the executive actions Biden would take on his first day of office to reverse some of the policies of the Trump administration, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding the ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries.\n Biden also rolled out his first signature legislative initiative this past week when he announced his $1.9 trillion relief package to mitigate the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic and expand and accelerate the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine across the United States.\n But Biden's advisers are concerned that the Senate's focus on impeachment could draw the Senate's attention away from critical tasks like confirming members of the President-elect's national security team and his Cabinet.\n \"It's important for the Senate to do its constitutional duty, but also to do its constitutional duty to move forward on these appointments -- on the urgent action the country needs,\" Klain told Tapper Sunday, noting that the Senate was able to conduct confirmation hearings for nominees during its morning sessions while Trump's previous impeachment trial was underway. \"I hope that the Senate leaders, on a bipartisan basis, find a way to move forward on all their responsibilities.\"\n Klain's memo about Biden's upcoming executive actions said the President-elect would sign orders halting evictions and giving relief from student loan payments to those struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden also plans to institute a mask mandate at federal sites and for travel between states. The President-elect has challenged Americans to mask up in his first 100 days in office.\n Biden also plans to introduce an immigration plan within his first 100 days that would include a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants living in the United States. In late January and early February, he also intends to ask the federal government to devise a system for reuniting children separated from their families at the US-Mexico border and will focus on moving criminal justice reform.\n On Sunday, Klain highlighted Biden's plans to streamline the nation's slow and lurching system for administering the Covid-19 vaccines by speeding up delivery, ensuring an adequate supply of second doses for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and by using the Defense Production Act to, for example, produce syringes that would allow health workers to extract six doses from each vial, instead of five, thereby increasing the vaccine supply by 20%.\n \"We're inheriting a huge mess here,\" Klain told Tapper. \"But we have a plan to fix it.\"\n This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.\n Jim Acosta, Josh Campbell, Jeremy Diamond, Jamie Gangel, Dan Merica, Peter Morris, Artemis Moshtaghian, David Shortell and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \"Burning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\" Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is trying to get out of the gate running. Even before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Biden has announced a $1.9. trillion stimulus plan, a massive list of executive orders that will undo President Donald Trump's most controversial decisions, and an immigration reform proposal to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million people. Whereas Trump was most interested in building a wall, Biden hopes to build new communities of citizens.\n With Washington, DC in a state of military lockdown, the pandemic surging throughout the states, and a Senate impeachment trial looming, the President-elect is wasting no time.\n As a veteran of national politics, Biden understands that the most valuable commodity for any new President is time. His sense of urgency is reminiscent of another highly experienced President with a deep resume on the Hill: Lyndon B. Johnson.\n Upon taking over the presidency in November 1963 following the tragic assassination of John F. Kennedy, Johnson mapped out a schedule to his closest advisers, including Bill Moyers, to impress upon them just how quickly their window for making progress would be open. Johnson clutched a notepad with a truncated scheduling filled with handwritten columns of months going from November until 1968. Johnson's message was that he had about a year and a half before the politics of the midterms kicked in and his chances for legislating started to dwindle. \"Bill, I've just been figuring out how much time we would have to do what we want to do,\" Moyers recalled Johnson saying. \"I really intend to finish Franklin Roosevelt's revolution . . . In an ideal world . . . we would have about 110 months to his 144 months . . .  I'll never make it that far, of course, so let's assume that we have to do it all in 1965 and 1966, and probably in 1966 we'll lose our big margin in Congress. That means in 1967 and 1968 there will be a hell of a fight.\"\n Biden hopes to convey the same message at a moment of even greater urgency. Even with many Democrats wondering how he will make any progress as the Senate deals with the articles of impeachment and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell relies on the filibuster to obstruct, the President-elect won't be locked down.\n Biden's goal is to reverse the damage that Democrats believe has been inflicted by Trump. Through executive action, he plans to end the travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries and rejoin the Paris climate accord on his first day in office. He will also do what Trump refused to do to fight the pandemic, including a mask mandate on federal property and interstate travel and working to reunite families separated at the US-Mexico border. Biden's stimulus plan would provide the kind of economic assistance to states and localities, $350 billion worth, that Republicans have blocked and move toward a bold immigration plan that undoes the era of restrictionism.\n Unlike some other famous first 100 days, like FDR in 1933, Biden's plan primarily aims to reverse the direction of policy under his predecessor and stabilize society from the pandemic rather than setting out on a fundamentally new path that remakes public policy. Nonetheless, given the circumstances, the plan is extremely ambitious.\n Besides executive orders and legislation, the biggest issue in the coming months is an implementation issue. There Biden has also shown he will not be passive. His incoming administration has promised to vaccinate 100 million people in 100 days. He is working to open new vaccine centers and has said he will use the Defense Production Act to ramp up the distribution of shots.\n If Biden works on getting this agenda going, the Senate impeachment trial of Trump would not stifle Biden's first 100 days. With the Senate doing the heavy lifting, the trial and the vote will allow Democrats to achieve some measure of accountability. There is even some chance that a sufficient number of Republicans could break toward conviction.\n The strategy won't be easy. Biden will inevitably come under fire for using the same kind of executive action that Trump was criticized for using. Though Republicans have lost control of the Senate, Senator Mitch McConnell still holds immense power if his caucus remains united and the Democrats don't abandon the filibuster. The fury and anger of Trump's loyal base, part of the GOP, will loom large. And Biden must lead in a world where the conservative media continues to pump out conspiracy theories and smears as he moves forward.\n But Biden's effort to start fresh could work. The nation might be in crisis, but he won't act like a trapped President. The most important power of the President in the early days is to set the agenda -- to lay out the issues that will be debated and to push Congress toward the issues that he wants examined.\n While President Gerald Ford tried to end \"our long national nightmare\" by pardoning President Richard Nixon for crimes that he might have committed, Biden is taking a different path. He is trying to reset the policy agenda, to lift us out of our national lockdown and move back to the period when we had ambitions to make this a more welcoming and engaged nation, one working to curb climate change, to open improved world markets and to get us out of the world that Covid-19 has created.",

        "body_text": "A 70-foot rocket, riding beneath the wing of a retrofitted Boeing 747 aircraft, detached from the plane and fired itself into Earth's orbit on Sunday \u2014 marking the first successful launch for the California-based rocket startup Virgin Orbit.\n Virgin Orbit's 747, nicknamed Cosmic Girl, took off from California around 10:30 am PT with the rocket, called LauncherOne, nestled beneath the plane's left wing. The aircraft flew out over the Pacific Ocean before the rocket was released, freeing LauncherOne and allowing it to power up its rocket motor and propel itself to more than 17,000 miles per hour, fast enough to begin orbiting the Earth.\n \"In both a literal and figurative sense, this is miles beyond how far we reached in our first Launch Demo,\" the company posted on its Twitter account.\n The rocket flew a group of tiny satellites on behalf of NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites, or ELaNa, program, which allows high school and college students to design and assemble small satellites that NASA then pays to launch into space. The nine small satellites that Virgin Orbit flew on Sunday included temperature-monitoring satellite from the University of Colorado at Boulder, a satellite that will study how tiny particles collide in space from the University of Central Florida, and an experimental radiation-detection satellite from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\n About four hours after takeoff on Saturday, Virgin Orbit confirmed in a tweet that all the satellites were \"successfully deployed into our target orbit.\"\n The successful mission makes Virgin Orbit only the third so-called \"New Space\" company \u2014 startups hoping to overhaul the traditional industry with innovative technologies \u2014 to reach orbit, after SpaceX and Rocket Lab. The success also paves the way for Virgin Orbit to begin launching satellites for a host of customers that it already has lined up, including NASA, the military and private-sector companies that use satellites for commercial purposes.\n Virgin Orbit spun off from Virgin Galactic, a company focused on suborbital human spaceflight, in 2017. Virgin Orbit conducted several \"drop tests\" of its LauncherOne rocket, which involved flying the vehicle out over the Pacific and letting it plunge into the ocean to vet the 747's release mechanism. Virgin Orbit's first attempt to put a rocket in orbit came last May, when LauncherOne malfunctioned shortly after release and the flight was aborted. That failure wasn't unexpected.\n \"Launching from the Earth to space is mind-bogglingly difficult,\" the company said after the 2020 launch attempt.\n Virgin Orbit had expected to try a second orbital launch attempt in late 2020, but the company was forced to postpone after \"a few\" of its employees tested positive for Covid-19, according to an email from the company. That left many employees potentially exposed to the virus and under preventative quarantine, the company said.\n \"We're grateful and fortunate that most of our teammates have since cleared their preventative quarantines, allowing us to proceed with pre-launch operations,\" the company said on December 31, \"albeit with even more extreme measures in place to protect the health and safety of our team.\"\n Virgin Orbit, like other space technology companies in the United States, is permitted to continue operations throughout the pandemic because the government deemed the space sector part of the country's \"critical infrastructure\" in March. As one industry group argued, the sector's commercial activity is also intertwined with crucial US national security projects and NASA programs.",

        "body_text": "Amid a devastating resurgence of the coronavirus in parts of Brazil, federal health officials have finally voted to authorize two vaccines for emergency use. Sunday, Brazilian regulatory agency Anvisa approved both the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the Coronavac vaccine.\n Minutes later, Monica Calazans, a Black nurse from downtown S\u00e3o Paulo, became the first Brazilian to be vaccinated. Calazans, who is at high risk for Covid-19 complications and works in an ICU that has been at 90% capacity or above since April, exploded into tears before receiving the Coronavac shot.\n \"You don't understand what this means to me,\" she told S\u00e3o Paulo state governor Jo\u00e3o Doria.\n Brazil is the country hit hardest by Covid-19 in Latin America. It has recorded more than 8 million cases and more than 200,000 deaths from coronavirus. While several of its neighbors have already approved vaccines for use, Brazil has seemed to lag despite its renowned public health and vaccination track record.\n Coronavac, developed by Chinese company Sinovac, is now authorized for use of 6 million imported doses. It has a history in Sao Paulo state, where the local Butantan Institute conducted Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine. Butantan will also produce future doses.\n However, Coronavac has shown a low average efficacy rate of 50.4%\u2014 barely above the 50% minimum established by the World Health Organization. The number, which falls far below the 78% previously announced, has raised questions about the veracity of the data and fueled skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.\n The technical report from ANVISA greenlighting Coronavac stressed that the agency had also taken into account the urgency of Brazil's skyrocketing Covid-19 cases and \"the absence of therapeutic alternatives.\"\n It also recommended that the vaccine be monitored further, noting the Butantan Institute had not provided important data from its Phase III study, such as the duration of protection provided by the vaccine and its effect on the elderly, those with comorbidities and other patient groups.\n Doria has promised to make vaccines developed in the state available to Brazil's federal health ministry for national distribution.\n \"Today is V day. It is the day of the vaccine, it is the day of truth, it is the day of victory, it is the day of life,\" he said at a news conference after the vaccines were approved -- a pointed jab at Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello's reluctance to commit to a start date for nationwide vaccinations, which he previously said would begin \"in the D Day and in the hour H.\"\n The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which showed 70.4% average efficacy in preliminary Phase III trials, has also been approved for use of 2 million doses, which will be imported from India's Serum Institute by Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz).\n Fiocruz signed a deal to purchase and produce the vaccine with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca in June. After successive delays, the Brazilian government signed in October a contract for 256 million doses and announced that it would receive the first ones in December.\n After another series of delays, Fiocruz expects to receive the first shipment by the end of January.\n CNN's Rodrigo Pedroso reported from S\u00e3o Paulo and Caitlin Hu reported from New York.",

Some of the tweets earned labels from Twitter noting: \"This claim about election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can't be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.\"\n The Georgia Republican bemoaned her suspension in a statement Sunday calling on Congress to \"act swiftly\" to \"protect free speech in America.\"\n \"Conservative Americans shouldn't be afraid to speak their mind. They shouldn't have to fear being cancelled by American corporations where they work, do business, and use services,\" she said. \"They shouldn't be scared into submission by Socialists who want to end their way of life.\"\n Greene's suspension comes as the social media platform continues to crack down on misinformation in the wake of the US Capitol breach that left five dead, including a US Capitol Police officer. Earlier this month, Twitter banned President Donald Trump from the platform indefinitely, and later, suspended more than 70,000 accounts for promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said last week, \"I believe this was the right decision for Twitter\" to ban the President but maintained that he did not \"celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here.\"\n \"While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us,\" he added.\n Though only elected to the House in November, Greene has long peddled conspiracy theories and bigoted views online.\n In the years before she ran for office, Greene wrote two conspiracy-laden blog posts speculating that the 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which led to one counter-protester's death, was an \"inside job\" and promoting a debunked conspiracy alleging some Democratic Party leaders were running a human-trafficking and pedophilia ring -- known as \"Pizzagate\" -- as real.\n CNN's Ryan Nobles and Michael Warren contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN.\nThe Founding Fathers would have been disgusted by President Donald Trump's serial abuse of the pardon power. Nearly 90% of his pardons to date have gone to friends or politically connected allies -- including corrupt politicians. While the President's pardon power may seem unconstrained by the Constitution, a closer look shows that Trump is violating every principle the framers of the Constitution assumed would be followed by a principled President -- and there's evidence they intended special constraints on a President's pardon power after they'd been impeached.\n Remember, the Founders were focused on restraining the power of the President to ensure he would not turn into a new type of tyrant. That's why the President's pardoning power was so hotly debated at the constitutional convention.\n Virginia's George Mason argued that the President \"ought not to have the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself... If he has the power of granting pardons before indictment, or conviction, may he not stop inquiry and prevent detection?\" Mason warned that this could \"destroy the republic.\"\n But wait, some will say, the Founders did not ultimately enshrine Mason's warning into the Constitution's broad final language: \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\"\n In response, I'll raise you President James Madison and Alexander Hamilton.\n Madison argued that a President's pardoning power would be restricted during the impeachment process -- precisely the situation Donald Trump finds himself in today. As the Brookings Institution's D.W. Buffa explains, \"What can stop him pardoning anyone who was involved in the crimes for which the president is being impeached or whose testimony might put him in jeopardy? The president, according to Madison, still holds office, but he no longer has the power to pardon. The House can 'suspend him when suspected, and the power will devolve on the Vice-President. Should he be suspected, also, he may likewise be suspended till he be impeached and removed, and the legislature may make a temporary appointment. This is a great security.'\"\n Hamilton, likewise, believed that Presidents' broad pardoning powers did not mean they would operate without ethical constraints. In Federalist 74, Hamilton discussed the debate over presidential pardons at length -- and made it clear that he assumed the President, then expected to be George Washington, would be a \"man of prudence and good sense.\" This is unfortunately not the case with Trump.\n Hamilton also assumed that pardons would be used to address an injustice, at a time when many crimes were punishable by death. As a result, he reasoned that checks and balances on the President's pardoning power -- such as advice and consent from Congress -- could result in a literally deadly delay that would deny justice forever.\n When the now timely subject of sedition or treason were raised as extreme examples for presidential pardon power, Hamilton argued that \"in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to recall.\"\n In this, Hamilton perfectly anticipated the scenario when President Washington offered a pardon for charges of treason brought against the instigators of the Whiskey Rebellion less than a decade later. Mercy secured the public good.\n But if President Trump offers a broad pardon or amnesty to his supporters who stormed the US Capitol in an attempted coup on January 6, the prospect of a general pardon would be to reward his supporters for an attack on the government -- not to secure the common good. This is the opposite of what the Founders intended.\n Which brings us to the final insult: the idea that a President can pardon himself. This is absurd on its face \"under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the president cannot pardon himself.\" That was the principle cited by a 1974 Office of Legal Counsel opinion during President Richard Nixon's politically fatal travails with Watergate. Advocates of the unitary executive might come up with other arguments, but the undeniable logic of the principle still stands. The alternative would put the President above the law and give him the power to legally excuse any tyrannical action he took in office. This was clearly not what the Founders intended.\n And for what it's worth, the President's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, argued on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in 2018 that \"the President of the United States pardoning himself would just be unthinkable. And it would lead to probably an immediate impeachment.\"\n Speaking of impeachment, it's clear that the Founders' assumption that impeachment would be a constraint against abuse of the pardon power was imperfectly thought out. They did not adequately appreciate that Presidents would issue their most controversial pardons on their way out the door, making the prospect of impeachment less of a deterrent to this abuse of power.\n In any case, there are a few constraints in place. No pardon can protect a person from prosecution for future crimes. There is no permanent get out of jail free card. Moreover, presidential pardons do not restrict state and local prosecution, which Trump has every reason to fear.\n The Founders' intent also makes a strong case that pardons for people who may have committed a crime at the order of a President or blanket pre-emptive pardons to family members and political cronies ought to be rejected by any judge who calls themselves an originalist. (For a deeper dive into this argument, I recommend reading Professor Aaron Rappaport in Just Security).\n Regardless, there clearly is a need for reform of the President's pardoning power -- even if it is to formalize past democratic norms, like the Justice Department signing off on recommendations, which should be based on clemency, not cronyism.\n When President Bill Clinton bypassed regular Justice Department channels to pardon financier Marc Rich, there was resounding and repeated outcry from conservative editorial boards -- the Wall Street Journal, in particular. But they have been largely silent about Trump's corrupt abuse of the pardoning power to date. Notably, a then-Senator named Joe Biden was quoted in a February 13, 2001 WSJ editorial as saying it was \"totally indefensible.\"\n This kind of moral consistency across partisan lines is rare (though GOP Sen. Ben Sasse accurately slammed the pardon of Paul Manafort as \"rotten to the core.\"). But the investigations that followed Clinton's dodgiest pardons should certainly be pursued in Trump's case.\n The purpose of the pardon is to do justice, not to excuse injustice. Donald Trump, characteristically, seems hell-bent on doing the opposite -- to benefit himself. And more sordid pardons on his way out of the White House will only solidify his reputation as the worst and most corrupt President in American history.",

        "body_text": "Were there hour-by-hour countdowns to the end of the Bush presidency? The end of the Obama years? No, definitely not to this extent. Trump's time in office is ending in ignoble fashion. There are countdowns to noon on Wednesday because Trump is leaving in disgrace -- the first president to do so since Richard Nixon. Trump \"long ago stopped governing, but he walks away with a reputation that is sealed now: that of one of the worst presidents in United States' history and certainly the most dangerous,\" David Gergen said on CNN Sunday evening.\n Even at this late hour, Trump is delusional about his election loss, or he is still in deep denial, or some combination thereof. He is \"still, and I think it's important to say, according to people I've spoke to, still telling people that he won,\" Maggie Haberman reported on \"Reliable Sources\" Sunday morning. \"You know, he's still maintaining this. So, the idea that he has accepted the loss, he is not there yet, if he is ever going to get there.\"\n Trump's inability to face the truth of his loss to Biden might explain why he has barely faced reporters at all in the closing weeks of his presidency. Even more remarkably, he rarely ever called into his favorite TV shows. Aside from a couple of chats with Maria Bartiromo and Brian Kilmeade and some WH-produced videos, he's been invisible.\n \"I think the feeling is, if he goes out and talk more, he is simply going to add fuel to the fire,\" Haberman said. \"That's part of why we are not hearing him, as people are afraid of what he will say -- people meaning his advisers -- what he will say off the cuff in an interview.\"\n American presidents typically deliver a thoughtful farewell address to the nation. Will Trump? We know he wants a made-for-TV sendoff on Wednesday, but it's unclear if he wants to speak about his legacy. CBS News is reporting that he will speak \"at a farewell event on the tarmac of Joint Base Andrews.\" It's also unclear how TV networks would handle such a speech, given his past deceptions and incitements.\n >> I'm not raising these questions because I \"want\" to hear from Trump, per se. I'm raising the Q's because what leaders don't say is often more revealing than what they do say. Trump is scrapping norms all the way until the very last minute of his presidency, by getting out of town before Biden takes the oath...\n VP Mike Pence has been attending briefings and holding events, trying to project American leadership since Trump can't. Speaking to sailors in California on Saturday, Pence said he was proud that \"this is the first administration in decades not to get America into a new war.\" I appreciate what he meant, about foreign entanglements, but America is not at peace. The war has come home. Here's my \"Reliable\" monologue.\n Pence \u2014 who, in an alt-history of the Trump age, would have become president had Trump been convicted by the Senate or deemed unfit by the cabinet \u2014 landed back in DC Sunday night after his final official trip in office. Per the press pool, he stepped off Air Force Two and \"paused for a minute to look around and take it all in.\" As he descended the stairs, the pool reporter shouted questions: \"Sir, are you worried about violence on Wednesday?\" And: \"Will you greet the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday?\" Pence did not answer.\n Haberman told me that one of the constants of the Trump era was the \"constant sense of incoming,\" a sense driven in large part by his Twitter feed.\n His Twitter feed is gone now, but that duck-and-cover sense hasn't totally faded away yet. Years of history are happening in days. \"We thought with 2020 behind us, things might slow down,\" but so much for that, USA Today editor Nicole Carroll said on Sunday's show.\n John Dickerson brought this up in a piece for \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" He said \"the new Biden administration may benefit by simply offering a steady stream of useful information -- potentially reviving the long-forgotten 'slow news day.'\"\n He interviewed Jill Lepore, who said, \"You actually just have to show up, have actual information, bring people in who are doing their jobs, and answer the questions that the press and the public have.\" Sounds simple -- and refreshing...\n With Biden about to take over, it's a good day to read or re-read inaugural speeches, and other compelling addresses by past presidents. I re-read John F. Kennedy's 1961 speech to newspaper publishers, which contains a lot of wisdom about democracy, national security, and the power of the press. Kennedy spoke of \"our obligation\" -- both his and the news media's -- \"to inform and alert the American people, to make certain that they possess all the facts that they need, and understand them as well -- the perils, the prospects, the purposes of our program and the choices that we face.\" Read or listen to the speech here...\n -- On Sunday night the NYT home page led with America's Covid-19 failure, noting that \"the country is hurtling toward 400,000 total deaths...\" (NYT)\n -- We should all recall that Trump said 100,000 to 200,000 total deaths would count as a \"very good job.\" The death toll will surpass 400,000 by the time he leaves the WH...\n -- On \"Face the Nation,\" incoming CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said \"we expect half a million deaths in this country\" by mid-February... (CBS)\n -- Walensky was part of a coordinated push by the Biden transition team to have reps on all five of the biggest Sunday morning shows...",

Before then, he had been crowned Asia champion four times for rock climbing, and at one point had ranked eighth globally.\n After his accident, he resumed climbing by attaching his wheelchair to a pulley system and using his upper body strength to haul himself up. Five years ago, he ascended the 495-meter (1,624 feet) high Lion Rock mountain, a local folk culture symbol of Hong Kong's strength and grit.\n \"Apart from just living, I wondered what drives me? So I began to chase that, knowing that there was a possibility I could climb mountains, even in a wheelchair,\" Lai said. \"In a way, I forgot that I was a disabled person, I could still dream and I could still do what I liked doing.\"\n On Saturday, Lai could not make it to the top of the 300 meter (984 feet) tall Nina Tower due to safety concerns. But, he said, he hoped his climb could send a message.\n \"Some people don't understand the difficulties of disabled people, some people think that we are always weak, we need help, we need assistance, we need people's pity,\" he said.\n \"But, I want to tell everyone, it doesn't have to be like that. If a disabled person can shine, they can at the same time bring about opportunity, hope, bring about light, they don't have to be viewed as weak.\"",

        "body_text": "The National Security Agency said Sunday it was installing Trump National Security Council staffer Michael Ellis as its general counsel, after acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller ordered NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone to place the Trump loyalist into the role.\n \"Mr. Ellis accepted his final job offer yesterday afternoon. NSA is moving forward with his employment,\" an NSA spokesperson said in a statement. Ellis will start in his new role on Tuesday, according to a source familiar.\n Ellis, who was a lawyer for the NSC, had been named to the position in November, but the NSA had yet to move him into the role. The Washington Post and CNN reported Saturday that Miller, who was installed as acting defense secretary as part of a purge of agencies after the election, had ordered Nakasone to install him into the position, giving him a Saturday evening deadline.\n \"The General Counsel of the Department of Defense is the sole selection authority for the position of General Counsel of the National Security Agency - as well as all other senior career DoD General Counsel positions,\" according to a statement from the Department of Defense. \"The Director of the NSA does not select or approve of candidates for the position of the NSA General Counsel.\"\n The move is significant because the role of general counsel at the country's largest intelligence agency is a civil service position, not a political role, meaning it could be difficult for the Biden administration to remove Ellis. The strategy of trying to install political loyalists into career positions is known as \"burrowing\" in the government.\n The Pentagon declined to comment Saturday when news of the deadline broke.\n Within days of Ellis being picked for the job in November, which came shortly after President Donald Trump fired then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper via Twitter, Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Jack Reed requested an investigation from the Pentagon's acting inspector general, saying in a letter, \"The combination of timing, comparative lack of experience of the candidate, the reported qualifications of the other finalists, and press accounts of White House involvement create a perception that political influence or considerations may have played an undue role in a merit-based civil service selection process.\"\n Before joining the Trump administration, Ellis served as the head counsel to California Rep. Devin Nunes, one of Trump's staunchest supporters. Ellis then became a lawyer with the NSC, refusing to testify as part of the House's 2019 impeachment inquiry. In March 2020, Ellis became the senior director for intelligence on the NSC, joining other Trump loyalists in key intelligence positions.\n When reached by The Washington Post on Saturday, Ellis said: \"I don't talk to the press, thank you,\" and hung up. CNN has been unable to reach Ellis for comment.\n Susan Hennessey, a former NSA attorney and CNN legal and national security analyst, ripped the decision to install Ellis in the Trump administration's last weekend in power. \"At this point, no one should extend this selection process the benefit of the doubt. By all indication, the Trump admin is violating civil service rules and politicizing an apolitical role. If Ellis is installed tonight, Biden should remove him on Day One,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n The general counsel of the NSA is not a Senate-confirmed position, Hennessey explained on her Lawfare blog, which removes a step of Congressional oversight that exists for roles such as general counsel of the CIA, Pentagon, or Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The goal of this process was to remove any political bias in appointing a candidate to one of the key roles at the NSA.\n \"This is a really difficult, really important job and we have a process to ensure only qualified individuals are in the role *BECAUSE* it is necessary to the national security of the United States,\" Hennessey wrote on Twitter.\n This story has been updated with a statement from the Defense Department.",

The source told CNN that Pence will make some final calls Monday and is \"hopeful\" they'll connect.\n The attempted outreach from Pence is just the latest example of the vice president taking on more of the public-facing role of commander-in-chief as President Donald Trump is holed up in the White House, silenced on social media and refusing to speak to the man who beat him or abandon the baseless election conspiracies that helped incite the rioters. Pence, on the other hand, called Vice President-elect Kamala Harris last week and visited National Guard members guarding the Capitol.\n Many in Pence's orbit remain furious at how Trump behaved the day of the insurrection attempt, which brought rioters within seconds of encountering Pence and members of his family in the hallways outside the Senate chamber.\n Footage from the January 6 insurrection captured by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic shows Goodman being chased up a Capitol staircase by a mob of insurrectionists shortly after they'd broken in. When he reached a landing, he looked to his left, where he noticed the door to the Senate chambers was still unguarded. He then led the rioters to the right, away from lawmakers and toward backup officers.\n The Senate chambers wouldn't be secured until one minute later, according to CNN's timeline of events from the riot.\n As a result, a bipartisan trio of lawmakers wants to recognize Goodman with a Congressional Gold Medal for potentially saving lives.\n Democratic Reps. Charlie Crist of Florida and Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri and Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation last week to award Goodman the medal, reserved for Americans who've made \"distinguished achievements and contributions\" to their country.\n \"By putting his own life on the line and successfully, single-handedly leading insurrectionists away from the floor of the Senate Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman performed his duty to protect Congress with distinction, and by his actions, Officer Goodman left an indelible mark on American history,\" the legislation reads.\n CNN's Scottie Andrew and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Warren. Currently a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Chopra will -- if confirmed -- return to the CFPB, where he previously worked as its top student loan watchdog. The nomination of Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive turned ferocious advocate for stricter regulation on big banks, is a signal that Biden's team is poised to take a harder line with Wall Street than previous administrations.\n The choices are a victory for the Democratic Party's progressive wing, which has led the charge for more aggressive oversight of the financial industry. Chopra was in on the ground floor with Warren, who built the CFPB as part of the Dodd-Frank law passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Gensler worked in the Obama administration for a time as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he earned a reputation as a hardliner on regulatory matters.\n \"These tireless public servants will be a key part of our agenda to build back better \u2014 and I am confident they will help make meaningful change and move our country forward,\" Biden said in the statement.\n Bloomberg and Politico were first to report news of the expected nominations.\n As word of the picks emerged on Sunday night, progressive groups and others committed to lessening Wall Street's influence in Washington celebrated.\n \"There are a lot of financiers who get incredibly rich taking advantage of lax 'regulators' of both parties in order to essentially defraud the American people. Those people are nervously conducting Zooms with high priced lawyers right now,\" said Jeff Hauser, head of the Revolving Door Project. \"Biden's financial regulatory regime right now is exactly what he needs to produce tangible, positive results for everyone who is not a slimy banker.\"\n Chopra was among the names of preferred potential nominees listed early on in the transition by the Progressive Change Institute, which was founded by the same duo who formed the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Warren-aligned group.\n \"If Biden selects someone of Rohit Chopra's gravitas to lead the CFPB, that would be a big win for consumers and a sign that executive power will be used to get tangible results for the American people,\" the PCCC tweeted on Sunday night. \"Rohit has a proven record of challenging corporate abuse on behalf of everyday families who don't want to be cheated.\"\n The selection of Chopra, who held the Student Loan Ombudsman title during his time at the CFPB, will also boost confidence among progressive leaders who have been pushing Biden to act swiftly and ambitiously to address the student debt crisis.\n Warren and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, have called for Biden to use his executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt per borrower. Biden, though, has appeared reluctant to meet that figure or bypass the Congress with his more limited proposal of $10,000 per person.\n But he has called on lawmakers to act and plans, through his Department of Education, to extend the current pause on student loan payments.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

She suggested that this update would ensure that animals \"aren't caught off guard and things don't end in a very tragic way.\"\n As it turns out -- Teslas and other electric cars are required to do this, as of September 2020. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now requires electric cars to emit sounds of at least 43 decibels when they're traveling at speeds less than 18.6 miles per hour.

        "title": "Tim Cook: Why I kicked Parler off Apple's App Store",
        "body_text": "Apple, along with Amazon and Google, effectively kicked Parler off the internet in the wake of the January 6 US Capitol siege. Despite criticism that Big Tech wields too much power over speech, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his decision.\n \"We looked at the incitement to violence that was on there,\" Cook told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n \"We don't consider that free speech and incitement to violence has an intersection.\"\n Parler, the alternative social network popular with conservatives, had been surging in popularity in recent months. But the platform failed to rein in hate-filled, violent speech, which Big Tech companies said could lead to another violent attack. Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) booted Parler off their app stores and Amazon (AMZN) stopped hosting the service.\n The ability to stop billions of people from easily accessing a social network is a weighty responsibility -- one that critics of all political persuasions have argued does not belong in the hands of a select few millionaires and billionaires running the world's largest companies. Some critics of Apple and its cohort's decisions to ban Parler have argued that pushing the app out of the mainstream will drive participants to dark channels of the internet -- and potentially deeper down the rabbit hole of radicalization.\n But Cook disputed that it's Apple's job to host every service, regardless of its content. He noted that Apple has terms of service for the 2 million apps its hosts, and apps that refuse to play by the rules aren't allowed to access Apple's massive audience.\n \"We obviously don't control what's on the internet, but we've never viewed that our platform should be a simple replication of what's on the internet,\" Cook said.\n Apple will welcome back Parler -- provided Parler finds a new cloud provider to host the social network -- if the app effectively moderates users' speech, said the Apple CEO.\n \"We've only suspended them,\" Cook noted. \"If they get their moderation together they would be back on there.\"\n Apple's CEO has criticized other tech companies for lacking ideals -- including sacrificing users' privacy by chasing profit. But Apple, the world's most valuable company, has to tread lightly. Its substantial size and power mean any controversial move can get under the skin of regulators that have sued other Big Tech companies, including Google and Facebook, for violating antitrust law. Forcing other companies to bend to its will isn't going to make Apple's argument easier if it finds itself under scrutiny for allegedly abusing monopoly power.\n Still, Cook argued Sunday that running a tech company is about more than making big bucks. He said Sunday that he believes Apple's mission should be to solve some of the world's biggest problems. The company and its employees are always trying to do the right thing -- a mission that motivates him to come to work each morning.\n That helped influence his decision about Parler -- particularly in the wake of the Capitol siege.\n \"It was one of the saddest moments of my life -- seeing an attack on our Capitol and an attack on our democracy,\" Cook said. \"I felt like I was in some sort of alternate reality, to be honest with you. This could not be happening.\"",

        "title": "New Delhi's teachers are being sent to the Covid frontlines, some without training, PPE or even pay",
        "body_text": "Every morning, teacher Vikas Kumar texts video lessons to his students before going to his second job as an untrained, frontline coronavirus worker.\n The 27-year-old normally teaches physical education but, like thousands of other government teachers in New Delhi, he was deployed to the pandemic frontline when the virus started spreading in India last March.\n Since June, Kumar has filled a number of roles alongside his teaching duties. First, he said he distributed ration kits to the poor, then he was assigned to conduct door-to-door surveys of neighbors of confirmed Covid cases. In that role, which involved taking residents' temperatures, Kumar says he contracted the virus and was ill in July for 17 days.\n In 2020, at least 28,000 teachers were deployed to Covid-19 roles, according to two teachers' associations in New Delhi. At least 35 teachers have died from Covid-19 during the pandemic, and hundreds more fell ill, they said. CNN reached out to the Delhi Ministry of Health to verify these numbers and received no response.\n Several teachers in the Indian capital told CNN they were given no training and are juggling their coronavirus duties with their normal teaching roles. Those working for the municipal corporations, which are the local-level governing civic bodies in Delhi, say they haven't been given enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield them from the virus. Others say they haven't been paid their normal salaries for months.\n \"The central government is telling the nation to take health and safety precautions but here, the Delhi Municipal Corporations (DMCs) are telling us to expose ourselves to the virus every day,\" said Vibha Singh, the senior vice president of Nagar Nigam Shikshak Sangh (NNSS), a union representing about 20,000 teachers in DMC schools.\n Teachers who do not report for their assignments can be threatened with action under the Delhi Disaster Management Act, according to Sant Ram, an elected member of the Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA). The first orders under the act were made in March as coronavirus spread throughout the country.\n Since then, more than 10,000 people have died in New Delhi, of more than 150,000 deaths nationwide. India is second only to the United States with more than 10.4 million confirmed cases, according to the global tally by John Hopkins University.\n When the virus started spreading through India in March, the central government ordered a nationwide shutdown that forced schools to shut. In major metropolises, including New Delhi, they have remained closed since.\n Teaching moved online and state and local authorities in the capital started assigning teachers to alternative duties to help execute the government's efforts to combat the virus.\n When some schools were turned into hunger relief centers, Alka Sharma, Additional Commissioner of East DMC, an administrative official for the district, says engaging teachers in the work \"made sense.\"\n However, since then teachers have been enlisted to do a wider variety of pandemic duties. Some were tasked with issuing fines to the public for disobeying the mask mandate, facilitating the screening of incoming passengers at Delhi international airport and conducting door-to-door surveys to help identify Covid-19 cases.\n A lot of these duties were short-term projects but many teachers, including Kumar, were moved from one assignment to another.\n Kumar said after spending 10 days distributing ration kits he was assigned to a dispensary where he was asked to knock on the doors of 50 houses surrounding confirmed Covid cases.\n He said he took the names, ages, travel history, comorbidities, and any coronavirus symptoms of people in each household. While he was provided with a mask, sanitizer, and a head cover, he said he wasn't given any training.\n \"If we had received training, it would have been better. We were given these oximeters and non-contact thermometers, but not everyone knows how to use them,\" Kumar said. \"We need training for how far we should stand, how to maintain people's safety and our own.\"\n \"We should be told how to ask (the survey) questions better. It's very hard to deal with the public and their reactions. So, training could make it easier and improve our work,\" he added.\n Delhi Directorate's Director of Education Udit Prakash Rai and the Directors of Education from all three DMC school zones -- East, North and South -- did not respond to requests for comment on allegations that teachers weren't given enough training or PPE.\n Sharma, the Additional Commissioner of East DMC, says teachers can request an exemption from Covid duties and applications are considered on a case by case basis.\n Sarita Yadav, 38, a primary school teacher in North DMC, said she was assigned to distribute food and ration kits in May and June, but was given no training or PPE.\n \"I bought everything out of my own pocket. I wasn't given masks, no sanitizers,\" she said. \"I purchased sanitizer, gloves, masks.\"\n Yadav said she and her colleagues in North DMC haven't been paid since August. Singh of NNSS said non-payment was an issue for teachers across the northern municipal area.\n \"Our family's circumstances are really bad,\" Yadav said, adding that festivals were difficult. \"Diwali is a big festival and everyone wants to buy new clothes. We told our kids we're not going out or shopping because of the pandemic.\"\n \"The children wanted to do something nice for Christmas. We coax them but we have no answers for them. It's so bad that now I'm worried I won't be able to pay their school fees.\"\n The lack of pay extends to teachers in East DMC, according to Singh, from NNSS teachers' union, who is also the principal of a school in East DMC. She said teachers there have not received their salaries since September.\n Sharma, the Additional Commissioner of East DMC, said the municipal corporation doesn't have enough money to pay the district's teachers.\n \"Our priority is (to pay) Covid workers, but we don't have the funds right now,\" she said. \"If we have money in our coffers, then everyone gets the salary.\"\n Sharma did not indicate when she expects funds to be available again.\n CNN has seen copies of several letters that NNSS and GSTA have sent to local and state authorities seeking better treatment for teachers on Covid duty and exemptions for older teachers.\n Similar letters from the NNSS demand better support for DMC teachers to execute their Covid duties, including PPE kits, regular testing and compensation for the families of teachers who contract the virus and die.\n The teachers' associations say they haven't received a satisfactory reply. CNN asked the Director of Education for the North DMC about claims that teachers weren't being paid and didn't receive a response.\n In June, another teachers' union in North DMC schools took teachers' complaints over no pay to the Delhi High Court.\n Teachers' union Akhil Dilli Prathmik Shikshak Sangh (ADPSS), which represents 20,000 primary school teachers across all the DMCs, filed a petition alleging its members hadn't been paid since March.\n In its ruling, the court said teachers on pandemic duties were \"corona warriors,\" the name the Indian government gives to workers helping to fight the pandemic.\n \"Teachers belong to one of the noble professions and, as they are made to do Covid-19 duty also, they can be equated to Covid-19 warriors,\" the judges said.\n The court ordered the North DMC to pay the salaries owed to teachers, but the teachers and their unions say they haven't received any payments since July.\n The court also ruled that if any teacher died as a corona warrior on duty, the family should receive compensation of Rs. 1 crore or about $135,000. But several families are still waiting for their compensation, according to teachers' unions.\n Several teachers told CNN they appreciated the Delhi Court ruling, but said there was little recognition of what a corona warrior has to sacrifice to keep others safe.\n They say teachers are working long hours, and months of unpaid salaries and inadequate PPE is making a difficult job even more challenging.\n \"Nobody takes it seriously. If they did, then at least they would pay our salary,\" said Yadav, the teacher. \"What is the point of a job and a salary, when we don't have it in time of need?\n \"We have stopped buying fruits now, in order to bring down our expenditure. Our savings have completely depleted. We used to save Rs. 10,000-20,000 a month ($136 to $270) but now we're at nil.\"\n \"When anyone working at a DMC office expresses suspicion of having Covid-19 symptoms, the whole office is sealed. The officials also go into home quarantine regardless of whether they came in contact with the individual with the possible infection,\" the letter states, adding that the same procedure is not followed for school staff.\n Instead, if a teacher expresses concern over possible Covid-19 symptoms and wants to isolate but has no test results, the person is threatened with action against them, the letter claims.\n \"Why is there a double standard for principals, teachers and school staff?\" the letter asks.\n Government schools cater to poor and low-income households where enrolled students are often first-generation learners and may not have support from their families to make up for lost time with teachers.\n Teachers say they are behind on the curriculum as the final exams fast approach in March, the most critical time of the academic year for senior students.\n \"If teachers are going on these duties, who is teaching?\" asked GSTA's Ram.\n The government has \"put the future of these kids at stake,\" said Singh of NNSS. \"They don't have help from their parents, who don't always know how to read or write themselves. If they are separated from teachers, what will they do?\"\n Before the pandemic, Yadav, the primary school teacher, said she repeated her lessons multiple times for kids to understand. With her time stretched between the pandemic duties and schooling, combined with the lack of equal access to technology among her students, it became even harder, she said.\n \"They don't have internet, they don't have smart phones. We can't give them worksheets. We ask them to call us if they have any issues. But they can't understand all the time,\" she said.\n Since mid-November, Kumar has been back on duty, knocking on doors again, which is how he says he got the virus last year. This time, he is among the teachers helping the Delhi government to survey containment zones and hotspots to identify symptomatic people and their contacts and ensure they get tested. Again, he says he received no training.\n Each day, when Kumar finishes his pandemic duty, he holds online video calls with his students.\n Meanwhile, Yadav still awaits her salary.\n \"I just want them to pay our salary, even if it is two months of salary,\" she said.\n The longer the pandemic drags on, the greater the cost to teachers -- and their students, said Ram of GSTA.\n \"We've gotten complaints. We have seen teachers die,\" he said. \"There is so much mental pressure on teachers.\"",

        "title": "Corporate earnings don't look great. But the drought may be over soon",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nIt's report card season for Corporate America. Companies are starting to release their earnings for the fourth quarter of last year, and so far it doesn't look like many blue chip stocks are going to get a passing grade. There's good news though: 2021 is likely to be a lot better.\n Big banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) reported results Friday that showed there are still concerns about the pandemic's impact on consumer and small business behavior. Delta (DAL) also reported a record loss last week as coronavirus ground travel to a halt.\n According to estimates from FactSet Research, companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report that their profits fell by about 7% in the final three months of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year. That, however, should be the end of the earnings drought.\n FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters told CNN Business that S&P 500 profits should rebound in the first quarter, with analysts forecasting a nearly 17% year-over-year jump in the first quarter and a more than 46% surge in the second quarter. For the full year, Butters said profits should rise more than 22%.\n Of course, companies will face relatively easy comparisons to last spring considering that much of the US economy essentially shut down for several months beginning in March. That's one reason why stocks have surged back to near record high levels.\n But the rally may be justified, especially if vaccinations and stimulus lead to a quicker return to normal.\n Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest, said in a report that \"worries about valuations could be overblown.\"\n \"There's also a good chance Wall Street is underestimating earnings growth in 2021. Earnings estimates for this year continue to climb,\" she added.\n Many companies tightened their belts during the pandemic, cutting costs in order to preserve profit margins. That means that any incremental sales growth will have a much bigger impact on future earnings.\n \"The very strong margin performance during the pandemic bodes well for earnings growth over the next couple of years as revenue growth resumes,\" said David Lefkowitz and Matthew Tormey, equity strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a report.\n With that in mind, investors will be keeping an eye on the forecasts from big companies when they report results next week. (US markets are closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.)\n Several other big banks, most notably Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), are scheduled to report. Also on tap? Earnings from Netflix (NFLX), UnitedHealth (UNH), Procter & Gamble (PG) and United Airlines (UAL).\n Two tech giants of the Dow that have made big personnel moves lately are also set to report their latest earnings.\n IBM (IBM), which recently hired former Trump economic adviser and ex-Goldman Sachs chief operating officer Gary Cohn as its vice chairman, reports as the company is set to spin off a big chunk of its older businesses in order to focus on its cloud operations.\n And struggling chip company Intel (INTC), which announced that CEO Bob Swan would be stepping down after just two years at the helm, will likely talk more in its earnings release about how it can get back on track.\n This year could be the most consequential for Alibaba (BABA) since it was founded two decades ago, my CNN Business colleague Jill Disis reports.\n China's most famous tech company faces a host of challenges at home and abroad that risk fundamentally changing it forever. Chinese authorities are investigating the company on\u00a0antitrust grounds, while also pushing its sprawling financial affiliate, Ant Group, to\u00a0overhaul its business.\n To make matters worse, the company's figurehead \u2014 co-founder and former chairman and CEO Jack Ma \u2014 has been out of public view\u00a0for months.\n The other threat is Washington. While the Trump administration has backed off a proposal to ban American investment in Alibaba and two other prominent Chinese tech firms, US-China tensions are likely not going away anytime soon.\n It could all make for a very rough 2021 for Alibaba.\n \"Alibaba, like all other big Chinese tech, is in [an] existential crisis,\" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore.\n Monday: US markets closed\n Tuesday: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, State Street and Netflix earnings\n Wednesday: BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Procter & Gamble, UnitedHealth and Alcoa earnings; EIA report on crude inventories\n Thursday: Baker Hughes, Truist, Union Pacific, IBM and Intel earnings; ECB decision; US initial unemployment claims\n Friday: Ally Financial and Schlumberger earnings; US existing home sales",

        "title": "Trump's last year in office will define his legacy, historians say",
        "body_text": "Historians face a daunting task when it comes time to assessing Donald Trump's presidency, during which news often moved at breakneck pace, and the ramifications of his one-term presidency have yet to be determined.\n CNN spoke with nine historians who largely agreed that Trump's final year in office -- mainly, his failure to properly respond to the pandemic and his incitement of a mob of rioters at the US Capitol -- has done more to cement Trump's legacy than the first three years of his presidency. In addition to his Covid-19 response and the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Trump's handling of his first impeachment Senate trial, racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans and his challenge to the 2020 election represents his time in office boiled down to a year, they said.\n Trump has set himself apart for his style of communication, including freewheeling speeches and speaking off the cuff in an informal manner. He threw out personal insults, cursed publicly, and regularly repeated mistruths. He used Twitter to govern and issue directives, appeal directly to his supporters, and spread conspiracies. He amplified the cultural wars, stoked racial divisions, and emboldened right wing extremism.\n He vilified judges and courts for rulings he disliked, railed against the \"deep state\" and worked to undermine US intelligence agencies, attacked his own Cabinet members, and waged war against the oversight of his own administration by firing agency watchdogs. A recent directive from Trump makes it easier to push out career officials from the federal government and replace them with loyal political appointees.\n \"The Trump legacy is an exhausted, divided, bruised country with strained institutions,\" Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian for CNN, said.\n Jeff Engel, a presidential historian and author of \"Impeachment: An American History,\" told CNN that he doesn't \"think that anything that President Trump did this year surprised anyone -- either his supporters, or his detractors, or neutral critics.\"\n \"What he managed to do over the first three years was to genuinely reveal who he was and everything the last year has just deepened the color palette for that portrait,\" Engel said.\n The coronavirus pandemic, upending all facets of American life, has consumed not only contemporary analysis of Trump, but also has shaped how the 45th President will be perceived long term, Engel said. As of Sunday, Covid-19 had claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 Americans and infected more than 23 million in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n \"If you had asked me before the pandemic, I probably would have talked a lot about the tax cuts, deregulation, even immigration,\" Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and a CNN contributor, said. \"The pandemic swept up the country and defined what was going on. And so by definition, everything he has done this year will be elevated beyond anything in the first three years.\"\n Such a health crisis would have challenged any American president, but Trump downplayed the pandemic as it spread, pushed unproven treatments, flouted health recommendations, maligned his government's health experts and politicized mask-wearing. His government worked expeditiously to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in record time, which is being touted as a remarkable scientific achievement. But Operation Warp Speed has fallen behind meeting expectations in administering doses to Americans.\n Historians told CNN that the vaccine accomplishment has to be weighed against Trump's other decisions in handling the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Trump, Engel said, had an opportunity to rise to the challenge and change the narrative of his presidency, and \"one of the things every President needs in order to go down in history as a significant or great president is a great crisis.\"\n Historians also told CNN that Trump's legacy will be marred by his refusal to concede the 2020 presidential election and advancement of misinformation and distrust in the American electoral process. All that crescendoed to January 6 -- in a violent mob of pro-Trump rioters who breached the US Capitol and demanded that Congress stop its certification of the 2020 election, which Trump lost to President-elect Joe Biden.\n \"Those images will endure, have left profound damage on our democratic processes, and will define the Trump era,\" said Laura Belmonte, a history professor and dean of Virginia Tech's College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences.\n Kathryn Brownell, an associate professor at Purdue University, told CNN that January 6 was a \"culmination of the ways in which Trump, supported and enabled by many in the Republican Party and in conservative media, has flagrantly flouted laws and norms over the course of his presidency.\"\n The attack on the Capitol, Brownell said, \"with the encouragement and direction of President Trump, was shocking and unprecedented. It revealed the extent to which America's dark and violent history of white supremacy continues to threaten democracy today, just as it has for centuries -- something that historians have repeatedly highlighted not just in the past week, but over the past five years.\"\n A week later, enraged by the January 6th events and threat to democracy and their lives, the US House voted to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection\" -- making Trump the first president in US history to be impeached twice.\n Trump's first impeachment -- for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- in December 2019 and acquittal by the US Senate in February 2020 may be viewed as a \"just something between commas in a long list of bizarre moments and breaking of norms,\" Engel said.\n Historians say that there's any numbers of ways that Trump shattered norms of the American presidency and politics, but Belmonte is not convinced much of Trump's legacy will be terribly enduring. She argued that Trump lacks a signature legislative achievement comparable to Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act or George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act.\n Presidential historian H.W. Brands told CNN that it's \"too soon to tell\" what Trump's most lasting legacy will be but that \"if Trump had won reelection, then his novelties might have become new standards.\"\n \"Trump weakened the confidence of other countries in American leadership, but confidence can be restored. He challenged the legitimacy of elections, but the recent election took place, the votes were counted, and the winner is going to be the next president,\" Brands told CNN in an email.\n History scholar Lindsay Chervinsky, author of \"The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution,\" told CNN that the turnover in Trump's Cabinet has been \"un-paralleled in American history\" and is \"perhaps one of the most unprecedented things about his presidency.\"\n Johns Hopkins University history professor Martha Jones and others told CNN that the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy that led to thousands of migrant children separated from their families, will certainly be revisited and have historians grappling with how it's possible the policy was permitted. His targeting of legal immigration and birthright citizenship will also be memorable, Jones said.\n Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, told CNN that a definite lasting impact will be Trump's reshaping of the federal judiciary and US Supreme Court, by appointing three justices and giving America's highest bench a 6-3 conservative-liberal majority. And time will tell whether Trump's most lasting legacy was \"the diminution of American democracy,\" she said.\n Trump's supporters would likely tout his tax cuts, judicial appointments, hardline immigration policies, and economic and trade policies, historians said.\n Trump backers may also point to his administration's peace negotiations in the Middle East, his tough stance on China, and his withdrawal of American troops from overseas such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump has removed the US from several international organizations and abandoned multilateral treaties including the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran nuclear deal, and the World Health Organization. He insulted the US' closest allies, while he cozied up to and praised dictators.\n Trump doesn't leave behind a \"Trump doctrine\" and \"hasn't left a structure in place that could be pointed to later as this is the Trump contribution to America,\" said Naftali, who argued that Trump's \"America First\" will not survive his administration.\n As the White House has declared the Trump doctrine to be that \"terrorists lose and peace wins,\" historians argue that Trump's foreign policy approach has damaged the US' global standing.\n While some of the historians CNN interviewed say that President-elect Joe Biden may be able to repair some of that damage, others such as Chervinsky believe it will take the US \"years and decades to try and restore trust\" among its allies.\n \"The loss of trust both domestically and internationally for the United States, for our institutions and our elections will probably be the most significant legacy, because that kind of thing takes so many decades to get back,\" Chervinsky said. \"Our international standing has really suffered.\"\n An important part of Trump's legacy, Zelizer said, is what he revealed about where the Republican Party was in 2020 and his exposure and aggravation of some of the most controversial and sometimes destructive elements of the GOP.\n Zelizer and others told CNN that as historians weigh Trump's legacy, they'll return to the question of how Trump managed to retain solid support within the Republican Party and his base despite his behavior and actions.\n \"Every time he pushed the envelope on what would've been considered normal behavior, not only -- he didn't pay a price for that politically very often, and indeed that just seemed to make his supporters that more deeply entrenched,\" Belmonte told CNN. \"And that's something I think that's going to take years for historians to piece out. What was the reason that there is this incredibly powerful loyalty to this President, irrespective of what he does?\"\n Historians also believe that Trump's legacy will be determined by the direction the Republican Party takes once Trump exits the political stage and how the GOP restructures itself.\n Elections are one way that presidential reputations are defined, Naftali said, and the midterm elections in 2022 and the presidential primaries in the 2024 election could all be indicators of the Trump legacy.\n The extent to which Trump will matter and remain a political influencer, Naftali told CNN, also depends on \"how many young ambitious politicos in this country look to his brand of leadership as a way to gain power. And that's a legacy that you can't describe yet.\"\n Already, the potential field of Republican presidential candidates for 2024's GOP primary is starting to shape up, with some hopefuls angling to inherit Trump's voter base.\n \"Republicans are going to help define Trump's legacy and I can't predict how that will go,\" Naftali said, adding that it depends on the \"political success of people who are carrying the Trump banner.\"",

        "body_text": "In less than a year, Covid-19 has killed almost 400,000 Americans.\n And in just the next month, another 100,000 lives could be lost to the disease, the incoming director of the US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention said.\n \"By the middle of February, we expect half a million deaths in this country,\" Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n \"That doesn't speak to the tens of thousands of people who are living with a yet uncharacterized syndrome after they've recovered,\" said Walensky, who was chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital before President-elect Joe Biden picked her to lead the CDC.\n Some people who have had Covid-19 have suffered symptoms months after testing positive.\n \"And we still yet haven't seen the ramifications of what happened from the holiday travel, from holiday gathering, in terms of high rates of hospitalizations and the deaths thereafter,\" Walensky said.\n \"I think we still have some dark weeks ahead.\"\n The CDC published a composite forecast last week projecting between 440,000 to 477,000 Covid-19 deaths in the US by February 6.\n While some states are starting to see improved outlooks in their fights against Covid-19, others are struggling badly.\n At least 126,139 patients were hospitalized across the US on Saturday -- less than the record-high of 132,447 patients on January 6.\n North Dakota, which has been under a mask mandate, saw its number of active Covid-19 cases drop 80% since a mid-November outbreak, Gov. Doug Burgum said Friday.\n That mask mandate will expire Monday.\n \"Our case numbers and hospital capacity have improved dramatically in North Dakota over the past two months, and with three new tools we didn't have last fall -- vaccines, rapid tests and effective therapeutics -- we can see the light at the end of the tunnel,\" Burgum said.\n \"However, this fight isn't over, and we need all North Dakotans to continue to exercise personal responsibility, follow protocols and keep wearing masks where physical distancing isn't possible. The day will come when we can take off our masks and discard them with confidence, but only if we do what's needed now to keep ourselves, our families and our communities safe.\"\n In Illinois, three regions of the state are moving into less-restrictive lockdown measures.\n \"I'm happy to report today that the majority of Illinois regions are making good progress,\" Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Friday.\n The state will soon see the return of group fitness classes, \"lower risk youth and recreational sports\" and the reopening of museums, the governor said.\n But much of the country is still in trouble. As of Sunday, 46 states had test positivity rates higher than 5%, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n For perspective, the World Health Organization has recommended governments not reopen until their test positivity rates stay at or below 5% for at least 14 days.\n A recent coronavirus projection from the University of Washington estimates more than 566,000 deaths in the US by May 1. The university's Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation said the figure could be lowered by thousands with universal mask requirements.\n Dr. Walensky said Sunday that the Biden administration will address \"bottlenecks\" in Covid-19 vaccine distribution and fulfill its goal to deliver 100 million doses in 100 days.\n \"I think that there are bottlenecks in different places across the entire system,\" Walensky told \"Face the Nation.\"\n \"Different states are having different challenges -- how much is being rolled out to each state, whether those states have adequate personnel, whether those states are getting vaccine to pharmacies,\" she said. \"Our job is to make sure that with the entire support of the federal government, that we address all of those bottlenecks wherever we are, so we can get vaccine into people's arms.\"\n President-elect Biden says his goal is to distribute 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days of office.\n \"We have looked carefully, and we are confident that we have enough vaccines for the 100 million doses over the next 100 days,\" Walensky said. \"It will be a hefty lift, but we have it in us to do that.\"\n Widespread confusion emerged when outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar revealed there's no federal stockpile of vaccines.\n The Trump administration previously said it was holding onto doses to help make sure Americans got their necessary second shots a few weeks after their first doses.\n Last week, a senior administration official said reserved second doses would be released, possibly over the span of two weeks.\n But on Friday, Azar told NBC's Lester Holt \"there's not a reserve stockpile.\"\n \"We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people, so we're not sitting on a reserve anymore,\" said Azar, who has submitted his letter of resignation.\n Like many Americans, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- wanted answers.\n \"I tried, and I think successfully, sorted that out,\" Fauci told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday.\n He said he spoke with Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer for Operation Warp Speed, \"and I think there was just a misunderstanding.\"\n Fauci said the Trump administration first approached vaccine distribution with caution, holding back second doses in case there were any \"glitches\" in the supply of vaccine.\n \"After a couple of cycles when it became clear that the cadence of the flow of doses was really going to be consistent and reliable, the decision was made instead of just giving enough for the first dose and holding back for the second dose, that as soon as they got the doses available, they would give it,\" Fauci said.\n More than 12.2 million vaccine doses have been administered in the US, according to the CDC.\n Over 10.5 million people have received their first injections, while 1.6 million have finished their vaccination cycle with a second dose.\n Those numbers fall short of goals set by Operation Warp Speed, which had promised 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by this year.\n \"We said we would have doses available for 20 million people that could be available, and of course, that was a projection based on estimates of when FDA would approve,\" Azar told NBC's Lester Holt Friday.\n \"FDA ended up approving later -- close to Christmas. You've got a natural scale up.\"\n Meanwhile, Fauci told \"Meet the Press\" that the US is closely examining new variants of Covid-19, including one first identified in the UK and another, \"more ominous\" strain identified in South Africa and Brazil. Health experts are watching out for whether new strains could lessen the impact of Covid-19 vaccines, which would prompt some modifications to the vaccines.\n The CDC recently warned that Covid-19 variants could accelerate the spread of the virus in the US.\n More infectious Covid-19 variants that are not necessarily more deadly can still cause more deaths, Fauci said.\n \"Even though on a one-to-one basis, it's not more virulent, meaning it doesn't make you more sick or more likely to die, just by numbers alone, the more cases you have, the more hospitalizations you're going to have, and the more hospitalizations you have, the more deaths you're going to have,\" he said.\n Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday that the spread of the UK variant across the US means the nation is facing \"a relentless strike\" heading into spring.\n \"In about five weeks, this is going to start to take over,\" Gottlieb said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\"\n \"The only backstop against this new variant is the fact that we will have a lot of infection by then, so there'll be a lot of immunity in the population and we will be vaccinating more people, but this really changes the equation,\" he said.\n Gottlieb said data from the US and other nations shows that the number of people infected with the new variant will likely double every week.\n On Saturday, Los Angeles County became the first county in the US to record a million coronavirus cases. It also announced that it had confirmed its first case of the UK variant of the virus.\n In a Sunday press release, health officials reported 11,366 new cases and 108 deaths. The numbers are the lowest of any day for the past week, but the Los Angeles Department of Public Health says they represent an undercount due to a lag in weekend reporting.\n There are currently 7,498 Angelenos hospitalized with the disease, and 23 percent of those are in the ICU, the department said.\n CNN's Christina Maxouris, Melissa Alonso, Paul Vercammen, Cheri Mossburg, Stella Chan, Jessica Firger, Sarah Mucha, Alta Spells, Lauren Mascarenhas, Susannah Cullinane and Hollie Silverman contributed to this report.",

During the game, the Ravens lost quarterback Lamar Jackson in the third quarter due to concussion protocol.\n So Bills fans -- nicknamed the Bills Mafia -- wanted to show their support for the injured NFL player. They utilized Reddit to figure out Jackson's favorite charity, CNN affiliate WLKY-TV reported.\n Once Bills fans learned Jackson has had a longtime relationship with Blessings in a Backpack, the non-profit said donations for the organization came pouring in.\n The organization works to feed \"school children in the United States who currently are fed during the week on the federally funded Free and Reduced Meal Program and are at risk of going hungry on the weekends,\" according to its website.\n \"Thank you, #BillsMafia for your support of Blessings in a Backpack to feed kids in #Louisville and nationwide in honor of @Lj_era8!\" the organization tweeted on Sunday, tagging Jackson's username.\n The Louisville chapter received more than $75,000 as of Saturday night, according to WLKY-TV. The program has now increased its efforts because of Covid-19, according to its website.\n Bills fans are known for having a charitable heart. In 2017, they donated money to then-Cincinnati Bengals quartback Andy Dalton. Earlier in the 2020 season, Bills fans also donated money to a children's hospital after Bills quarterback Josh Allen's grandmother died, according to ESPN.\n The Ravens showed their support for Bills' fans generosity.\n \"Respect, @BuffaloBills and #BillsMafia,\" the team tweeted on Sunday, linking to a tweet that shared news about Bills fans' donations.\n After their win on Saturday, the Bills are headed to the AFC championship, where they'll play the Kansas City Chiefs to determine who goes to the Super Bowl.",

        "title": "Trump to issue around 100 pardons and commutations Tuesday, sources say",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump is preparing to issue around 100 pardons and commutations on his final full day in office Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the matter, a major batch of clemency actions that includes white collar criminals, high-profile rappers and others but -- as of now -- is not expected to include Trump himself.\n The White House held a meeting on Sunday to finalize the list of pardons, two sources said.\n Trump, who had been rolling out pardons and commutations at a steady clip ahead of Christmas, had put a pause on them in the days leading up to and directly after the January 6 riots at the US Capitol, according to officials.\n Aides said Trump was singularly focused on the Electoral College count in the days ahead of time, precluding him for making final decisions on pardons. White House officials had expected them to resume after January 6, but Trump retreated after he was blamed for inciting the riots.\n RELATED: Trump's 'pro-law enforcement' image crumbles in his final days\n Initially, two major batches had been ready to roll out, one at the end of last week and one on Tuesday. Now, officials expect the last batch to be the only one -- unless Trump decides at the last minute to grant pardons to controversial allies, members of his family or himself.\n The final batch of clemency actions is expected to include a mix of criminal justice reform-minded pardons and more controversial ones secured or doled out to political allies.\n The pardons are one of several items Trump must complete before his presidency ends in days. White House officials also still have executive orders prepared, and the President is still hopeful to declassify information related to the Russia probe before he leaves office. But with a waning number of administration officials still in jobs, the likelihood that any of it gets done seemed to be shrinking.\n The January 6 riots that led to Trump's second impeachment have complicated his desire to pardon himself, his kids and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. At this point, aides do not think he will do so, but caution only Trump knows what he will do with his last bit of presidential power before he is officially out of office at noon on January 20.\n After the riots, advisers encouraged Trump to forgo a self-pardon because it would appear like he was guilty of something, according to one person familiar with the conversations. Several of Trump's closest advisers have also urged him not to grant clemency to anyone involved in the siege on the US Capitol, despite Trump's initial stance that those involved had done nothing wrong.\n \"There are a lot of people urging the President to pardon the folks\" involved in the insurrection, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on Fox News. \"To seek a pardon of these people would be wrong.\"\n One White House official said paperwork had not yet been drawn up for a self-pardon.\n Still, Trump is expected to leave the White House on January 20 and could issue pardons up until noon on Inauguration Day.\n Other attention-grabbing names, like Julian Assange, are also not currently believed to among the people receiving pardons, but the list is still fluid and that could change, too.\n It's also not certain whether Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon will receive a pardon.\n RELATED: Wikileaks asks reporters for help in desperate bid to score Julian Assange last-minute pardon\n Trump is still receiving multiple streams of recommendations on pardons from those advisers who remain at the White House, as well as people outside the building who have been lobbying for months for themselves or their clients.\n The expectation among allies is that Trump will issue pardons that he could benefit from post presidency.\n \"Everything is a transaction. He likes pardons because it is unilateral. And he likes doing favors for people he thinks will owe him,\" one source familiar with the matter said.\n Dr. Salomon Melgen, a prominent eye doctor from Palm Beach, Florida, who is in prison after being convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud, is currently expected to be included in the clemency list, three sources familiar tell CNN.\n Melgen, who is noteworthy for being the co-conspirator in a since-dismissed corruption case against Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, was sentenced to 17 years for health care fraud in 2018.\n While his name surprised some Trump allies given the President's attitude toward Menendez, Melgen is seen as a wealthy and influential figure in south Florida. The corruption case against Menendez and Melgen was dropped by the Justice Department in January 2018.\n Inside the White House, there has been a scramble to petition for pardons on behalf of allies and advocacy groups and names could be added and taken off up until the last minute, sources say.\n CNN previously reported there has been a crush of pardon requests during Trump's final days in office from allies, lobbyists and others hoping to cash in on their loyalty to Trump. The New York Times reported Sunday some of those people were getting paid tens of thousands of dollars to lobby on behalf of felons hoping for pardons.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

        "title": "Weekend protests at state capitols stayed small amid heavy police presence",
        "body_text": "Officials were prepared this weekend for potential unrest ahead of Inauguration Day, but the small groups of protesters that gathered at state capitols across the country were dwarfed by the heavy presence of law enforcement.\n Demonstrations remained small and peaceful as of Sunday night, despite warnings that armed protests were being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n In Michigan, a group of several dozen demonstrators -- some of whom were armed and armored -- and counterprotesters gathered at the state Capitol in Lansing under a light snow Sunday morning. But the event was peaceful, and the crowd had largely dispersed by the afternoon.\n There were fewer than a dozen people at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul -- a group far smaller than the journalists and law enforcement who were present. One state official told CNN the state's Department of Public Safety was \"cautiously optimistic\" about how the day progressed.\n About two dozen armed protesters showed up for a demonstration outside the Texas Capitol in Austin. But they weren't there to contest the presidential election; instead they wanted to highlight what they believed was an assault on their Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n Organizer Ben Hawk said the event had been planned for months, and he didn't plan for it to be stopped after this month's events at the Capitol, which he called \"repulsive.\"\n \"Biden won the election,\" he said. \"He won the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, votes have been certified. He will be inaugurated as President.\"\n State leaders across the US ramped up security around their capitol grounds ahead of the weekend -- pulling in National Guard members for help, erecting barriers, boarding up windows, asking residents to avoid the area and some even closing down capitol grounds altogether.\n But the groups that materialized Sunday were small, at the most made up of several dozen protesters.\n In Denver, demonstrator Larry Woodall told CNN he was disappointed with the low turnout, saying he'd come out to \"support Trump, let him know we still care.\"\n Woodall said he did not support violence or the Capitol riots this month, and he'd accepted that Biden would be president, calling it \"a done deal.\"\n \"We just have to live with that and hope that it doesn't turn out the way that people are saying it's going to turn out,\" he told CNN, \"that they're going to take our guns, they're going to force us to do this, force us to do that. I pray to God it's not like that.\"\n In Oregon, five armed people dressed in camo and carrying flags arrived to the state Capitol, saying they were anti-government libertarians who did not support either Biden or President Donald Trump.\n In Ohio, a small group of protesters stood in front of the statehouse in Columbus near a large police presence and metal barriers, according to CNN affiliate WSYX. And in Columbia, South Carolina, CNN affiliate WIS reported about 40 protesters gathered at the Statehouse for a protest about free speech in the wake of social media companies banning the President.\n Meanwhile, capitols in Minnesota, Tennessee, California and Colorado, among others, had a major police presence but few if any protesters.\n After being banned from Twitter and Facebook, Trump had not promoted these gatherings, a contrast from his actions before the January 6 rally in DC, when he repeatedly called for his supporters to converge on the city.\n But online calls for violence have intensified recently. And experts warn the perceived success of the deadly insurrection earlier this month, when a pro-Trump mob overwhelmed police and took over the US Capitol, may be motivation for another attack.\n \"As somebody who worked on al Qaeda-related terrorism throughout the 2000s at the Justice Department and worked extensively on counterterrorism investigations and cases, there were several times where we were anticipating a follow-on attack to a world event,\" Carrie Cordero, a CNN legal and national security analyst, said Saturday. \"I have that same feeling now.\"\n The heightened security, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, is making for an Inauguration Day unlike any other.\n In Washington, DC, fences blocked off areas once open to the public, National Guard members patrolled near the Capitol and much of the city was closed to vehicles and street traffic.\n A joint bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and eight other agencies says domestic extremists pose the most likely threat to the inauguration, particularly those who believe the incoming administration is illegitimate.\n In response, the Pentagon has authorized up to 25,000 National Guard members for Inauguration Day in Washington, DC, and much of the area surrounding the country's iconic political buildings has been fenced off or made inaccessible.\n The rehearsal for the inauguration ceremony will now be delayed until Monday amid heightened security concerns, acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said. Cuccinelli cited \"online chatter\" about the previously scheduled rehearsal day of Sunday but said there are \"no specific credible threats.\"\n Because of concern over potential protests at state capitols, security measures are in place around the country. The US Postal Service temporarily removed some mailboxes in several major cities, while the Transportation Security Administration said Friday it has \"significantly increased its security posture.\"\n Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser urged Americans to enjoy the inauguration virtually from home and has asked anyone who does not need to be out to avoid restricted areas.\n CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Jamie Crawford, Lauren Fox, Omar Jimenez, Lucy Kafanov, Bill Kirkos, Jason Kravarik, Ross Levitt, Artemis Moshtaghian, Jon Passantino, Conor Powell, Manu Raju, Raja Razek, Rebekah Riess, Hollie Silverman, Dan Simon, Greg Wallace and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The US government is warning that groups could rely on radio equipment as an alternative to social media to plan future criminal activities.\n In a stark warning Sunday, the Federal Communications Commission's enforcement bureau said people coordinating or conducting criminal activity over radio waves are breaking the law.\n \"The Bureau has become aware of discussions on social media platforms suggesting that certain radio services regulated by the Commission may be an alternative to social media platforms for groups to communicate and coordinate future activities,\" the FCC said in its warning Sunday. \"Individuals using radios in the Amateur or Personal Radio Services in this manner may be subject to severe penalties, including significant fines, seizure of the offending equipment, and, in some cases, criminal prosecution.\"\n The FCC licenses certain signals for people to broadcast over radio waves. Those messages are generally protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment. But the FCC reminded radio licensees and operators that it is prohibited to transmit \"communications intended to facilitate a criminal act.\" People are also not allowed to encode their messages to obscure their meaning from law enforcement.\n The laws governing airwaves apply to amateurs broadcasting with personal ham radios, which can reach long distances. But they also apply to people using Citizens Band (CB) radios commonly used for communication between truckers -- or even walkie-talkies.\n In the wake of the January 6 Capitol riots, Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and other mainstream social networks have become more vigilant about policing people who use their platforms to plan or incite attacks. They have booted off several high-profile radicals and thousands of groups and users who the platforms say engage in harmful conspiracy theories and other violence or hate speech.\n Similarly, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) effectively took Parler off the internet.  Parler, the alternative social network popular with conservatives, had been surging in popularity in recent months. But the platform failed to rein in hate-filled, violent speech, Big Tech companies allege. Amazon, Apple and Google said that unmoderated speech could lead to another violent attack.\n In response, Parler sued Amazon last week, alleging an antitrust violation, breach of contract and interference with the company's business relationships with users. The complaint  calls Amazon Web Services' decision a \"death blow\" to Parler.\n \"Without AWS, Parler is finished as it has no way to get online,\" the complaint said. \"And a delay of granting this TRO by even one day could also sound Parler's death knell as President Trump and others move on to other platforms.\"\n Amazon said that Parler's lawsuit has \"no merit.\"",

        "title": "Confidence in Chinese vaccines has taken a hit. But as coronavirus cases grow, some countries are still pushing ahead",
        "body_text": "Mass public vaccination programs using a Chinese coronavirus vaccine are underway across Indonesia and Turkey, where tens of millions of people are expected to receive doses of the CoronaVac shot made by Beijing-based company Sinovac.\n On Wednesday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo was shown receiving the country's first CoronaVac shot, after the government authorized it for emergency use. While on Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced he had also received the vaccine.\n But the rollouts come despite a growing number of questions over the effectiveness of the shot, which last week was revealed to have an efficacy rate of just 50.38% in late-stage trials in Brazil -- significantly lower than earlier results showed. That rate only barely crosses the 50% efficacy threshold as set by the World Health Organization, and far lower than the 78% previously announced to much fanfare in China earlier this month.\n The apparent discrepancy has led to concern among some scientists, and shaken international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines.\n \"Since many countries are planning to order, or have already ordered Sinovac's vaccines, it might undermine people's willingness to take them, because people may question the usefulness of the vaccines,\" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations and expert on the Chinese health care system. \"It could be a potential stumbling block.\"\n The Brazilian results suggest CoronaVac is far less effective than vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%. Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine has an efficacy of 91%, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%. The Sinovac vaccine has a lower efficacy rate than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says has a 79.34% efficacy.\n The Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines have been regarded as potentially affordable and easily distributed vaccine candidates. Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, the Chinese shots do not require expensive cold storage.\n Sinovac has agreements in place with at least six governments, with plans in place to provide 46 million doses of its CoronaVac vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It will also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.\n Thailand has ordered 2 million doses of CoronaVac and expects to receive the first 200,000 doses in February, while the Philippines has ordered 25 million doses, of which the first batch is also expected to arrive next month, according to Reuters.\n However, following the release of the Brazilian trial data, other countries are now reexamining potential plans.\n Singapore's Health Minister said officials would review Sinovac's vaccine before any rollout to its citizens. Singapore has not approved the vaccine but does have a purchase agreement with the company. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the vaccine would need to go through a regulatory process and authorization by Singapore's Health Sciences Authority, according to the Straits Times.\n Malaysia also said it would seek more data from Sinovac before it approved and purchased supplies, Reuters reported -- while in Hong Kong, which has signed a deal with Sinovac, a senior medical adviser said an expert panel would review every vaccine based on clinical trial data.\n Even though Brazil's health agency regulator, Anvisa, voted to approve emergency use authorization of Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine on Sunday, it said it did not have access to important data about the vaccine on the Phase 3 study, such as the duration of protection provided by the vaccine and its effect on the elderly and other specific groups, such as people with comorbidities.\n Brazil's national vaccination program is set to begin on January 20, according to the health ministry.\n And while governments in Thailand and the Philippines have so far publicly backed the Sinovac shot, politicians in both countries have questioned their rollout plans. In response to the concerns, Thai regulators have asked Sinovac to provide more detailed information on the clinical trials.\n On Wednesday, Sinovac defended the safety and efficacy of its vaccine. \"These Phase III clinical trial results are sufficient to prove that CoronaVac vaccine's safety and effectiveness are good around the world,\" company chairperson, Yin Weidong, said in a news conference, according to Reuters.\n Part of the confusion over Sinovac's vaccine has been around different efficacy rates and the data made available.\n Turkey, which approved the Sinovac vaccine for emergency use on Wednesday, reported an efficacy of 91.25%, while Indonesia reported 65.3%.\n Data from Brazil, meanwhile, showed 50.38% efficacy for those who suffered very mild cases of Covid-19. But the rate rose to 78% for mild to severe cases.\n \"It is difficult to interpret all this information without seeing the full datasets. This highlights the problem of issuing data by press release rather than publication in a peer-reviewed journal,\" Prof. Lawrence Young, virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said in a statement. \"It also emphasizes the different approaches to requirements for regulatory approval.\"\n There are several reasons why one trial could produce a different efficacy rate from another, including how they were conducted, or that the vaccine could be more or less effective in different age groups, or different population groups, experts say.\n A Sinovac representative told CNN that the discrepancy in efficacy results was due to the different situations in countries where clinical trials were carried out.\n \"The results are from different populations, in different places with different morbidity rates, and therefore they span a relatively large range,\" the representative said.\n But amid the vast amounts of new vaccine information coming out on a daily basis, analysts say there is a risk people could get confused and lose trust.\n \"There is a danger when people misunderstand the science,\" said Dr. Nikki Turner, director of the immunization advisory center at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. \"There is a really important point here about trying to effectively communicate the science behind these vaccines. Especially when things are moving very fast.\"\n And efficacy might not necessarily mean how effective the vaccine turns out to be. \"Once the vaccine moves from clinical trials into the community, you need to think broadly about all the different aspects of what makes a vaccine work,\" Turner said.\n \"Some vaccines may be more effective against reducing the disease, some vaccines may be more effective in reducing transmission, so it depends what your aim is.\"\n The concern about one country relying on a single vaccine with a lower efficacy rate is that it may not necessarily build up the required herd immunity in a population.\n That debate played out in Australia this week, with some scientists proposing a delay in mass inoculations.\n Australia has secured 54 million doses of the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine, with plans to begin rolling it out later this year. However, some scientists -- including the president of the Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology -- have argued that the vaccine won't provide herd immunity and rollout plans should be halted, citing its low efficacy rate compared to US-made vaccines.\n Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, tried to alleviate such concerns, saying \"AstraZeneca is, on the evidence we have so far, a safe and effective vaccine,\" adding that more data is set to come.\n Experts have said that while scientific discussion of new data being made available is a good thing, it shouldn't detract from the fact that all vaccines that have been approved in countries around the world have been shown to be safe and effective at stopping death and serious disease.\n Australia has recorded fewer than 30,000 Covid-19 cases and under 1,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Several other nations in the Asia-Pacific region which have had similar success in controlling the pandemic have purchase agreements for vaccines but appear to be waiting for more data and to see what happens during the mass vaccine rollouts in harder-hit nations, before inoculating their own citizens.\n Turner, from the University of Auckland, believes waiting and assessing new data on vaccine safety and effectiveness will mean the population will be able to have greater confidence in the vaccines.\n \"You have communities around the world that are nervous about new vaccines, new vaccine technology. Are they safe? Are they effective? So if we do not have to rush emergency decisions with preliminary data, then we are in a good position to wait a few more months and get more complete data on the effectiveness and the safety of these vaccines,\" she said.\n Waiting too long, however, could risk another outbreak -- particularly given new, potentially more transmissible variants.\n \"This is a balancing act between getting vaccines into the country to get the economy (on track), and to try and prevent the disease entering our country, versus rushing ahead and losing community confidence,\" Turner said.\n Jamie Triccas, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Sydney's school of medical sciences, said that with the pandemic still raging, multiple vaccines from several suppliers must be considered -- and it was important to use them all.\n \"The main thing is we want to stop deaths, that's the first thing you want. If you vaccinate as many as you can, you know the vaccine may not stop all people from getting infected but those are good at stopping serious infections, hospitalizations and death,\" he said.\n \"Time is not on our side. We're in a situation where we're having more deaths and cases per day than ever. It's time to cooperate and move all vaccines out as quickly as possible, as long as they're safe and have a level of efficacy that's agreed on as being effective.\"\n CNN's Nectar Gan and Jadyn Sham contributed reporting from Hong Kong and Rodrigo Pedroso contributed reporting from in Sao Paulo.",

When he developed an infection after surgery, his prognosis was so poor that a priest was called to give last rites.\n During his slow recovery, Kennedy worked on a book project \u2014 with his gifted aide Ted Sorensen playing the central role \u2014 that became \"Profiles in Courage.\" It was six years before Kennedy would be elected president, nine years before he would be assassinated in a motorcade in Dallas. The book, which told the stories of senators who had risked their careers for standing by their principles, became a best seller and won the Pulitzer Prize for biography.\n If Americans understood, the book suggested, \"the terrible pressures which discourage\" a politician from taking an unpopular stance \u2014 the possible \"loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow men\" -- they might be \"more appreciative of those still able to follow the path of courage.\"\n \"While many House Republicans reportedly supported impeachment,\" Dent observed in a second piece, \"only 10 courageous GOP members actually voted for it. If the Senate were to convict Trump and prohibit him from ever seeking high office again, many House Republicans would be most grateful and relieved. It's called 'hope yes, vote no.'\"\n It was the second impeachment for Trump \u2014 unprecedented in US history. The first time, no House Republican voted \"aye,\" and in the Senate, only one Republican, Mitt Romney, voted to remove him from office.\n \"What happened on January 6 was NOT a political act. It was a crime. Violent. Vicious. Premeditated. Lethal. Everyone who incited it and everyone who committed it are perpetrators. And calls for 'unity' cannot be simultaneous excuses for this violence. To achieve unity, we must also deliver accountability and justice. I am not a prosecutor and cannot try Donald Trump in a court of law. Impeachment is the only means I have available to stop him from inciting further acts of mayhem, bloodshed and insurrection.\"\n At noon Wednesday, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is due to take the oath of office as 46th president of the United States in an inauguration that will look unlike any other, given the security threat and the Covid-19 pandemic. The 45th president, who for months refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, is breaking with tradition by not planning to attend Biden's swearing-in.\n \"From the moment he descended the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015 and entered national politics with a barrage of incendiary, racist tripe, Trump has routinely and scurrilously lied and sold his self-serving version of events and conspiracy theories. He has willfully and cynically divided and inflamed the country he was elected to lead to suit his own ends.\"\n Trump's father taught him that there are two kinds of people -- killers and losers, as Axelrod pointed out. \"The violent insurrection against the US Capitol and our democracy will be his epitaph. The threat of legal action and disbarment from public office in the future still looms. But the President already has suffered the most painful penalty of all: Fred Trump's boy will go home a loser.\"\n Trump is one of only four presidents in the last century to be denied a second term by voters.\n For more on this moment in Washington:\n To Democrats in the House, impeaching Trump was an easy call. The more complicated question is how to handle a trial in the Senate, since the Republican majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, hasn't indicated he favors holding it before the end of Trump's term. For the incoming president, the trial poses a dilemma since it threatens to slow both the confirmation of Biden's Cabinet and the aggressive initiatives he has outlined to fight Covid-19 and revive the economy.\n Some Republicans contend that moving ahead with the trial would be divisive.\n For more on politics:\n The reality, Sepkowitz noted, is that some of the advice he and other doctors gave in the early months of the pandemic proved to be incorrect. \"The year has been extremely humbling. We infectious disease specialists have been wrong repeatedly \u2014 a predictable problem with a once-in-a-century event, but still.\" At first, doctors minimized the risk and said mask-wearing wasn't necessary. US scientists stumbled in developing reliable tests to diagnose the disease. Now there's hope in the form of vaccines, although their rollout has been much slower than predicted. \"The Biden team surely is aware of what lies ahead,\" Sepkowitz observed. \"We can only hope that its decisions will rely on evidence, sound judgment and, most of all, the lonely humility of a doctor caring for a critically ill patient.\"\n \"The roots of the White supremacist tree that has flourished in the age of Trump are deep, and King combated these forces in his own time with a moral force and power that turned him into a radical political agitator who broke with his former political ally, President Lyndon B. Johnson, on the issue of Vietnam and a revolutionary human rights leader who vowed to help end militarism, racism and materialism before it destroyed American society,\" Joseph wrote.\n \"King would surely shy away from using his holiday as an example of American exceptionalism \u2014 and would instead push us toward the hard work of building, for the first time in our nation's history, a racially inclusive democracy that will ensure that this latest attack on the sacred citadel of American democracy will be the last.\"\n \"1984\" author George Orwell, who died in 1950, is one of those thinkers whose eternal curse is to have his acute observations of his own society dragged into contemporary debates to be used and misused.\n When a BBC presenter said Trump had inspired \"insurrection,\" an adviser to the Trump campaign accused him of using \"Orwellian language to change what happened.\"\n Beers, a historian who is preparing to teach a course on Orwell, wrote that while he \"opposed censorship, he abhorred the corruption of language by political leaders\" trying to cloak \"dubious or amoral actions\" in the \"language of bureaucracy and legalese, or the emotional language of patriotism. One of Orwell's deepest laments was that, during his lifetime, 'political speech and writing' had become 'largely the defense of the indefensible.'\"\n \"Most likely,\" Beers added, \"Orwell would not have supported either the de-platforming of Trump, or the cancellation of Hawley's book contract. But he likely would also have despised both men for their cynical abuse of the English language.\"",

        "body_text": "China's economy grew more than expected last year, even as the rest of the world was upended by the coronavirus pandemic.\n The world's second largest economy expanded 2.3% in 2020 compared to a year earlier, according to government statistics released Monday.\n It's China's slowest annual growth rate in decades \u2014 not since 1976 has the country had a worse year, when GDP shrunk 1.6% during a time of social and economic tumult.\n But during a year when a crippling pandemic plunged major world economies into recession, China has clearly come out on top. The expansion also beat expectations. The International Monetary Fund, for example, predicted that China's economy would grow 1.9% in 2020. It's the only major world economy the IMF expected to grow at all.\n The pace of the recovery appears to be accelerating, too: GDP grew 6.5% compared to a year ago, faster than the third quarter's 4.9% growth.\n \"The performance was better than we had expected,\" said Ning Jizhe, a spokesman for China's National Bureau of Statistics, at a press conference in Beijing.\n The country scrapped its growth target last year for the first time in decades as the pandemic dealt a historic blow to the economy. GDP shrank nearly 7% in the first quarter as large swaths of the country were placed on lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.\n Since then, though, the government has attempted to spur growth through major infrastructure projects and by offering cash handouts to stimulate spending among citizens.\n Industrial production was a particularly big driver of growth, jumping 7.3% in December from a year earlier.\n \"In and out of lockdown ahead of everybody else, the Chinese economy powered ahead while much of the world was struggling to maintain balance,\" wrote Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC, in a Monday research report.\n Chinese markets reversed opening losses Monday to rise following the announcement. The Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) gained 0.8%, while the Shenzhen Component Index \u2014 a benchmark for the city's tech-heavy exchange \u2014 rose 1.6%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) increased 1%.\n There are still some weak spots, though. Retail sales lost a little steam in December, rising 4.6% compared to November's 5%. For the entire year, retail sales slumped 3.9%. Ning, the National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson, blamed the waning sales on a resurgence of coronavirus in some places.\n Even so, Ning said the country believes the pandemic is under control, and said authorities expect people to spend more money this year.",

        "body_text": "An Army reservist who federal investigators say has security-level security clearance and a long record of posting his extremist views online was among the latest wave of rioters charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the January 6 Capitol insurrection.\n Others charged this weekend include a woman who has been seen in photos brandishing the name plate that had been affixed outside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, authorities said, and the mother of a man who was arrested after he was captured in a striking photo on the Senate floor with zip-ties, now herself accused of chasing police officers with zip-ties in her hands.\n The details that emerged about the three defendants and others in the newly unsealed court documents provide a clearer scope of the violence inside the Capitol and the potential military-style coordination that took place during the breach of the building. Lawyers for each of them were not listed in an online federal court filing system.\n Federal investigators said the Army reservist \u2014 Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, of Colts Neck, New Jersey \u2014 was described by an informant as \"an avowed White supremacist and Nazi sympathizer.\"\n According to court documents, in a phone call with the informant on Thursday that was recorded by law enforcement, Hale-Cusanelli can be heard saying that he encouraged members of the mob to \"advance\" through the Capitol and gave directions \"via both voice and hand signals.\" It's not clear if he's been arrested.\n Authorities identified Emily Hernandez, of Sullivan, Missouri, as the woman who allegedly stole the Pelosi placard. In a number of photos investigators included in court records, they identify her as the woman seen smiling as she brandishes the jagged wooden fragment before a crowd.\n It was not clear on Sunday if she had been arrested either. The placard will cost $870 to replace, according to an estimate from the curator of the House of Representatives that was cited in the court documents.\n Lisa Eisenhart -- the mother of Eric Munchel, a Nashville man who was arrested last week and identified by authorities as a person pictured carrying zip ties in the building -- was taken into custody in Tennessee on Saturday. She's charged with breaking into the Capitol and disorderly conduct, according to the Justice Department.\n According to a charging document, Eisenhart is seen on video footage holding flex cuffs, or plastic restraints, as she chases police officers as part of a mob inside the building.\n Prosecutors in the nation's capital have charged about 100 cases related to the riot, and there are more than 275 open investigations into potential criminal activity on that day, acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said on Friday.\n Among the newest slate of charges are some of the more notorious crimes, as well as unsettling allegations of participation by far-right extremists.\n Investigators identified Chad Jones of Mt. Washington, Kentucky, as the man seen in a video using the end of a flagpole with a Trump flag to bash a door that leads to the Speaker's Lobby outside the House chamber, according to a charging document. Lawmakers had been evacuated through that lobby just minutes before.\n Jones was allegedly in the same mob that included Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was shot and killed by Capitol Police, according to the charging document. It was not clear Sunday if he had been arrested.\n And a man who was captured wearing a Proud Boys T-shirt and holding up the corner of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds -- according to an FBI agent, citing photos, in a court document -- was arrested on Sunday in Maryland, the Department of Justice said.\n The document alleges that Bryan Betancur told law enforcement in the past that he was a member of several White supremacist organizations, and stated at one point that he wanted to \"run people over with a vehicle and kill people in a church.\"\n Betancur had been wearing a GPS monitor in connection with a previous probation violation, authorities said, and location data referenced in a charging document against him shows his presence in restricted areas of the Capitol grounds.\n On Sunday, authorities in Washington, DC, arrested a New Mexico county commissioner who had climbed on to a restricted platform around the Capitol to preach to the crowd outside during the insurrection. Couy Griffin had returned to DC and was taken into custody just blocks away from the Capitol after Capitol Police officers ran his license plate and noticed that he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest, according to a law enforcement official.\n He is charged with entering a restricted area of the Capitol complex. It wasn't immediately clear who he had retained as his lawyer.\n A county commissioner in Otero County, New Mexico, Griffin had discussed his presence at the Capitol riot at a public meeting of the commission on Thursday, telling colleagues that he led a prayer session from a restricted-access deck of the Capitol building.\n He also announced in the meeting that he planned to return to Washington ahead of the inauguration this week, and that he would bring his guns in his car.\n \"I'm going to go back to Washington, DC, I'm gonna be there on January 20,\" he said, according to video of the remarks posted online. \"I'm gonna take a stand for our country and for our freedoms because this election was fraudulent on every level.\"\n Others arrested over the weekend had also pledged to return to DC to fight.\n Cousins Daniel Adams and Cody Connell are described by authorities as storming the Capitol together earlier this month.\n According to court documents, Adams led a group of rioters who charged a line of Capitol Police officers that were holding protective shields and guarding a set of stairs in front of the building. An FBI agent identified him in photos posted online in part by his \"mullet hairstyle,\" according to an affidavit. Both men were arrested on Saturday \u2014 Adams in Texas and Connell in Louisiana.\n Authorities said they believe that Connell had been planning to return to DC for the week of the inauguration, citing witnesses that he communicated with about purchasing rifles, ammunition and body armor.\n \"According to the witness,\" an FBI agent wrote in a charging document, \"Connell explained that he was not returning to Louisiana unless he was in a body bag.\"\n A 24-year-old man alleged to be a member of the far-right armed group The Three Percenters -- and who runs his own private paramilitary training group -- was charged Sunday night for his role in the riot, according to court documents.\n Robert Gieswein of Colorado wore a patch representing his group, the Woodland Wild Dogs, on the tactical vest he wore to the Capitol, prosecutors said, citing social media.\n Gieswein faces five charges that include allegations of entering the Capitol, spraying a substance from a canister at police and helping the crowd lift a temporary barrier to block police, according to new court records filed in federal court in Washington, DC.\n This story has been updated with additional information.\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The Capitol insurrection could be a bigger racial reckoning than the George Floyd protests   ",
        "body_text": "An enraged White man thrusts the sharp point of an American flagpole toward a helpless Black man. A snarling police dog lunges at a civil rights protester. A White police officer presses his knee on the neck of an unconscious Black suspect.\n Each of these blistering images from history changed the way Americans talked about race and exposed truths that many had long denied.\n The January 6 assault on the US Capitol has added some new entries to that grim gallery. Many Americans are still reeling from seeing images of what's been called a \"White riot\" -- an assault on Congress by supporters of President Donald Trump, which left five people dead.\n It's been described as \"the most dramatic challenge to the US democratic system since the civil war,\" but its impact on racial justice has been undersold.\n Many have noted the racial dimensions to the insurrection, in which at least one Capitol rioter carried a Confederate flag. One commentator said that if the mob was Black, the Capitol's marbled \"hallways would be red with their blood.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the mob chose their \"whiteness over democracy.\"\n But I believe the Capitol riot could have a far-reaching impact on racial justice in America -- bigger, even, than last summer's George Floyd protests. In some ways, it already has.\n Here are five reasons why the Capitol insurrection offers an opportunity for transformative change.\n Consider the impact of last year's George Floyd protests -- what they did, and what they failed to do.\n Floyd's death last May at the hands of a White police officer in Minnesota sparked what some consider the largest protest movement in American history.\n An estimated 15 to 26 million Americans of all races took to the streets to protest police brutality last summer. Local and state politicians proposed laws to reform policing and combat racism. Corporations posted Black Lives Matter on their websites. Sales of anti-racism books soared.\n But here's what the protests didn't do: They didn't stop Trump from getting 74 million votes six months later in November's election -- more than any president before him.\n Trump may be leaving office, but his corrosive influence isn't going away. Critics say the President is responsible for returning White supremacy to mainstream politics. For years, a large segment of White America continued to support him no matter what he said or did. The Floyd protests didn't loosen Trump's hold on the Republican party or large swaths of White America.\n The fallout from the Capitol assault, though, may cause irreversible damage to Trump's brand. The House of Representatives impeached him -- again -- for inciting violence against the US government. Some Republican lawmakers are now openly breaking with him. His approval rating has sunk to its lowest level ever. Corporations and banks are cutting ties with the Trump Organization.\n \"His entire legacy was wiped out yesterday,\" Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican freshman from South Carolina, told CNN a day after the Capitol assault.\n It's true that Trump remains the most dominant force in the Republican Party. It may be premature to write his political obituary. But the stain of the Capitol riot may follow him, his family and their supporters in Congress for the rest of their lives.\n The shame of the Capitol riot will haunt many of Trump's followers as well. \"The heartbeat of racism is denial,\" the race scholar Ibram X. Kendi once said. \"The American creed of denial \u2014 'I'm not a racist' \u2014 knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.\"\n It was easier for a segment of White America to deny their racism during the Floyd protests. They could say the four police officers charged in Floyd's death were just a few bad apples. They could tune out debates about abstract terms like \"systemic racism.\" They could attack a clumsy political slogan like \"defund the police\" to justify defending the status quo.\n The Capitol riot, though, has made it much more difficult for White Americans to deny our country has a huge problem with White supremacy. It's forced many Americans to see how dangerous White supremacy is in a way that the Floyd protests did not.\n You can see this shift in the language people are using to describe members of the Capitol mob. They've called the assault an \"insurrection\" and a \"coup from below\" and argued that White supremacy is incompatible with democracy.\n Few, if any, described the accusations of police brutality that fanned the Floyd protests in such a stark way.\n The images of the Capitol mob also show how White supremacy is wielded by many ordinary White Americans. Not everyone in the mob was a White supremacist. But the White people who waved a Confederate flag in the Capitol Rotunda, built a makeshift gallows on the Capitol grounds and forced lawmakers to flee for their lives represented a broad swath of America.\n \"These were not just the Trump loyalists of lore, that economically marginalized, over-elegized white working class of the heartland, columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times.\n \"No, the crowd that stormed the Capitol was a big tent of whiteness, a cross-section of American society bridging divisions of class, geography and demography. They were doctors and lawyers, florists and real estate agents, business executives, police officers, military veterans, at least one elected official and an Olympic gold medalist. They'd all come to coup for America.\"\n The Capitol rioters didn't just embarrass themselves -- they embarrassed the country they profess to love.\n The riot occurred as the US is jockeying with Russia and China for global influence. Russia and Iran ridiculed the US on social media over the riot, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government has been accused of human rights violations, called the mob \"a disgrace for democracy.\" The riot occurred the same week that China cracked down on Hong Kong's democracy movement with mass arrests.\n \"There is no way to ... ignore the power of the message that these events send to both the friends and the enemies of democracy, everywhere,\" the historian, Anne Applebaum, wrote in a recent essay.  \"The images from Washington that are going out around the world are far more damaging to America's reputation as a stable democracy than the images of young people protesting the Vietnam War several decades ago, and they are far more disturbing to outsiders than the riots and protests of last summer.\"\n But the Capitol crisis also presents an opportunity for racially transformative change at the federal level. It's happened before, under similar circumstances.\n The US was locked in a global struggle with Russia for the hearts and minds of people when the civil rights movement took flight in the 1950s and 1960s. Civil rights leaders leveraged our Cold War rivalry to help pass sweeping civil rights laws.\n The 1963 civil rights campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, offered a classic example. Images of Black protesters being attacked by police dogs and sprayed with firehoses were beamed around the world. Foreign governments attacked American leaders for their hypocrisy in preaching the virtues of democracy abroad while hanging \"Whites only\" signs at home.\n White supremacy became a national security issue. The ugly fallout from the protests in Birmingham forced President John Kennedy to propose a bill that became the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed segregation in public accommodations and made employment discrimination illegal.\n In a nationally televised speech announcing his bill, Kennedy said the US was \"committed to a worldwide struggle\" to promote freedom, and now was the time for the nation to \"fulfill its promise.\"\n \"We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home,\" Kennedy said, \"but are we to say to the world -- and much more importantly, to each other -- that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes?\"\n The Capitol mob has created the same type of political environment for change. The Floyd protests sparked some changes at local and state levels and led a cultural shift among Whites who began to consider their own racism. But they have yet to bring any racially transformative changes at the federal level.\n The Capitol insurrection, however, has created the conditions for such potential changes under President-elect Joe Biden.\n Consider the political appetite for racially transformative change in a new Congress where both Houses are controlled by the Democrats and the GOP is now in disarray.\n Start with voting rights reform. There is no racial issue more important than voting rights. A famous 19th-century Supreme Court decision declared that voting is \"a fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights.\"\n It's easy to forget, but the Capitol riot was sparked by some voters' distrust of elections. Trump and some Republican lawmakers claim, without evidence, that the Presidential Election was stolen by voter fraud. Progressives counter that Republicans employ such tactics as voter purges, restricting early voting and closing polling stations in predominantly Black communities.\n There's a growing sense that America's electoral system is broken.\n One voting rights expert says this is the perfect opportunity for Congress to repair the damage done by the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which opened the door to voter suppression tactics by removing a key enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act.\n Democrats could pass an updated version of what's now being called the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would block voter purges, ensure easy access to early voting and restore federal supervision of voting changes in states with a history of voter suppression, says Richard L. Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n The new Congress could also cite the mayhem at the Capitol building as a reason to crack down on social media platforms where users spread misinformation about voter fraud. Several Democratic leaders say social media helped spark the riot.\n \"Congress was attacked ... by a mob that was radicalized in an echo chamber that Facebook and other big platforms created,\" said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey.\n These potential changes -- new federal laws expanding voting rights and regulating social media platforms -- aren't as dramatic as the throngs of protesters that flooded American streets last summer. But they are potentially more racially transformative.\n Many Americans are still stunned by what happened at the Capitol. An outgoing President who many consider to be a White supremacist tried to incite lawmakers and citizens to overturn a legitimate election and block an incoming administration which includes the nation's first Black and South Asian vice-president.\n For some, the Capitol mob's actions reminded them of White terrorism in the Jim Crow South. White militia groups such as the \"Red Shirts\"  used violence to intimidate voters and attack Blacks. In 1898, an armed White mob staged a coup against a multiracial government in Wilmington, North Carolina, and killed more than 60 Black people.\n There's also a growing recognition that what the Capitol mob did is nothing new.\n \"Since the nation's founding, a large portion of White citizens have embraced free and democratic elections only when the political system did not require them to share power with people of color,\" the historian Joshua Zeitz wrote in a recent essay for Politico.\n Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born former Republican governor of California, said it reminded him of Kristallnacht \u2014 the \"Night of Broken Glass\" \u2014 an infamous episode in 1938 in which a mob of Nazi sympathizers rampaged through Jewish neighborhoods in Germany, killing Jews and destroying synagogues and Jewish-owned stores.\n \"Wednesday was the day of broken glass right here in the United States,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"The broken glass was in the windows of the United States Capitol. But the mob did not just shatter the windows of the Capitol. They shattered the ideals we took for granted. They did not just break down the doors of the building that housed American democracy. They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded.\"\n How the Biden administration channels the outrage of people like Schwarzenegger will be critical in the weeks ahead. Many Americans see the Capitol rioters as patriots and freedom fighters. Some on the far right have praised the assault as a \"second revolution.\"\n How future Americans view the Capitol assault will also depend on what vision of America prevails -- Trumpism or the egalitarian principles that Schwarzenegger evoked.\n If the forces that drove rioters to ransack Congress gain permanent political power, the notion of citizens choosing their Whiteness over democracy won't seem so offensive.\n But if America fulfills what Kennedy called \"its promise,\" those images of White supremacists in the Capitol Rotunda will join the shameful gallery of photos that includes the 1963 Birmingham protests.\n The rioters will be viewed as symbols of a bygone America its citizens have left behind.",

The Raskins said Tommy Raskin began experiencing depression in his 20s, something that became \"a kind of relentless torture in the brain for him.\"\n The comments on Sunday from Raskin come just days after the House moved to impeach Trump for a second time, this time charging the President with inciting a violent mob that stormed the US Capitol, an offense Raskin described as uniquely dangerous.\n \"This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America. The most dangerous crime by a president ever committed against the United States,\" he told Tapper.\n The congressman also said that House Democrats will transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate \"soon,\" an action that will eventually result in the start of Trump's impeachment trial.\n \"I know that (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) also considers the President a clear and present danger to the republic,\" Raskin said.\n Raskin, who is one of nine House impeachment managers, also addressed his party's decision to pursue a Senate conviction of an outgoing president, arguing Trump must be held accountable for his role inciting the violent mob on January 6.\n \"I don't think anybody would seriously argue that we should establish a precedent where every president on the way out the door has two weeks or three weeks or four weeks to try to incite an armed insurrection against the union or organize a coup against the union, and if it succeeds, he becomes a dictator, and if it fails, he's not subject to impeachment or conviction because we just want to let bygones be bygones,\" he said.\n But pressed by Tapper on whether the Democratic impeachment managers would seek witnesses for the impending trial, Raskin declined to give specifics.\n \"We're putting together a trial plan, which is designed to get the truth of all of these events out,\" Raskin said. \"Obviously, we're not going to be able to tell everyone's story, but we are going to be able to tell the story of this attack on America and all of the events that led up to it.\"\n Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin told Tapper on the same program Sunday that his party's leadership hasn't promised when it will deliver the impeachment article to the Senate but added that \"we have a responsibility to act as quickly as possible.\"\n Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who will soon become majority leader, said last week that Trump's trial can \"begin immediately\" if an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can be reached -- but the Kentucky Republican has made clear that the trial won't start until after January 19.\n If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454.\n This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.\n CNN's Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Federal prisons across the United States have been placed under temporary lockdown ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) announced Saturday that it is securing all institutions \"in light of current events occurring around the country.\"\n \"There is no specific information that triggered this decision,\" the statement said. \"This action is precautionary, and is not in response to any significant events occurring inside our facilities.\"\n Security measures are being stepped up ahead of Inauguration Day, with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies preparing for the possibility of more violence after rioters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, leaving five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.\n The FBI has also received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington, DC in the days leading up to Biden's inauguration on January 20, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN.\n Shane Fausey, president of the Council of Prison Locals, told CNN in a statement that he supports the national lockdown.\n \"In consultation with the Council of Prison Locals, and out of an abundance of precaution, I can only applaud the leadership of the Federal Bureau of Prisons for initiating this national lockdown,\" he said. \"With patience and support of the American people, I am confident the Bureau of Prisons and our outstanding employees will resume normal operations.\"\n Inmates will be given limited access to telephones and email to remain in contact with their families, the BOP said. The agency added that it hopes to remove the lockdown after a short period of time and that operations will return to normal \"as soon as practical.\"\n CNN's Zachary Cohen and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Melania Trump will be exiting the White House with the lowest favorability rating of her tenure as first lady, according to a new CNN poll.\n At 47%, more people have an unfavorable view of the first lady now than at any point since CNN first asked about views of her in February 2016. The poll, conducted by SSRS for CNN, puts Trump's favorable rating at 42%, with 12% of those asked answering they are unsure of their feelings about the first lady.\n Trump's highest favorable rating was in May 2018 at 57% according to a CNN poll taken at the time, which came on the heels of the first state dinner and Trump's attendance at the Texas funeral of the late first lady Barbara Bush. Trump went to the funeral without President Donald Trump.\n However, by December of that year, public opinion of Melania Trump had fallen by double-digits following her solo trip to Africa. At that time, her favorability was at 43% and her unfavorable at 36%, according to a CNN poll conducted at the time.\n The first lady's current favorability rating is notably higher than the President's (33%) and among Republicans, her favorability number (84%) is higher than either the President's (79%) or the Vice President's (72%).\n Public opinion of Trump as she leaves is dramatically below that of her most recent predecessors. According to a CNN/ORC poll in January 2017, Michelle Obama departed the White House with a 69% favorable rating, which was the same number as when she entered, eight years prior. Laura Bush's parting ranking was also largely positive, despite her husband's unpopularity at the time. In 2009, a CNN/ORC poll put Bush at a 67% favorable rating, while George W. Bush was only viewed positively by 35%. Hillary Clinton will also beat Trump as a better liked first lady. In a November 2000 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, just prior to Clinton's exit, her favorable number stood at 56%, fourteen percentage points higher than Trump.\n The methodology and weighting for the poll had been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cellphones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for partisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls.\n The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

        "title": "People want the Covid-19 vaccine, but the government is failing",
        "body_text": "It's been over a month now since the first Covid-19 vaccines were distributed in the United States, and we still haven't reached the initial goal set out for 20 million Americans to be vaccinated -- one initially set for the end of 2020. That has come and gone, and the promised windfall of doses being released from the federal reserve turned out to be a false hope, as the reserve had already been exhausted.\n The federal government led by President Donald Trump has over-promised and under-delivered. As more and more Americans want the vaccine, we're getting more shots into arms, but not enough.\n The number of Americans vaccinated with at least one dose as of Friday stands at 10.6 million, according to the CDC. The number of total doses administered stands at 12.3 million. That's an increase of more than 5 million from last Friday, which equals to a little less than 1 million doses administered per day. Just a week ago, we averaged giving out about 500,000 vaccines on a given weekday.\n This was the first week in which we had at least one day of 1 million vaccines delivered on a given day and multiple reported days of at least 800,000 doses administered per day, though most days fell short of the incoming Biden's administration promise of a million doses per day.\n Part of the rising vaccination rates has to do with the fact that more people who received a first dose are now eligible for a second. Part has at least partially to do with states loosening their restrictions on who can get the vaccine.\n Still, even as the number of vaccinations rise, there are many doses that have yet to be used. The ratio of vaccines administered to those distributed to the states stands at 39%. That's better than it's ever been, but still is an indication that we're struggling to get the vaccines we do have into people.\n It would be tempting to think that this is a problem of Democratic or Republican governance. To the degree that the President is a Republican, it is.\n It's not as simple as that, however.\n There is no clear relationship between the partisanship of a state's governor and the number of vaccines distributed.\n Four of the top 10 states (and District of Columbia) for vaccinations per 100,000 have Democratic heads, while four of the worst 10 states for vaccinations per 100,000 have Democratic governors.\n Perhaps the best example of this is to look at New York and Florida. Both have similarly sized populations, but one with a Democratic and one with a Republican governor. They're ranked right near each other for the number of vaccines administered and both have a similar ratio of vaccines administered vs. distributed to each state.\n Indeed, it seems that one factor into how many people are getting a vaccine is the size of the population of each state. The states (and the District of Columbia) with the 10 smallest populations have vaccinated about 5,000 per 100,000 on average, while the states with the 10 largest populations have vaccinated about 3,300 per 100,000.\n This basic relationship of less populated states doing better at administering the vaccine holds even when controlling for the number of doses given to each state per 100,000.\n While it's difficult to untangle why less populated states would be better, it could just be as simple as less populated states being able to coordinate better.\n Fortunately, the problem so far hasn't seemed to be an unwillingness for folks to get vaccinated.\n The fact is that more and more Americans say they want to get the vaccine.\n In a Gallup poll this week, 65% said they'd get the Covid-19 vaccine if it was available to them at no cost. That's the highest percentage who said that in a Gallup poll since July.\n Likewise, an Axios/Ipsos poll finds that 60% say it's at least somewhat likely they'll get the vaccine as soon as it's available. That's the highest percentage that poll has ever recorded on this question. The percentage (37%) who say they're very likely to get it is also its highest ever in the poll.\n This makes sense because one of Americans' biggest reasons for not getting the vaccine was that they wanted to see if it was safe and effective. Given that the vaccines have proven to be exactly that through trials and one month of distribution in America, we would have expected it to rise.\n That perhaps leaves us with the biggest remaining question on the Covid-19 vaccines in America. When will the supply and distribution meet the demand?\n Hopefully, the Biden administration doesn't drop the ball like the Trump administration clearly has.",

We will keep you informed,\" Hogan Gidley, the campaign's national press secretary, wrote in a tweet early Sunday.\n The announcement comes as the President stares down his second Senate impeachment trial, with this one set to take place after he leaves office later this week. The chamber will consider an article of impeachment passed by the House last week that charged Trump with inciting a deadly riot at the US Capitol earlier this month.\n Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who will soon become majority leader, said last week that the trial can \"begin immediately\" if an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can be reached -- but the Kentucky Republican has made clear that the trial won't start until after January 19.\n Though the President hasn't formally announced a legal team to defend him in the trial, his longtime personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was seen at the White House on Saturday, and the former New York mayor told ABC that day that he is involved with and working on the President's impeachment defense ahead of the trial.\n But Trump has told people he wants to stop paying Giuliani's legal fees in recent days out of frustration that he faces a second impeachment, though aides were unsure how serious the President was about his instruction.\n CNN has reported that Trump blames Giuliani for his current predicament; Giuliani has played a leading role in promoting the kinds of election conspiracy theories that drove Trump supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6. Giuliani is still expected to play some role in Trump's defense.\n Meanwhile, John Eastman, the conservative attorney who falsely told Trump that Vice President Mike Pence could block the certification of Biden's win, could join Trump's legal team defending him in the upcoming impeachment trial, a person familiar with the matter said. But those discussions are still preliminary and Eastman isn't yet formally a part of the team.\n White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and her deputy, Brian Morgenstern, both had their last day on Friday, leaving the White House press shop largely vacant for the remainder of Trump's term.",

        "title": "How to modify popular yoga poses if you're super inflexible",
        "body_text": "Contrary to popular belief, yoga isn't just for the super flexible. However, trying to complete moves that are out of your comfort zone can be frustrating. There are plenty of people who suffer from this same feeling of discouragement, so you're not alone. That's why it's important to explore the alternatives to difficult poses and remember that there are always ways to modify yoga poses to develop your flexibility.\n Flexibility is essential in our everyday lives. Whether it's bending down to grab something we dropped or stretching out our arms to reach another object, we all need a certain level of flexibility. It doesn't always come naturally, though. Flexibility has to do with age, joints, body size and a range of other factors. Some of the main predictors of flexibility are out of our control. Still, there are ways to improve.\n Yoga increases flexibility and balance over time, research has shown. I've compiled a list of five yoga poses that can be modified to reach your level of flexibility. Everyone's body is different, so don't feel bad about taking advantage of modifications that help you feel comfortable. These moves will help you start feeling looser and more relaxed. You might even discover a new love for yoga!\n For each pose, breathe in and out slowly through your nose.\n This pose will stretch your hamstrings, calves, shoulders and the entire back of your body.\n To begin, start with your hands and knees on the mat. Keep your hands on the mat at shoulder width apart. Walk your knees back a few inches behind your hips. Then tuck your toes under and lift your hips up into the downward-facing pose.\n Reach through your heels toward the ground, and draw your naval in toward your spine.\n If you've got a tight low back or hamstrings, step the feet out wider than your hips and bend your knees.\n If you've got tight shoulders, you can turn your hands outward toward the top corners of the mat so that the wrists are no longer parallel to the top of the mat.\n This pose stretches your spine and chest.\n Begin by lying down with your stomach on the mat. Press your hands to the mat at your chest. Keep your elbows bent close to your body. Press the tops of your feet into the ground.\n As you breathe in, press your hands into the mat and press the tops of your feet into the ground to come up into the upward-facing pose. Keep your thighs and feet as wide as your hips. Then straighten your arms and lift your torso and thighs up off the mat. Roll the shoulders back and open the chest.\n Hold for a few breaths, and then release.\n If you don't have the shoulder flexibility for this, simply come into cobra pose by pressing the hands into the mat but keeping the thighs onto the mat. Lift your head, neck and chest off of the ground slightly while pressing firmly into the ground with your thighs and feet. Keep the thighs and feet open just as wide as your hips.\n If your low back is too tight, open the legs as wide as the mat and perform cobra.\n If your spine and hamstrings are feeling stiff, this pose can help you loosen up.\n Start with a standing forward bend (reaching toward your toes). As you inhale, press your fingertips into the ground and begin to move your chest away from your body and straighten your arms. Your back should be as straight as possible, forming as close to a 90-degree angle with your legs as possible.\n Press the feet into the ground as wide as the hips, and keep the legs straight by engaging your quadriceps.\n If your upper back doesn't have the flexibility to lift up very high, move your fingertips up to your shins and press them into your shins.\n If your low back and hamstrings are lacking flexibility, open the feet a little bit wider than the hips, bend the knees and press the fingertips onto the shins as you look up.\n Triangle engages the hips, groins and hamstrings, offering a heavy stretch.\n Begin by standing on your mat. Move your feet so that they are about 4 or 5 feet apart with your heels aligned. Point your right foot so that it is perpendicular to your left. With your arms in a T shape, shift your hips to the left as you reach your right arm toward the front.\n Then lower the right fingertips to the ground and reach the left arm up toward the ceiling. Turn your head to look up at your left fingertips, or if it's more comfortable, turn your head in the opposite direction and look down.\n Engage both quads and your core to hold yourself in this position for a few breaths.\n If your inner thighs, groin, and hamstrings are too tight for the full expression of triangle, try placing your right hand onto your shin instead of on the ground. Keep your left hand on your hip. Bring your legs a little bit closer together (so about 3 feet apart).\n This pose stretches the back of the body and the hips.\n Begin by kneeling on the floor with your calves underneath your butt. Keep your inner thighs pressing toward each other. Then walk your hands forward and reach your glutes back over your heels.\n Take a few deep breaths here.\n If your hips are tight, open the knees as wide as the mat and keep the feet touching behind you. Then lean forward with your arms and reach your glutes back toward your heels. It's OK if your butt is up in the air.\n If your shoulders are tight, reach your arms out toward the front corners of the mat so that they're a little bit wider than your shoulders.\n If you want to work on your flexibility, start by performing these modified moves. Yoga is meant to help you improve, so don't worry if you struggle at first. Keep it low-key. You may find yourself becoming looser and wanting even more of a stretch as time goes on.\n Stephanie Mansour, host of \"Step It Up With Steph\" on PBS, is a health and wellness journalist and a consultant and weight loss coach for women.",

        "title": "How empty stadiums proved useful during the Covid-19 pandemic",
        "body_text": "On March 11, sports in the United States came to terms with the arrival of the coronavirus.\n An NBA player tested positive shortly before tipoff in Oklahoma City, forcing the game's cancellation. Within days, every major sports league in the US had shut down.\n The ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic continue to be felt in all corners of American life, as the nation approaches a full year's worth of personal and economic devastation. Nearly 400,000 Americans have died from Covid-19.\n Amid the turmoil, sports teams and cities opened their empty facilities for assistance efforts. Because of their day-to-day experiences with traffic flow, crowd control and project management, arenas and stadiums proved practical as Covid-19 testing sites and food banks.\n During the 2020 election season, some became early voting and Election Day centers, allowing Americans easier access to voting while maintaining social distancing guidelines.\n Now, stadiums are gearing up for the next phase of combating the pandemic. Health officials and local governments are working with sports facilities across the country to be used as vaccination hubs.\n Sports leagues eventually restarted in summer with only limited crowds at a few select events. Many grandstands remain silent, yet their usefulness is apparent heading into the new year. The abrupt shift witnessed in 2020, from entertainment outlets to critical resource centers, provided images that were often hard to believe.\n The Covid-19 pandemic also brought a crippling economic crisis. More than 20 million Americans lost their jobs by the end of April.\n The strain on food bank facilities soon followed the March lockdowns. Katie Fitzgerald, chief operating officer at Feeding America, a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs, told CNN in late March that food banks reported a 40% increase in demand.\n \"It's the speed that this is hitting us that is making it so difficult to contend with,\" Fitzgerald said. \"The current inventories that we have in place were not designed to serve the numbers of people who need help now.\"\n To help with dispensing, food centers were established by charities and organizations at stadiums nationwide.\n Stadium parking lots in the spring and summer, filled in years past by tailgaters, staff and street vendors, instead became home to pop-up tents for Covid-19 testing.\n Nurses and health practitioners administered PCR nasal tests at a multitude of sports facilities, as state and federal governments raced to understand how widespread the virus had become.\n Massive parking lots kept cars off main roads, freeing up traffic. The sheer volume of those in need, however, meant lines would stretch beyond anything expected.\n Arenas and stadiums across the country opened their doors in the fall for an additional purpose: polling locations during the 2020 election cycle. This gave many voters an alternate way to submit ballots and stay safe by limiting proximity to others and potential Covid-19 exposure.\n Initially, voting locations in Atlanta during the June Georgia primary suffered from long lines and fewer election staffers, hindered by the realities presented by the pandemic.\n In response, the Atlanta Hawks opened State Farm Arena as a November voting center for Fulton County, easily accessible via public transportation.\n \"State Farm Arena is an ideal solution to help us serve thousands of voters while maintaining social distancing requirements,\" Mary Carole Cooney, chairperson of the Fulton County Board of Registration & Elections, said in June. \"We appreciate the Hawks for coming to us with this creative solution.\"\n The NBA had more than 20 of its franchises offer their stadiums for polling and voting stations. Other sports league franchises also pitched in to increase safe voting access.\n The vaccines cleared for emergency use authorization in December by the Food and Drug Administration have given the nation a proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.\n Stadiums that assisted with earlier food bank efforts, Covid-19 testing and voting were well-positioned for the next phase of pandemic relief.\n On Friday, Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles became a hub for vaccine distribution, soon capable of inoculating 12,000 people each day according to officials.\n Mayor Eric Garcetti referred to it as the \"biggest vaccination site in the country,\" urging eligible residents to get the vaccine. Other stadium programs are underway.\n David Ortiz, public information officer for the LA City Fire Department, told CNN's Paul Vercammen that working with the Dodgers and using their stadium lot is a boon for the county's vaccination efforts.\n \"Three hundred and sixty-five acres of prime real estate in downtown Los Angeles, available for us to use to help and take care of people. We couldn't have done this without them,\" Ortiz said.\n CNN's Paul Vercammen, Tami Luhby and Sheila Sarmiento contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in a new interview airing Sunday recalled the time Beau Biden, the late son of President-elect Joe Biden, stood by his principles in a moment of \"incredible\" pressure.\n \"His state hadn't been as hard-hit as many around the foreclosures, but Beau, on a matter of principle, said it's not right and I'm going to stand with you guys,\" Harris said of Biden, reflecting on the time the two served as attorneys general of California and Delaware, respectively, during the 2010 foreclosure crisis.\n \"It was incredible how much heat we took, and Beau stood there. Beau stood there,\" Harris told CNN's Abby Phillip in a special report set to air Sunday night.\n Harris had grown close with Biden, working on how to take on national banks during the crisis, when there was a wave of improper foreclosures initiated by large banks and other lenders. Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer at the age of 46.\n Harris wrote in her memoir, \"The Truths We Hold,\" that Beau Biden was \"an incredible friend and colleague\" who had the \"principle and courage\" to take on banks that were largely organized in Delaware.\n \"There were periods, when I was taking heat, when Beau and I talked every day, sometimes multiple times a day,\" Harris wrote. \"We had each other's backs.\"\n California was among the hardest-hit states during the crisis, and banks filed foreclosures on more than 1 million homes. \"I determined that what the banks were offering California was crumbs on the table. So I pulled California out of the negotiations,\" Harris told Phillips.\n Harris, a Democratic senator from California, will make history on Wednesday as the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to be sworn in as vice president of the United States. CNN's hour-long special report,\u00a0Kamala Harris: Making History,\u00a0will air on Sunday, January 17 at 10 p.m. ET.\n Harris, in her interview with Phillip, also addressed her record as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California, which has been the subject of scrutiny and criticism by progressives.\n \"There are a lot of nuances in what it means to be a prosecutor, especially in this moment, that is, I think, long overdue where America is coming to a reckoning on a lot of issues that deal with racial injustice,\" Harris said.\n And reflecting on her failed 2020 presidential bid in the interview, the vice president-elect told Phillip that \"making a decision to get out of a race is probably as difficult as making a decision to get into a race.\"\n Harris dropped out of the race in December 2019. When she later endorsed Joe Biden for president in March 2020, she spoke about Beau Biden and how she came to know the President-elect through his son.\n \"He spoke with so much love about the father that raised the man who he was,\" Harris said of Beau in her endorsement speech. \"I know Joe. And that is why I am supporting him.\"\n Biden went on to tap Harris as his running mate in August of that year.",

        "body_text": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo departs his Foggy Bottom post on Wednesday a loyal Trump footman to the very end.\n His nearly three-year term as the top US diplomat was marked by an \"America First\" approach that saw fundamental and oftentimes controversial shifts in foreign policy, from Iran to China to Israel. Some of his most consequential decisions were announced in the final weeks of his tenure, leaving behind a minefield for the Biden administration to navigate.\n He pledged to bring \"swagger\" to the State Department, but he is leaving it \"hollowed out,\" in the words of his ousted ambassador to Ukraine.\n And as the United States continues to grapple with the fallout of an assault on its very institutions of democracy -- one incited by the President and his allies -- Pompeo leaves with an apparent eye toward his own political future on a tide of Twitter self-congratulations.\n In the weeks leading up the inauguration, Pompeo has used his official State Department account to share dozens and dozens of tweets about his legacy as top US diplomat -- an enumeration of \"the mission set, the huge wins, personal stories, and a lot more,\" he said. \"Just me, Mike.\"\n Many were pugnacious, with the Harvard-educated lawyer taking aim at the foreign policy \"elite\" and the Obama administration. Several called for the account's three million followers to follow him on his personal Twitter page. One, posted Wednesday, suggested President Donald Trump should be nominated for a Nobel Prize for his work on normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\n Hours later, Trump was impeached for an unprecedented second time, this time for \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n In an interview just a day prior, Pompeo suggested that he did not believe the deadly attack on the US Capitol would tarnish the administration's legacy.\n \"Look, what happened that day was terrible, and I have said repeatedly that those folks who engaged in this activity need to be identified, prosecuted, and they are criminals and ought to be treated as such,\" he told Hugh Hewitt.\n \"But history will reflect on the good work that this President and our administration has done. Those books will be written about the changes that we have made in the world, the recognition that we have taken about reality, sovereignty, respect for basic dignity and human rights, a return to the founding principles in a way that previous administrations had not done,\" he said.\n One former senior State Department official told CNN that \"in many ways, Mike Pompeo's singular accomplishment is that he didn't get fired and that he somehow survived four years with this President, and not many can claim that.\"\n Pompeo was Trump's CIA Director prior to moving to the State Department.\n \"As in all things related to this administration, there is no such thing as a Pompeo legacy or Tillerson legacy or a Mattis legacy or an Esper legacy. It's only the Trump legacy, because of how the President understands himself and understands everyone around him,\" the official said.\n Four years of the Trump administration have left the United States isolated on the world stage, its credibility shaken as Trump upended traditional foreign policy, pulled out of multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization and withdrew from treaties like the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal.\n The US President disparaged allies and sought personal diplomacy with some of the world's most dangerous leaders. He held two summits with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and exchanged \"beautiful\" letters with him.\n He pursued an unusually close relationship with Vladimir Putin, siding with the Russian leader over his own intelligence community regarding 2016 election interference.\n These relations resulted in neither a denuclearized North Korea nor a subdued Putin. Just this week, Kim unveiled a new submarine-launched ballistic missile. Russia has continued to illegally occupy Crimea, was linked to a massive cyberattack on the US government, attempted to meddle in the US election, put bounties on US soldiers and its secret police force tried to murder a leading Kremlin critic.\n \"We're in a worse place today than we were before he came in, and I didn't think that was possible,\" said former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was fired in March 2018.\n In an interview with Bloomberg at the beginning of January, Pompeo declined to offer details on his future plans, but said he was proud of the work the administration had done.\n \"I've made some real friends and I've had a chance to see people at every level in the United States Government working and striving to keep the American people safe,\" he said.\n Pompeo said that \"after four years, I think we're leaving the world safer than when we came in\" -- a claim belied by the ongoing global pandemic and aggression of adversaries worldwide, some of whom were emboldened by the very policies this administration put in place.\n \"I hope that the policies that we put in place will have the capacity to continue,\" he said.\n Pompeo and members of his State Department team were the faces of some of the administration's biggest efforts -- its hawkish China strategy, its unprecedented dealings with the Taliban, its \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran, and its reversal of long-standing policies on Israel.\n Another former senior State Department official also said that \"whether it was Iran, actions with China, his own interpretation of human rights, or the meshing of domestic political agenda with what State did, all that seemed driven by strong personal interests as well.\"\n The top US diplomat played a steady drumbeat of anti-Beijing rhetoric throughout his tenure, calling the Chinese Communist Party the \"central threat of our times\" as tensions between the two nations spiked. He enacted aggressive policies aimed at countering the Chinese government; Beijing frequently responded with tit-for-tat retaliation.\n He imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government officials, designated Chinese media companies based in the United States as foreign missions, and shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston, accusing it of being a central node of Chinese espionage.\n The administration unveiled a number of punitive measures for crackdowns on protesters and Beijing's encroachment into the once semi-autonomous region. Pompeo also spoke out about the Chinese government's brutal campaign of repression against the Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang.\n Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach described Pompeo as \"very strategic\" and \"tough,\" which he saw as attributes in dealing with China.\n \"If I look at China, in order to have areas of cooperation with them, we actually have to compete with them first. They look at it as a zero-sum game. And the only way to deal with it is from a position of strength,\" he told CNN.\n Krach said that he believed the Clean Network initiative, under which dozens of governments and companies pledged to use \"trusted\" telecommunications partners as opposed to companies like Huawei, would be one of the lasting legacies of the State Department under Pompeo. The administration threatened to limit intelligence sharing with nations who used the Chinese telecom giant.\n As Pompeo hardened America's policies towards China, in his final days he announced a major policy shift to clear the way for US diplomats and other government officials to deal directly with Taiwan government officials in a move that seemed aimed at boxing in the Biden administration.\n It was one of the many significant announcements he unveiled at the 11th hour, along with re-designating Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism and designating Yemen's Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization. Experts fear the latter could lead to famine in the war-torn nation.\n As part of the administration's efforts to end America's longest-running war -- a Trump campaign pledge -- Pompeo and his team did something no American leader had been willing to do before: meet and sign an agreement with the Taliban. That agreement, signed in February 2020, eventually led to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, but those talks have yet to yield results.\n In the meantime, deadly violence in Afghanistan has continued and reports found that the Taliban has not distanced itself from al Qaeda after pledging to do so. Despite Trump administration officials' claims that a US withdrawal from the country would be conditions-based, Trump continued to decrease troop levels -- which some argue has given the Taliban the upper hand in negotiations. With the Trump administration coming to an end, the nearly two-decade presence on the ground continues, with 2,500 troops as of Friday.\n Pompeo began his tenure by laying out 12 demands of Iran and pursued a policy of crushing sanctions for the subsequent two and half years. That \"maximum pressure\" policy saw the US consistently isolated from its major allies -- glaringly so, for example, when it tried to extend a conventional weapons embargo on Iran last year. Rather than constraint, the administration's approach has led to a more belligerent Tehran. It increasingly breached the commitments it made under the Iran nuclear deal, which the US abandoned in May 2018. Iran recently announced it would enrich uranium up to 20% purity.\n \"If we had stayed in the JCPOA, they never would have done that,\" the first former senior State Department official said.\n The US also saw itself isolated from allies on Israel as the Trump administration relocated its embassy to Jerusalem and broke with historic and international precedent to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights - territory taken from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War.\n Pompeo announced in November 2019 that the US would no longer consider Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank de facto illegal, a major reversal of the US' longstanding policy.\n \"Nobody really wanted to touch it, and he was willing to touch it,\" US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said of the prior position on settlements, which had been in place since 1978. Friedman, a Trump political appointee, told CNN that Pompeo commissioned \"a good amount of energy within the legal department of State\" to make it happen.\n During one of his last trips as top US diplomat, Pompeo became the first secretary of state to visit one of the settlements, which are considered illegal under international law, as well as the Golan Heights. The visit fueled speculation about his 2024 presidential ambitions, as it was seen by some as an attempt to appeal to US evangelical voters.\n This was far from Pompeo's first apparent outreach to the conservative American evangelical community. Last year, he spoke at a megachurch in Texas, appeared at the conservative Values Voters Summit, and delivered the keynote address for a conservative, anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion Christian organization in Florida. The former Kansas congressman has used his position to institute religious freedom policies and strong anti-abortion measures.\n In Israel, Pompeo recorded a speech for the Republican National Convention, a stark break from his past secretaries who largely avoided partisan politics while in office, an apparent breach of his own State Department regulations, and a possible violation of the law. The State Department said at the time he was making the speech in his personal capacity and no taxpayer resources were used.\n His time in office was marked by several Office of Inspector General inquiries, including one into potential misuse of taxpayer resources by himself and his wife, and a controversial ouster of inspector general Steve Linick.\n Pompeo waded into the domestic political fray in July remarks at the unveiling of the draft report from his long-touted \"Commission on Unalienable Rights,\" casting ire at the New York Times' \"1619 Project\" and warning that \"the very core of what it means to be an American, indeed the American way of life itself, is under attack\" amid nationwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality.\n But on the underlying issue motivating those protests, Pompeo remained largely silent. He did not immediately comment on the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, to the disappointment of diplomats who spoke to CNN.\n And when he was asked about Trump forcibly removing peaceful protesters from outside of the White House and the message it projected to the world, Pompeo scoffed at the question. It was one of many contentious exchanges between the free press and the top US diplomat, who once excoriated an NPR reporter in a statement bearing the State Department seal. He used one of his final public speeches to accuse the Voice of America news service of \"demeaning America\" in a speech that a watchdog group criticized as \"political propaganda\" and a violation of the government-funded agency's own rules. A VOA reporter who attempted to ask Pompeo a question following that speech -- during which he took no queries from journalists -- was quickly reassigned.\n In his early days on the job Pompeo promised the State Department would get its \"swagger\" back under his leadership, but many diplomats have told CNN he failed.\n Sources said there were high hopes for the outset of his tenure, as he took over a department decimated under Tillerson, with the first senior State Department official telling CNN that Pompeo made \"significant headway at the beginning of his tenure\" in making the State Department relevant to the President.\n That changed drastically with Trump's first impeachment \"and this kind of remarkable parade of senior State Department officials who are subpoenaed and called to the Hill to testify against him,\" the official said.\n The most prevalent of those State Department officials was highly respected former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed from her post after a coordinated campaign by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others.\n As she was repeatedly impugned by Trump, Pompeo remained silent. Morale plummeted.\n \"I remain disappointed that the department's leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong,\" she testified before lawmakers in November 2019. \"This is about far more than me or a couple of individuals. As Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasn't already.\"\n Some former diplomats said that Pompeo deserves credit for preventing Trump from doing further damage to the Department in the wake of the first impeachment.\n But many officials and diplomats who spoke to CNN throughout his tenure believed that Pompeo repeatedly relinquished his duty to support, protect and inspire the diplomatic corps when tumult at home impinged on their work to advocate for American democracy around the world, from the crackdowns on peaceful protesters in the US to his failure to initially acknowledge Joe Biden's victory to most recently with his response to the violent insurrection at the Capitol.\n Pompeo's public response in the aftermath of the attack consisted of three tweets condemning the violence and calling for those responsible to be held accountable. They were a brief interlude in his tweets about \"America First\" accomplishments. For some his actions in his final days was the breaking point.\n \"What we saw on Wednesday is the antithesis of the work of the State Department,\" said a State Department political appointee who quit the week of the protests. \"I do not see how this is any different than an attack on one of our embassies. I cannot believe that Secretary Pompeo has demonstrated such a lack of leadership on this. It is absolutely disgraceful.\"\n CNN's Nicole Gaouette contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Joe Biden's incoming White House chief of staff on Sunday did not rule out blocking President Donald Trump from receiving intelligence briefings once he is a private citizen.\n Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" whether the Biden administration would follow recommendations from a former intelligence official to limit Trump's access to classified information, Ron Klain said, \"We'll certainly look for a recommendation from the intelligence professionals in the Biden-Harris administration once they're in place and act on that recommendation.\"\n \"So obviously, we don't have those intelligence professionals in place yet. (I) hope the Senate moves to confirm them quickly and then we'll look what they recommend in terms of intelligence sharing going forward,\" he continued.\n Former Trump principal deputy director of national intelligence Sue Gordon wrote in an op-ed published in The Washington Post on Friday that Trump \"might be unusually vulnerable to bad actors with ill intent\" once he is no longer President.\n \"He leaves, unlike his predecessors who embraced the muted responsibilities of being a 'former,' with a stated agenda to stay engaged in politics and policy,\" she wrote. \"No departing president in the modern era has hinted at or planned on becoming a political actor immediately after leaving office.\"\n Gordon's op-ed came in the wake of Trump's role inciting a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.\n Klain told Tapper that the incoming Biden administration has concerns about threats to state capitol buildings across the country ahead of Inauguration Day. But he added that he thinks the Secret Service and the more than 20,000 National Guard troops will keep Washington, DC, and inaugurations events safe.\n \"These broader threats, Jake, are concerning,\" Klain said. \"The President did incite this mob on January, 6 and that's very, very, disconcerting. ... We are obviously getting briefings from the outgoing administration about the efforts to try to secure state capitals, secure Washington, DC.\"\n Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on \"Inside Politics\" that Biden should cut Trump off from briefings.\n \"There's a grave danger of him inadvertently or willfully revealing classified information that would compromise sources and methods,\" he told CNN's John King. \"There is no upside, there is no reason that he needs to have this information. It's a courtesy that's been passed on from president to president, but there is no legal requirement and I think given his past history of being fast and loose with intelligence data, it ought to be -- that ought to be an easy decision for the incoming President.\"\n Former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, a Trump ally turned critic, told Tapper that while there are \"many reasons\" for the assault on the US Capitol, the President's \"sustained disinformation\" are chief among them.\n McMaster wouldn't say whether the Senate should convict Trump, but told Tapper it would be \"terribly divisive for our country for him to run again\" and that \"our reputation is harmed\" around the world because of the insurrection and the President's attacks on democracy.\n This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.\n CNN's Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.",

        "title": "CNN Poll: Republican Party favorability dips as most want party to move on from Trump",
        "body_text": "The Republican Party will begin its time as the minority party in Washington unpopular with a public ready to move on from President Donald Trump, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. The poll also finds that the most high-profile elected Republican who will remain in office after Trump leaves, Sen. Mitch McConnell, is viewed more negatively than ever before.\n The public overwhelmingly wants to see the Republican Party move on from Trump once he's left office. Overall, just 19% say the party ought to continue to treat Trump as its leader, while 77% say it should move on. Among Republicans, views are split, with 48% saying the party should move on and 47% saying the party should continue to treat Trump as the leader of the party. Independents who lean toward the Republican Party, however, are much more likely to say the party should move on from Trump (62% feel that way).\n And after months of the Trump campaign and conservative media sowing doubts about the results of the 2020 presidential election, self-identified Republicans are less likely to have confidence in American elections than are Democrats, which could complicate GOP efforts to get those voters to the polls in future contests. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Yet 75% of Republicans say they have little or no confidence that elections in America today reflect the will of the people, including a majority (57%) who say they are not at all confident that election results represent the will of the people.\n The Republican Party's favorability rating has taken a 9-point hit since before Election Day, with just 32% viewing it favorably. That shift rests mostly on a decline in positive views among Republicans themselves: 92% had a positive take in October, just 76% do now.\n The drop in positive sentiment toward the GOP comes as opinions of Trump have also shifted negative. The President will leave office this week with the lowest approval rating of his term, while most would prefer him to be removed from office before January 20, and a majority describe his time in office as a failure.\n Views of the Democratic Party, meanwhile, have held about even, 49% have a favorable view now compared with 46% in October. And self-identified Democrats are more apt to have a favorable view of their own party (89%) than Republicans are to say they have a positive take on their chosen party.\n McConnell, the current majority leader who will become minority leader after Biden is inaugurated and the results of the Georgia Senate runoffs are certified, is viewed more negatively than he has been at any point in CNN's polling by a wide margin. About two-thirds (66%) have an unfavorable view of the Kentucky Republican, outpacing his previous high by 17 points. Those unfavorable views have grown across party lines, up 20 points among Republicans, 18 points among independents and up 14 points among Democrats since a December 2019 poll.\n McConnell's negatives far outpace those of any of the other top leaders in Congress, though none are viewed positively. Views of incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are about evenly divided, 39% favorable and 41% unfavorable. Most Democrats (75%) say they have a positive view of Schumer, about 30 points better than McConnell's favorability among Republicans.\n On the House side, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is viewed favorably by 44% and unfavorably by 52%. Democrats largely view the Speaker positively (84% favorable), while Republicans are sharply negative toward Pelosi (94% have an unfavorable view of her). House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is less well-known than other leaders in Congress (42% offer no opinion of him), but those with an opinion tilt slightly negative (25% favorable to 33% unfavorable). Among Republicans, 43% have a favorable view and 21% an unfavorable one.\n The methodology and weighting for this poll has been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cellphones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for partisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls.\n The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

John McCain and a member of the Biden-Harris Transition Advisory Council, which is partnering with organizations around the country to provide new opportunities to serve. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nFaith in our country is the bedrock of our democracy. My late husband John McCain spoke of falling in love with our country while he was a prisoner in someone else's. America's decency -- our \"faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people,\" he once said, makes America \"not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for.\" His experience meant he was no longer his own man -- he was his country's.\n America has been severely tested many times. This past year, hundreds of thousands of lives were lost to a global pandemic. Hospitals have been overwhelmed, businesses have shuttered. Communities and families have been devastated, their trust eroded by the lies many of their national leaders fed them.\n Yet, even in our darkest days, our collective faith endures in adversity. Heroes in all corners of our nation have emerged, connected by our foundational decency, empathy, and compassion for the dignity of our fellow citizens. Like John, Americans rose to the challenge because ours is a cause worth fighting for.\n Together, they have fought in service of their fellow man. Health care workers fought around the clock to save lives in ICUs, which many described as war zones. Essential workers have risked their lives keeping our grocery shelves stocked, our public transportation running, and our cities functioning. Educators have invented new ways to keep their students connected and learning. Our neighbors have offered a helping hand, from organizing local food drives to providing childcare and homemade PPE.\n No matter how many leaders betrayed our trust, John remained steadfast in his belief that most Americans were fundamentally good and decent people. No matter how many people lost their faith in our country, he continued to believe in our sacred trust to establish self-government as the only moral government. He would never have been dissuaded by angry threats, insurrectionists, false causes, lies, shattered glass or ransacked halls of Congress. No one could ever convince him that Americans weren't capable of living our ideals and making a better world than the one we inherited.\n President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris share that faith, and like John, they know it is strengthened by acts of service -- be they on the front lines of this health crisis, on battlefields overseas, in public service, or in simple acts of kindness to our neighbors. Our faith demonstrated through service is paramount to preserving and protecting our democracy.\n That's why at this pivotal moment in our history, we're marking a new dawn with a National Day of Service on January 18 -- the day we honor Martin Luther King Jr.'s pursuit of social justice through peaceful action.\n The Biden Inaugural Committee is partnering with organizations in every corner of our nation to provide opportunities to serve. By volunteering your time virtually or safely in person, you can take part in this new beginning in America. Just two days before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn into office, you can donate blood or convalescent plasma at a blood drive hosted by the American Red Cross or contribute to a local food drive. You can share your knowledge through virtual tutoring or write cards thanking our frontline workers. There are many ways to safely participate in this National Day of Service.\n Through these acts of service, we will honor not only King but also the Americans who served their fellow man and kept our nation moving forward during this perilous time.\n We will not be defined by the few among us who seek darkness through destruction and insurrection. John lived and breathed the idea that is America -- that each of us deserves decency that recognizes our dignity. That our country is only as strong as the respect and compassion we have for one another.\n As this dark chapter in our history comes to a tumultuous close, we know there will remain currents that attempt to pull us apart. But as we embark on this new era, we can trust that there are good men and women in every community in this country, as there have been in every American generation, who are making our nation safer, stronger and better.",

        "title": "Biden on track to take office without key Cabinet roles in place ",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden is on track to take office without key Cabinet members being confirmed on the day of his inauguration, a result of the Republican-led Senate moving much more slowly to schedule confirmation hearings and votes than it has for previous presidents.\n The timeline for confirming Biden's Cabinet nominees could accelerate when Democrats take control of the Senate in the coming days. But Republicans, amid the coronavirus pandemic and the Capitol riots, have been slow to schedule confirmation hearings.\n The first set of hearings is scheduled to take place January 19 -- days and in some cases weeks after those hearings have begun in recent transitions -- with no dates for confirmation set.\n The latest delay came when the Senate Intelligence Committee postponed what would have been the first confirmation hearing for a Biden nominee, moving from Friday until next Tuesday the hearing for Biden's pick to be the next director of national intelligence, Avril Haines.\n That makes next Tuesday -- the day before Biden's inauguration -- one jam-packed with confirmation hearings, with Biden's nominees to helm the defense, homeland security, state and treasury departments all scheduled to take place.\n The proximity to Biden's inauguration makes it unlikely Biden administration confirmations will proceed at the same pace as his predecessors in recent decades, with all new presidents in the last 30 years seeing at least some Cabinet nominees confirmed on the days of their inauguration.\n The early days of Biden's administration will see a collision in Congress of the Senate's trial of outgoing President Donald Trump, the process of confirming Biden's nominees and talks over Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus vaccine and economic stimulus proposal.\n With Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer set to replace Republican Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader following Biden's swearing-in and the swearing-in of two Georgia Democrats who won runoffs there this month -- making Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote in a Senate split 50-50 -- the confirmation schedule could accelerate.\n Biden officials are pressing for the Senate to operate on multiple tracks at once, holding confirmation hearings during Trump's impeachment trial. In a briefing with reporters Friday evening, Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki pointed to Trump's first impeachment, noting that the Senate held unrelated hearings during that trial.\n \"Our expectation and hope and belief is that we can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Psaki said. \"We are urging fast action on getting these nominees into place ... as close to day one as possible.\"\n Biden's transition team made a push this week to get confirmation hearings for national security posts onto Senate committees' schedule.\n Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement Friday that while hearings for key posts have since been scheduled, \"the American people deserve assurances that swift floor votes will follow.\"\n \"Progress towards confirmations still lags significantly behind where it was at this point during the last two presidential transitions, and\u00a0it is essential that key national security and economic leaders are confirmed and in place on day one. And the Senate held hearings throughout last year's impeachment proceedings.\"\n Experts said that with Biden facing immediate challenges combating the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, as well as facing national security threats following the January 6 riot at the Capitol, getting his agency heads in place quickly is crucial.\n \"There's never been a more important time to get confirmed nominees in place because we're dealing with an economic crisis, a health crisis and a political crisis,\" said David Marchick, the director of the non-profit Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.\n Anticipating a delay in confirmation votes, Biden's transition team is identifying officials across the government to serve as acting secretaries to oversee what he hopes is a seamless transition of power, people familiar with the matter said.\n David Norquist, the current deputy defense secretary, is being asked to run the Pentagon until Biden's new team is in place, the sources said. He will remain in place until the confirmation of Lloyd Austin, the retired general whose nomination requires a waiver from the House and Senate because he has not been away from the military for the required seven years.\n In the coming days, Biden aides say, other officials will be named in key agencies like the Department of Homeland Security, State Department and Justice Department.\n Biden has also moved more quickly than his predecessors in recent decades in filling White House roles and department positions that don't require Senate confirmation -- which means that many of his selections can begin their work on January 20, even if Cabinet nominees are delayed.\n \"We need to move quickly to get the right people in these agencies and to make sure that we're keeping this country safe and we're ready for whatever threats might come,\" Biden's incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain, said in a live interview with The Washington Post on Friday.\n CNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "President Donald Trump will leave office with the lowest approval rating of his presidency, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, with more Americans than ever in support of removing him from office.\n A majority, 54%, say Trump ought to be removed from office before January 20 because of his role in the events of January 6, when Trump incited a mob of his supporters to storm the US Capitol -- an unlikely prospect as Vice President Mike Pence has ruled out the use of the 25th Amendment to expel Trump from office and no Senate trial on the impeachment charge passed by the House is likely before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in this week.\n That is larger than the share who favored impeaching and removing Trump from office at any point in 2019 or early 2020 as the investigation which led to his first impeachment progressed to a Senate trial. But the wide partisan gap that drove views on that question throughout that process continues now. Nearly all Democrats (93%) favor removing Trump from office before January 20, while just 10% of Republicans feel the same.\n The survey was in the field as the House voted to impeach Trump for the second time, and there is no significant difference in support for Trump's removal before versus after the vote.\n Overall, 34% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling the presidency, down from 42% in a pre-election poll and one point below his previous low point in CNN's polling. Among his own partisans, Trump's approval rating has dropped 14 points since October but remains largely positive with 80% approving. It has held steady in the low single digits among Democrats (3% pre-election, 2% now).\n Just over a third of Americans (36%) call the January 6 attack on the US Capitol a crisis for American democracy, and another 39% call it a major problem. Views on the significance of the attack are split by party, with most Democrats calling it a crisis (54%), and few Republicans in agreement (20%).\n The public mostly rejects the baseless conspiracy theory behind the rioting -- that Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to become president: 65% say that he did legitimately win enough votes, but a sizable share (23%) -- and particularly among Republicans (58%) -- believe that conspiracy theory to be true and that there is solid evidence to support it. There is no evidence that the election was illegitimate, nor that there was widespread fraud in the vote count.\n The questions raised by the Trump campaign's legal team and echoed by GOP lawmakers and conservative media in the months since the election appear to have dented Republican confidence in the American election system generally. Fully 75% of Republicans say they have little confidence that US elections reflect the will of the people.\n Most Americans (55%) say Trump deserves a great deal of blame for the storming of the Capitol. Opinions are split by party, though, with 92% of Democrats placing a great deal of blame on Trump vs. 13% of Republicans. Likewise, the 4 in 10 who say that Republican lawmakers who objected to the results of the 2020 election deserve a great deal of blame is also divided by party (70% among Democrats, 14% among Republicans).\n There is greater agreement across party lines, however, that the rioters themselves bear significant responsibility for the storming of the US Capitol. Overall, 76% place a great deal of blame on their shoulders, including 88% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans. Far fewer (26%) lay significant blame at the feet of the Capitol Police force.\n Most say those who rioted at the Capitol have not been penalized enough (63%), and even there, a partisan gap holds. Among Democrats, 85% say the rioters have not faced sufficient punishment, while that drops to 38% among Republicans. Republicans are more likely than others to say they're not sure whether the rioters have faced enough punishment.\n Looking back over Trump's full time in office, 55% consider his term to be more of a failure than a success, while 41% call it successful. A larger number now say Trump's presidency changed the country (85%) than said so at any prior point in his time in office, but most (55%) say he has changed it for the worse, the first time a majority has said that. Among Democrats, 82% feel he changed it for the worse, while among Republicans, roughly a quarter agree (24%).\n Trump's final approval rating lags far behind his immediate predecessor's (Barack Obama left office with a 60% approval rating in 2017) and ranks among the worst since Gallup began tracking presidential approval regularly in the 1940s. Five of 12 presidents in that time have left office with approval ratings below 40%: Jimmy Carter and Trump each at 34%, Harry Truman at 32%, George W. Bush at 31%, and Richard Nixon at 24% just before resigning.\n The economy remains the high point for Trump in the eyes of the public: 53% say they approve of the way he handled the economy, the only issue tested for which he earns majority approval. The major crises of his final year in office -- the coronavirus outbreak and race relations -- earn sharply negative reviews. Just 34% approve of how he handled race relations, and 36% of the coronavirus. Approval is similarly low for the signature issue of Trump's 2016 campaign for the presidency, immigration. Just 36% approve of how he handled that.\n Trump's favorability rating -- a measure of views of him personally rather than of his work as president -- is among the lowest of his political career. Overall, 33% say they have a favorable opinion of Trump, 64% an unfavorable one. He's been viewed worse just twice since he declared his run for the presidency in June 2015, and both came before he was elected -- in September 2015 and March 2016.\n Other findings from the same survey suggest that as Trump's standing has dipped in the eyes of the public, Americans are ready for the Republican Party to shift away from Trump. The GOP's favorability rating has taken a steep hit since before the election, and around three-quarters of Americans say they want the GOP to move on from Trump rather than continue to treat him as their leader.\n Views of Pence hold steady overall, but despite the lack of movement in the topline number there has been a partisan shift in views of Pence. Among Republicans, his favorability rating has dipped 12 points compared with an early October survey, while it has climbed 14 points among Democrats over that same time.\n More have an unfavorable view of first lady Melania Trump now (47%) than at any point since CNN first asked about views of her in February 2016.\n The methodology and weighting for this poll has been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cellphones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for partisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls.\n The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

        "title": "Young leaders ask incoming Biden administration for a seat at the table",
        "body_text": "A cohort of youth-led organizations has asked the incoming Biden administration to create official positions aimed at engaging younger Americans.\n The groups have drafted a memo asking the Biden administration to build an \"Office of Young Americans\" within the Executive Office of the President. They have also asked the administration to appoint a \"Director of Youth Engagement\" -- who they say should be a member of Gen Z -- to sit on the Domestic Policy Council and engage with the National Security Council. Additionally, they requested that the administration engage young Americans across all administration agencies and devote a specific person in the Office of Presidential Personnel to hiring young Americans into government.\n \"We come together as a diverse array of organizations led by and serving youth to call on the Biden-Harris administration to represent and reflect young people across the Executive Branch,\" the groups write in the memo, shared first with CNN.\n The memo has so far been signed by more than a dozen youth-led organizations, including civic engagement organization 18by Vote, education organization Student Voice, gun violence prevention organization March For Our Lives, immigrant rights organization United We Dream and Future Coalition, a national network of youth organizers.\n Those involved in writing the memo say young people have the unique experience of dealing with multiple crises at once -- Covid-19, economic downturn, racial injustice, climate change and now the insurrection at the US Capitol and the domestic terrorist threats that have followed -- and can help play a key role in Biden's mission to \"build back better,\" the President-elect's effort to create jobs and rebuild the economy.\n \"I am 23 years old and have lived through more unprecedented historical events than I can count. From 9/11, to extreme weather events, living in a continual state of economic recession, losing family members to a global pandemic, or seeing the United States Capitol ransacked by right-wing domestic terrorists. In all of these things, the first-hand experience of young people is invaluable. There's no way to fully understand that unless you have lived that,\" Jazmin Kay, executive director of 18by Vote and one of the authors of the memo, told CNN.\n \"Our brains are wired to be curious right now and to want to think of solutions,\" Kay added.\n The memo was sent to the Biden transition team and will be sent to the incoming administration.\n For its part, the Biden transition team has involved young voices in its discussion.\n The transition team held weekly youth stakeholder meetings and listening sessions on topics including student debt, racial justice, mental health, foster youth, hunger and homelessness, gun violence prevention and democracy reform, Cameron French, a Biden transition spokesperson, told CNN. The conversations were led by Hannah Bristol, a member of the Biden transition team, whose primary role was to engage young people. Bristol had previously organized Young Americans for Biden, the youth-focused arm of the Biden campaign.\n The transition team also brought organizations such as Student Voice into deeper policy discussions and planning through conversation with the Department of Education's Agency Review Team, French added.\n \"Over 80 million Americans, including many under the age of 25, supported President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris' vision to get the pandemic under control and build our economy to work for all. Young people will play a critical role in helping our nation tackle some of our toughest challenges from climate change to immigration, gun violence prevention to racial justice,\" French said. \"The incoming Biden-Harris administration will continue to put an emphasis on creating opportunities for young people to shape, guide and participate in the government-wide effort to build back better.\"\n According to a number of young leaders who have signed onto the memo and were part of the youth stakeholder calls, the conversations gave young people across the country a look into the decisions the Biden transition team was making when it came to Cabinet nominees and priorities.\n And yet -- while these young leaders are appreciative that Biden's team has so far been willing to engage and hear their concerns -- they say there is still more work to be done to ensure solutions moving forward.\n Merrit Jones, who at 23 years old is the oldest member of the Student Voice team and one of the authors of the memo, said that Student Voice was fortunate to have adult allies on the Education Agency Review Team and that without them, it would have been really hard to engage in meaningful conversation with the transition team.\n \"That made it easier to navigate [the process], but even then it was difficult,\" Jones said, noting the need for students to have formal roles in the Biden administration.\n While young people recognize the historic diversity of Biden's Cabinet picks, they say the incoming administration could make a commitment to hiring people under the age of 25.\n \"It's important to fill roles within the administration with young staffers who reflect the diverse population of young people in the US and who have a deep knowledge and lived experience of the issues and youth organizing work,\" Jones added.\n While drafting the memo, the groups were advised by a number of former Obama administration officials, including Bo Machayo, who worked in the Office of Public Engagement for the White House council on environmental quality under the Obama administration when he was 24 years old.\n \"Having served in the [Obama] administration, I realize the importance of young Americans being involved in policy making decisions and engagement opportunities,\" Machayo, now 29, told CNN.\n \"I think this proposal and memo really makes a lot of sense. There's a lot of great diversity in this coalition, and this memo will help drive administration priorities with a particular eye to young Americans,\" Machayo said.\n \"The more we have young Americans involved in government, the more it starts working for the next generation of Americans,\" he added.",

        "body_text": "We've all heard of state flowers and state birds, but Massachusetts is stepping it up by proposing a state dinosaur.\n There's already a state fossil (surprisingly enough, dinosaur tracks), but now state Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis has announced plans to propose a bill aimed at adopting a state dinosaur.\n He told CNN he has high hopes that the initiative will help kids in Massachusetts learn more about science and prehistory in their area, along with the legislative process.\n \"I was unprepared for the excitement that this project would generate,\" said Lewis, adding that tens of thousands of people have already voted in a poll to choose the dinosaur.\n \"My hope continues to be that this project will help young people better understand the prehistoric world and career opportunities that might grow out of a childhood interest or a love of science.\"\n Massachusetts is far from the first state to adopt an official dinosaur. More than a dozen others and the District of Colombia already have prehistoric pals to represent them.\n The number changes a bit depending on how the dinos are counted -- nine states and DC have official state dinosaurs (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming), while six have state fossils that happen to be dinosaurs (Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah and Oklahoma).\n States have long had a tradition of naming official state fossils. In 1981, New Mexico became the first to name a bona fide dinosaur (the Coelophysis). A decade later, New Jersey went all in and coined the term \"state dinosaur\" by adopting the Hadrosaurus foulkii as one of their official symbols.\n According to New Jersey officials, Victorian fossil hobbyist William Parker Foulke hired a crew in 1858 to dig up a clay pit in Haddonfield because he had heard a rumor that giant bones were buried there. Eventually, they found the bones of a duckbilled dinosaur. Dubbed \"Haddy,\" it was later nominated to become an official New Jersey state symbol by an elementary school class in 1991.\n Before Massachusetts citizens can adopt a dinosaur of their own, they are being asked to decide in a poll which of their state's \"oldest constituents\" to designate: Podokesaurus holyokensis or Anchisaurus polyzelus.\n \"Learning real facts about ancient dinosaurs requires our best scientific skill and equipment. Fortunately Massachusetts is well-versed in this regard, especially in the biological sciences,\" Mark McMenamin, a professor of geology at Mount Holyoke College, told CNN in an email.\n \"Dinosaurs already serve as a gateway to science for many young people,\" added McMenamin, who is one of the paleontologists working on the project to adopt a state dinosaur. \"As we move forward with naming a state dinosaur, kids will learn the names of dinosaurs that lived here in Massachusetts. This emphasizes the fact that dinosaur bones and tracks exist right under our feet.\"\n The first fossil of Podokesaurus holyokensis, a fast-moving, carnivorous dinosaur, was discovered in Mount Holyoke in 1910. It has the distinction of being the first dinosaur to be named and described by a female scientist, American paleontologist Mignon Talbot.\n Anchisaurus polyzelus was an herbivore. Its bones were first discovered in 1855 in Springfield, Massachusetts, but because these dinosaurs were so small (only 60 to 75 pounds) their bones were initially mistaken for human remains.\n \"While they aren't the largest dinosaurs to roam the planet, they begin to tell the story of how dinosaurs came to rule the Earth,\" says the state dinosaur poll, which is open to Massachusetts residents and those with close connections to the Commonwealth. So far, it has received more than 20,000 votes.\n \"Ultimately, if this exploration of a 'state dinosaur' helps even one person make contact with their local elected officials, and if that contact is helpful down the road, this would have been all worth it,\" Lewis told CNN.\n \"And, in case anyone ever doubted it, dinosaurs are still pretty cool.\"",

After 24 hours as a hostage, he told the gunmen he was unwell, and was released, leaving to provide crucial information to authorities about the embassy layout, the number of gunmen and hostages.\n It was an experience that he later realized had traumatized him in ways he didn't comprehend at the time, and, as his career as a news boss took off, he remembered the impacts, long before PTSD became a well-known term for soldiers and others.\n In January 2004 I was in a two-car CNN convoy ambushed by insurgents just south of Baghdad.  One of our two drivers and my translator were killed, and my photographer sitting next to me survived being shot in the head.  We all nearly died that day.\n It was Cramer, then Executive Vice President and Managing Director of CNN International, who knew exactly what those of us who survived were going through and acted accordingly.\n He had by then established a system within the company where staff could access professional help if needed after a traumatic incident, but, crucially, on that day, understood on a personal level our need to stay in Iraq together as a team for another week to process the experience, and attend funerals, rather than immediately leave to our respective scattered homes.\n \"Among his many accomplishments, Chris was a pioneer and innovator in field safety, as the world became more dangerous for journalists,\" said Cramer's successor with CNN International Tony Maddox, who carried on and expanded what Cramer had started.\n \"He led the development of guidelines and practices now widely adopted across the industry.\"\n I, for one, will always remember -- and be grateful for -- Cramer's empathy for those who'd seen and experienced dreadful things. He knew from experience what it was like. I was in Iraq 17 times during the war, and also covered conflicts -- from Afghanistan to Libya to Gaza and the West Bank -- and I always felt Chris had our backs with the best possible security and support, both tangible and emotional.\n Before joining CNN in April 1996, Cramer spent 25 years at the BBC. He was Head of Newsgathering and sat on the BBC's News and Current Affairs Management Board, and was highly regarded by those with whom he worked.\n He was also President and Founding Member of the International News Safety Institute (INSI) -- a global organization dedicated to journalists' safety.\n As news of Cramer's passing spread, those who worked with him began to recount their memories of the man, and his impact on their careers.\n Octavia Nasr was CNN's Senior Editor of Middle East Affairs, a position Cramer created after the 9/11 attacks. \"Chris was an amazing boss,\" she recalled.\n \"I will never forget lessons I learned from him in being direct and fighting for one's rights -- he supported women in senior and executive positions and helped us succeed. I owe him gratitude and respect and I will sorely miss his journalistic ethics and sense of humor.\"\n Chris could be many things -- sometimes on the same day or within the same meeting. Tough, blunt and uncompromising, but also charming and wickedly funny. And, above all, he cared deeply about journalists and good journalism.\n He was certainly one of a kind and he will be sorely missed.",

        "body_text": "Allies and associates of President Donald Trump have collected tens of thousands of dollars in fees from those seeking pardons from the President, The New York Times reported Sunday.\n The Times, citing documents and interviews with more than three dozen lobbyists and lawyers, reported that the lobbying for clemency intensified as it became apparent Trump had no standing to challenge his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden. Those who monetized the lobbying efforts include a former federal prosecutor, a former personal lawyer to the President and a former top Trump campaign adviser, among others, the Times reported.\n As CNN previously reported, Trump has been expected to issue a flurry of pardons in the final days of his presidency and close business associates of the President and many high-profile criminals have ramped up efforts to secure a pardon before he leaves office.\n As of late December, Trump was considering pardons for more than two dozen people in his orbit whom he believes were targeted -- or could be targeted in the future -- for political ends. That's in addition to hundreds of requests from others who have approached the White House directly, and tens of thousands more whose petitions are pending at the Justice Department.\n According to the Times, former US attorney Brett Tolman has collected tens of thousands of dollars in recent weeks to seek clemency for several people. Tolman did not respond to the New York Times' request for comment. CNN has also reached out to Tolman for comment.\n Former Trump attorney John Dowd has also accepted \"tens of thousands of dollars from a wealthy felon and advising him and other potential clients to leverage Mr. Trump's grievances about the justice system,\" according to the Times. Dowd declined to answer questions to the Times and declined to comment on the report when reached by CNN Sunday.\n And a former Trump campaign top adviser was paid $50,000 to secure a pardon for John Kiriakou, a former CIA intelligence officer who was convicted of illegally disclosing classified information in 2012, and agreed to a $50,000 bonus if the president granted it, according to a copy of an agreement obtained by the newspaper.\n Kiriakou said, according to the Times, that an associate of Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani claimed the former mayor of New York could help with a pardon request for $2 million. Giuliani rejected those claims to the Times. CNN has reached out to Giuliani for comment Sunday.\n The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment Sunday and declined to comment to the Times.\n The Times noted that \"there is nothing illegal about Trump associates being paid to lobby for clemency\" and that any explicit offers of payment to the President could be investigated for possible violations of bribery laws. There is no evidence, however, that Trump was offered money in exchange for a pardon, according to the newspaper.\n Following Trump's reelection loss, calls and emails flooded into the West Wing from people looking to benefit. At one point, his staff was so inundated with requests for pardons or commutations that a spreadsheet had been created to keep track of the requests directed to Trump's close aides.\n Trump has also discussed issuing pardons for himself and his children with new urgency since the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. However aides and allies are concerned over the public perception of such a pardon following the violent insurrection, which led to the deaths of five people.\n So far, the President has pardoned and commuted sentences of several people in his circle, including longtime friend Roger Stone, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former 2016 campaign aide George Papadopoulos.\n CNN's Jamie Gangel, Pamela Brown, Kara Scannell and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "In his sermon before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the Rev. Raphael Warnock called for equity and inclusivity at a time when Americans may feel like \"we're living in exile.\"\n Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached, said Sunday the country is experiencing a difficult time and he hoped God's words may give people courage to stand up for justice and righteousness. Warnock is set to become Georgia's first Black US senator after winning a close runoff election earlier this month.\n \"This time in which we feel like we are living in exile, a land made strange by a pandemic the likes of which no one living has ever seen. A land made strange by an economic turn down. A land made strange by a kind of political speech and rhetoric that continues to reach new lows. A land made strange when we witnessed the unthinkable as the very house of the people was attacked by those who are driven by the worst impulses, stirred up by demagogues,\" Warnock said in reference to the January 6 deadly riot at the US Capitol.\n \"This strange time of exile, this strange time of spiritual exhaustion, this strange time in which the soul of our nation hangs in the balance,\" he added.\n The church's services were delivered without an in-person audience and posted online because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Warnock focused his sermon on the book of Isaiah, which centers on the Babylonian exile. He specifically cited chapter 40, in which the prophet proclaims comfort to those who were exiled.\n He quoted a verse, saying \"Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill brought low; the crooked places shall be made straight and the rough places smooth; the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\"\n He went on to say, \"In God's vision for the land, not only is there equity, not only is there integrity, not only is there possibility in God's vision for the land, there is inclusivity. In God's economy, there's a place for everybody -- red, yellow, Brown, Black and White.\"\n Warnock explained that poor Black and Brown people are often \"crushed in the machinery of systems that don't care about them.\"\n He said Eric Garner, a Black 43-year-old who died after being put in a police chokehold in 2014 after allegedly selling loose cigarettes illegally on Staten Island, and George Floyd, a 43-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, were treated unfairly.\n \"Meanwhile, Wall Street bankers destroyed billions of dollars of household wealth through mortgage fraud, and almost sent the entire American economy over the cliff,\" Warnock said. \"George Floyd died, Eric Garner died and not one banker went to jail. Crooked places.\"\n Warnock's Sunday sermon comes two days after an Atlanta synagogue said it was the target of a cyberattack during its annual MLK Shabbat service in which the US Senator-elect was participating.\n \"Presumably, The Temple was singled out by a racist and anti-Semitic group or individual bent on silencing our joint Temple-Ebenezer Baptist Church MLK Jr. Shabbat,\" Kent Alexander, president of The Temple, wrote in a letter sent Saturday to the congregation.",

        "title": "Why Trump is still a problem for the GOP establishment",
        "body_text": "Our first CNN/SSRS poll since the insurrection of the Capitol contains mostly bad news for Republican President Donald Trump.\n His approval rating (34%) is the lowest CNN's ever recorded, and most Americans want Trump removed from office immediately.\n But a look underneath the hood finds that Trump's influence on the political scene is likely far from over. Many Republicans still like him, and he could be a figure to be reckoned with heading into 2022 and, yes, 2024.\n Let's start with the basic fact that Trump's approval rating among Republicans in our poll stands at 80%. Other polls taken since the events of January 6 have similar ratings for Trump among Republicans, if perhaps a touch lower into the high 70s on average.\n That 80% rating is certainly down from 94% before the election, but it's still a very large percentage. It's certainly a higher approval rating among his own party than the other presidents (Harry Truman, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush) who left office with an approval rating below 40% overall.\n To give you some perspective, presidents who have approval ratings above 75% amongst the base have never faced a credible primary threat. In fact, every president who ran for another term with an approval rating above 60% within his own party won his party's nomination.\n A question in our poll that tries to get at Trump's baseline support within the GOP reveals that there are a lot who don't want to move on from him.\n A large chunk (47%) say the party should continue to treat Trump as the leader of the GOP. That falls to 43% when you include Republican leaning independents, but, again, it's a substantial portion. Just 19% of Americans, overall, want the party to continue to treat Trump as its leader.\n Other recent polling points out that Republicans who go against Trump might not be able to escape his wrath in a 2022 or 2024 primary.\n A quite high 57% of Republicans said in Ipsos KnowledgePanel poll that they agreed Trump should be the 2024 nominee. This included 37% who strongly agreed.\n In other 2024 polling, Trump has continuously led the pack of named challengers. It does seem his support may have fallen off since the insurrection, but not tremendously. He's still well out ahead with backing generally matching his 2016 primary performance of 45%.\n Put another way, his position in very early hypothetical 2024 polling is at this point far better than other presidents after they lost their bid for another term (Gerald Ford for 1980, Jimmy Carter for 1984 and George H.W. Bush for 1996).\n The polling, in this case, matches the reality you saw in the congressional vote to accept or reject the electoral votes from Pennsylvania, after the insurrection. A majority of Republican members of Congress chose to sustain the objection to those votes, despite no evidence that there was fraud that could have tipped the balance of the election in either Pennsylvania or any other state.\n Indeed, the polling on the insurrection just gives you an understanding of how different the Republican base and the general electorate sees things right now.\n While 65% of Americans place a great deal or moderate amount of blame on Trump \"for the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6\", only 23% of Republicans do in our CNN poll. The vast majority of Republicans (76%) said little (20%) to no (56%) blame lies at the President's feet.\n The clear majority of Republicans (75%) say President-elect Joe Biden did not win enough votes to legitimately win the election, despite no evidence to make such a claim. Most Americans (65%) believe he did win legitimately.\n And even as a majority of GOP members of Congress voted with no evidence to sustain the objection to Pennsylvania's electoral votes, 51% of Republicans said in an ABC News/Washington Post poll that party leaders didn't go far enough in supporting Trump's bid to overthrow the election. Most Americans (52%) thought they went too far.\n Therefore, it's not surprising that, even as the majority of Americans (54%) in the CNN poll want Trump removed from office, a mere 10% of Republicans do. Other polling shows similarly.\n The bottom line is that most Americans are ready to move on from Trump, but a lot of Republicans aren't.\n That could cause the party plenty of heartache. Under Trump, the party lost the House, Senate and the presidency. The party's favorability rating has dropped over the past few months.\n This puts the GOP party leaders in a bind. We already saw that low Republican turnout in the Georgia runoffs in areas most friendly to Trump cost Republicans. Functioning political parties cannot just ignore their base, even if what their base wants is in contrast to what the larger electorate does.\n What Republicans need to hope is the party can unite, as most opposition parties do, around a common goal of defeating the majority party. You could see that working well in general elections.\n Of course, that may not help out congressional Republicans who have defied Trump in a primary.",

Shortly afterward, they announced the tragic loss.\n \"We are heartbroken to announce that Nasha's calf died shortly after our birth announcement earlier today after the calf was accidentally stepped on by her mother,\" the zoo wrote.\n \"Our animal care team quickly intervened but were unsuccessful at saving the calf,\" the zoo wrote. \"An initial necropsy showed trauma to the neck but further testing will follow to determine if there were any underlying causes for the newborn's death. Thank you all for your support over the past few weeks and especially during this tough time.\"\n \"We are devastated over the loss of Nasha's calf,\" said Dr. Heather Schwartz, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine. \"Our staff has worked tirelessly to make sure this calf was given the best possible care. We moved from fear of a stillborn to joy of revival to anguish.\"\n Birth complications had led the zoo to take down the live feed during the birthing process as thousands tuned in, the zoo said.\n \"SURPRISE! Nasha's calf has arrived, just in a different way than we expected! There were some complications with labor and our team stepped in to assist with the birth. Both mom & baby seem to be doing fine...\" the zoo tweeted at the time.\n Schwartz said the calf appeared to be thriving, and they decided to move the newborn to be with her mother. The two were bonding, but during this time Nasha may have inadvertently injured her calf, Schwartz said.\n Masai giraffes are endangered due to their population declining by about 50% in the last three decades, according to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation.\n Nasha is doing well and keepers will be giving her an abundance of comfort and care for the next few days, according to the zoo.",

It makes illegal the statements of individuals that clearly encourage, cajole, and otherwise, you know, get people motivated to commit violence,\" he added.\n The DC attorney general enforces local codes for the city. He does not have as robust criminal jurisdiction as the US Department of Justice, which handles prosecuting both federal crimes and the major crimes committed in Washington, DC. Federal prosecutors are leading the effort to investigate and prosecute crimes related to the violent riot on January 6 that left five dead.\n \"The federal charge carries far more jail time,\" Racine said, adding that his office is \"collaborating at a high level with the federal prosecutors.\"\n \"(Trump's) conduct prior to the mob storming the Capitol is relevant. I think his conduct during that time and immediately thereafter is also relevant,\" the attorney general said.\n Of the insurrectionists who attacked the Capitol, Racine said \"every single person\" at the Trump rally that day is \"being reviewed\" in what he called a \"thorough investigation\" of the Capitol insurrection.\n The investigation will include \"talking to people who were at that rally\" as well as people who stormed the Capitol and \"went inside,\" he said.\n Racine also said during his interview that his office \"will be judicious with whether to charge and who to charge,\" but noted, \"it's all about the words that are utilized ... it's all about the dynamics and the environment and frankly the energy.\"\n He said his office has jurisdiction to pursue offenses including weapons, ammunition, curfew violations and inciting violence.\n In a Friday news conference, FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director-in-Charge Steven D'Antuono explained the FBI's approach to all tips regarding insurrectionists. \"Your tips are helping us investigate people on a variety of federal charges,\" he said, providing information on how to submit tips.\n In a direct statement to insurrectionists who have yet to be identified, D'Antuono continued: \"To those of you who took part in the violence, here's something you should know. Every FBI field office in the country is looking for you. As a matter of fact, even your friends and family are tipping us off. So you might want to consider turning yourself in instead of wondering when we're going to come knocking on your door, because we will.\"\n Though not a criminal case, Trump has already been impeached by the House for his role inciting the riot. The Senate will begin a trial soon that could result in a conviction that might also lead to Trump being barred from ever again holding a federal office.\n Federal prosecutors also said earlier this month that they are looking at everyone involved in the riot, including the role Trump played in inciting it.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

Since its inception, the company has helped more than 10,279 families throughout the UK, according to Anderson.\n \"We basically deliver a lifeline to anybody who is elderly disabled and vulnerable of any age,\" said Anderson.\n With the elderly population being one of the most vulnerable during the pandemic, DEPHER's work has been especially important to the community, said Anderson. The company even expanded donations to include PPE, a food bank, and paying electric and gas bills for those who could no longer afford it.\n \"I can never thank you enough James,\" wrote a customer in a post to social media. \"You kept me out of [the] hospital and saved my life.\"\n A large portion of the company's operations are funded through Go Fund Me donations from the community.

But for now, he says there are three things we need to focus on during and after the pandemic.\n \"Community, family, and love. That's what we need now, \" said Anderson. \"We need them things now all over the world and people need to do it.\"",

        "body_text": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will officially resign Monday from her US Senate seat, ending her four-year Senate career, according to a Harris aide. The move comes two days before she's inaugurated on Wednesday, making history as the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president.\n Aides say Harris has already started the process of her resignation, having notified California Gov. Gavin Newsom of her intent and sent her formal indications that she'll be resigning Monday. Harris will not give a farewell speech on the Senate floor, due to the schedule.\n Harris won her seat in November 2016 and was sworn in January 2017. At the time, Harris was California's attorney general.\n Newsom has already named Alex Padilla, California's secretary of state, to fill Harris' seat. In a press call, he told reporters he would likely be sworn in himself on Wednesday.\n The incoming vice president has spoken to Padilla before he comes into office, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.\n Harris made history throughout her career, becoming the first Black woman in California to serve as a senator.\n In her November victory speech, she recognized the hard battle women faced to exercise their civic rights and break into the upper echelon of American politics, nodding to the women who came before her like former Rep. Shirley Chisholm and the young girls who will come after her.\n \"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\" Harris said. \"Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\"\n Now, Harris will preside over the same chamber that she is stepping down from, becoming president of the Senate.\n With the double Democratic victories in two Georgia Senate runoffs and a highly polarized Congress, Harris will have the power to push any legislation, judicial appointments and Cabinet nominations languishing on party lines over the threshold and take credit for helping pass the administration's priorities. As president of the Senate, she will cast the tie-breaking vote.\n But Harris aides say they hope Harris won't have to break many ties.\n \"We believe that the issues that the Congress will have to take up are bipartisan issues that are of importance to the American people,\" one aide said.\n President-elect Joe Biden rolled out his first legislative priority this week, announcing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that included direct payments to Americans. Biden has emphasized he wants it to be the first issue Congress takes up after he is inaugurated on January 20.\n In a press call with reporters announcing the resignation, Harris aides pointed to the first time she worked on Capitol Hill in 1984. She interned for California Sen. Alan Cranston during her sophomore year of college at Howard University, a historically Black university.\n \"I loved going to work\u2014it felt like the epicenter of change, even as an intern sorting mail,\" Harris wrote in a tweet from her Senate account in January of last year. \"I now work in the exact Senate office where I once interned.\"\n Aides on the call outlined what they viewed as Harris' legislative victories, including the introduction of her Maternal CARE Act, the first bill in the Senate to specifically address racial disparities in maternal mortality, according a fact sheet, as well as several bipartisan efforts like the anti-lynching act cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, along with her election security bill with Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma.\n On Wednesday, Harris will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, according to a Harris aide. The vice president-elect will take her oath of office using two Bibles; one that previously belong to a former neighbor and family friend of Harris, Regina Shelton, and another that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court, the aide said.\n When asked about who she will be thinking of, Harris has repeatedly said her late mother Shyamala Gopalan.\n \"I will be thinking about my mother, who is looking down from heaven,\" Harris told NPR this month.\n CNN's Dan Merica and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The Senate gets to call the shots for Trump's impeachment trial ",
        "body_text": "When the US Senate moves forward with an impeachment trial of soon-to-be former President Donald Trump, senators would have full control over how they run it, based on history and Supreme Court precedent.\n Trump, who desperately fought his first impeachment proceedings and has remained defiant through his second, could not appeal the Senate's action.\n The Supreme Court affirmed in a 1993 case that impeachment is the domain of the two chambers of Congress, with the US House having the right to accuse and the Senate the \"sole\" power to try the accusation.\n Then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that the Constitution leaves no room for judges to intervene in Congress' business. To rule otherwise, Rehnquist said, would conflict with the framers' intentions and expose the country to \"months, or perhaps years, of chaos.\"\n Still, an array of questions has emerged since the US House of Representatives on January 13 impeached Trump, opening the door to a Senate trial, for inciting the violent resurrection at the Capitol on January 6.\n Practical considerations hover along with substantive issues. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet set a date for delivery of the articles of impeachment to the Senate, and senators would be organizing a trial just as they take up the agenda of new President Joe Biden.\n No president has been tried after leaving office. In earlier centuries, however, two other officials were impeached and subjected to some Senate action after they resigned. Among the basic questions spurred by a groundbreaking trial for an ex-president is whether the Chief Justice John Roberts would preside, as he did at Trump's first impeachment trial one year ago.\n Many legal scholars believe a former president can be subject to trial, and even some who differ, recognize that the 1993 precedent, in which Mississippi federal judge Walter Nixon unsuccessfully challenged Senate trial procedures in his impeachment case, case could thwart a Trump appeal to federal courts.\n Yale University law professor Akhil Reed Amar said constitutional history and precedent allow the Senate to try former officials, including the President.\n \"It would be absurd if you could escape by resigning one step ahead of the gavel,\" said Amar, author of \"America's Unwritten Constitution.\"\n In 1876, the Senate tried William Belknap, who was war secretary in the administration of Ulysses S. Grant. Belknap resigned just as the US House was voting to impeach him.\n He was charged with \"criminally disregarding his duty as Secretary of War and basely prostituting his high office to his lust for private gain.\"\n The Senate determined that the former secretary could still be tried. After a lengthy Senate trial with dozens of witnesses, Belknap was acquitted.\n University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman, author of \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump,\" said the Constitution provides for removal, as well as \"disqualification\" from holding office, because the framers were concerned about future dangerous conduct.\n \"The framers were worried, principally, about getting a president out of office,\" Bowman said, \"but they were also worried about the rise of a demagogue.\"\n Bowman and Amar say the Walter Nixon case, along with the text and structure of the Constitution, would prevent Trump from drawing federal judges into an impeachment dispute.\n Ross Garber, who teaches at Tulane Law School, asserts that the Senate may try only a sitting president but nonetheless agrees it would be difficult for Trump to find a court that would hear his appeal.\n \"I think the reasoning of Nixon (case) could be a problem for any Trump litigation effort,\" he said, adding that \"it is very unlikely the Supreme Court would stop the Senate in its tracks in a direct Trump challenge to its jurisdiction.\"\n Garber added: \"Strategically, Trump is likely better off not litigating but instead appealing directly to the senators.\"\n The Constitution dictates that \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n The process for impeaching a federal judge is the same as impeaching a president. Judge Nixon was impeached and convicted in 1989, after an earlier criminal conviction for lying to a grand jury about his efforts on behalf of a defendant whose father had given his money. Federal judges are appointed for life, and impeachment is the only way to remove them from their post and judicial salary.\n After his Senate conviction, Nixon's lawyers challenged in federal courts the Senate's use of a committee to take evidence, saying that violated the full Senate's constitutional responsibility to \"try all impeachments.\"\n The Supreme Court unanimously rejected Nixon's claim. Chief Justice Rehnquist was among seven of the nine judges who found that the case presented a \"political\" question beyond review by judges.\n In his opinion for the high court, Rehnquist explored the 18th Century constitutional debates over where the impeachment power should reside. \"According to Alexander Hamilton,\" Rehnquist wrote in Nixon v. United States, \"The Senate was the 'most fit depositary of this important trust' because its Members are representatives of the people.\"\n Justice David Souter, who agreed that the case presented a \"political question,\" wrote separately to suggest an exception for maneuvers that threatened the integrity of the result, \"say, upon a coin toss.\" But no other justice joined his concurring opinion.\n Nearly six years later, Rehnquist presided over the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, just as Chief Justice Roberts did for Trump's first trial in 2020. The Constitution states, \"When the President of the United States is impeached, the Chief Justice shall preside,\" rather than any senator or the vice president, who under the Constitution serves as the Senate president.\n But if the trial is of an ex-president, the question of who presides is an open one.\n Amar is among those who believe Chief Justice Roberts would not take the chair high on the Senate dais this time.\n He said the framers' rationale for requiring the chief justice to preside in trials of a president stems from the natural conflict of interest of a presiding vice president. If the Senate convicted and removed the President from office, the vice president would succeed him.\n The framers believed the chief justice should preside, Amar said, \"precisely because the vice president is next in line.\"\n But Bowman said even after a president has left office, a chief justice could still oversee a Senate trial.\n \"Any prudent organizer of the trial would insist that the chief preside,\" he said, adding that the presence of the chief justice of the United State would lend \"legitimacy\" to the proceeding. \"Now, he will have his own views on the matter. But the best read (of the Constitution), and the most prudent read, is that he would preside.\"\n Asked what Chief Justice Roberts thought, a spokeswoman said he had no comment.",

        "body_text": "Dean Obeidallah, (@DeanObeidallah) a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show\" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nPresident Donald Trump's lie that he was cheated of a victory in the November election, which he peddled on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, was a driving factor in spreading misinformation on this issue. How do we know? Research released Friday found that online discussions about election fraud plunged a whopping 73% since Twitter and other social media companies banned Trump and his key allies on January 8.\n The study was conducted by Zignal Labs, a San Francisco-based analytics firm, between the day after Trump was banned from Twitter through this past Friday. Zignal's research confirmed the view of many experts that Trump and his allies had created via social media what the Washington Post calls \"a powerful, integrated disinformation ecosystem\" that was central to pushing millions of Americans to reject the election results.\n Zignal found that online conversations about election fraud dropped from 2.5 million mentions to 688,000 mentions across several social media sites in the week after Twitter banned Trump. And since Trump and some of his supporters were blocked on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media platforms, the use of hashtags such as #FightforTrump and terms like \"March for Trump\" had fallen a remarkable 95%.\n What if the social media platforms had banned Trump from its platforms after he first began spewing lies about election fraud in early November? Would that have impacted views on 2020 election integrity and the results? If people had not been fed Trump's election lies for two months, would the January 6 attack on our Capitol by Trump supporters seeking to \"Stop the Steal\" still have taken place?\n There's no disputing that Trump's primary means of peddling lies about the election was social media. Trump ramped up his campaign of election misinformation within hours after the polls closed on Election Day by amplifying claims that votes for Joe Biden showed an unexplained jump. Over the next two days, Twitter had labeled 38% of Trump's tweets about the electoral process as misleading.\n Trump's efforts to undermine the election then went into overdrive. In the 24 days post-Election Day, as Variety documented, Twitter had labeled 200 of Trump's tweets as including \"disputed\" or false information about the election. At the time, Trump was peddling false claims that the election was \"100% rigged\" and that \"There is NO WAY Biden got 80,000,000 votes!!!\"\n In the midst of Trump's misinformation campaign a Monmouth poll released in mid-November noted that nearly 70% of Republicans said Biden had only won the election due to \"voter fraud.\" A Reuters/Ipsos poll found 52% of Republicans saying Trump had \"rightfully won.\"\n Trump continued non-stop to employ social media to undermine our democracy as well as call for his supporters to attend his January 6 rally. For example, on December 19 Trump tweeted, \"Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" then added, \"Be there, will be wild!\"\n From there we all saw what happened as Trump supporters laid siege to our Capitol to stop Congress' certification of Biden's electoral victory. As one protester was heard saying during a livestream while in the Capitol during the attack, \"Our president wants us here. ... We wait and take orders from our president.\"\n Obviously, there's no way to know with certainty if events would have unfolded differently if social media had not waited until after the deadly Capitol siege to ban Trump. But it appears a substantial number of Americans lay the blame for this incident at the feet of social media. A new NBC poll released Sunday morning found that 38% percent of Americans say social media is \"solely\" or \"mainly\" responsible for the \"rioters overtaking the U.S. Capitol.\" Another 41% responded social media is at least \"somewhat\" responsible for the attack -- with only 19% absolving these platforms of any responsibility. (In contrast, 52% of American say Trump is \"solely\" or \"mainly\" responsible for the attack while 29% responded he's not to blame.)\n As a passionate advocate of freedom of speech who believes that the best way to counter speech you don't like is with more speech, I fully defend the free exchange of ideas. But it's abundantly clear that social media companies need to act far more swiftly in the future when people -- especially public figures with immense followings -- use their platforms to spread dangerous misinformation. If not, we may see even more deadly attacks by those radicalized by the lies of morally bankrupt social media users.",

        "title": "Gab: Everything you need to know about the fast-growing, controversial social network",
        "body_text": "Gab, an alternative social media network popular with conservatives, the alt-right and some extremists, is surging in popularity after conservative social network Parler was effectively taken off the internet in the wake of the January 6 Capitol siege.\n On Thursday, Gab tweeted that it gained 2.3 million new users over the past week. During that time period, people visited Gab 55 million times, viewing 100 million pages on the social network, Gab said.\n The platform has been criticized for hosting hate-filled, violent speech, for which it has been -- like Parler -- ostracized from most Big Tech companies that serve as front doors to the internet. Because of that, Gab has had some difficulty keeping its platform working smoothly during the recent influx of traffic.\n Parler appears to be close to returning online, after being kicked off Amazon Web Services on January 10. The website on Sunday evening featured a message from Parler's CEO, John Matze, in which he stated, \"We will resolve any challenge before us and plan to welcome all of you back soon. We will not let civil discourse perish!\"\n Gab, founded in 2016, coins itself as the \"free speech social network\" with a mission to \"defend, protect and preserve free speech online for all people,\" according to its website description.\n The platform looks like a mix of Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB) and users can post what it bills as \"gabs\" of no more than 300 characters. But, unlike those mainstream social media networks, Gab features virtually no moderation of the content users post.\n Gab also has a pro-subscription tier, a merchandise shop and its own web browser extension \"Dissenter\" that creates it owns commenting system.\n \"We believe that the future of online publishing is decentralized and open,\" the platform's site reads. \"We believe that users of social networks should be able to control their social media experience on their own terms, rather than the terms set down by Big Tech.\"\n As of April 2020, Gab reported 1,157,000 cumulative registered accounts and 3.7 million monthly visitors globally, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commissions annual report.\n Gab's lax approach on content has made way for a slew of QAnon conspiracy theories, misinformation and anti-Semitic commentary on the platform, among lots of vile hatred and racist posts -- much of wouldn't be allowed on today's well-known social apps (although mainstream social networks have their own problems moderating extremism as well).\n One exception: Gab blocks posts that involve \"illegal activity, threats of violence, doxxing, pornography, child exploitation and spam,\" which, Gab claims, it takes action to \"prevent and remove.\"\n The controversial messaging app is also home to some prominent conservative voices such as Richard Spencer and Alex Jones, some of who've been banned off more mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n After Twitter banned President Trump, White House officials were considering getting the president an account on Gab. That is, until Jared Kushner nixed that idea because of anti-Semitic speech on the network.\n Gab first drew public scrutiny in 2018 following the discovery that the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman used the network to threaten and target Jews. The suspect's profile featured the message: \"I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in,\" right before allegedly killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue.\n Gab noted in a statement in 2018, that it \"unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence.\" It also said it suspended the account and contacted the FBI.\n It was forced offline, following the shooting, after being banned by online payment processors, PayPal (PYPL) and Stripe along with domain registrar GoDaddy and website hosting service Joylent over hate speech violations.\n Despite attempts from Big Tech companies to shut the network down, Gab has managed to remain online. Its site is now under a different domain registrar, Epik, which welcomed the platform in 2018.\n Gab was founded by Andrew Torba, an entrepreneur Trump supporter, who describes himself as a \"conservative Republican Christian.\" Torba, who used to work in Silicon Valley, created the alternative network in response to reports that social platforms like Facebook were biased against conservatives.\n \"I didn't set out to build a 'conservative social network' by any means, but I felt that it was time for a conservative leader to step up and to provide a forum where anybody can come and speak freely without fear of censorship,\" Torba told the Washington Post in 2016.\n \"Every major communication outlet, every major social network, is run, owned, controlled and operated by progressive leaders, progressive workers in Silicon Valley,\" he told The Post.\n Gab is now facing a call from the Anti-Defamation League for a criminal investigation to determine whether the platform \"intentionally aided, conspired with or directed\" those who attacked the Capitol on January 6.\n The anti-hate group noted in an open letter on Wednesday there was at least one report that Gab users exchanged \"directions for which streets to take to avoid the police and which tools to bring to help pry open doors.\"\n The ADL also cited posts of Torba telling users \"heading to DC\" to \"record footage in landscape mode while filming\" and \"document as much as you can.\" It further cites Torba's post on the day of the attack, in which he says, \"in a system with rigged elections there are no longer any viable political solutions.\"\n In response, Gab called for an investigation into Facebook, where protests were organized. The company also said it put an \"immediate stop to a series of newly created accounts that were making threats of violence aimed at public officials.\"\n \"We worked diligently with law enforcement and spent several weeks warning our community about this behavior and taking swift action to remove it from our platform in the weeks prior to the January 6th protest,\" Torba said in a statement. \"Our moderation and legal teams work tirelessly to ensure public safety. Threats of violence and illegal activity have no place on Gab.\"\n Gab claims the ADL is targeting it because, unlike Parler, Gab remains up and running. In a statement to CNN, Torba said hate speech \"isn't real\" and is protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution.\n \"The ADL has NO POWER over Gab which is why they hate us,\" Torba said. \"We will never bend to their demands and we will never censor legal, 1A-protected speech that hurts the ADL's feelings. Ever. Jesus is King.\"",

        "title": "How Trump's most consequential policies have changed America",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump's presidency has largely been defined by his disregard for political norms and his historic two impeachments.\n Trump purposefully sought to upend conventional domestic and foreign policy, fundamentally altering America's role in the world. And he disrupted the status quo in Washington, recalibrating the federal government's role in everyday American life in ways both temporary and for a longer term effect.\n Some of Trump's most consequential decisions, such as his judicial appointments, will dictate the ideological make-up of the courts for decades. And the physical reminder of his immigration and border security policies, in the form of a US-Mexico border wall, will likely remain etched into America's landscape well past his presidency.\n Other actions, including many issued through the use of executive authority, can be undone through the regulatory process or with the flick of Joe Biden's pen once he's president. Still, those actions will have sometimes had a years long impact on American lives, affecting everything from their jobs to their schools to the kinds of lightbulbs they can buy.\n Here are some of the most significant ways Trump's policies and actions changed the country:\n The federal response to the coronavirus pandemic was the Trump administration's biggest focus during the President's final year in office -- and its biggest failure.\n Trump made apparent political calculations that put optics ahead of the health of Americans. He held large rallies in the final months of the election filled with throngs of unmasked crowds as the pandemic was hitting a new peak, he declined to wear a mask or social distance in front of cameras and he publicly downplayed the seriousness of the virus while privately knowing its deadliness.\n Early on, the White House and the President were heavy on talk, but took little immediate action. The federal government struggled to deliver personal protective equipment and medical supplies to US hospitals and nursing homes. Testing efforts were disorganized. And, though not an official policy, Trump and his allies blatantly disregarded the guidelines his administration touted -- such as wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding travel and avoiding large gatherings. It led to outbreaks among members of the administration (including Trump himself) and supporters.\n The US currently boasts more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country.\n The one victory was the quick development of two coronavirus vaccines that were authorized by December. But the rest of the handling on the pandemic was defined by major, and at times arguably fatal, missteps.\n There's no good, specific treatment for coronavirus infection and the US efforts to help speed development of new approaches was middle by an early emphasis on drugs that were proven to be completely useless, notably hydroxychloroquine.\n Prior to the pandemic, the opioid crisis was Trump's top public health focus. The President declared a public health emergency over the issue and signed Congressional legislation into law that increased funding for the epidemic.\n However, the efforts have had mixed results.\n Drug overdose deaths fell slightly in 2018, but there has been a substantial increase in fatal drug overdoses coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Trump's immigration policies were always going to be central to his presidency, ever since he announced his candidacy and declared that migrants coming into the US from Mexico were rapists and criminals.\n The administration rolled out hundreds of executive actions curtailing both legal and illegal immigration to the United States, starting with one of his first actions as President: the travel ban, which has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban Muslims from the US.\n After many legal battles, including some instances where the ban was blocked by courts, the Supreme Court upheld an iteration of the ban in 2018.\n Some of the Trump administration's restrictive immigration efforts have been blocked by courts, including an attempt to include an immigration question in the census and end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n The Trump administration also separated thousands of families at the US-Mexico border under the controversial \"zero-tolerance\" policy and built hundreds of new barriers on the border. Refugee admissions to the US plummeted. And in a pair of White House immigration moves this past spring, the administration suspended much of family-based immigration and a number of guest worker visas through the end of the year, with some exceptions, citing high unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n On Day 1 of his presidency, Biden is expected to quickly issue executive actions undoing Trump's past immigration orders, reinstating DACA and repealing the travel ban. But ultimately, the administration overhauled the US immigration system to largely bar immigrants from the US through successive changes that will be difficult for Biden to undo.\n Though Trump has largely leaned on stock market gains, boosted take-home pay and record low unemployment as major highlights of his presidency, his full record on the economy is mixed at best. Many those economic achievements dissipated when the coronavirus hit.\n Nearly 8 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since June, according to researchers from the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame. The poverty rate jumped to 11.7% in November, up from 9.3% in June. That's nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s. The rise in the poverty rate has most dramatically increased among Black Americans, the research indicates.\n The President's only major legislative victory was signing new, sweeping tax cuts into law.\n Unemployment numbers in 2019 dropped to their lowest point since 1969, but that was before the coronavirus pandemic upended American businesses and the economy, skyrocketing unemployment claims. Now, more than 10 months into the pandemic, the US jobs market continues to flounder. And there's mounting evidence that the pandemic has dealt a lasting blow to the US economy, with about 4 million permanently lost jobs. He also promised to revive the coal industry and failed.\n And he will have overseen smaller growth in economic output than any of the previous 12 presidents.\n The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have reached record highs during the Trump presidency, even as unemployment increased due to Covid-19, but those market gains have largely been driven by low interest rates set by the Fed.\n And while Trump can boast a higher-than-average 3.32% annual gain in real per capita disposable income, that average conceals the extent of those gains that flowed to the affluent, who benefited disproportionately from his tax cuts.\n Trump cast himself as a businessman-turned-politician that would not allow the US to be taken advantage of by the rest of the world. That nationalist mindset manifested itself in several ways, but especially on trade -- impacting the cost of goods from around the world and altering the US labor market.\n Trump exited the Trans-Pacific Partnership during his first month in office. His administration waged a steel and aluminum tariff war against key US trading partners, causing prices of many products made with the metals to rise. His administration also threatened to issue and, sometimes, followed through with tariffs against a range of European products -- including cars, cheese, wine and whiskey.\n His administration renegotiated the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico, renaming it USMCA. The administration also struck a trade agreement with China, but after phase one of the deal was agreed upon earlier this year, relations with China were put on ice, largely due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n The reasoning behind much of Trump's trade moves, he and his allies asserted, was to bring back jobs from overseas. But tacking on tariffs, relaxing economic regulations and lowering taxes could have a limited effect on the repatriation of job opportunities for Americans lost to cheaper labor abroad, and foreign direct investment in the US declined significantly during the first two years of Trump's tenure.\n Trump's tariffs ultimately levied $80 billion of new taxes on Americans.\n The President seemed to acknowledge that his trade war hurt farmers, and that to offset their struggles, he celebrated the implementation of subsidizing tactics that ran counter to the anti-socialist principles he said he believes in.\n The pandemic set off new crises for the industry, including damage to supply chains. Farm bankruptcies before and during the pandemic soared.\n Despite Trump's efforts to repatriate US companies' production to the US, American auto plants closed. And in 2020, major US car companies shifted into survival mode because new car sales entered a steep decline and production halted.\n Of all the President's policy legacies, his judiciary appointments promise to be the most enduring: He successfully appointed hundreds of federal judges and three Supreme Court justices, ensuring a strong conservative influence for decades.\n But Trump's approach to the Justice Department, a federal agency traditionally understood to work independently from the President, can best be understood by the fact that he has said he sees himself as the country's chief law enforcement officer. Still, he's made history as the first US president to be impeached twice.\n Throughout his presidency, Trump was vocal about his distrust of the Justice Department and fundamentally misunderstood its mission.\n He refused to accept losing the 2020 presidential election for months, directing a storm of Trump campaign lawsuits that largely failed in court and fomenting so much distrust in the democratic process among his supporters that it led to deadly violence at the US Capitol.\n Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and publicly railed against his successor, Chris Wray. He fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and late last year, his successor, Trump loyalist Bill Barr, resigned less than two months before the end of the presidential term after publicly splitting with the President on several high-profile issues.\n And the President essentially adopted a pardoning policy that put his friends, former associates and individuals with connections to the administration before other formal petitioners.\n The Trump administration announced in July 2019 that it was reinstating the federal death penalty. Thirteen federal death row inmates have been executed in the six months since it has been reinstated.\n Trump faced an arguably unprecedented mountain of lawsuits challenging his policies, his business practices and his own personal behavior. Many of those legal fights will follow him once he's out of office.\n Trump's efforts around education largely revolved around school choice and symbolic efforts appealing to culture war issues.\n The administration had a few small-term successes on school choice, including the increase in annual fund for charter expansion and allowing 529 savings plans to be used for K-12 education. Adding to those victories, Trump also signed legislation passed in Congress that secured Historically Black Colleges and Universities with permanent funding.\n Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also rolled back two Obama-era policies that were key to the previous administration's crack down on predatory for-profit colleges.\n In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida in 2018, Trump established a school safety commission that led to the rescinding of Obama-era guidance meant to address racial disparities in how students are disciplined. Two years after the shooting, the commission rolled out SchoolSafety.gov, a federal clearinghouse of information to help schools. Trump and the White House also proposed arming teachers.\n On another culture war front, the administration also withdrew Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. And in his final year in office, as Black Americans protested police brutality in widespread protests, Trump issued a salvo against attempts to more accurately portray racism and slavery in school history including creating the \"1776 Commission\" to \"promote patriotic education.\" But with Trump's presidency coming to an end, it's unlikely to have an impact on future US curriculums.\n The bathroom guidance and executive orders can easily be reversed by Biden.\n Trump announced in his first year in office that he intended to exit the Paris Climate Agreement. He said during the announcement, which was aimed at curbing climate change, that the accord placed \"draconian\" financial burdens on the American people. It's one of many instances of Trump exiting an international agreement where he felt the US was treated unfairly.\n Biden has said he plans to have the US rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office. The US is about halfway toward achieving the accord's goal to cut emissions, but not on track to meet it, according to the New York Times.\n Besides Trump's decision to pull out of the accord, the Trump administration's record on energy and the environment was largely headlined by efforts to roll back a slew of environmental protections in favor of perceived economic opportunity. Much like Trump reversed many of Obama's environmental policy achieved through executive order, Biden is expected to do much the same of Trump's.\n The Republican's administration targeted 50-year-old Clean Air Act protections, carbon emissions caps, methane regulations, energy efficient light bulb requirements, the length of environmental impact studies for infrastructure projects and gas pipelines, animal protections, herbicide limits and limits for auto emissions.\n They've downsized major protected lands and proposed allowing logging in the nation's largest national forest. In Trump's final year in office, the administration has pushed forward regulatory changes that would remove penalties for killing birds, loosen water efficiency standards for showerheads, and loosen energy conservation standards for washers and dryers.\n The US has also opened vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. But Trump has issued a moratorium on offshore drilling in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina. In 2018, the US became the world's largest oil producer, a feat fueled by the shale boom and Congress' 2015 decision to lift a ban on crude oil exports. The boom allowed Trump to take credit for lowering prices at the pump and encouraging economic expansion.\n The President has frequently touted that the US has the \"cleanest air\" and \"cleanest water\" in the world, but the US ranks 16th in air quality in the world and the US ranks 26th in quality of sanitation and drinking water, according to the Environmental Performance Index.\n However, one analysis shows that after rising sharply in 2018, US greenhouse gas emissions reversed course and dropped an estimated 2.1% in 2019. But that drop is largely due to drops in coal power generation -- an industry the Trump administration has attempted to revive.\n Trump's defense strategy was headlined by efforts to push the US to exit foreign wars. And his foreign affairs strategy was dominated by his belief that the US was being taken advantage of by other nations, including allies.\n He approached foreign relations much like his businesses, leaning on loyalists outside official diplomatic and military channels to push his most controversial efforts while insisting that he alone had the deal making prowess to deliver wins with dictators such as Kim Jong Un. Still, those efforts consistently fell short.\n While Trump was in office, the United States withdrew troops from Syria, Germany, Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n Trump authorized the use of America's most powerful non-nuclear bomb, killing nearly 100 ISIS fighters in Afghanistan in 2017. He authorized the killing of the terrorist group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in 2019.\n The US and the Taliban signed a historic agreement setting into motion the potential full withdrawal of US forces in Afghanistan.\n Trump increasingly isolated Iran, pulling the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal and ordering the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.\n His administration brokered Middle East peace agreements and moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n The administration also put many of President Barack Obama's attempts to warm relations with Cuba on ice, with the US recently naming the country a state sponsor of terrorism. His administration also targeted Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela.\n Despite his repeated calls for the US not to serve as the world's policemen, he also successfully sought increases to military spending. And when Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law in 2019, he created the the newest military service and the first new service since the US Air Force came into being in 1947 -- the United States Space Force. His administration also repeatedly attempted to slash foreign aid.\n He also went over the heads of military commanders to institute controversial policies, blindsiding the US Joint Chiefs when he announced via Twitter that he would institute a blanket ban prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military. The ban went into effect in 2019, prohibiting transgender people from joining the military. It's likely to be reversed by the Biden administration.\n Trump's style of diplomacy both eschewed the conventions of the US' preferential treatment of allied nations and its intolerance of dictators. He led a charge to get NATO country members to pay more toward collective defense. He pushed allies to bring Russia back into the fold of the G7. He also attempted to warm relations with North Korea and embraced controversial, often nationalist leaders -- such as Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Hungary's Viktor Orban and Poland's Andrzej Duda.\n Another hallmark of his foreign policy was his approach to Russia -- namely, his hesitation to single out Russian aggression and, at times, embrace its leader, Vladimir Putin, against his allies' and advisers' warnings.\n He declined to condemn Putin or his government over their role in foreign election interference and spreading misinformation, hacking federal agencies, the poisoning of dissidents, and the reported bounties on the heads of US troops in Afghanistan.\n Trump's health care efforts were largely motivated by attempting to undo his predecessor's landmark law -- the Affordable Care Act. He also implemented a slew of regulations aimed at appeasing his evangelical base, such as religious freedom objections. In apparent efforts to appeal to seniors and his longtime nationalist focus -- fighting for the US not to get \"ripped off\" -- he also pursued policies aimed at price transparency and matching the prescription costs in other countries.\n The Trump administration did many things to weaken Obamacare -- including cutting the open enrollment period in half to six weeks, slashing the advertising budget by 90% and severely cutting funding for enrollment assistance. Also in 2017, the President eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies.\n Sign-ups on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, slipped in the first three years of the Trump administration before rising amid the pandemic in 2020. After the President's tumultuous first year in office, premiums edged down for three years straight and the number of participating insurers grew.\n Most notably, the administration is supporting a coalition of Republican-led attorneys general who are seeking to overturn the landmark health reform law. They argue that Congress' reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero invalidated the individual mandate, and the entire law must fall. The challenge is currently before the Supreme Court.\n The Trump administration released a 44-page blueprint of how the President would reduce drug prices in 2018, but few of the measures have taken effect or made a dent in prices. Some were blocked by courts, including his recent rule to tie Medicare's reimbursement of certain drugs to their cost in other countries and an attempt a few years ago to require drug makers to include list prices in television ads.\n The Trump administration also waged a multi-front battle looking to chip away at abortion access throughout the President's tenure.\n In 2019, the administration introduced a rule barring federally funded health care providers in the Title X family planning program, which provides taxpayer funds to health clinics that offer sexual health services, from referring patients for abortions.\n Trump reinstated and expanded the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, during his tenure.\n The Trump administration also reversed a directive which ordered that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that separately provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood\n Trump frequently celebrated signing a \"Right to Try\" bill passed by Congress into law, which was aimed at helping terminally ill patients access drug treatments that have not been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n The Trump administration sought to remove millions of people from public assistance programs over the last four years, but in many cases, these efforts failed to be finalized before the end of the President's tenure or failed to hold up in court.\n Prior to the pandemic, Trump saw poverty decline during his time in office, but as the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic have continued to ravage the US, hunger and poverty have surged.\n In 2019, the US Department of Agriculture proposed three rules that could strip an estimated 3.7 million people of their food stamp benefits.\n Like its efforts with food stamps, the Trump administration in 2018 also began allowing states to institute work requirements in their Medicaid programs, but federal courts struck down several of the approvals. The Supreme Court agreed last month to review the issue.\n Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently granted Tennessee's request to turn its federal Medicaid funding arrangement into a so-called modified block grant. It is the first state to receive such permission to receive a lump sum of federal support in exchange for increased flexibility in administering its Medicaid program and an opportunity to share in any savings with the federal government.\n The Department of Housing and Urban Development also sought to strip protections for transgender Americans seeking housing in federally funded homeless shelters. The department argued that the change would \"better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers,\" as well as other practical concerns, but it came during the coronavirus pandemic, worrying advocates who feared that it could leave some transgender Americans without housing in the middle of a public health crisis. The rule has yet to be finalized and Biden will likely seek to keep the existing rule in place.\n And for years, the administration also fought to implement its controversial \"public charge\" rule -- which would make it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. It was immediately met with pushback, and in December, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the administration, saying the rule has a chilling effect on immigrants who may need to seek medical assistance.\n CNN's Tami Luhby, Maggie Fox, Katie Lobosco, Ellie Kaufman, Priscilla Alvarez, Zachary Cohen, Caroline Kelly and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",
