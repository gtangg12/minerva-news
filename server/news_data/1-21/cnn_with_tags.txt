        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nPresident Joe Biden's raft of executive actions are designed to represent a U-turn from the Trump administration's policies on everything from Covid to climate change to the border wall.\n But this yo-yo style of government is not how things are supposed to work in the US. Big policy changes are supposed to move through Congress and then to the president's desk, molded by the compromises necessary to get everyone to agree. Instead, with Congress absolutely stuck on key issues for the past 15 years -- give or take -- presidents have settled into a pattern of making executive policy on their own, which has resulted in them doing and then undoing each other on key issues. (That is, unless the courts step in first.)\n Presidents have power. The actions Biden signed on Thursday were meant to focus the federal government's efforts on Covid, create a national effort to get kids back in schools, encourage mask usage, mobilize FEMA and the national guard to help get vaccines into communities, harness local pharmacies and reinsert the US in the worldwide Covid effort. Read more here.\n But other actions he signed, including the major ones on Wednesday -- re-joining the global climate change effort and protecting undocumented children raised in the US -- are the duct-tape version of governing. Biden essentially undid what Trump had done to undo what Obama had done.\n Consider immigration. Biden plans to push for a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. Presidents have been trying to get a comprehensive immigration plan through Congress for 15 years.\n A bill passed through the House during the George W. Bush administration. A bill passed through the Senate during the Obama administration. But legislation never passed through both chambers. So President Barack Obama promised to protect undocumented kids if they came out of the shadows under a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Many did. Then Trump tried to end that program, although he was slowed by the courts. Now Biden is trying to protect it.\n Trump, who started with a GOP-dominated Congress, came in with his own agenda involving a border wall. He didn't really even try the normal route, instead declaring a national emergency at the border to funnel money to his wall project. So Biden has rescinded Trump's national emergency and halted the wall.\n And climate change. An existential threat deserves actual legislation to address the problem in a serious and effective way. But a coordinated climate change policy to cut greenhouse gas emissions is, if anything, more difficult to achieve than immigration reform.\n Think about this:\n Bill Clinton put the US in a global climate agreement. (Kyoto)\n George W. Bush pulled the US out.\n Obama put the US in a global climate agreement. (Paris)\n Trump pulled the US out of Paris.\n Biden is putting the US back in.\n No wonder it's hard for Americans and other countries to figure out where the US stands on climate change. It changes every few years. Biden puts a transition away from fossil fuels as one of his top priorities. If he wants to get something lasting accomplished, he'll need to get it through Congress -- which at the moment rests on an evenly divided Senate, where one Democrat is West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. West Virginia is a coal state, and Manchin once cut a campaign ad where he shot a hole in the middle of the cap-and-trade bill. (Watch it here.)\n Legislating is hard on purpose; it's what was supposed to generate compromise in our big, messy democracy. Instead, it's led to absolute gridlock. Even when Congress can get something big done (Obamacare, for instance), the effort to protect it from being undone becomes so all-consuming that making reasonable fixes becomes impossible.\n More policy yo-yos: drilling in the Arctic, the Keystone pipeline and protections for LGBTQ Americans.",

        "title": "Fauci: Vaccinations will help coronavirus variants from emerging",
        "body_text": "Covid-19 vaccinations will not only help stop the virus from spreading, they will also hamper the coronavirus' ability to mutate into new variants, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Thursday.\n \"Viruses don't mutate unless they replicate,\" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a news briefing at the White House, his first under the administration of President Joe Biden.\n \"And if you can suppress that by a very good vaccine campaign, then you could actually avoid this deleterious effect that you might get from the mutations,\" Fauci said.\n Fauci's remarks come as scientists around the world attempt to decipher what the new variants may mean for those who've been vaccinated or have antibodies to the virus.\n While a few recent studies suggest that a variant first detected in South Africa may be a problem, even for people who have been vaccinated, at least one recent study found evidence that people vaccinated against coronavirus will be protected against new variants.\n Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles found a new strain in one-third of their patients that may have contributed to the recent explosion of cases there, the hospital reported recently.\n \"The strain, which the investigators designated as CAL.20C, is believed to be in part responsible for the dramatic increase in cases over the last two months,\" Cedars-Sinai said in a release.\n The researchers' findings do not indicate that the strain is more deadly, the hospital said, but Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Thursday that \"when more people get it, it passes more quickly, and more people die because of that.\"\n If enough people get vaccinated by the end of summer, the US could start nearing a sense of normalcy by the fall, Fauci said.\n \"If we get 70% to 85% of the country vaccinated, let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer, I believe by the time we get to the fall we will be approaching a degree of normality,\" Fauci said.\n Two-thirds of Americans say they will try to get vaccinated, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS. While that's a higher number than past polls, Fauci said his concern is that not enough people will be willing to be vaccinated, \"because many people are skeptical about that.\"\n For now, however, demand is strong for the available vaccine. For a second time, more than a million vaccine shots were given in a single day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Thursday.\n More than 17.5 million vaccine doses had been administered in the US, and almost 2.4 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n And the push to get people vaccinated has grown even as officials work to meet demand with limited supply.\n \"Demand for the vaccine will be much greater than the supply for some time,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a Thursday news conference.\n She said her state is 46th nationally in the amount of doses allocated, with just 19,500 doses each week, though the state is ranked 15th for administering the vaccine. She's not sure why the state is receiving few doses but hopes that Iowa will be allocated more doses in the coming weeks, perhaps by the first week of February.\n \"We are doing a lot with relatively little vaccine,\" Reynolds said.\n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is administering about 65,000 doses a day -- a rate that will deplete its current supply in two or three days. \"What's clear now is that we will be going from week to week and you will see a constant pattern of basically running out, waiting for the next week's allocation and then starting up again,\" Cuomo said.\n The state will receive 250,400 doses next week, but Cuomo urged President Biden to increase the supply to states immediately.\n \"At this current rate of supply, it takes seven and a half months to get enough vaccine for the currently eligible population,\" Cuomo said.\n Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide mask mandate on Tuesday while the state waited for more vaccine doses.\n \"At the end of the day, vaccine supplies are limited, so while we continue to ask the federal government for more vaccines and faster, we have to keep working together to stop the spread today,\" Evers said, \"by continuing to wear our masks, staying home whenever we can, avoiding gatherings, and doubling down on our efforts to keep our friends, neighbors, and families safe.\"\n The Covid-19 death toll in the US will likely top 500,000 next month, President Biden said in a news conference Thursday, as he portrayed his administration's plan to respond to the pandemic as a \"wartime undertaking.\"\n Part of that plan involves asking Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration -- a step that could save thousands of lives, he said -- as it works to improve the vaccine rollout.\n \"The masks have become a partisan issue, unfortunately,\" Biden said, \"but it's a patriotic act.\"\n \"The fact is they're the single best thing we can do,\" he said. \"If we do this as Americans, the experts say by wearing a mask from now until April, we'd save more than 50,000 lives.\"\n Biden's warning of tens of thousands more deaths in just a few weeks echoes the latest ensemble forecast by the CDC, which projects the death toll could reach up to 508,000 by February 13.\n Biden's remarks came on his first full day in office, which marked one year since the first patient with Covid-19 was identified in the US. That number has since ballooned to more than 24.5 million as of Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n The President signed a series of executive orders to address the crisis on several fronts, including setting up a pandemic testing board.\n \"Let me be clear: Things are going to get worse before they get better,\" Biden said, adding that a memorial he held for Covid-19 victims this week will not be the last.\n \"But let me be equally clear: We will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic,\" he said.\n There remain significant challenges with vaccine supply across the country, according to state officials. And sources tell CNN that Biden and his advisers are inheriting no coronavirus vaccine distribution plan from the outgoing Trump administration.\n Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, said the United States can reach the President's goal of 100 million shots in 100 days -- and may even be able to surpass it.\"\n \"The President has made this his top priority,\" Fauci told ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" adding he was set to meet with Biden later Thursday to brief him on Covid-19 and vaccine distribution.\n \"As he says, he's going to do everything that he needs to do to make sure we have a successful rollout of the vaccines, get it into people's arms and get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can,\" Fauci said.\n Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said he believes there is a \"real chance\" that vaccine production could double by the end of February and double again by the end of March if President Biden uses to Defense Production Act to \"jumpstart\" production. Lamont was recently named a co-chair for the National Governors Association's Pandemic and Disaster Response Task Force.\n New CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Thursday told NBC News the agency was working with the federal government's Operation Warp Speed, vaccine manufacturers and the states to understand the supply issues.\n But in the meantime, \"right now, I think we still have vaccine on the shelves that we need to get into people,\" she said. Federal officials are looking at a \"diverse\" rollout plan, she said, involving community vaccination centers, stadiums and mobile units to get vaccines to everyone across the country.\n Biden also announced the US would rejoin the World Health Organization, a move Fauci said was important for an effective global response.\n \"The official announcement that we are rejoining, we're going to live up to our financial commitments and a whole bunch of other things, it was really a very good day,\" Fauci said. \"The response I'm getting from my colleagues all over the world is really very, very refreshing.\"\n While the US is far from out of the woods, CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins data shows slight dips in new daily cases.\n New cases are down 21% compared to last week, the largest week-over-week drop since the pandemic began. As of Wednesday the average number of new cases over the last seven days remained high, at 194,252 -- but that marked a dip below the 200,000 per day average the country has consistently seen for weeks.\n As of Thursday morning, 43 states were reporting decreases in new Covid-19 cases greater than 10% compared to last week, according to CNN's analysis.\n Six states -- Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont -- were holding steady compared to the week prior. Only Virginia showed an upward trend in cases greater than 10% compared to last week.\n And according to data from the COVID Tracking Project, the US has a 9.81% positivity rate over the last seven days, dropping below the 10% threshold for the first time since late November.\n CNN's Virginia Langmaid, Haley Brink, Ben Tinker, Matthew Hoye, Arlette Saenz, Cheri Mossburg, Sarah Moon, Julian Cummings, Deidre McPhillips, Jacqueline Howard and Kay Jones contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Army changes account of key phone call on response to Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "The US Army has changed its account of a key phone call that took place on January 6 as rioters stormed the US Capitol. More than two weeks after the riot, the Army put forward two senior generals to speak with reporters Thursday to explain their roles on that afternoon after conflicting accounts of what took place circulated.\n They changed their explanation soon after the Department of Defense acknowledged that one of the generals who spoke to reporters, Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn -- the brother of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn -- was in the room for one of the key January 6 phone calls.\n The shifting accounts are only likely to increase scrutiny on the Pentagon, which is already trying to rebut accusations that it denied or delayed the deployment of additional troops as the riot worsened on Capitol Hill, eventually leaving five dead, including a Capitol Police officer. A Washington, DC, official called the process of calling up more guardsmen \"long\" and \"tortured.\"\n Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied the accusations, insisting there were no intentional delays, though then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy on Monday told CNN the response was hampered by an \"archaic system.\"\n On Thursday's call Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, who serves as director of the Army Staff, acknowledged for the first time that he may have expressed concern about the \"optics\" of deploying more troops on the streets of the nation's capital, despite previously strenuously denying he ever made such a statement. And Flynn, the deputy chief of staff of the Army, said that he was in the room for part of the call that included Piatt, then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, and others, but he was unsure if he spoke.\n Army spokeswoman Gen. Amy Hannah insisted that defense officials had \"no intent to deceive\" anyone and claimed the Army had never misrepresented Flynn's participation in the call because they never made an on-the-record statement before Wednesday about him.\n \"We cannot account for any comments made ... by an anonymous official,\" Hannah said.\n In the days following the riots, the Army organized multiple briefings with anonymous senior defense officials while insisting that those briefings remain \"on background,\" even as reporters pushed for them to be on-the-record.\n Piatt, a three-star general, said he may have talked about the \"optics\" of putting troops in riot gear on the streets of the capital after speaking with note-takers, but he didn't remember it in the \"chaos\" of an urgent phone call as Washington officials requested immediate Army help.\n \"If someone says I said that, I don't recall saying it, that's the best I can say, I'm not trying to mislead anyone, I'm just being as honest as I can,\" Piatt said.\n But Piatt vehemently denied that he was worried about the optics last week, after the Washington Post quoted former US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund accusing Piatt of not liking \"the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background.\" Piatt maintained he \"did not make the statement or any comments similar to what was attributed\" to him.\n On Thursday evening, Piatt struck a completely different tone after he conferred with note-takers in the room. \"Some folks say I may have said that, so OK I may have said that, I'm not gonna deny what they said. I'm not aware of a transcript. I've not seen one. If there is one, we would love to see it.\"\n Piatt, who has faced accusations from Sund and DC officials that he rejected a request to send additional troops, emphasized that he said three times on the call that he did not have the authority to call up more National Guardsmen. \"I stressed that the secretary of the Army was down with the acting secretary of Defense and that he needed to make that decision,\" Piatt said.\n During that January 6 call, Flynn entered the room and listened in for a total of four minutes, he said on the call with reporters Thursday, shedding light for the first time on his involvement, just one day after the Army acknowledged for the first time that he was ever on the call. Flynn said he was in a meeting in the Pentagon when he was interrupted and told McCarthy needed him urgently. He said he got to the office just as McCarthy was leaving to see then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller to authorize the deployment of more troops.\n Flynn said he entered the room for about four minutes and listened, along with Piatt and Deputy General Counsel Michelle Pierce.\n \"As far as me speaking on that teleconference, if the mic was open, I may have said something to Michelle Pierce or to Walt Piatt. I do not recall saying anything in the conference, but I may have. I just don't recall saying anything to the audience on the other end.\"\n Flynn is the younger brother of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump's first national security adviser who was a vocal adherent of disputing President Joe Biden's victory on behalf of the former President. Michael Flynn, who was pardoned by Trump, had suggested in an Oval Office meeting that the President should invoke martial law as part of the effort to overturn the election, though others in the room pushed back on the idea, CNN previously reported. At a rally the day before the riot, Michael Flynn urged the crowd to dispute the election results.\n \"The Army leadership has full confidence in the integrity, honor and service of Lt. Gen. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, director of the Army staff,\" said Gen. Hannah. Charles Flynn categorically denied that Michael Flynn had any influence on his actions or decisions.\n The official timeline from Miller's office listed McCarthy, Bowser, the city's deputy mayor, DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency Director Christopher Rodriguez, and Metropolitan Police Department leadership as participants on the call. Officials said Piatt was also on the call.\n But there was no mention of the involvement of Charles Flynn, a three-star general who has already been approved by Congress for a fourth star. Flynn is responsible for operations, plans and training, but he is not part of the chain of command of the DC National Guard, and he does not have the authority to deploy troops.\n In official timelines released by the Department of Defense in the wake of the riot Charles Flynn was not listed as participating in any of the calls that day about mobilizing the National Guard to respond to the riot.\n The Washington Post reported that the Army \"falsely denied for days that Lt. Gen. Charles A. Flynn\" was involved in the key meetings. One of the officials who was on the call told CNN in the days following the insurrection at the Capitol that Flynn was not on the calls, but the military did not confirm his participation until Wednesday.\n In the days leading up to January 6, Pentagon officials were sensitive to the deployment of troops on the streets of DC, particularly after the criticism they faced following the Army's response to June's protests.\n Nevertheless, the Pentagon deployed 340 members of the DC National Guard, asking both the city and the Capitol Police if they needed more troops. Both said no. But as the situation rapidly deteriorated on January 6, now-ousted Capitol Police Chief Stephen Sund and DC officials say military leaders waffled and were overly concerned about the public perception of more troops being deployed on the streets once again.\n The open involvement of Charles Flynn, just one day after his brother, Michael Flynn, egged on Trump supports with cries of a stolen election and violent imagery, would have only increased that scrutiny. The elder Flynn was permanently banned from Twitter for promoting QAnon and spreading lies and conspiracy theories about the presidential election. Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump's first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian diplomats before Trump pardoned him in November.",

        "title": "As expected, Biden intends to keep FBI director in his post, an official says",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden intends to keep FBI Director Christopher Wray in his post, a senior administration official tells CNN, a sign of confidence for the bureau's leader who has more than six years remaining in his term.\n This is not unexpected.\n During the transition, Biden signaled his plan to keep Wray on board -- if he wasn't fired first by President Donald Trump. Like all FBI directors, Wray has a 10-year term. Wray was appointed by Trump in 2017 and faced criticism from the ex-president on a number of issues.\n Wray had no reason to think he wasn't on solid footing with the new Biden administration -- despite the fact that White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not answer on Wednesday when asked if Biden had confidence in Wray.\n \"I have not spoken within him about specifically FBI Director Wray in recent days,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said, \"but I'll circle back if there's more to convey.\"\n Psaki followed up on Thursday, tweeting: \"I caused an unintentional ripple yesterday so wanted to state very clearly President Biden intends to keep FBI Director Wray on in his role and he has confidence in the job he is doing.\"\n An official said she simply had not spoken to Biden about the FBI leader, so she answered honestly at her first briefing.\n Wray's team of federal investigators is currently chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington and around the country.\n Wray announced last week that investigators have identified more than 200 suspects in their probe of the attack at the US Capitol and arrested more than 100 individuals, a challenge that FBI and Justice Department officials say is \"unprecedented.\"\n While federal law enforcement officials have sought to reassure the American public in recent days that they are up to the task on both fronts, their public remarks also lay bare the enormity of the challenge they face in tracking potential threats to not only the nation's capital, but across the country.\n Law enforcement officials have indicated to CNN that authorities missed key signs ahead of the siege, which left five dead and the Capitol ransacked, and the FBI's preparations leading up to the day of the attack on the Capitol have come under scrutiny.\n The Washington Post reported last week that the FBI warned of a violent \"war\" at the US Capitol in an internal report issued a day before the deadly siege, but it wasn't acted on urgently enough to prevent the domestic terrorist attack.\n The Post said that the Tuesday prior to the attack, an FBI office in Norfolk, Virginia, issued an \"explicit internal warning that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and 'war.' \"\n The report \"painted a dire portrait of dangerous plans, including individuals sharing a map of the complex's tunnels, and possible rally points for would-be conspirators to meet up\" in several states before heading to Washington.\n Prior to the attacks, Trump made little attempt to veil his disdain for Wray, who many of Trump's allies have suggested to him is doing little to stamp out what they view as rampant corruption at the FBI. He complained privately that Wray refuses to rebuke his predecessor James Comey, has chastised those who recommended him for the job and has said he would love to replace him.\n Officials at the Justice Department and the FBI told CNN last year that Wray knew Trump was often unhappy with him and that the possibility remained ever-present he could be fired by tweet. But Trump's repeated attacks on Wray appeared designed to motivate a subset of his political base eager to hear him rail against a swampy deep state -- despite holding responsibility himself for executive branch appointments and at the time enjoying Republican control of the Senate, which confirms administration nominees.\n CNN's Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Donald Trump has a money problem",
        "body_text": "Just 24 hours after Donald Trump formally left the White House -- and the presidency -- behind, it's increasingly clear that his money problems are getting worse, not better.\n According to financial disclosure documents released in the hours after Trump left the White House to fly to his new home in Florida, the ex-President's eponymous company took a major revenue hit over the last year.\n And, as CNN's Charles Riley notes, those downturns came even before a series of companies cut ties following Trump's role in the incitement of rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6.\n While some -- maybe much? -- of the downturn in Trump's financial fortunes can be laid at the feet of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the societal restrictions it has forced on all of the travel and hospitality industry, the \"why\" of Trump's falling fortune matters far less than the \"what now.\"\n You'll remember -- and, if not, I am here to remind you -- that Trump faces a series of financial challenges in the coming months and years, primarily tied to his personal guarantees on a series of multimillion dollar loans.\n As The New York Times' David Leonhardt wrote of Trump's tax returns in late 2020:\n \"He appears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.\n \"Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president. Whether he wins or loses, he will probably need to find new ways to use his brand \u2014 and his popularity among tens of millions of Americans \u2014 to make money.\"\n So, Trump didn't win reelection.\n And not only that but, on his way out the door, he peddled a series of lies about the 2020 election that played a not-insignificant part in a riot on January 6 that led to the violent storming of the US Capitol and triggered his second impeachment by the House.\n All of which is likely to even further complicate Trump's ability to a) make money and b) pay off his looming debts.",

        "title": "McConnell proposes delaying impeachment trial until February so Trump team can prepare",
        "body_text": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is proposing that the Senate give former President Donald Trump's legal team two weeks to prepare for the upcoming impeachment trial once the Senate receives the article and delay its start until mid-February.\n McConnell's proposal to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer throws the timing of the trial further into doubt, though it remains to be seen if Democrats would go along with the plan. House Democrats could still send the impeachment article over to the Senate and start the trial the next day.\n Asked if he had heard a response from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, McConnell told CNN Wednesday, \"Not yet but we continue to talk about it.\"\n Negotiations between Schumer and McConnell over the impeachment trial are directly tied to the efforts to get President Joe Biden's nominees confirmed and the Senate's power-sharing agreement finalized, per sources with knowledge of the matter.\n Schumer and Democrats haven't ruled out the idea of delaying the trial as long as they try to get a deal to lock in votes on Cabinet nominees and finalize a deal on the power-sharing agreement that would allow Senate committees to organize.\n Without a deal on the power-sharing resolution, the GOP will still control the committees under the rules of the last Congress, when the GOP maintained a majority in the chamber -- something that gives McConnell leverage in the talks.\n In a statement, McConnell said he wants to structure the trial so that the ceremonial functions, like the formal reading of the impeachment article, would occur next week on Thursday, January 28. Trump would have another week under McConnell's plan to answer the article by February 4, and the following week Trump's team would submit a pre-trial brief, before the trial would begin. The House would also submit briefs over those two weeks before the trial gets underway in mid-February.\n McConnell told Republicans on a conference call Thursday he's in no rush to begin the trial. The Republican leader's point was the House moved quickly on impeachment but the Senate needs time to prepare for a full trial, according to sources on the call.\n \"At this time of strong political passions, Senate Republicans believe it is absolutely imperative that we do not allow a half-baked process to short-circuit the due process that former President Trump deserves or damage the Senate or the presidency,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n While the decision on when to start the trial is up to Democrats, there are reasons congressional Democrats -- and the Biden White House -- may be amenable to a delay in the trial, as it would give the Senate a chance to confirm more of Biden's Cabinet nominees.\n \"I think Democrats will be open to considering a delay that allows former President Trump time to assemble his legal team and his defense for the impeachment trial, if we are making progress on confirming\" Biden's nominees, Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\"\n Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman said Thursday, \"We received Leader McConnell's proposal that only deals with pre-trial motions late this afternoon. We will review it and discuss it with him.\"\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday that the House was \"ready\" to begin the trial but would wait until the Senate was prepared before formally transmitting the impeachment article, the step that would trigger the start of the trial the following day.\n \"They have now informed us they are ready to receive, the question is other questions about how a trial will proceed, but we are ready,\" Pelosi said of the Senate.\n Asked about a delay to the trial, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield reiterated that the White House will \"leave timing mechanics to Senate leadership.\"\n She noted that Biden has spoken previously with both Schumer and McConnell, and it is his hope that Congress can \"focus on a Covid package simultaneously.\"\n \"The articles could be walked over Friday,\" one source told CNN.\n House Democrats were in discussions to send over the article of impeachment to the Senate as early as Friday, two sources say, though one complicating factor was that Trump's legal team remained a question mark on Thursday morning.\n But it appears Trump now has at least one lawyer for the trial. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and ally of the former President, said in a conference call with Senate Republicans Thursday that South Carolina lawyer Butch Bowers will represent Trump at his impeachment trial, according to a person on the call.\n Trump's campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, confirmed on Twitter that Bowers would represent Trump for the trial. CNN has reached out to Bowers for comment.\n Graham told reporters that he would urge Trump's legal team to \"focus on the unconstitutional argument\" that a former president cannot be convicted by the Senate.\n \"They didn't present any evidence in the House, so I don't know if you can present evidence in the Senate that you didn't present -- I guess you could -- but we'll make our own decisions about did the President go too far, was this incitement under the law, what's the right outcome there? So it should be a quick trial really, quite frankly,\" Graham said.\n Republicans have urged Democrats to abandon the Senate impeachment trial of Trump, arguing both that it's unconstitutional and that it directly undercuts Biden's inauguration message of unity in the first days of his presidency.\n Pelosi rejected those calls on Thursday.\n \"No, I'm not worried about that,\" she said. \"The fact is, the President of the United States committed an act of incitement of insurrection. I don't think it's very unifying to say, oh, let's just forget it and move on. That's not how you unify. ... You don't say to a president 'Do whatever you want in the last months of your administration, you're going to get a get-out-of-jail card free.'\"\n Senate Democratic leaders say they don't know when the trial will begin, though Schumer pledged there would be a vote on whether to convict Trump on the House's charge of \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n \"Leader McConnell and I are trying to come up with a bipartisan agreement on how to conduct the trial,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"But make no mistake about it. There will be a trial, there will be a vote up or down on whether to convict the president. I believe he should be convicted. And we'll have to wait to see when she sends the articles over to figure out how to do all that.\"\n Asked when the articles might be sent, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said it was still unresolved.\n \"Whether or not it's going to be a full blown trial with evidence and witnesses, or 'expedited' -- whatever that means -- that final decision isn't even close,\" Durbin added.\n During Trump's 2020 impeachment trial, House impeachment managers focused much of their case on the need to have witnesses in the trial to corroborate their charges that Trump sought Ukraine's help to undermine Biden ahead of the 2020 campaign. That push ultimately failed, as Republicans voted against hearing witnesses before Trump was acquitted.\n This time around, Democrats are eyeing a quick trial, given the fact that the Senate is likely to be stalled while the trial is ongoing -- meaning Biden's Cabinet nominees would be delayed in getting confirmed.\n Democrats have yet to say whether they will seek witnesses for this trial, but Pelosi hinted Thursday they might not need to do so, saying the decision would be up to the managers.\n \"I do see a big difference between something we all witnessed versus information you might need to substantiate an article of impeachment based in large part on a call the President made and described as perfect,\" Pelosi said. \"This year, the whole world bore witness to the President's incitement, to the execution of his call to action and the violence that was used.\"\n House impeachment managers are meeting and preparing to make their case to the Senate, and Democrats remain hopeful they can convince 17 Republican to convict Trump, especially given the fact that McConnell has indicated he is keeping an open mind and will listen to the argument.\n A faction of Senate Republicans, however, are warning McConnell that his backing will quickly wane in the Senate GOP conference if he votes to convict Trump.\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.\n CNN's Kristin Wilson, Daniella Diaz, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Video calls and at-home business casual: West Wing jobs in the time of Covid",
        "body_text": "Landing a West Wing job is a dream-come-true for most any political staffer, even with the long hours, cramped working conditions and around-the-clock pressure.\n Doing it remotely, it turns out, is slightly less glamorous.\n \"I would love to have seen and been there for what it was like before Covid,\" an administration official said wistfully on Thursday. \"It looks so beautiful, but I hear it's empty.\"\n Indeed, on President Joe Biden's first full day in office, aides described the West Wing as anything but the hive of bustling and chaotic activity seen in previous administrations -- or certainly as dramatized on NBC's \"The West Wing\" or countless political films.\n A small contingent of staff, including Biden's senior-most aides and those needed to support the President and Oval Office operations, are in place. But the majority of staffers will work remotely, at least for now, as coronavirus rages and the new President looks to better model his government's own recommendations.\n The roster of those working inside the West Wing so far this week includes: Ron Klain, White House chief of staff; Jen Psaki, press secretary; Kate Bedingfield, communications director; Jeff Zients, Covid-19 coordinator; Jake Sullivan, national security adviser; Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council; and Cedric Richmond, director of the office of public engagement.\n A White House official said aides who were working from home were utilizing \"a variety of tools to stay in touch and carry out their work.\"\n That isn't to say that all of Biden's new staff is not busy. The President is entering office on a policymaking spree, dismantling the previous President's agenda while instituting new plans to combat coronavirus, manage immigration and battle climate change. The amount of documents to write, bullet points to approve, language to vet and events to plan far exceeds other recent administrations, at least in the opening hours.\n It's just that many of the people executing the work are sitting at their kitchen tables, in their spare bedrooms or, if they are fortunate enough, in their home offices. Staffers are managing the administration's intensive early days through conference calls, video meetings and over email.\n The set-up has made for some Covid-era adjustments.\n Before former President Donald Trump left office this week, the White House IT department installed cameras on computers throughout the West Wing the night before Biden was inaugurated to better facilitate video calls for the new administration.\n Several members of the Biden administration's new team dressed up for their virtual swearing-in session with the President on Wednesday. Word spread among the staffers beforehand that campaign attire like sweatshirts and fleece pullovers would not be appropriate. So even though they were only appearing on a tiny box in a monitor -- rather than in person in the State Dining Room -- suit jackets, shirts and ties were in order.\n The concept of working remotely is hardly a new one, particularly for those who did so during the last eight months of the campaign after the Biden headquarters in Philadelphia shuttered in the early days of the pandemic. But it doesn't make it any less frustrating, when the new office is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n While many officials worked in the Obama-Biden administration, others did not, making the remote working environment even more of a disappointment, considering the pandemic was unfathomable at the dawn of the 2020 campaign. Many will stop by the White House in some capacity over the coming days to pick up equipment and receive ID badges, but the work-from-home orders are in place for the foreseeable future.\n That means, for now, no walking into one of the most famous buildings in the world for work or looking out the window to see Marine One lifting off from the South Lawn. No lunches picked up from the takeout window of the Navy mess or taco Wednesdays at Ike's Eatery in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. And no after-hours tours of the West Wing to peek into the iconic Roosevelt or Cabinet rooms.\n In a building where proximity equals power, work-from-home staffers are also deprived of the type of casual run-in or last-minute pull-aside with their superiors -- or even the President -- that could help spark policy or determine strategy.\n By all accounts, Biden is not running his White House like Trump, where casual visitors or low-level staffers often found themselves in the Oval Office as Trump upended his meetings and briefings for arcane tangents. But as many Americans have learned during the pandemic, even the most buttoned-up offices lose something of the organic flow when workers are stuck at home.\n The virtual scenario has, however, eased one ritual of a new administration: fighting for remarkably limited real estate in West Wing offices or even in the more sprawling Eisenhower Executive Office Building just a stone's throw from the White House.\n For now, many of those offices are assigned but empty as staffers ride out the pandemic working from home.\n Vice President Kamala Harris has moved into her West Wing office, although she maintains a far more spacious and ceremonial quarters in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n Officials said they received new government computers and phones that were activated at noon on Wednesday, allowing them to conduct official business from living rooms, kitchens and home offices.\n National Security Council staff who arrived to work at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Thursday were largely sent home and told they will be teleworking for the foreseeable future due to stricter Covid-19 measures being imposed by the administration.\n According to an administration official, only \"continuity of operations\" staff will be allowed to work inside the building, which includes the national security adviser and his top advisers, as well as the heads of a few key directorates and other key personnel.\n Other staffers who need to access top secret information would be allowed in on an ad hoc basis, this official said. Many staffers who had been going in previously are being told that they'll have to stay home.\n But other mid-level and lower level staffers will work from home, a departure from Trump aides who mostly continued coming to work without wearing masks.\n Psaki said during her press briefing on Wednesday that all staffers entering the complex will be required to undergo a Covid test, wear an N95 mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Plexiglass barriers were also mounted on desks in the West Wing, something Trump officials had resisted.\n \"The President has asked us to also be models to the American people, and that's vitally important to us as well,\" she said.\n This story has been updated with more names of staffers working inside the White House.\n CNN's Vivian Salama and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

The Bidens fostered him from the Delaware Humane Association and made his adoption official in November 2018.\n Champ is mostly light brown with a dark snout, and Major is mostly black with light brown paws.\n Earlier this month, the Delaware Humane Association and Pumpkin Pet Insurance hosted an \"indogeration\" event celebrating Major's ascent to first dog.\n Though he is the first shelter dog in the White House, he is not the first rescue. Before Major there was Yuki, a mixed-breed pup abandoned by his owner at a gas station in Texas and rescued by President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci. Bill Clinton's family cat, Socks, was also a rescue.\n \"Happy #InternationalDogDay from Major and camera-shy Champ!\" Biden tweeted in 2019.\n The tradition of keeping pets in the White House dates back to Thomas Jefferson, who kept a mockingbird and a couple of bear cubs during his presidency. Throughout the years, presidential pets became celebrities of sorts.\n \"It softens their image; it broadens their appeal,\" Ed Lengel, a former chief historian at the White House Historical Association, told CNN in 2017. \"They help create an atmosphere of the White House as a family, a lived-in place and not just a stiff museum, but a place where a family lives and plays and enjoys each other's company.\"\n CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Twin suicide bombs rocked a busy market in central Baghdad on Thursday morning, killing at least 32 people and injuring 110 others, according to officials and state media.\n Security forces say they pursued the two attackers before they blew themselves up. It was the first suicide attack to strike Baghdad in nearly two years.\n The first bomber entered the marketplace and, pretending to be sick, asked for help, causing people to gather around him before he blew himself up, according to officials and state media. The second bomber then drove to the scene on a motorbike before detonating his explosive vest.\n Double bombings were common in the country during the height of its sectarian war between 2005 and 2007.\n \"The twin terrorist bombings against the safe citizens of Baghdad at this time confirm the attempts and endeavors by dark groups to target the national needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people for a peaceful future,\" Iraqi President Barham Salih said in a tweet. \"We stand firmly against these rogue attempts to destabilize our country,\" he added.\n A US embassy in Baghdad statement called the attack \"a reprehensible act of cowardice that underscores the dangers of terrorism that millions of Iraqis continue to face.\"\n \"We extend our condolences to the families of these victims, and hope for the swift recovery of those who were injured,\" said the statement on the US embassy in Baghdad's Facebook page.\n The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) also condemned the bombing. \"Such a despicable act will not weaken Iraq's march towards stability and prosperity,\" UNAMI said in a statement on its Facebook page. \"Our sincere condolences to the families of the deceased, and we wish the injured a speedy recovery.\"\n Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has held an emergency meeting with top security officers at the Baghdad Operations Command headquarters. Kadhimi, who is backed by the US, is also the Commander in Chief of the Iraqi armed forces.\n Despite seeing a decrease in violence in recent years, Iraq continues to host numerous armed groups.\n Iraq's Iran-backed armed groups have been accused of regularly mounting attacks against US positions, namely the US embassy, over the last year, leading to rising tensions in a country grappling with a coronavirus outbreak and economic turmoil.\n Pope Francis is set to travel to Iraq for a three-day trip this March. He plans to visit Baghdad as well as other parts of the country linked to biblical sites, such as the plains of Ur and Nineveh.\n CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Hamdi Alkhshali also contributed to this report from Atlanta.",

If we're going to change that, we'll have to do it together, especially now that the Senate is split 50-50.\n It's a tall order, but as a Republican who has spent a good part of the last 30 years on Capitol Hill, I can say this: There is no politician better positioned to make this happen than Joe Biden.\n I've seen him up close in the two jobs that bookended my career in Congress.\n I arrived on Capitol Hill in the summer of 1991 as an intern for Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. The first Democratic politician I met was Biden, ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Helms. I saw a lot of Biden that summer.\n \"Jesse and I have our differences,\" I remember him telling me. \"But if he gives me his word, it's a blood oath. I trust him.\"\n Fast forward 21 years. Now I'm deputy chief of staff to the House majority leader, Eric Cantor. With which Democrat does he have his most important working relationship? Vice President Joe Biden.\n They forged a bond during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations. While those talks did not pan out, Biden and Cantor stayed in touch. Conversations were held. At least one dinner happened. And visits to the Naval Observatory (the VP's residence), if infrequent, occurred. These were clandestine, of course. Washington was already polarized enough that \"compromise\" was a dirty word.\n So it was no surprise in 2012 when Biden reached out to Cantor to ask for his help in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, a legislative priority for the Democratic administration.\n The politics surrounding the law were treacherous. Biden wanted a deal. Our team jumped in to help. Some Senate Democrats wanted to use VAWA as an issue against Republicans. Reaching agreements was difficult. Keeping them, we found, was often harder. But Biden never wavered. Despite some tough conversations among our staffs, he was always focused on the end result.\n When I saw Biden that December, I had not spoken to him since the summer of 1991. But he was the same person. Told I worked for Cantor, he put his arm around me and said, loudly, to the many people in the room: \"Doug works for Eric Cantor. I like Eric Cantor because I know I can trust him. When he gives his word, he means it.\"\n There was that word again. In Washington you learn not to trust anyone, especially people from the opposing party. But to Biden, trust is critical.\n It's one reason why Cantor wrote the 2013 article in Time magazine praising Biden as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n Last year, I co-wrote an op-ed article calling for mandatory Covid-19 testing on Capitol Hill. My co-author was Kendra Barkoff Lamy, Biden's press secretary during the VAWA negotiations. When you want to do something bipartisan, Team Biden is where you look first.\n Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus, and their allies in the Senate, are saying they don't want to compromise with Biden on anything. On the other side, Democrats with an agenda more liberal than Biden's are wary of compromising with the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell.\n Republicans must be prepared for disappointment. A perfect example happened on day one of the Biden presidency. It didn't get much attention, but Biden blocked the Keystone Pipeline, which would have created thousands of union jobs, something the left typically supports. The National Association of Manufacturers and North America's Building Trades Unions praised Biden's inaugural words of \"healing and bipartisanship\" even as they criticized his decision on Keystone.\n As the new President said Wednesday, \"The answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions.\" He's right about that. Unfortunately, the political status quo favors obstructionists, not dealmakers. If Biden's goal is to get things done for the American people -- on things they broadly agree on, like Covid-19 relief, infrastructure and jobs -- he will have to wield all his deal-making skills to the utmost.\n There's no guarantee of success. These things are hard even in normal times, even when we agree.\n Donald Trump won four years ago as an outsider, but that didn't get us out of our political mess. Biden's long career and deep relationships on Capitol Hill are a big part of what America needs now.",

        "title": "Democrats frustrated as fight over filibuster stalls power-sharing agreement in Senate",
        "body_text": "Senate Democrats are refusing to buckle to demands from Senate Republicans that they agree not to weaken filibusters against legislation, something many progressives are anxious to do in order to push through the Biden administration's agenda as Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress for the first time in years.\n \"I think we ought to end the filibuster, unquestionably. It is an obstacle to conquering the pandemic and reviving the economy, getting stuff done,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut.\n The tense standoff over the issue is stalling a power-sharing agreement between the parties in the 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris has a tie-breaking vote. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, now in the minority, is insisting language assuring the protection of minority rights -- through the requirement that 60 votes are needed to overcome filibusters of bills -- be added to a must-pass organizing resolution.\n \"Mitch McConnell was fine with getting rid of the filibuster to a United States Supreme Court nominee for a lifetime appointment, but he's not okay getting rid of the filibuster for unemployment relief for families that are out of work because of COVID-19,\" said Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \"I've just had enough of Mitch McConnell.\"\n Even though Harris can break ties in Democrats' favor, the party can't take full control of the Senate until reaching an agreement with Republicans on an organizing resolution. They're operating on the organizing resolution from the last Congress, when the GOP was in the majority. Because of that, for instance, confirmation hearings for President Joe Biden's Cabinet picks this week are being chaired by Republicans.\n Wrapped up in the larger negotiations over the power-sharing agreement are talks over the timing of the impeachment trial. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democrats haven't ruled out the idea of delaying the trial -- as McConnell has proposed -- as long as they try to get a deal to lock in votes on Cabinet nominees and finalize a deal on the power-sharing agreement.\n Republicans are trying to leverage the urgency to pass an organizing resolution to press Democrats to agree not to gut the filibuster for legislation. But with Democrats staunchly refusing to do so, it's not clear how long it will take the sides to reach an agreement and it could drag out.\n McConnell argues that preserving a supermajority vote to pass legislation is a unique and important characteristic of the Senate, which the Founders believed should be a body where compromise between the parties would be needed to balance the strict majority-driven rule of the House of Representatives.\n The Kentucky Republican made that point in a 2019 op-ed in the New York Times: \"Yes, the Senate's design makes it difficult for one party to enact sweeping legislation on its own. Yes, the filibuster makes policy less likely to seesaw wildly with every election. These are features, not bugs. Our country doesn't need a second House of Representatives with fewer members and longer terms. America needs the Senate to be the Senate.\"\n McConnell also argues that Democrats used the filibuster countless times when they were in the minority to block legislation from Republicans and the Trump administration.\n Schumer, who had said his caucus would have a serious discussion about it if they gained control of the Senate, has not stated if he wants to change the filibuster for legislation. But he doesn't want to rule out the possibility for fear Republicans might obstruct nearly everything the Democrats put on the floor.\n Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said his party is \"not going to give\" in to McConnell's wishes: \"If you did that then there would be just unbridled use of it. I mean, nothing holding him back.\"\n Despite the consternation over the issue, it doesn't appear Democrats would have enough support in their caucus to change the rules because at least two centrists are resisting.\n West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has said repeatedly he would not vote to gut the filibuster -- meaning it can't be pushed through the Senate without him -- but he said he doesn't disagree with Schumer refusing to put language into the organizing resolution protecting it.\n \"Chuck is right to do that, he's the leader. I'm in the minority of the caucus on this,\" Manchin said. \"He has the right to use that to leverage in whatever he wants to do.\"\n Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine, said he doesn't want to consider changing the filibuster unless he determines the Republicans are overusing it.\n \"Right now, we don't know whether it will be abused,\" he said. \"If they're going to use it to obstruct absolutely everything, then I'm prepared to change my mind.\"\n Supporters of the filibuster have reason to fear it could be further diminished. Both parties have jammed through on partisan votes -- known as the \"nuclear option\" -- changes to Senate rules to weaken filibusters against nominees. The Democrats did it first in 2013 to make it easier to confirm then-President Barack Obama's executive and judicial branch nominees. The Republicans extended it in 2017 to Supreme Court nominees clearing three of then-President Donald Trump's picks to the high court.\n On the organizing resolution, Schumer argues the Senate should adopt the same power-sharing agreement as was passed in 2001, the last time the Senate was split 50-50. That agreement said nothing about gutting the filibuster, which was not used as frequently then as it is now.\n \"Our caucus believes that the fairest easiest and most bipartisan way to come to an organizing resolution is to enact the 2001 agreement that senators Lott and Daschle came to in a bipartisan way back then. We, our caucus, is strongly opposed to any extraneous provisions,\" he said referring to then-Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and then-Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.\n But McConnell argued the 60-vote threshold for legislative filibusters is a standing rule of the Senate and therefore should be upheld in the organizing resolution.\n \"If the talk of unity and common ground is to have meaning, and certainly if the rules from 20 years ago are to be our guide, then I cannot imagine the Democratic leader would rather hold up the power-sharing agreement and simply reaffirm that his side won't be breaking this standing rule of the Senate,\" McConnell said on the floor.\n Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz summed up the frustration Democrats feel over the standoff this way: \"McConnell is threatening to filibuster the Organizing Resolution which allows Democrats to assume the committee Chair positions. It's an absolutely unprecedented, wacky, counterproductive request. We won the Senate. We get the gavels.\"",

        "title": "Four people charged in Portland after demonstrators vandalized federal ICE building, Democratic Party state headquarters",
        "body_text": "Demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, on Wednesday vandalized the state Democratic Party headquarters and a federal US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, according to police. Four people have been charged Thursday in connection with those demonstrations.\n At least four demonstrations were planned in the city, Sgt. Kevin Allen, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said in a video statement early Thursday.\n Two remained peaceful, but the others resulted in \"property damage and arrests,\" he said. CNN is attempting to learn more about who organized the demonstrations.\n A group of about 150 people converged on the ICE building in the South Waterfront neighborhood Wednesday evening around 9 p.m., Allen said.\n Some demonstrators were carrying pepper ball guns, fireworks, shields, rocks and \"electronic control weapons similar to Tasers.\"\n In an updated statement, police said many in the crowd wore gas masks and helmets, and within a few minutes, people began tagging the ICE building with graffiti.\n CNN affiliate KOIN reported that the graffiti included messages like, \"Reunite families now\" -- a possible reference to the separation of migrant children from their parents. There were other messages with an anti-law enforcement sentiment, calling on the abolition of ICE with another anarchy symbol. One message read, \"Kill cops!!!\"\n Federal officials declared it an unlawful assembly after demonstrators started throwing rocks and vandalizing the building, Allen said.\n Federal law enforcement officers deployed \"crowd control munitions,\" Allen said, though he did not say what kind, deferring to federal officials. Portland police did not deploy CS gas (commonly referred to as tear gas), Allen added.\n CNN affiliate KOIN reported its journalists at the scene saw law enforcement use what appeared to be tear gas, along with stun grenades and pepper balls. Several people appeared to be taken into custody, according to KOIN.\n Allen said that police were in the surrounding neighborhood and \"some arrests were made.\"\n The city and the ICE building have been the sites of repeated clashes between protesters and federal authorities in recent months. Police did not characterize the makeup of the groups involved in Wednesday's protests.\n The demonstration at the ICE building followed another earlier in the day, when a crowd of about 150 people gathered at Revolution Hall before marching to the Oregon state Democratic Party headquarters.\n Officers on bicycles encountered the protesters in a parking lot at Revolution Hall, where \"(d)ozens of people pressed in on the officers and then took one of the officers' bicycles,\" Portland Police said in a statement. More officers arrived to help and managed to get the bicycle back. The crowd blocked officers' way as they tried to leave.\n The group then left Revolution Hall and marched to the Democratic Party headquarters, where some demonstrators \"smashed windows and vandalized the building,\" Allen said.\n At one point, the crowd \"showed aggression by swarming officers and throwing objects,\" Allen said.\n Images from CNN affiliate KATU showed an anarchy symbol spray painted next to the building's front door with a profane reference to newly inaugurated President Joe Biden on the other side.\n Another showed the crowd making their way up the street, many of them clad in all black, carrying a sign that read, \"We are ungovernable.\" The station reported the demonstration was billed as a protest against Biden and law enforcement, while supporting the rights of indigenous people.\n At least eight people were arrested on various charges, including felony criminal mischief, possession of a destructive device and rioting, Allen said.\n In a statement, the Democratic Party of Oregon said none of its staff were in the building at the time, but they were \"frustrated and disappointed.\"\n \"This is not the first time our building has been vandalized during the past year -- none of the prior incidents have deterred us from our important work to elect Democrats up and down the ballot, and this one will be no different,\" the statement said.\n Police in Seattle also reported vandalism to several buildings in its downtown area Wednesday night, including at a federal courthouse.\n The department shared photos on Twitter, saying \"multiple windows\" were shattered at the William Kenzo Nakamura US Courthouse, used primarily by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n CNN affiliate KOMO reported the group also lit the American flag on fire and threw objects in the streets to block motorists' way. Participants also damaged several vehicles before police ordered them to disperse, KOMO reported.\n Other photos shared by police showed an Amazon Go store with anarchy symbols and anti-Biden and anti-police graffiti. Several windows were shattered. Other pictures showed broken glass at a Starbucks storefront.\n Several arrests were made, police said, including some for property damage and assault. Another man was arrested in connection to a burglary investigation at the Starbucks.\n CNN's Mallika Kallingal, Dave Alsup, Andy Rose and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

American is among several airlines that have also suspended in-flight alcohol sales to minimize the amount of time flight attendants have to interact with customers in the Covid-19 era. American posted a net loss of $3.6 billion in its latest earnings report, and wine sales aren't expected to make much of a dent in its losses.\n The company hopes its new at-home wine program will bring in about $40,000 to $50,000 in sales during the first three months of the year, an American Airlines spokesperson said in an email, citing the company's chief customer officer, Alison Taylor.\n But the short-term prospect of bringing in money from grounded wine bottles isn't the only consideration.\n \"Though revenue is important, Flagship Cellars is moreso a way of engaging with customers, even when they are not traveling with us,\" a spokesperson said via email.\n \"It also gives them a taste of what you can enjoy in Flagship First or Flagship Business,\" the spokesperson said.",

        "title": "National Guard allowed back into Capitol complex after lawmakers erupt at banishment to parking garage",
        "body_text": "Members of the National Guard have been allowed back into the Capitol Complex after a slate of lawmakers voiced their outrage at guardsmen being banished to a parking garage as a rest area, a guardsman told CNN.\n The Guard will now be allowed to rest in the US Capitol Visitor Center, the guardsman said.\n The change comes after thousands of National Guardsmen were moved to a parking garage after they were told they could no longer use space within the US Capitol Complex, including areas like the cafeteria of a Senate office building, as a rest area, multiple Guardsmen told CNN.\n Prior to Thursday morning, several areas throughout the Capitol Complex were designated as authorized rest areas where members of the Guard could take breaks from their shifts protecting the Capitol. By Thursday morning, all those areas had been cleared out and their designations removed, the Guardsmen said.\n \"We honestly just feel betrayed,\" one guardsman told CNN earlier Thursday, noting that a day before, congressmen had come by for photos with the different National Guards units that came to Washington to support security around the inauguration. \"After everything went seamlessly, we were deemed useless and banished to a corner of a parking garage.\"\n News of the guardsmen's situation, which was first reported by Politico, drew swift outrage from lawmakers who tweeted their concern over the situation.\n Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, wrote, \"Very upset by this story but I have been in touch with the Utah National Guard and they are taken care of. My staff and I are investigating what happened here and will continue working to fix this situation.\"\n Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, tweeted, \"Just made a number of calls and have been informed Capitol Police have apologized to the Guardsmen and they will be allowed back into the complex tonight. I'll keep checking to make sure they are.\"\n And Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, tweeted, \"This is outrageous, shameful, and incredibly disrespectful to the men and women keeping the U.S. Capitol safe and secure. We need it fixed and we need answers on how it happened.\"\n On Friday morning, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer thanked a few National Guard members resting in the US Capitol Visitor's Center and told CNN what had happened was an outrage, vowing it won't happen again.\n Pictures provided to CNN showed guardsmen sitting or lying down in areas cordoned off with caution tape. Some appeared to be sleeping by resting against concrete pillars in the garage, just a few feet away from parked cars. There was one electrical outlet and one bathroom with two stalls for 5,000 troops, one guardsman told CNN. Though many of the troops in the pictures are wearing masks, some are not, which the guardsman said was against guidance and a serious Covid risk, calling it \"totally unacceptable.\"\n \"Our guidance is if you're not eating or drinking, you need to be wearing a mask. We've already had just some in my unit alone test positive for Covid, and they're just keeping us packed together with caution tape in small areas,\" said that guardsman. \"And that's the only authorized rest area.\"\n The House Acting Sergeant at Arms, Tim Blodgett, said in a statement Thursday evening he will continue to \"monitor the working and living condition of the Guard.\"\n Approximately 25,000 National Guard troops were called up from all 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia because of heightened security concerns around the inauguration of President Joe Biden. Many used the caf\u00e9 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, just northwest of the Capitol, as a rest area to relax, charge phones and get wireless internet. But on Thursday afternoon, the guardsmen who spoke with CNN said they could no longer use the cafeteria and could only rest in the parking garage of the nearby Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center.\n Acting US Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman said Friday that the Capitol Police \"did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities,\" with the \"exception of specific times\" on Inauguration Day when the swearing-in ceremonies were underway.\n The National Guard Bureau, however, said earlier Thursday the troop relocation was temporary because Congress is in session.\n \"The National Guard continues to assist and support the U.S. Capitol Police. As Congress is in session and increased foot traffic and business is being conducted, Capitol Police asked the troops to move their rest area. They were temporarily relocated to the Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center garage with heat and restroom facilities. We remain an agile and flexible force to provide for the safety and security of the Capitol and its surrounding areas,\" the National Guard Bureau said in a statement.\n Pittman said Friday that all National Guard troops have now been relocated to space within the Capitol complex.\n \"The Department is also working with the Guard to reduce the need for sleeping accommodations by establishing shorter shifts, and will ensure they have access to the comfortable accommodations they absolutely deserve when the need arises,\" she added.\n One week earlier, pictures of National Guard troops resting in the Capitol rotunda also caused an uproar. A spokesperson for the Guard made clear that the troops were not sleeping on duty but were resting between shifts.\n \"To be clear, this is not where they are lodging when off-duty. Being present is the first step in ensuring the safety of our citizens and our Nation's Capitol. Our security personnel work in shifts and rest when they can as others stand watch,\" a Guard spokesperson said.\n Most of the 25,000 National Guardsmen who were brought to Washington to help secure the city through the inauguration will be sent home within five to 10 days, the Bureau said earlier Thursday. Approximately 15,000 troops will return home \"as soon as possible,\" though the planning and process to begin moving them may take a few days.\n There are some agencies requesting ongoing support, the National Guard Bureau said, and approximately 7,000 guardsmen are expected to stay through the end of the month.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n CNN's Sam Fossum, Ali Zaslav and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A new feature on the relaunched White House website contact form allows people to choose their own pronouns, reflecting the new administration's commitment to diversity.\n The change did not go unnoticed -- it was shared widely on Twitter, including by LGBTQ civil rights organization Equality California which wrote, \"In this @WhiteHouse we respect pronouns.\"\n GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, also shared the news on Twitter.\n \"On Day One, the Biden administration has taken immediate steps to include trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people in the conversation,\" GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. \"Pronouns matter, and adding inclusive pronouns to a contact form is more than just a demonstration of allyship.\"\n \"Research has shown that recognition and respect of our pronouns can make all the difference for our health and wellbeing -- especially when it comes to LGBTQ youth,\" Ellis added.\n The site now also includes a Spanish language version of the White House's communications -- a page that went dark when Donald Trump took office. The relaunch came the same day President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took the oath of office. Harris is now the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president.\n \"President Biden and Vice President Harris are proud be building an administration that reflects the diversity of our country and is inclusive of all Americans, and the White House is proud to be welcoming of all people regardless of their gender identity,\" White House spokesman Matt Hill said.\n Biden has vowed to be a champion for inclusivity -- and his picks for the country's top leaders could make history, if confirmed, for the most diverse presidential Cabinet.\n A CNN analysis found 50% of Biden's nominees for Cabinet positions and Cabinet-level positions are people of color -- more than former President Barack Obama's, who held the previous record for diversity with a Cabinet that was 42% people of color.\n Among them is California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who would be the first Latino to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who would be the first out LGBTQ Cabinet secretary to be approved by the Senate.\n And earlier this week, Biden nominated Dr. Rachel Levine to serve as assistant health secretary. Levine would make history as the first out, transgender federal official to be confirmed.\n \"Dr. Rachel Levine will bring the steady leadership and essential expertise we need to get people through this pandemic -- no matter their zip code, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability -- and meet the public health needs of our country in this critical moment and beyond,\" Biden said in a statement about the pick.",

        "title": "How airbag jeans and high-tech vests could make motorbikes safer",
        "body_text": "Balanced on two wheels without a protective shell, riding a motorbike is far more dangerous than driving a car. In the United States, for example, motorcyclists are about 28 times as likely as car occupants to die in a crash.\n But innovations in airbags could help keep motorcyclists safe.\n Moses Shahrivar designed his first pair of motorcycle jeans in collaboration with Harley-Davidson Sweden 16 years ago \u2014 featuring a protective leather lining. Now he is taking the idea one step further. His company Airbag Inside Sweden AB has designed a prototype pair of super-strong jeans that have concealed airbags inside the legs.\n The wearer tethers the jeans to their bike and if they fall from the motorcycle, the airbags are triggered, filling with compressed air and lessening the impact on the lower body. The airbag can then be deflated, refilled with gas and reassembled into the jeans to use again, explains Shahrivar.\n Airbag Inside Sweden AB is in the process of getting the jeans certified to European health and safety standards and is putting them through a series of crash tests.\n The company has raised \u20ac150,000 ($180,000) from the European Union to develop the idea and is hoping to bring the jeans to market in 2022. French company CX Air Dynamics has launched a crowdfunding campaign to develop a similar idea.\n Shahrivar says it's the first time this kind of protection will be available for the lower body.\n Equivalent technology for the upper body has been around for more than 20 years. Motorcycle airbag vests can be fitted under a jacket, and protect the chest, neck and sometimes the back.\n Early versions were tethered to the bike, like Shahrivar's jeans, but more recently, autonomous electronic airbags have been developed, which instead use high-tech sensors to detect when the rider is about to fall.\n Among the autonomous airbags on the market is a system created by French firm In&motion.\n The company started designing wearable airbags for professional skiers in 2011 and has since adapted the technology for motorcyclists. Rather than using a tether to trigger airbags, it has created a \"brain\" consisting of a GPS, gyroscope and accelerometer. A bit bigger than a smartphone, this box is placed in the back of any compatible vest.\n \"The sensors measure movements in real time and the algorithm is able to detect a fall or an accident to inflate the airbag just before a crash,\" In&motion communication manager Anne-Laure Hoegeli tells CNN Business.\n The box measures the position of the rider 1,000 times per second. As soon as an \"unrecoverable imbalance\" is detected the airbag triggers and fully inflates to protect the user's thorax, abdomen, neck and spine, explains Hoegeli. This takes just 60 milliseconds.\n In&motion recently raised \u20ac10 million ($12 million) in funding to expand in Europe and the United States.\n While the basic operation is similar to other electronic airbags on the market, In&motion has an affordable subscription service, explains Emma Franklin, deputy editor of Motorcycle News. \"Their system has in many ways made airbags more attainable for everyday people,\" Franklin tells CNN Business.\n Riders can either buy the box outright for $400 or rent it from In&motion for about $120 a year. Users in France also have access to a setting that calls emergency services in the event of a crash.\n While airbag protection is now mandatory in MotoGP and at this year's Dakar Rally, airbags aren't a legal requirement for road motorcyclists \u2014 but Franklin believes they are an important safety innovation.\n Richard Frampton, a senior lecturer in vehicle safety at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom, says there hasn't been much academic research into the effectiveness of motorcycle airbag vests, as they are still fairly new for road riders. But he pointed to research from the French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks, which found airbag vests offered good protection at impact speeds lower than around 30 to 40 kilometers per hour (18 to 25 miles per hour).\n \"From the few papers, case studies and articles I've seen, they look to be a very useful device,\" says Frampton.\n \"I'm in favor of them \u2014 the chest, neck and spine are all areas where you can get life-threatening injuries.\"",

        "title": "Exclusive: Trump advisor calls on Congress to approve Biden's rescue plan",
        "body_text": "Former Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett broadly supports President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package as a way to keep the coronavirus-ravaged economy afloat.\n \"They've thrown a lot of stimulus at it,\" Hassett told CNN Business on Thursday, \"but I think we need to be risk averse.\"\n The former Trump administration official fears that without more aid from Washington, the worsening pandemic will cause the US economy to suffer a repeat of the first quarter of last year, when GDP shrank by 5%\n \"There are so many businesses treading water, barely hanging on. Now they are getting hit by another shock,\" said Hassett, who served as Trump's top economic adviser from 2017 to 2019 before returning in a voluntary role in March of last year. \"You could end up in a negative spiral for the economy.\"\n \"The disease is spreading in a remarkable and scary rate,\" said Hassett, now a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.\n With his American Rescue Plan, Biden is taking a go-big or go-home approach. The package calls for $1,400 stimulus checks to most everyone who makes less than $75,000, enhanced unemployment benefits, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments and $400 billion to address the pandemic itself.\n Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, worries the federal government is rushing too quickly to throw more money at the problem.\n \"I would like to see a smaller, more targeted approach as we see the economy evolve and adapt, rather than layering on additional helicopter money,\" Piezga said.\n \"We made it through last year without a total, utter collapse of GDP because of extremely aggressive stimulus,\" said Hassett, who served as a CNN commentator last year.\n The former Trump economist is an outlier in his pessimistic view of the recovery's strength. While Hassett is warning the US economy is likely to shrink in the first quarter, the New York Fed Nowcast model is projecting brisk growth of 6.2%. After Biden unveiled his plan, Goldman Sachs upgraded its 2021 GDP outlook to 6.6%, although that forecast assumes Biden gets $1.1 trillion of fiscal stimulus.\n The pandemic is clearly doing real damage to the economy, especially in virus-sensitive industries such as restaurants, movie theaters, hotels and cruise lines.\n The United States lost jobs in December for the first time since the spring. Another 900,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits during the final full week of the Trump presidency alone.\n The sluggish rollout of the vaccine risks extending not just the health crisis, but the economic one as well.\n Speeding up vaccine distribution is being complicated by logistical issues and the disastrous transition between the Biden and Trump administrations.\n Biden and his advisers are taking charge without a national coronavirus vaccine distribution plan having been put in place by the Trump administration, sources told CNN.\n Somewhat counterintuitively, Hassett worries that the US economy will suffer another blow when vaccine distribution accelerates. He explained that people who are next in line for a vaccine, or who have already received a single dose, will be extremely careful to avoid getting infected.\n \"If you hide in your basement for three weeks, then you know you're going to be okay,\" Hassett said. \"There will be a massive increase in risk aversion. We should expect the economy to really, really slow -- even if the government doesn't call for more shutdowns.\"\n Hassett predicted that after some haggling, Congress will pass another major stimulus package in the next month. He noted that Congress and the Trump administration were close to a nearly $2 trillion stimulus deal last fall.\n \"Now that the election is behind us,\" he said, \"people can focus only on what is good for the country.\"",

        "title": "Army now acknowledges the brother of Michael Flynn was a part of Army response to Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "The Army is now acknowledging that Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn, the brother of President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, was in the room for one of the key January 6 phone calls in which DC government and US Capitol Police were asking for National Guard troops to quell the unfolding violence at the US Capitol.\n The decision-making has come under scrutiny as city and Capitol Police officials have alleged that the Pentagon was slow to respond, while the Pentagon and Army maintain they never denied or delayed requests for the National Guard.\n In official timelines released by the Department of Defense in the wake of the riot, Charles Flynn, the deputy chief of staff of the Army, was not listed as participating in any of the calls that day about mobilizing the National Guard to respond to the riot.\n The Washington Post was the first to report Flynn's participation in the call.\n \"I entered the room after the call began and departed prior to the call ending, as I believed a decision was imminent from (then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy) and I needed to be in my office to assist in executing the decision,\" Flynn said in a statement released to CNN. There was no clear answer about how long Flynn was on the call or whether he contributed to the conversation.\n The Washington Post reports that the Army \"falsely denied for days that Lt. Gen. Charles A. Flynn\" was involved in the key meetings. One of the officials who was on the call told CNN in the days following the insurrection at the Capitol that Flynn was not on the calls, but the military did not confirm his participation until Wednesday.\n There is no indication that Charles Flynn agrees with his brother, who was a vocal adherent of disputing President Joe Biden's victory on behalf of the former president.\n Michael Flynn, who was pardoned by Trump, had suggested in an Oval Office meeting that the President should invoke martial law as part of the effort to overturn the election, though others in the room pushed back on the idea, CNN previously reported. At a rally the day before the riot, Michael Flynn urged the crowd to dispute the election results.\n \"Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don't have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here, and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie,\" he said.\n The official timeline from the office of then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller listed McCarthy, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, the city's deputy mayor, DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency Director Christopher Rodriguez, and Metropolitan Police Department leadership as participants on the call. Gen. Walter Piatt, director of the Army staff, was also on the call.\n But there was no mention of the involvement of Charles Flynn, a three-star general who has already been approved by Congress for a fourth star. Flynn is responsible for operations, plans and training, but he is not part of the chain of command of the DC National Guard, and he does not have the authority to deploy troops.\n The revelation comes as the Department of Defense is already trying to rebut accusations that it denied or delayed the deployment of additional troops as the riot worsened on Capitol Hill, eventually leaving five dead, including a Capitol Police officer. A DC official called the process of calling up more guardsmen \"long\" and \"tortured.\"\n Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied the accusations, insisting there were no intentional delays, though McCarthy on Monday told CNN the response was hampered by an \"archaic system.\"\n In the days leading up to January 6, Pentagon officials were sensitive to the deployment of troops on the streets of DC, particularly after the criticism they faced following the Army's response to June's protests. Nevertheless, the Pentagon deployed 340 members of the DC National Guard, asking both the city and the Capitol Police if they needed more troops. Both said no. But as the situation rapidly deteriorated on January 6, now-ousted Capitol Police Chief Stephen Sund and DC officials say military leaders waffled and were overly concerned about the public perception of more troops being deployed on the streets once again.\n The open involvement of Charles Flynn, just one day after his brother, Michael Flynn, egged on Trump supports with cries of a stolen election and violent imagery, would have only increased that scrutiny. The elder Flynn was permanently banned from Twitter for promoting QAnon and spreading lies and conspiracy theories about the presidential election. Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump's first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian diplomats before Trump pardoned him in November.",

        "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook once gave President Trump a $5,999 Mac Pro",
        "body_text": "In a new financial document released just hours after he left the White House, former President Donald Trump disclosed Apple CEO Tim Cook once gave him a $5,999 Mac Pro computer.\n The documents, made public on Wednesday, list the item as \"the first created at the Flex Factory in Austin, Texas.\"\n Apple (AAPL) did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was the first Mac Pro computer out of the factory, but the timing seems unlikely. The factory opened in 2013. It could, however, be the first 2019 model to come out of the facility.\n The Mac Pro gift likely stems from a November 2019 factory visit to highlight American jobs at the Flex Ltd. manufacturing facility that makes Apple products. Controversy followed the meeting, as Trump implied the factory was new for Apple under his leadership, which is was not.\n \"We're seeing the beginning of a very powerful and important plant,\" Trump said at the time. \"Anybody that followed my campaign, I would always talk about Apple, that I want to see Apple building plants in the United States. And that's what's happening.\"\n It's possible he got it confused with Apple's new $1 billion Austin campus that it broke ground on the same day.\n Also listed on the disclosure is a $529 leather bomber jacket from Ford chairman Bill Ford, $650 Ultimate Championship belt from martial artist professional Colby Covington, and golf clubs and accessories from Derek Sprague, former president of the PGA of America. (The disclosure listed Sprague as president of the US Golf Association.)\n The disclosure also revealed that Trump's hotels and golf clubs took a hit last year due to the global pandemic. Trump's businesses generated nearly 40% less revenue in 2020 and the first 20 days of this year compared to 2019.\n While it's common for presidents to receive gifts, there are rules and regulations around what they can accept.\n While the Mac Pro is a costly gift, it's the baseline cost of the current 2020 model. That's before you factor in a $999 Pro stand and other bells and whistles like $5,999 for a 32-inch Pro Display XDR with Retina 6K display and $25,000 for 1.5 TB of memory. All in, a Mac Pro can cost up to $62,571.\n Cook and Trump had cultivated an unlikely relationship during Trump's presidency, from dinners to appearing with Ivanka Trump to promote education. After Trump famously called Cook \"Tim Apple\" at a White House event, the CEO changed his name to that on Twitter.\n But the pair also bumped heads over the years, including when Trump injected himself into a fight between the Justice Department and Apple over the security protections on iPhones used by the gunman who killed three people on a US naval base in Pensacola, Fla. Cook has also spoken out against Trump's immigration policies.\n Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the financial impact of the pandemic on Donald Trump's businesses revealed by his financial disclosure. The revenue for these businesses has fallen by nearly 40%.",

        "body_text": "The negative effects of excess body fat on heart health can't be canceled out by maintaining an active lifestyle, according to new research.\n Previous studies had suggested that being physically fit could mitigate the negative effects of being overweight on heart health, but this is not the case, according to a new study in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), published Thursday.\n \"One cannot be 'fat but healthy.' This was the first nationwide analysis to show that being regularly active is not likely to eliminate the detrimental health effects of excess body fat,\" said study author Alejandro Lucia, a professor of exercise physiology at the European University of Madrid.\n \"Our findings refute the notion that a physically active lifestyle can completely negate the deleterious effects of overweight and obesity.\"\n Previous research provided some evidence that people who were \"fat but fit\" could have similar cardiovascular health to those who were \"thin but unfit,\" but Lucia said this has had unintended consequences.\n \"This has led to controversial proposals for health policies to prioritise physical activity and fitness above weight loss,\" he said. \"Our study sought to clarify the links between activity, body weight, and heart health.\"\n Researchers used data from 527,662 working adults from Spain insured by an occupational risk prevention company, with an average age of 42.\n They were put into groups according to activity level and groups by body weight: 42% of participants were normal weight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 20-24.9; 41% were overweight, BMI 25-29.9; and 18% were obese, BMI 30 or above.\n Then researchers looked at their cardiovascular health by categorizing them for diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, all of which are major risk factors for stroke and heart attack.\n After investigating the associations between BMI, activity level and risk factors, researchers concluded that any level of activity meant it was less likely that an individual would have any of the three risk factors compared with no exercise, with the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes decreasing with increased activity levels.\n \"This tells us that everyone, irrespective of their body weight, should be physically active to safeguard their health,\" Lucia said.\n However, the study showed greater cardiovascular risk for overweight and obese participants compared with those of a normal weight, regardless of how much exercise they did.\n Participants who were obese and active were twice as likely to have high cholesterol, four times as likely to have diabetes and five times as likely to have high blood pressure as those who were normal weight but inactive.\n \"Exercise does not seem to compensate for the negative effects of excess weight,\" Lucia said. \"This finding was also observed overall in both men and women when they were analysed separately.\"\n Lucia underlined that it is \"equally important\" to fight obesity and inactivity.\n \"Weight loss should remain a primary target for health policies together with promoting active lifestyles,\" he said.\n Questions remain, however, around the circumstances of those involved in the study.\n \"This is a cross sectional study -- all we can talk about is associations, we cannot talk about causality,\" Michael Pencina, vice dean for data science and information technology at Duke University School of Medicine, told CNN.\n \"Because it's a cross sectional study, we don't know what came first -- what this study is not telling us is, did the person who is obese and active, did they become active when they realized they were obese, and their risk factors were high? Or were they active, and despite that, they became obese and their risk factors went up?\" Pencina, who was not involved with the study, added.\n \"What we see is that the risk factor burden increases by weight category. Obese people have the highest burden of associated risk factors. That remains true according to the activity level,\" he added.\n The study adds to an extensive body of research on the topic.\n Scientists at the University of Oxford released results of a large study on January 12. Physical exercise may be even more important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease than previously known -- and the more activity the better, the report revealed.\n And researchers at the Cleveland Clinic published a study in January 2019 showing a sedentary lifestyle is worse for your health than smoking, diabetes or heart disease.\n \"While the controversy about the precise contribution of weight versus exercise to cardiovascular health will likely continue, to optimize health and minimize the risk of cardiovascular disease, patients should pay attention to both: maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active,\" said Dr. Anthony Rosenzweig, chief of the cardiology division at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.",

        "body_text": "\"No Time to Die,\" the latest film in the James Bond series and one of the most anticipated movies of 2021, has been delayed again.\n The film, which stars Daniel Craig as the stylish spy, was set to open on April 2. But MGM announced on Thursday that it would push the action film to October 8.\n This is the third time the film has been delayed since the coronavirus pandemic started. It was originally set to open in North American theaters on April 10, 2020.\n The shifting schedule of \"No Time to Die\" is a symbol of the pandemic's impact on Hollywood. The 25th film in the Bond series was the first major movie to be delayed because of the pandemic, but it was far from the last.\n Warner Bros. has even gone as far to say it will release all of its 2021 films in theaters and on HBO Max on the same day. (Warner Bros. and CNN share the same parent company, WarnerMedia.)\n Sony also said on Thursday that \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife,\" the sequel to the popular Ghostbusters franchise, would be moving from June 6 to November 11.\n Now theater owners, whose business has been ravaged by the outbreak, and the rest of Hollywood watch to see if a new batch of blockbuster will be postponed in the coming weeks.\n The next big films on the calendar are \"Black Widow,\" which is set for May 7, and \"F9,\" which is set for May 28.",

        "title": "Reaction to Churchill bust removal muted for Biden after outrage for Obama",
        "body_text": "It had once been a transatlantic art scandal -- or at least various actors of questionable intent would have you believe it was.\n Overheated, confusing and laden in the end with blatant racism, the case of the White House bust of Winston Churchill still persists.\n President Joe Biden has removed it from the Oval Office after four years standing sentry under his predecessor, who thought he looked something like the wartime prime minister.\n An Oval Office redesign brought in new busts instead: Latino civil rights leader Cesar Chavez, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt.\n Some British tabloids deemed it a snub. The US Embassy in London put out a video Friday morning underscoring the special relationship between the US and the UK -- emphasizing that it is not about a piece of sculpture.\n \"We've seen some discussion about the Churchill Bust, so we just wanted to remind everyone what the Special Relationship is truly about,\" the embassy wrote on Twitter along with the 30-second video, noting other areas such as trade and security.\n In another era, the same decision caused outcry. American conservatives and even some British politicians declared it an issue.\n Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, said it was because President Barack Obama \"probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather.\"\n Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, claimed the decoration decision \"foreshadowed everything that was to come the next six years.\"\n Boris Johnson, who was then mayor of London and is now prime minister, went furthest. He blamed the swap on the \"part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire.\"\n The attacks were blatantly racist and also misleading. Obama officials were infuriated.\n There are actually two identical Churchill busts, both by the British modernist sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein. One has been in the White House collection since Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. Another was lent by Prime Minister Tony Blair to the George W. Bush White House when the other one was being restored.\n The one from Blair sat on display in the Oval Office until Bush departed. It was returned to the British government.\n Under Obama, the White House-owned version was not displayed in the Oval Office; instead, Obama kept it outside the Treaty Room in the Residence, where he walked past it when he wanted to watch basketball on the weekends and evenings. He chose to put it there so he would see it during his personal time. He had a bust of King in the office.\n He addressed the situation during his final year in office.\n \"I love the guy,\" he said during a visit to London, adding later: \"There are only so many tables where you can put busts. Otherwise, it starts looking a little cluttered.\"\n When Trump arrived, he returned Churchill to the Oval Office, much to the (proclaimed) pleasure of the Brits. Then-Prime Minister Theresa May, who was Trump's first foreign visitor to the Oval Office, came armed with the UK version of the bust to present to Trump. Officials said the Trump team had requested it.\n \"We were very pleased that you accepted it back,\" May told him.\n Now, the bust is gone again. But Johnson, who is now Prime Minister and is hoping to cement strong ties with the new administration, does not appear to have the same reaction.\n \"The Oval Office is the President's private office, and it's up to the President to decorate it as he wishes,\" a Downing Street spokesman said on Thursday. \"We're in no doubt about the importance President Biden places on the UK-US relationship, and the Prime Minister looks forward to having that close relationship with him.\"\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

        "title": "Washington Post: DOJ watchdog investigating Atlanta US attorney's resignation",
        "body_text": "The Justice Department inspector general is investigating the sudden departure of former Atlanta US Attorney Byung \"BJay\" Pak, who then-President Donald Trump replaced at the same time that Pak and the state of Georgia had become a focus for Trump in his attempt to overturn the state's certified presidential election results, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.\n The paper, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the probe by Inspector General Michael Horowitz appears nascent, noting that investigators had not spoken to Pak and the bounds of the investigation remain unclear.\n A spokesperson for the inspector general's office declined to comment when reached by CNN. Pak declined to comment to the Post.\n Pak, a Trump appointee who had served in the office since 2017, left his job abruptly on January 4 as the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, which includes Atlanta and Fulton County, citing \"unforeseen circumstances\" in a memo to staff. Pak's departure followed fallout over a phone call the previous weekend in which Trump had pressured Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" votes to overturn the election in the state, which he lost to President Joe Biden.\n In audio of the phone call obtained by CNN and first reported by the Post, Trump is also heard making baseless claims about the state's election and at one point, when questioning the audit of ballots, he tells Raffensperger, \"You have your never-Trumper US attorney there,\" without mentioning a name. The comment appears to reference Pak.\n Trump, in turn, ordered a US attorney from southern Georgia to take over the Atlanta office, in an unusual move. The Justice Department said the Southern District of Georgia's US attorney, Bobby Christine, who is also a Trump appointee and has been in the job since 2017, would take over as acting head in Atlanta, handling both roles. The Atlanta office's top assistant US attorney, Kurt Erskine, normally would have taken on the acting US attorney role but was passed over.\n Two people familiar with the matter told the Post in Thursday's story that a call from a senior Justice Department official in Washington had indicated to Pak that he should resign. Trump was angry at what he viewed as the department's insufficient pursuit of his baseless allegations about Georgia's election and the nation overall, people familiar with the matter told the paper at the time.\n As CNN has previously reported, there have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have impacted the election, as affirmed by dozens of judges, governors, election officials, the Electoral College, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Supreme Court.\n The law firm Alston & Bird announced Thursday that Pak was returning to the firm in February as a partner in its Litigation & Trial Practice Group in Atlanta. Pak was formerly a litigation associate at Alston & Bird and began his private practice career there in 2000, according to a news release from the firm.\n In the statement from the Justice Department announcing his resignation early this month, Pak said he was grateful to Trump for the opportunity to serve and thanked former Attorneys General William Barr and Jeff Sessions.\n \"It has been the greatest honor of my professional career to have been able to serve my fellow citizens as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,\" he said. \"I have done my best to be thoughtful and consistent, and to provide justice for my fellow citizens in a fair, effective and efficient manner.\"\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Evan Perez, Chandelis Duster and Kelly Mena contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Feds briefed Biden's interim DOJ leaders on Capitol attack probe ",
        "body_text": "Federal investigators leading the probe into the January 6 Capitol riot briefed interim Biden administration leaders at the Justice Department on Wednesday -- their first day on the job -- as the sprawling nationwide hunt for suspects continues, an official briefed on the matter said.\n Prosecutors have charged more than 120 people, as of Thursday, and have taken steps to bring more serious charges, including charging a group of alleged attackers with conspiracy. The charges range from unlawfully entering the US Capitol grounds to assaulting police -- and a few defendants face more serious counts of conspiracy or threatening a public official.\n The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on Wednesday increased the reward to $75,000 for tips about the pipe bombs found near the Capitol on the day of the attacks -- a sign that investigators are still struggling to identify the perpetrators.\n That elusiveness may indicate the person or people behind the bombs were more sophisticated in their operation, a law enforcement official said. Investigators have looked through hours of surveillance video and combed through cellphone site data to try to find those responsible.\n Acting US Attorney for DC Michael Sherwin has publicly outlined a push to bring sedition charges against some of those involved. The briefing Wednesday for top Justice Department officials included Sherwin and FBI officials.\n The department quickly changed leadership hours before President Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday when acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen announced his resignation.\n Later that day, Monty Wilkinson -- a career Justice Department lawyer and deputy chief of staff to former Attorney General Eric Holder -- was named acting attorney general until Judge Merrick Garland is confirmed by the Senate, people briefed on the matter said.\n Wilkinson is deputy assistant attorney general for human resources and administration. For a few hours -- until Biden signs an executive order appointing Wilkinson -- John Demers, assistant attorney general for the national security division, will serve as acting attorney general.\n John Carlin, who served as the top national security prosecutor during the Obama administration, was selected on Wednesday to serve as the acting deputy attorney general. Carlin will remain in the role until Biden's pick, Lisa Monaco, is confirmed.\n The rest of the department's leadership team took shape on Thursday as they announced filling a critical role in the solicitor general's office. After previously serving as an assistant in the office, Elizabeth Prelogar was named the acting solicitor general.\n Her job will be to represent the government before the Supreme Court, and she will face an enormous workload both reversing Trump administration legal positions and developing a defense strategy as Biden's executive actions come under inevitable legal challenge.\n All the announced acting positions within the agency will remain in place until Garland's confirmation, according to a memo obtained by CNN, written by Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee J. Lofthus.\n \"Please be advised that the list of assignments will change as additional appointments or designations are made. Also, for your information, all remaining United States Attorneys and United States Marshals have been asked by the incoming administration to continue to serve for the time being,\" the memo notes.\n FBI Director Christopher Wray, Demers, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Director of the Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal and Director of the US Marshals Service Donald Washington, all of whom have termed positions, will remain until further notice, the memo said.\n CNN's Jessica Schneider and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The Kamala Harris you don't know",
        "body_text": "Dan Morain is a journalist from California and author of a new biography of Kamala Harris, \"Kamala's Way, An American Life.\" The opinions expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nOn Wednesday, Kamala Harris became the 49th vice president of the United States, the first woman, first Black and first South Asian person to hold that office.\n Since Harris announced her presidential bid in early 2019, she was met with pushback and reservations from progressives in the country due to her law enforcement record. People on the right view her as leftist. Some on the left see her as not progressive enough. She is, on some levels, a work in progress and, no doubt, will fall short of some people's expectations. But as her biographer, I'm here to tell you there's much more to Kamala Harris than meets the eye.\n When she became California attorney general at the start of 2011, Kamala Harris made clear that she had big plans for herself. Harris announced that former US secretaries of state Warren Christopher and George Shultz would co-chair the team leading her transition to an office with no discernible foreign policy portfolio. It was too easy for me, then a political affairs columnist for the Sacramento Bee, to be snarky. I wrote that Harris either was aiming for higher office or would have \"the best darned foreign policy of any attorney general in America.\"\n I was right that Harris was a woman in a hurry. But what I didn't know then, and what I have learned since in writing her biography, is that she knew the virtue of staying out of the spotlight and avoiding making ill-timed power grabs that could undermine her goal.\n Perhaps, most importantly, I found that she is willing to take time out of her busy schedule to commit acts of empathy, even when there is nothing in it for her. As I wrote her biography, the examples of her character and style abounded.\n There is, for instance, her work to end human trafficking. Harris had seen the ugly side of the issue when she worked as a prosecutor in Oakland and San Francisco. She used her position as California attorney general to elevate the issue.\n \"Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery,\" the Harris-led California Department of Justice said in a report on human trafficking in California, back in 2012. The report pointed out that in the internet age, \"the business of sex trafficking, in particular, has moved online,\" and singled out \"unscrupulous websites like Backpage.com,\" a classified ad website that was a bazaar for prostitution, with revenue exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars a year, Justice Department authorities allege.\n Harris and other state attorneys general were especially concerned that Backpage was being used to traffic minors. That's why in 2013, they signed a letter to four Congress members pointing out that the federal Communications Decency Act precluded state law enforcement authorities from carrying out their duty \"to investigate and prosecute those who promote prostitution and endanger our children,\" and urging that the law be changed.\n The Communications Decency Act, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, served to shield social media companies from liability for what people post on their sites. The law helped transform companies such as Twitter and Facebook into internet behemoths. That immunity is fundamental to their business model. Backpage also sought to hide behind that same protection.\n Despite the requests from state attorneys general in 2013, Congress failed to act. So, starting in 2013, one of Harris's deputies, Maggy Krell, embarked on an investigation into Backpage that found several minors who had been pimped using ads from the site.\n Three years later, in 2016, with Attorney General Harris's backing, Krell filed charges against the creators and CEO of Backpage.com, accusing them of a form of pimping. The case also would test the boundaries of state law.\n The criminal complaint and an arrest warrant were filed under seal at the end of September 2016, and, with the help of Texas authorities, agents searched Backpage's offices in Dallas.\n On Oct. 6, 2016, a little more than a month before Harris would face voters in her run for the US Senate, California unsealed the complaint. Some of Harris's critics claimed she filed the case to win votes, although the outcome of the race was not in doubt. She had large leads in polling throughout the campaign.\n Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose agents helped California authorities, held a news conference announcing details of the case. Harris issued a news release but did not hold a news conference. She rarely held news conferences after arrests, and she did not parade defendants before cameras in perp walks.\n Two years later, when Harris was long gone from Sacramento, federal authorities shut down the site and brought criminal charges against several of its executives. Backpage was no more, in no small part because the investigation began when she was California's attorney general. She held no news conference to commemorate its demise.\n In 2016, when Harris was running for the Senate and Donald Trump was running for President, Trump's so-called university had become the focus of lawsuits by the New York attorney general and by private attorneys representing students who claimed they were victims of fraud.\n Harris's opponent, Loretta Sanchez, a fellow Democrat who was then a member of Congress, criticized Harris for failing to sue Trump's school, saying her reticence could have been tied to $6,000 in campaign donations she had received from Trump early in her tenure as California attorney general.\n Perhaps, Harris could have joined the New York attorney general's lawsuit against Trump. She definitely would have scored points with California voters, given their dim view of Trump.\n But she declined to sue Trump University, and there were sound reasons for that decision. One of Attorney General Harris's former aides who was involved in the decision making told me that relatively few Californians were victims of the Trump University scam. People who fell for Trump's bluster were out some money but weren't made destitute. And resources are finite.\n Instead, under Harris, the state sued Corinthian Colleges, Inc., a California-based corporation that affected far more people in the state. In its suit, the state alleged that Corinthian, operating under various names, advertised heavily on daytime television, targeting people who had ''low self-esteem.\" The state alleged that many Corinthian students received degrees of little value and were left with huge student loan debt. The state ultimately won a $1.1 billion judgment against the company and pushed for forgiveness on the debt Corinthian students amassed. Instead of the headlines a Trump suit would have got her, she focused on the mass of California students in need.\n Harris can be tough on her staff, and harsh when, as a US senator, she questioned Trump administration officials and nominees. But what I also discovered is that when cameras weren't around, she displayed a more human side.\n Matthew Davis, a friend from law school, recalled the time he called Harris, then San Francisco district attorney, to encourage her to write a note to an old woman, Naomi Gray, who was nearing the end of her life at a nursing home. Gray had supported Harris and was overjoyed that she had won the seat. Harris had a better idea. She dropped what she was doing, went to the nursing home, and spent 20 minutes holding the woman's hand and comforting her. The woman died a few days later.\n I found many other examples like that, including the time, days before the 2018 midterms, when Harris learned that one of her aides, Tyrone Gayle, was nearing death from colon cancer. She put her political duties on hold and got onto a flight from Washington to New York, so she could hold his hand one last time.\n Vice President Harris has a record of winning, of being strategic, and keeping her eye on the prize. Perhaps most important of all, she has a heart. She shares that attribute with President Biden. If the nation is to heal from the divisiveness of the past four years, and of the weeks since November 3, having a vice president who mixes toughness and determination with empathy ought to give us reason for hope.",

        "body_text": "It's time to admit that making jokes about sacred historical moments like inaugurations is just part of our way of coping with overwhelming political and social change. We know history is being made, yes, but what kind of history? When future generations look back on this day, what will they see?\n Mostly Bernie Sanders memes, it seems.\n In the meme-orable moments of President Joe Biden's inauguration, the Vermont Senator emerged as the day's clear victor. From the moment he arrived, a beacon of sensible northeastern outerwear amid a sea of elegant wool coats, the internet fell in love with Sanders all over again.\n Perhaps it was the Burton jacket, apparently a favorite item in Sanders' wardrobe and proof, as Esquire says, that you only need one good coat. (Longtime Bernie meme fans recognized the coat as the same one he appears to be wearing in another meme-able moment from the campaign trail in late 2019.)\n Perhaps it was the mittens, a perfect melding of function and fashion, or the fact that he rolled up to the inauguration carrying what looked like a package and ... a check? Either way, he gave off a casual \"This has been fun, but the post office closes at six\" vibe that people felt deep in their souls.\n Imagine sitting in a folding chair, just trying to stay warm, and becoming the most beloved meme of the day. People have already made art of this moment!\n Of course, the other groundbreaking fashions at the Inauguration also drew their fair share of jokes and admiration, whether it was the jewel-toned coat squad of powerful political women or Lady Gaga cosplaying as Effie Trinket's sensible twin sister.\n Jennifer Lopez really thought she could slip some \"Let's Get Loud\" into her inaugural performance and people wouldn't make a deal about it? \u00a1Imposible!\n People also took note of the man who executed the critical task of wiping down the lectern in between appearances. We're in a pandemic! He deserves the love!\n Later in the evening, as the sun set on Biden's first day in office, America's other uncle Tom Hanks (Sanders is the uncle on the dad's side, Hanks is the uncle on the mom's) stood in front of the Lincoln Memorial and gave a tribute to the American dream of unity. This would normally be nothing to comment upon, but the internet was very tired and overstimulated, and Hanks was not wearing a coat. Intolerable.\n The dawning of a new presidency brings with it so many questions, so many unknowns. But before we meet the challenges that lie ahead, it was a joy to be able to come together as Americans and celebrate what really unites us: A collective concern over whether Bernie Sanders got that package delivered on time.",

        "body_text": "A Texas public health doctor charged with stealing a vial of Covid-19 vaccine was trying to use leftover doses so they wouldn't go to waste, his attorney said Friday.\n Dr. Hasan Gokal has been charged with theft by a public servant, a misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg's office said in a statement Thursday.\n Gokal is accused of taking a vial with nine doses on December 29, 2020. He was working at a vaccination site in Humble, north of Houston, Ogg said.\n Authorities contend the doctor \"disregarded county protocols in place to ensure vaccine is not wasted but administered to vulnerable populations and front-line workers on a waiting list.\"\n \"He abused his position to place his friends and family in line in front of people who had gone through the lawful process to be there,\" Ogg said in the statement. \"What he did was illegal, and he'll be held accountable under the law.\"\n On Friday, Gokal's attorney, Paul Doyle, said his client was simply trying to use all the doses left over in an open vial instead of throwing them away.\n In a news conference, Doyle said a new vial had to be opened to administer a vaccine to the last person that showed up on December 29, 2020, around 6:45 p.m. CT, leaving 10 doses left over.\n \"As they wrap up, they have a vial that has now a six-hour (shelf life),\" Doyle said, \"and Dr. Gokal is faced with the issue of what to do with it.\"\n According to Doyle, Gokal looked to law enforcement and the medical staff at the site, but they had already been vaccinated. He then began contacting as many people as he could, Doyle said, to find eligible recipients for the leftover doses.\n Gokal ended up vaccinating several eligible individuals, Doyle said, including elderly people Gokal \"provides pro bono medicine to\" and several individuals he found through acquaintances.\n \"What Dr. Gokal is doing is trying to find people who qualify with the goal of not wasting and throwing way this vaccine,\" Doyle said.\n When he had one dose left, Gokal then vaccinated his wife -- who Doyle said also qualified -- after another person who was going to receive the vaccine suddenly said he was unavailable.\n \"The allegation that he put his family in the front of the line and his friends in front of the line is absolutely false,\" Doyle said.\n Gokal told a fellow employee what he did and that person reported him to supervisors, authorities said. He was later fired.\n But Doyle said Friday his client went to the office the next morning and followed correct procedures for reporting the administered doses. Doyle claimed his client was fired January 8 after confirming to human resources representatives that he inoculated his wife.\n Asked for comment regarding Doyle's news conference, the Harris County District Attorney's Office sent CNN the charging documents in Gokal's case.\n Those documents cite the director of Harris County Public Health, who told investigators any vial that had been punctured and still contained viable doses were supposed to be brought back to their main office, and that a procedure was in place to make sure leftover doses were administered to at-risk front-line workers.\n Additionally, there's a secondary waiting list to ensure each dose is administered and not wasted, the documents state.\n Harris County Public Health said that it will not release a statement.\n Gokal has turned himself into authorities, Doyle said.",

        "body_text": "President Joe Biden's first full day in office on Thursday focused on rolling out his national strategy to get the coronavirus pandemic under control and signing several executive actions, including ramping up vaccination supplies and requiring international travelers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to traveling to the US.\n \"Our national strategy is comprehensive, it's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it's detailed,\" Biden said, speaking from the White House. He said the 198-page plan is posted on WhiteHouse.gov.\n Biden's plan starts with a national vaccination campaign in order to meet the President's goal of administering 100 million shots, which is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses, in his first 100 days in office.\n \"We're at Day 1,\" Biden said.\n He said the plan was developed with input from the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, among other advisers and experts. Fauci was at the event at the White House, along with Biden's Covid czar Jeff Zients.\n Biden said the American public would be \"hearing a lot more from Dr. Fauci again, not from the President, but from the real genuine experts and scientists.\"\n Former President Donald Trump sidelined and undermined his own medical experts as the pandemic raged across the country.\n \"We're going to make sure they work free from political interference and that they make decisions strictly based on science and health care alone, science and health alone, not what the political consequences are,\" Biden said.\n The day after being sworn-in, Biden signed at least 10 executive orders, memorandums and directives focused on tackling the pandemic, which, as of Thursday afternoon, has claimed the lives of more than 408,000 Americans and infected more than 24 million in the US.\n Biden signed executive orders ramping up supplies for vaccination, testing and personal protective equipment and another boosting development of therapeutics to treat Covid-19.\n Biden emphasized the need for Americans to wear face masks in order to stop the spread of the virus, saying masks are \"even more important than the vaccines.\"\n The President, who has long stressed the importance of mask-wearing, signed an executive order on his first day in office requiring masks in federal buildings and on federal lands, and asked Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office.\n Following through on his campaign proposals, Biden signed two executive orders creating a National Pandemic Testing Board to improve US coronavirus testing capacity and a Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force to ensure an \"equitable\" pandemic response and recovery.\n Another executive order he signed enhance the nation's collection, production, sharing and analysis of data about the virus.\n He directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to offer full reimbursement to states for the cost of National Guard personnel and emergency supplies such as PPE for schools.\n Biden asked the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services to provide guidance for safe reopening and operating of schools, childcare providers, and institutions of higher education.\n He signed an executive order calling on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to release clear guidance on Covid-19, decide whether to establish emergency temporary standards, and directs OSHA to enforce worker health and safety requirements.\n Building on the order he signed Wednesday making masks mandatory on federal property, Biden also took action to require facial coverings in airports and on certain modes of transportation, including many trains, planes, maritime vessels and intercity buses.\n Biden is also issuing a presidential directive to restore America's leadership, support the international pandemic response effort, promote resilience for future threats, and advance global health security and the Global Health Security Agenda.\n Newly-installed White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters Wednesday that Biden's pandemic strategy will be \"a fundamentally different approach from the Trump administration,\" and will be \"driven by science, data, and public health\" -- not politics.\n CNN reported Thursday that Biden and his advisers are inheriting a nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to speak of from the Trump administration, with sources telling CNN that they'll have to essentially \"build everything from scratch.\"\n \"For almost a year now, Americans could not look to the federal government for any strategy, let alone a comprehensive approach to respond to COVID. And we've seen the tragic costs of that failure. As President Biden steps into office today that, that'll change tomorrow,\" Zients said Wednesday.\n After his swearing-in ceremony Wednesday, Biden's first action as President was to impose a mask mandate on federal property. Biden also installed a coronavirus response coordinator to oversee the White House's efforts to distribute vaccines and medical supplies. He also signed an executive order halting US withdrawal from the World Health Organization.\n CNN's Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A Florida man knew he was wanted by authorities for being at the US Capitol riots but returned to Washington, DC, to attend the inauguration, the Justice Department said in a court filing Thursday.\n Samuel Camargo, 26, was arrested Wednesday in Washington, prosecutors said. The name of Camargo's attorney wasn't immediately available Thursday. He has not yet formally entered a plea.\n Camargo faces four charges related to the January 6 riots that include civil disorder; knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; knowingly engaging in disorderly or disruptive conduct in any restricted building or grounds; and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the criminal complaint.\n Camargo appeared Thursday in DC District Court, where a judge ordered he stay detained as he awaits trial. The judge agreed with the Justice Department that Camargo was a flight risk.\n \"Frankly this country is very large and there are many different places a defendant could hide within it,\" US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said at the hearing.\n Washington prosecutors wrote in a court filing Thursday that Camargo was seen in video at one of the doorways of the Capitol on January 6 \"using his mobile phone to video tape his struggle with the U.S. Capitol Police over opening a door to the U.S. Capitol Building.\"\n Camargo later apologized on social media for his actions that day \"while at the Capitol in D.C.,\" prosecutors wrote.\n On January 7, when contacted by an FBI agent about his actions, Camargo admitted he was in Washington the day of the riot and returned to his home in Broward County, Florida.\n \"Then he became uncooperative and questioned the agent's loyalty to the constitution before saying he had no more information to provide,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Following this interview, the defendant then posted on social media 'Just finished speaking to an FBI agent, I believe I've been cleared.'\"\n Authorities tried to arrest Camargo on Tuesday at his home in Florida, but he was gone, prosecutors said. He was found the next day in Washington.\n Camargo told investigators after his arrest that he knew he was wanted by the Justice Department in connection with his actions at the Capitol and \"decided that he should attempt to attend the Inauguration rather than turn himself into authorities,\" prosecutors wrote in the court filing on Thursday.",

        "title": "Seven Senate Democrats request ethics probe into Cruz and Hawley over Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "Seven Senate Democrats filed an ethics complaint on Thursday against Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas and called for the Ethics Committee to investigate how their objections to the Electoral College votes on January 6 may have contributed to inciting the violent Capitol insurrection.\n \"The Senate Ethics Committee should open an investigation into the actions of Senators Hawley and Cruz, and perhaps others as investigation may reveal, in order to protect the integrity, safety, and reputation of the Senate,\" Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio wrote in the complaint.\n \"The question the Senate must answer is not whether Senators Hawley and Cruz had the right to the object to the electors, but whether the senators failed to '[p]ut loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department' or engaged in 'improper conduct reflecting on the Senate' in connection with the violence on January 6,\" the Democrats wrote, citing the Code of Ethics for Government Service and the Senate Ethics Manual.\n In their letter to the panel's leaders, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the seven senators also asked the committee to offer disciplinary recommendations, \"including up to expulsion or censure.\"\n In a statement Thursday, Hawley called the complaint \"a flagrant abuse of the Senate ethics process and a flagrant attempt to exact partisan revenge.\"\n \"Democrats appear intent on weaponizing every tool at their disposal \u2014 including pushing an unconstitutional impeachment process \u2014 to further divide the country,\" the Missouri Republican said, referring to the House's impeachment of then-President Donald Trump earlier this month, which will next go to the Senate.\n A spokesperson for Cruz accused the seven Democrats of \"playing political games by filing frivolous ethics complaints against their colleagues.\"\n \"Sen. Cruz debated a question of law and policy on the floor of the Senate, he did so expressly supported by 11 other Senators, and he utilized a process to raise the objection that has been explicitly authorized by federal law for nearly 150 years,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that \"Cruz immediately condemned the January 6th terrorist attack on the Capitol, calling for everyone who stormed the Capitol to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n The complaint comes as authorities are investigating hundreds of people in connection with the deadly pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol, including possible links to high-ranking Republicans who encouraged them.\n Federal prosecutors said earlier this month that they are looking at everyone involved in the riot, including the role Trump played in inciting it. District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine warned Sunday that Trump could possibly be charged by city prosecutors with \"a misdemeanor, a six-month-in-jail maximum,\" amid fallout from the insurrection.\n Hawley announced on December 30 that he would object during the Electoral College certification process, defying Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. Nearly a dozen other Republican lawmakers, including Cruz, later announced that they, too, would object. But some changed their minds after the midday violence on January 6 -- which is something the seven Democrats noted in their complaint.\n \"By proceeding with their objections to the electors after the violent attack, Senators Cruz and Hawley lent legitimacy to the mob's cause and made future violence more likely,\" the Democratic senators wrote.\n The seven Democrats wrote Thursday that \"The Senate has the exclusive power to determine whether (Hawley's and Cruz's) actions violated its ethics rules, to investigate further conduct of which we may not be aware that may have violated these rules, and to consider appropriate discipline.\"\n They urged investigators to probe issues including whether Hawley, Cruz or members of their offices or campaigns \"were in contact or coordinated with the organizers of the rally,\" \"knew about the plans for the event\" or \"received funding from organizations or donors that also funded the rally.\"\n Whitehouse, one of the seven Democrats, told CNN on Thursday afternoon that he sent the letter because \"we need to clear up exactly what happened.\"\n \"The only place to get that done effectively is in the Senate, because you can't trust executive branch agencies to do that investigation because they're on the wrong side of the separation of powers,\" he added.\n Hawley, who is thought to harbor 2024 presidential ambitions, has borne the brunt of the blame for kicking off the actions that led to thousands of Trump supporters storming the Capitol complex and forcing the House and Senate to go into emergency lockdown. Hawley had offered pro-Trump demonstrators who stood outside the Capitol a raised-fist salute as he walked into the Senate early that day.\n Publishing house Simon & Schuster dropped his upcoming book, which will now be released by conservative publisher Regnery Publishing. Several major companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Citigroup, announced they were halting donations to Hawley and other Republicans who objected to the Electoral College votes. Luxury hotel chain Loews Hotel Group has since canceled a fundraiser for Hawley, saying it's opposed to \"all who supported and incited\" the deadly riot at the Capitol.\n The complaint from the Democratic senators also quotes Missouri's former Sen. John Danforth, Hawley's onetime mentor, who told The New York Times that \"lending credence to Trump's false claim that the election was stolen is a highly destructive attack on our constitutional government.\"\n Danforth, whose support was central to Hawley winning his 2018 Republican primary, called supporting him \"the worst mistake I ever made in my life\" earlier this month.\n This story has been updated with a statement from a spokesperson for Sen. Ted Cruz.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Ali Zaslav, Dan Merica, Paul LeBlanc, Katelyn Polantz and Rebecca Grandahl contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Canada's governor general steps down after employees accuse her of creating a 'toxic' workplace",
        "body_text": "Julie Payette, a former Canadian astronaut and the country's governor general since 2017, announced she would step down Thursday after she was accused by current and former employees of creating a \"toxic\" workplace environment.\n In a detailed statement, Payette said that she took the allegations seriously -- although she did not formally apologize or admit to any misconduct in the workplace.\n \"While no formal complaints or official grievances were made during my tenure, which would have immediately triggered a detailed investigation as prescribed by law and the collective agreements in place, I still take these allegations very seriously,\"  Payette said in the statement.\n As first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) last year, current and former government employees accused Payette of creating a toxic workplace, harassing and bullying employees and reducing some employees to tears.\n In response, the Trudeau government hired an independent consulting company to investigate the allegations. The report was completed and submitted to the government earlier this week and that prompted Payette's resignation.\n \"I am a strong believer in the principles of natural justice, due process and the rule of law, and that these principles apply to all equally,\" Payette wrote. \"Notwithstanding, in respect for the integrity of my vice-regal Office and for the good of our country and of our democratic institutions, I have come to the conclusion that a new Governor General should be appointed. Canadians deserve stability in these uncertain times.\"\n Canada's prime minister released his own statement Thursday, saying he had received Payette's resignation. Trudeau did not confirm any of the allegations leveled at Payette. However, in the brief statement, he did not thank her for her service.\n \"Every employee in the Government of Canada has the right to work in a safe and healthy environment, and we will always take this very seriously,\" Trudeau said in a statement. \"Today's announcement provides an opportunity for new leadership at Rideau Hall to address the workplace concerns raised by employees during the review.\"\n Trudeau said Canada's chief justice will fulfill the duties of governor on an interim basis until he makes a recommendation on a replacement to Queen Elizabeth.\n Had Payette not agreed to resign in light of the workplace investigation, dismissing her could have triggered a constitutional crisis in Canada, and would have mandated more formal involvement by the Queen.\n Government officials told CNN that the report provided by the independent investigators found the allegations were consistent among employees and the evidence of a toxic workplace was \"robust.\"\n It is not clear whether the results of the workplace investigation will be made public.\n Payette said in her statement of resignation that, \"Everyone has a right to a healthy and safe work environment, at all times and under all circumstances. It appears this was not always the case at the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General. Tensions have arisen at Rideau Hall over the past few months and for that, I am sorry.\"\n However, later in the statement she added, \"We all experience things differently, but we should always strive to do better, and be attentive to one another's perceptions.\"\n That appeared to echo similar language used by Trudeau. In 2018, CNN reported that in response to allegations that he had inappropriately groped a woman in 2000, Trudeau said during a press briefing that, \"I do not feel that I acted inappropriately in any way but I respect the fact that someone else might have experienced that differently.\"\n Canada's prime minister is tasked with recommending a candidate for governor general for appointment by Queen Elizabeth. In 2017 when he recommended Payette, Trudeau said she was \"unquestionably qualified for this high office.\"\n But Canada's opposition leader, Erin O'Toole, accused the prime minister's office of not vetting Payette thoroughly for the job. He said all political parties should now have a say in who replaces Payette.\n \"The Governor General is the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces and has an important constitutional role,\" O'Toole said in a statement to CNN. \"Considering the problems with his last appointment and the minority Parliament, the Prime Minister should consult opposition parties and re-establish the Vice-Regal Appointments Committee.\"",

        "title": "Biden's DOJ must confront what to do with outstanding cases in which it is defending Trump. The first test could come Friday.",
        "body_text": "As the Biden administration begins to take shape, one key question President Joe Biden's Justice Department must confront is whether to continue defending Donald Trump, who relied on Department of Justice lawyers to fight some of his personal battles.\n Friday may be the first test of how the Justice Department will handle some of these issues. Lawyers will be in court in Washington, DC, for a case involving the House Ways & Means Committee's attempt to obtain Trump's tax returns from federal agencies that have them. Trump broke with the tradition of a president voluntarily disclosing his tax returns.\n At stake is whether the Biden administration will back out of legal proceedings making their way through the courts in which Justice Department lawyers under the former President tried to protect Trump and others.\n The Senate has not yet set a hearing date for Biden's nominee for US Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland, so it's not clear how quickly decisions on these cases will be made.\n The Justice Department serves as the lawyer for government agencies and Office of the President in civil litigation, such as defending executive orders, policies, and fights over executive privilege.\n During his four years as president, Trump's Justice Department was called on to intervene in cases that affected him personally.\n Last fall the Department of Justice moved to substitute itself for Trump in a defamation lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who accused the former President of raping her in the mid-1990s.\n A federal judge ruled against the Justice Department, but in the waning days of Trump's presidency, the department appealed the decision.\n Trump also relied on department lawyers to serve his interests, whether it was to block the release of his tax returns or to sue over a tell-all book published by Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.\n In the case involving Trump's tax returns that will be in court Friday, the Treasury Department, formerly led by Steven Mnuchin, denied the request in 2019, prompting the Democrat-led House committee to sue.\n The Justice Department represented the Treasury Department in the case, as is normal, but now it's unclear whether Biden's Treasury and Justice departments will continue to block the request.\n The Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n The case has been slow moving. Judge Trevor McFadden of the DC District Court has taken cues from other separation of powers fights in which the House and Trump -- or the Justice Department on his behalf -- have gone to court in a standoff.\n The parameters of executive privilege are ones every administration and Justice Department grapple with. The difference with the Trump administration was how aggressively it fought with Congress on every request it made.\n McFadden essentially kept the tax return case at bay while appeals courts worked out a related question, whether the House could force former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn to testify about Trump's attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation.\n As of now, McGahn has not testified, and the Internal Revenue Service has not handed over the tax returns.\n During the latter half of Trump's term in office, the McGahn case became the major test for how far the federal courts would go in responding to House subpoena enforcement requests that had been blocked by a recalcitrant executive branch or Trump himself. The McGahn case is set for arguments at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in late February.\n In a court filing this week, private attorneys for Trump identified a potential change in policy under Biden as a possible outcome, and asked McFadden for a hearing. Their concern is that the Biden administration may not oppose the request for Trump's tax returns and quietly release them to the House committee.\n According to Trump's lawyer, the House Committee indicated that it is \"not in a position at this time to speak for the incoming administration regarding release of President Trump's tax-return information to the Committee.\"\n The House committees that have filed subpoenas involving Trump's tax returns and financial documents have said they plan to renew those subpoenas in the new Congress this year, although they have yet to formally do so because the congressional committees have not yet organized.\n House aides say that conversations with the Biden Justice Department about how to settle the congressional cases are likely to wait until after top Biden officials like Garland have been confirmed.",

        "title": "Eli Lilly's antibody therapy helps prevent Covid-19 in nursing homes, drugmaker says",
        "body_text": "Eli Lilly and Company's monoclonal antibody combination therapy helped prevent symptomatic Covid-19 infection among nursing home residents and staff in a Phase 3 trial, the company announced on Thursday.\n The study findings were described in a company news release, but Eli Lilly noted that the full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed clinical journal.\n Nursing home residents who received the drug -- known as LY-CoV555, also called bamlanivimab -- had up to an 80% lower risk of contracting symptomatic Covid-19 versus residents in the same facility who received a placebo, according to drugmaker Eli Lilly.\n The findings suggest a key preventive use of the antibody treatment, which was issued an emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration in November to treat mild to moderate coronavirus infections in adults and children. The treatment is administered as an infusion in a hospital or other health care setting.\n Eli Lilly now will consider requesting FDA regulators to extend the drug's authorized emergency use from being just to treat Covid-19, but also to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in long-term care facilities where someone may have tested positive for the disease.\n \"We're glad bamlanivimab is already available as a treatment for patients at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 illness or hospitalization, including those in nursing homes, and look forward to working with regulators to explore expanding the emergency use authorization to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in these facilities,\" Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said in the company news release Thursday.\n \"We are exceptionally pleased with these positive results, which showed bamlanivimab was able to help prevent COVID-19, substantially reducing symptomatic disease among nursing home residents, some of the most vulnerable members of our society,\" Skovronsky said.\n The study included 1,097 residents and staff of long-term care facilties who were randomly given either 4,200 milligrams of bamlanivimab or a placebo.\n The trial results showed that after eight weeks, among only the residents in the study who originally tested negative for Covid-19, four died from the disease -- but the deaths all occurred in residents who were given a placebo. There were no Covid-19 deaths among residents who were given bamlanivimab, the company announcement said.\n Among only the residents who originally tested positive, four people also died but they were all given a placebo and there were no deaths among those given bamlanivimab, the announcement noted.\n During the entire trial, there were a total of 16 deaths reported, including deaths not related to Covid-19, and all deaths were among residents, not staff members, according to the announcement. Eleven of those deaths occurred among people given a placebo and five were among those given the therapy.\n \"The antiviral activity seen with bamlanivimab treatment emphasizes the importance of early intervention to help counter the devastating impact the virus has had in this vulnerable population and other high-risk patients,\" Dr. Myron Cohen, co-principal investigator and director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in Eli Lilly's announcement on Thursday.\n While the announcement provides limited information, the findings \"exceed\" expectations, Dr. Nick Cammack, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator lead at Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Thursday.\n \"These results exceed our expectations, demonstrating that this class of treatments can be used to both prevent and treat disease,\" Cammack said in the statement.\n \"Reducing the risk of getting Covid-19 by up to 80% would be remarkable, and could have a dramatic impact on outbreaks among the most vulnerable groups globally,\" Cammack said in part. \"Monoclonal antibodies are traditionally the most expensive class of treatments in the world. Covid-19 must be the pivot moment where they move from the rich world to the whole world and become part of mainstream therapeutics.\"\n In the United States, anyone sick with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 who is at high risk for progressing to a more severe illness should be able to access bamlanivimab or ask their doctor for a monoclonal antibody infusion.\n Studies show these treatments can prevent high-risk Covid-19 patients from developing severe symptoms, yet health officials say not enough of the available treatments have been used.\n CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report.",

        "title": "CNN Poll: Americans' willingness to get the coronavirus vaccine is on the rise",
        "body_text": "Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they will try to get vaccinated now that multiple Covid-19 vaccines are approved and beginning to be made available to the public, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n That's up from about half in October (51%), before any vaccines had been approved for use.\n The rollout of vaccines to fight the virus -- which has shut down much of the country for nearly a year -- appears to be tilting public opinion toward optimism that the worst is behind us.\n Overall, 49% say the worst of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States is behind us (up from 44% in October), while 47% say that the worst is ahead. Among those who say the worst is behind, 62% say they feel that way because there are vaccines available. No other reason reaches double-digits, but 9% each cite the administration change in the White House and that we know more about the virus now.\n On the other side, among those who say the worst is still to come, no single reason dominates, but many say their pessimism is because people are not taking the virus seriously or not following guidelines (18%), vaccines are not widely available yet (17%) or the recent rise in cases and deaths (17%).\n The longstanding partisan divides in views on the coronavirus are still largely in place, though the change in power at the White House appears to be driving some shifts. With an incoming Democratic administration, Democrats are starting to hold a more positive outlook on the pandemic (38% say the worst is behind, the largest share to say so since the start of the outbreak) while Republicans are becoming more negative about it (30% say the worst is ahead, the highest since April and nearly doubled since October, when 16% felt that way).\n And Democrats are increasingly willing to get the coronavirus vaccine (from 61% in October to 83% now), while among Republicans, that number has held about even (45% in October, 49% now).\n Beyond the partisan shift in willingness to get a coronavirus vaccine, there has also been a 27-point increase in the percentage of those age 65 or older who are willing to be vaccinated (from 60% in early October to 87% now). Among younger adults, the changes are smaller, holding roughly steady among those under age 35 at 55% willing to get a vaccine, up 10 points to 58% among those age 35 to 49, and up 21 points to 69% among those from age 50 to age 64.\n The survey finds partisan agreement, though, that the distribution of vaccines so far, which has been limited largely to health care workers and older adults, has mostly been fair. Overall, 75% say so, including 79% of Republicans, 78% of independents and 69% of Democrats.\n Results from the same poll released earlier this week found that Americans largely expect President Joe Biden to be able to achieve his pledge of ensuring that 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine are administered by the 100-day mark of his presidency (70% said that is likely to happen, including 90% of Democrats, 69% of independents and 47% of Republicans).\n Most Americans say they only occasionally or rarely feel that people around them in public are doing too little to prevent the spread of the virus (56%), while 42% say they feel that way all or most of the time. Half of Democrats say they feel people around them aren't doing enough most of the time (50%), while that dips to 36% among Republicans.\n About half (48%) say they are experiencing financial hardship due to the coronavirus, including 13% who say it's a severe hardship, those numbers are roughly the same as when CNN last polled on this question in August.\n The methodology and weighting for this poll have been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cell phones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for p                artisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls.\n The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

        "title": "Volkswagen CEO joins Twitter and immediately trolls Tesla and Elon Musk",
        "body_text": "Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess is new to Twitter, but he made a splash with his very first tweet -- going after master troll and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n \"Hello @Twitter! I'm here to make an impact with @VWGroup, especially on political issues,\" Diess tweeted on Wednesday. \"And, of course, to get some of your market shares, @elonmusk \u2014 after all, our ID.3 and e-Tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions.\"\n Volkswagen Group (VLKAF), which includes VW and Audi among other brands, has made a major push on electric vehicles, selling more of them than any other traditional automaker. Last year it sold 231,600 pure electric vehicles, slightly less than half of the 500,000 cars sold by Tesla, but more than triple VW's electric vehicle output in 2019.\n Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA) is building a factory in Germany to increase its European sales, but VW has jumped to the lead in electric vehicles in many European markets.\n Volkswagen is the world's largest automaker, with global sales of 9.3 million vehicles in 2020 \u2014 just 2.5% of those sales were electric vehicles.\n Although Volkswagen is far larger by sales, Tesla's market value is roughly eight times greater.\n Diess joined Twitter in December but sent out his first tweet on Wednesday. In less than 24 hours the tweet had racked up 4,400 likes and he already had 12,900 followers -- a fraction of Musk's 42.6 million followers, but not bad for a first day.\n Musk so far hasn't replied publicly to Diess' tweet.\n As Diess enters the Twitterverse, he could learn a bit from Musk's mistakes on the platform. A handful of Musk's roughly 13,000 tweets have gotten him into real-life trouble \u2014 including action by the Securities and Exchange Commission that stripped him of his title as chairman of Tesla, and a defamation suit that he won.\n The Tesla CEO certainly loves trolling other automakers, but he'd actually tweeted nice things about Diess and VW in the past.\n In September 2019, when someone tweeted a story critical of Diess and Volkswagen to Musk, he responded, \"Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it's worth, he has my support.\"\n And this past October, responding to another tweet about Diess, Musk wrote: \"Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he's in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.\"\n And asked about the tweet, Michael Manske, a spokesperson for Volkswagen, also pointed to compliments of Tesla and Musk that Diess has made in the past.\n \"Herbert Diess and Elon Musk have a good relationship and respect each other,\" he said.  \"The competition with Tesla accelerates the transformation of Volkswagen.\"",

        "body_text": "The Trump administration will not have its own signature collection to display in the White House China Room -- another departure from protocol for the outgoing first family.\n Timing and exorbitant cost prevented outgoing first lady Melania Trump from following through on the collection, the patterns and colors for which she had selected, according to a source familiar with the events. Ultimately, the china took too long to make and cost too much, the source said.\n Trump pulled the plug on the project at some point during the last six weeks, the source said.\n A representative for Melania Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n Each administration has the opportunity to design and have made its own official china collection, both for entertaining purposes and for legacy and future administrations to use -- with the exception of few, every administration since George Washington has done so.\n The nonprofit White House Historical Association has paid for past official china collections with funds supplied by its donors, but another source involved in the discussions of the Trump china told CNN the association had \"concerns\" with the price tag and decided it was too expensive an endeavor.\n \"The White House Historical Association was not involved in an acquisition project related to the Trump china,\" an official with the association told CNN. The official would not comment on the reason for the lack of involvement. The last administration not to use funds from the association for official china was the Reagan administration.\n A full official administration china service is expensive and an endeavor that takes significant time.\n The Obama china, planning for which began in 2011, was delivered in 2015, the color inspired by the blue waters off of Hawaii. There were 320-settings of 11 pieces each, costing more than $350,000, paid for by the White House Historical Association.\n Laura Bush's china selection totaled 4,500 pieces and cost $492,000, also paid for by the association. Bush ordered an additional, less-formal 75-place settings to use for entertaining in the private residence, which was not paid for by the White House Historical Association.\n Trump most commonly opted to borrow place settings from the official Clinton china set for her White House events, the two Trump-hosted state dinners included. There are 300-place settings of apropos ornate, shiny gold plates and dishware selected by Hillary Clinton when she was first lady.\n First lady Ellen Wilson created the White House China Room in 1918 to display the china of presidential administrations.",

        "title": "Trump's business was crashing even before the Capitol riot made his brand toxic",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump's businesses generated nearly 40% less revenue last year as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the hotel industry, putting the former president under financial pressure even before corporate partners and banks ditched him in the wake of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n Posted on Wednesday as he left the White House, Trump's final financial disclosure as president reveals a steep decline in revenue at some of his marquee properties in 2020 and the first 20 days of this year. Sales at the Trump International Hotel Washington plummeted by 63% compared with 2019 to $15.1 million, while revenue fell 62% to $9.8 million at Scottish golf resort Turnberry.\n Revenue at one of the former president's biggest businesses, the Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami, declined to $44.2 million from $77.2 million in 2019. Trump has mortgages on the property totaling between $55 million and $75 million, according to the document. The loans from Deutsche Bank mature in 2023.\n Hotels and other hospitality companies, which form a substantial part of Trump's business empire, have been hit especially hard during the pandemic as travelers stay home and governments impose lockdowns. In Scotland, for example, Trump Turnberry has been forced to close because of government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n There were a few bright spots for the Trump Organization. Revenue was fairly steady at his golf courses in Charlotte, North Carolina, Philadelphia and New York's Hudson Valley. Sales at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump returned after leaving the White House on Wednesday, increased to $24.2 million from $21.4 million. (He transferred his permanent residence to the Florida property from Trump Tower in New York in 2019, and spent hundreds of days golfing at courses he owned during his presidency.)\n Still, there are major questions about the president's business after his supporters vandalized the Capitol earlier this month in a brazen assault that left five people dead and sparked a major corporate backlash.\n Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB) banned Trump indefinitely, taking away his biggest megaphones. Stripe is no longer processing credit card payments for his campaign organization, Shopify stopped operating online stores for the Trump Organization and the campaign and the PGA announced it was pulling a major golf tournament from his Bedminster, New Jersey, course.\n New York City is seeking to terminate its business relationships with the Trump Organization. That would prevent Trump from continuing to operate several recreational venues including the Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park, which generated $4.5 million in revenue in 2020, according to the financial disclosure.\n Deutsche Bank (DB) has decided to no longer do business with Trump, a source told CNN Business earlier this month. In addition to the mortgages on the Doral property, Germany's biggest bank has also provided loans for the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago and the company's hotel in Washington.\n The Trump Organization owes Deutsche Bank approximately $340 million in the coming years, the source said. It's unclear which, if any, other banks will want to loan money to the Trump Organization.\n New York state criminal investigators looking into Trump's business practices have subpoenaed the bank about its lending relationship with the Trump Organization. Late last month the two private bankers at Deutsche Bank who worked most closely with Trump resigned their positions.\n Signature Bank said following the attack on the Capitol that it had started closing Trump's personal accounts. The former president has a checking account with the bank, according to his financial disclosure.\n The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n \u2014 Matt Egan and Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Fauci talks 'liberating feeling' serving under Biden versus Trump",
        "body_text": "When Dr. Anthony Fauci returned to the White House briefing room on Thursday, he did so without the sour reality of a hostile president watching him from feet away in the Oval Office.\n \"I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the President,\" Fauci told the room, appearing nonetheless to take some pleasure in no longer having to dance around President Donald Trump's turbulent ego.\n \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is -- let the science speak,\" he added. \"It is somewhat of a liberating feeling.\"\n He demurred somewhat on his rocky history with the previous administration. But he made no attempt to veil his pleasure at the changing of guard.\n For the 80-year-old infectious disease specialist, it was the latest act in a long history of serving seven US presidents. Fauci, who sat on Trump's coronavirus task force and endured Trump's public scorn, emerged to tout a new administration's plans and voice support for a new President's approach.\n In some ways it was a turnabout. Though he was sidelined and ignored in the end, he still helped formulate a badly flawed Trump administration policy that failed to contain the virus.\n But when things began to get bad, Trump's aides restricted how much Fauci could appear on television to offer warnings and disinvited him from briefing the President in the Oval Office.\n Fauci and Trump disagreed on how to approach the pandemic, what the correct message was for the American people and how to balance reopening with preventing further contagion.\n Through it all, Trump insisted he respected Fauci but disagreed with his approach. But at their relationship's nadir, Trump suggested he was considering firing Fauci. Attacks from Trump's allies led to death threats and enhanced security.\n It was a different scene on Thursday. Fauci awoke before 4 a.m. ET to address the World Health Organization on the administration's behalf after Biden rejoined the body.\n In the State Dining Room several hours later, Biden and Fauci greeted each other warmly before Biden signed a series of executive actions meant to combat the pandemic. He appeared for a number of television interviews. He was the first administration expert to stand in the briefing room under new management.\n Fauci himself said he was guaranteed a new approach.\n \"One of the things that was very clear as recently as about 15 minutes ago, when I was with the President, is that one of the things that we're going to do is to be completely transparent, open and honest,\" Fauci said. \"If things go wrong, not point fingers but to correct them. And to make everything we do be based on science and evidence.\"\n \"That was literally a conversation I had 15 minutes ago with the President,\" he said, clearly relieved the stark warnings he's been trying to convey about the pandemic for months would now come with the imprimatur of the White House.\n \"We are still in a very serious situation,\" Fauci said as he began his remarks, calling the recently passed death toll of 400,000 \"historic in a very bad sense.\"\n He suggested that the recent seven-day average of cases \"looks like it might actually be plateauing in the sense of turning around,\" and the public health officials \"think it's real.\"\n But, he added, he's said this before.\n \"I'm sort of getting a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu standing up here cause I said something like this almost a little bit less than a year ago when we were talking about the acceleration of cases in the late winter, early spring of 2020, when we were having New York City metropolitan area being the epicenter of what was going on. There are always lags, so please be aware of that,\" he said.\n That, of course, was before Trump decided Fauci's urgent warnings were dampening Americans' spirits and, in turn, his political prospects.\n By summer, Trump had taken to insisting the country was \"rounding the corner\" on the virus. By the time another surge hit in the fall, Trump was in full denial.\n Fauci went for weeks without speaking with Trump. Two days before the election, Trump suggested to a crowd in Florida he might fire Fauci. The doctor continued to attend task force meetings with Pence, and appeared at a briefing with Pence in November, but his relationship had died with Trump -- who'd taken to a new adviser, Dr. Scott Atlas, whose views were on the fringe.\n On Thursday, Fauci signaled the days of overconfidence and loose facts were over.\n \"One of the things new with this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess,\" he said. \"Just say you don't know the answer.\"\n CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden wants to remove this controversial word from US laws",
        "body_text": "It's just one small part of the sweeping immigration overhaul President Biden is pushing.\n But the symbolic significance is huge.\n Biden's proposed bill, if passed, would remove the word \"alien\" from US immigration laws, replacing it with the term \"noncitizen.\"\n It's a deliberate step intended to recognize America as \"a nation of immigrants,\" according to a summary of the bill released by the new administration.\n The term \"illegal alien,\" long decried as a dehumanizing slur by immigrant rights advocates, became even more of a lightning rod during the Trump era -- with some top federal officials encouraging its use and several states and local governments taking up measures to ban it.\n \"The language change on the first day of this administration, with Kamala Harris the daughter of immigrants, to me it's not just symbolic...it's foundational,\" says Jose Antonio Vargas, an undocumented immigrant whose organization, Define American, pushes for more accurate portrayals of immigrants.\n \"How we describe people really sticks. It affects how we treat them,\" he says. \"How we talk about immigrants shapes the policies. It frames what are the issues really at stake here. It acknowledges that we're talking about human beings and families.\"\n US code currently defines \"alien\" as \"any person not a citizen or national of the United States.\"\n Officials in the past have pointed to the term's prevalence in US laws to defend their word choices.\n In 2018, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed prosecutors to refer to someone who's illegally in the United States as \"an illegal alien,\" citing the US code in an agency-wide email.\n The term \"alien\" was often invoked by President Trump in speeches as he warned of what he saw as the dangers of unchecked illegal immigration.\n Speaking at the Mexico border last week in one of his final addresses as president, Trump used the term at least five times.\n \"We were in the Trump administration the perennial boogeyman,\" Vargas said. \"Whenever Trump was in trouble, he started talking about the 'illegals' and talking about the border.\"\n But not everyone in the Trump administration was a fan of the language.\n In an interview with the Washington Post published shortly before he resigned as acting secretary of Homeland Security in 2019, Kevin McAleenan told the newspaper he avoided using the term \"illegal aliens\" and instead described people as \"migrants.\"\n \"I think the words matter a lot,\" McAleenan said, according to the Post. \"If you alienate half of your audience by your use of terminology, it's going to hamper your ability to ever win an argument.\"\n California struck \"alien\" from the state's labor code in 2015.\n New York City removed the term from its charter and administrative code last year.\n In guidelines issued in 2019, New York City banned the term \"illegal alien\" when used \"with intent to demean, humiliate or harass a person.\" Violations, the city warned, could result in fines up to $250,000.\n And last year two Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to replace the term \"illegal alien\" with \"undocumented immigrant.\" The bill never made it to the state Senate floor for a vote.\n One of the first times the use of the term \"alien\" drew widespread attention during the Trump administration was in 2017 after officials publicized a hotline for victims of \"crimes committed by removable aliens.\"\n Prank callers swiftly flooded the line with reports about space aliens, sharing examples on social media of their comments about Martians and UFOs.\n But Vargas says the term and others used to demonize immigrants are no laughing matter.\n \"Language has power. And I think we saw that in the Trump administration, how it used dehumanizing terms and how it debased language and in turn debased people,\" Vargas says. \"If you call them 'alien,' of course you're going to put them in jail, of course you're going to lock them up, of course you're not going to care that you're separating little kids from their parents.\"\n Vargas says the new administration's effort to use more respectful language gives him hope that some Americans' views on undocumented immigrants could also shift. Changing just one word, he says, could have a far-reaching impact for millions of people.",

Walls featuring figures such as Andrew Jackson were replaced with portraits of Founding Fathers and busts of civil rights leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.\n Among the new displays near a collection of personal photos: a bust of Mexican American farm labor leader Cesar Chavez.\n \"It really speaks to the contributions and importance of the work of our community. Immigrants have given and continue to give to this country, even in the toughest of times,\" Paul Chavez, his son and the president and chairman of the Cesar Chavez Foundation, told CNN in an interview.\n Cesar Chavez brought public attention in the 1960s and 1970s to the plight of Latino immigrants and workers harvesting America's crops. His advocacy led to farmworkers gaining fairer wages, lunch breaks and access to toilets and clean water on the job.\n Born in 1927, Chavez joined the Navy as a teen, serving two years before becoming a community activist and organizer. In 1962, Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, which later merged to become the United Farm Workers union.\n Chavez and his association joined Filipino American farmworkers in the 1965 Delano grape strike, protesting substandard pay and employee treatment. In 1968, Chavez fasted for more than two weeks, which culminated in a meeting with Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who had been horrified by the working conditions they witnessed and pledged to support Chavez and their cause. The labor groups' efforts ultimately proved victorious.\n A lifelong defender of workers' rights, Chavez died in 1993. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom the following year.\n President Barack Obama honored Chavez during his administration, declaring the anniversary of his birth, March 31, as Cesar Chavez Day. The rallying cry of Chavez's movement was \"\u00a1Si se puede!\" -- and its translation, \"Yes We Can!\" became the Obama-Biden campaign's slogan en route to winning the 2008 presidential election.\n Paul Chavez today continues the work set forth by his father, helping those new to the US as well as families and descendants who have lived stateside for decades. Their foundation focuses on affordable housing, educational programs, community service and the rights of workers throughout the Southwest.\n The foundation runs a series of radio networks, airing in English and Spanish. Information from medical experts and local leaders on how to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and register for vaccines are a regular feature, as well as the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n \"We made it a point to ensure that our listeners understood that the plight of African Americans is the plight of the Latino community,\" Chavez told CNN. \"While we may come from different backgrounds, we share the same plight and we share the same dreams.\"\n Chavez noted the toxicity of the prior administration toward Latinos and immigrants, saying, \"The last four years you've heard so many derogatory things about our community, you would believe we all got here yesterday and that we're here doing things we shouldn't be doing.\"\n He highlighted the community's long-standing patriotism, answering calls to service and working jobs that often go unfilled by other Americans. \"Many times, we're treated as second class citizens,\" he added, \"so what we do is remind people of the contributions and the importance that our community and immigrants bring to improve this society.\"\n Now, with a bust of Cesar Chavez prominently displayed behind the Resolute Desk, his son hopes efforts such as immigration reform will stay at the forefront of the new administration's goals.\n \"We're happy that the bust is there,\" Paul said, focused less on the direct honor bestowed upon his father and instead on what it could mean for \"a people that my father spent his entire life supporting and empowering.\"\n \"It represents the hopes and aspirations of an entire community that has been demonized and belittled, and we hope this is the beginning of a new day, a new dawn in which the contributions of all Americans can be cherished and valued.\"\n CNN's John King, Cindy Y. Rodriguez and Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "900,000 Americans filed for unemployment in Donald Trump's last full week as president",
        "body_text": "The jobs crisis roared on during Donald Trump's last full week as president, with 900,000 Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n It was down from the prior week's upswing, when claims rose to 926,000. It's a good sign that benefit applications fell again, but \"good\" is relative here: Millions of Americans still need government help to make ends meet, and there haven't been any real improvements for months.\n Although Wednesday's inauguration of President Joe Biden spurred hopes for more government stimulus, help can't come fast enough for the unemployed. Last week's initial claims figure was still more than four times higher than in the same period last year.\n \"It is promising that last week's large increase was not repeated,\" said Indeed Hiring Lab economist AnnElizabeth Konkel in emailed comments. But she noted \"both the magnitude and direction of the total initial claims remain a problem, with no substantial improvement since late summer.\"\n On top of regular claims, 423,734 Americans applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which provides benefits for workers such as the self-employed, the Department of Labor said. That figure was an increase of nearly 140,000 from the prior week. This number is not adjusted for seasonal swings.\n Added together, first-time claims totaled 1.4 million on an unadjusted basis last week. This total has remained stubbornly high.\n Continued jobless claims, which count workers who have applied for aid for at least two weeks in a row, fell to 5.1 million.\n Experts think part of the reason for the recent increase in claims is a surge in applications after the passage of the latest stimulus package at the end of December. Meanwhile, economists are also tasked with seeing through seasonal patterns in a time where things like seasonal holiday hiring is upended.\n Overall, nearly 16 million Americans received some form of government benefits in the week ended January 2, a decrease from Christmas week.\n But the details are less encouraging. Claimants of regular state benefits, federal employees and veterans on benefits, as well as workers who have exhausted all other options and have rolled onto the Extended Benefits program, all increased.\n Workers who have exhausted their state benefits, as well as aid from the Pandemic Unemployment Emergency Compensation program that is designed to bridge the gap, may then be eligible for extended state benefits depending on where they live.\n It's a complicated system of many different programs, but the bottom line is this: Millions of Americans still need help.\n The Biden administration will have to get to work right away on the labor market. Biden has indeed promised to create jobs through investments in infrastructure and clean energy -- but that won't solve the immediate jobs crisis.\n Ultimately, economists believe the vaccine rollout will help usher in the real recovery in the jobs market. But until then it's about supporting those still out of work while the nation battles the ongoing pandemic and rising infections.",

        "title": "Why Joe Biden is already thinking about a 2nd term",
        "body_text": "Even before Joe Biden became the country's 46th president on Wednesday, his orbit was sending out signals that he wouldn't be a one-term wonder.\n \"He is planning to run again,\" Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told Politico over the weekend. \"He knows that we are at the middle of an absolute turning point, a pivot point in American history. And he's up for the challenge.\"\n Which is interesting!\n After all, Coons is one of Biden's closest allies and advisers. Which means it's pretty unlikely that he just sort of spouted off -- days before Biden became president -- about the 46th president's plans to run again in 2024.\n This was, without question, a concerted effort -- and strategy -- to get the word out that Biden has no plans to limit himself to a single term. And it's a very smart strategy.\n Why? Because the second that Biden -- or one of his top surrogates -- suggests that Biden, who, at 78, is by far the oldest person ever sworn in for a first presidential term, may not run again, he immediately becomes a lame duck. The clock starts ticking on the end of his term and Republicans begin the process of stalling as much as possible -- knowing that Biden is going to be gone in less than four years.\n (There's a reason that the last president to make a one-term limit pledge was Rutherford B. Hayes way back in the 1870s.)\n It's also suggests there's been a significant change from where Biden reportedly was on seeking second term -- at age 82 -- as recently as December 2019. As Politico's Ryan Lizza reported at the time:\n \"Former Vice President Joe Biden's top advisers and prominent Democrats outside the Biden campaign have recently revived a long-running debate whether Biden should publicly pledge to serve only one term, with Biden himself signaling to aides that he would serve only a single term.\n \"While the option of making a public pledge remains available, Biden has for now settled on an alternative strategy: quietly indicating that he will almost certainly not run for a second term while declining to make a promise that he and his advisers fear could turn him into a lame duck and sap him of his political capital.\"\n And Biden spoke openly about his candidacy (and presidency) as a sort of generational bridge for the party and the country.\n \"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,\" Biden said in March 2020. \"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.\"\n But by August, with Donald Trump ramping up attacks on the former vice president's age and ability to do the job of president, Biden was less vague about his future plans, Asked whether he could see himself running again in four years, he responded: \"Absolutely.\"\n The truth is that no one -- Biden included -- knows what he and the country will look like in four years' time. Did anyone think that 18 months ago that we would be in the grips of a global pandemic that has already killed more than 400,000 Americans? Exactly.\n But words have impact. And Coons' pledge that Biden not only could run again but it is \"planning\" to do so is very clearly meant to send a signal to every Democratic and Republican in Washington that this guy isn't going anywhere -- so it's time to get to work with him on the problems facing the country.",

        "title": "Biden changes America in an instant -- but tougher challenges loom",
        "body_text": "On the first morning of Joe Biden's presidency, America has changed utterly, and not at all.\n Already shredding Donald Trump's legacy, Biden is demonstrating the vast potential of his office to turn the nation's direction on a dime. He has watched nine presidents since coming to Washington, and it shows. The new commander in chief quickly reached for familiar levers of power and showed a mastery of the theatrics of his office to supercharge a new political era in the hours after taking his inaugural oath.\n Every step Biden took on Wednesday -- from worshipping with rival congressional leaders before his swearing-in to an inaugural address that stressed healing, unity and truth through a trip to Arlington National Cemetery with three ex-presidents -- sent a clear message: America is on a new course.\n When Biden bowed his head in silent prayer in memory of pandemic victims during his address and spent the day behind a mask, he demonstrated respect for the virus's dangerous potential never shown by his predecessor. In the process he pointed to the route out of the most serious of what he said were \"cascading\" national crises that will assail his early months in office.\n Thanks to a towering pile of executive orders on the Oval Office desk, the US is returning to the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and ending a travel ban from some mainly Muslim nations.\n In the time it took him to write his name, Biden choked off funding for the border wall, which was the single most galvanizing cause of Trumpism.\n Biden's swift signatures did not just send a signal around the world that America as its allies have known it for decades was back. They exposed a key weakness of Trump's presidency: Ill-thought-out executive power grabs to win a headline for a strongman president are easy to undo -- and lack the permanence of legislative triumphs, which the former president had little interest in pursuing.\n All day Wednesday, there was a sense of lightness in the air as political opponents went out of their way to be courteous to one another, perhaps out of respect for Biden's call for an end to the \"uncivil war\" of modern politics.\n Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri recalled how former President Barack Obama had sung \"Amazing Grace\" at a memorial service after a South Carolina gun massacre. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called Blunt her \"friend.\" Congressional leaders even shared jokes. There was none of the walking on eggshells or fawning before the commander in chief that had been required by Trump's brittle public persona. His removal from Washington, for a few hours at least, appeared to change the character of the city.\n Biden's early events, meanwhile, suggest that the President will now speak to the country in calm, well-measured speeches rather than raging tweets and rambling monologues.\n In the evening, Biden's new press secretary, Jen Psaki, delivered a news briefing that broke with recent tradition in that it was not designed solely to provide mic drop moments for Fox News. And Biden vowed to fire anyone who treated co-workers with disrespect -- a code his predecessor would have quickly violated.\n In essence, Biden's conduct Wednesday, as he often reflected credit on his subordinates and coaxed the American people to live up to their country's core values, demonstrated deep respect for the institution of the presidency itself, and a willingness to make his term about something other than himself.\n Kindness and decency are back.\n In many ways, the 46th President has returned Washington to its old normal. And Trump's supporters no doubt will see the restoration of decorum at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as a sign the \"establishment\" is back in control.\n Yet the sight of the nation's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president, Kamala Harris, being sworn in suggested the capital isn't just back in the hands of its old White establishment.\n Sixty years ago, an aged Robert Frost recited a poem at the inauguration of a young President John Kennedy. On Wednesday, a young Black woman, 23-year-old national youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman, delivered an ode of stunning rhetorical power to bless the swearing-in of an old President. Her appearance reflected the shifted morality of the White House with its new occupant and previewed a culture of inclusion that honors the unfinished national racial reckoning of last year.\n By late on a chilly Washington night, it felt like far more than a few hours since Trump had lifted off from Joint Base Andrews as the fading bars of \"My Way\" rolled over the closing credits of an aberrant four-year term.\n Yet throughout the day there were reminders of the challenges that will decide the fate of Biden's presidency -- underscoring that while he nailed the early optics, reality is a tougher fix.\n Speeches can't correct the racial and economic inequality that scars America. A climate crisis is exacerbating drought and wildfires. Trump's presidency has validated surging White nationalism. Abroad, a new power in the East, China, is challenging American dominance.\n The eerie silence that greeted Biden's motorcade as he drove to the White House through empty streets was a reminder of the security net clamped on Washington after Trump incited an insurrection against Congress only two weeks ago.\n The new President is no fool, and he knows that many even on his own side roll their eyes at his somewhat old-fashioned belief that America is one country -- even as millions of Trump voters believe falsely that he stole the election.\n \"I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy,\" he said in his inaugural address. \"I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.\"\n But Biden made a compelling case that despite national fractures that are as deep as at any time since the Civil War, the American experiment is strong. Never mind that the country often seems to be heading off in two separate cultural, racial and social directions.\n \"We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,\" Biden said. \"If we show a little tolerance and humility -- if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes just for a moment.\"\n Those are fine thoughts from a lifetime optimist. But the coming Senate impeachment trial of ex-President Trump will be sure to reopen old wounds. Some of the executive actions Biden took Wednesday on climate and immigration will have already closed off potential Republican votes for his own goals.\n The new White House will spend the first full day of Biden's term on Thursday addressing the crushing threat of the pandemic -- after over 4,000 more Americans died as inauguration commemorations took place.\n While offering the tantalizing promise of a healthy future, Biden delivered a somber warning that the road ahead will be strewn with loss.\n \"We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter,\" he said, pleading for politics to be finally put aside during the pandemic's horrible endgame.\n Biden's frank talk was another notable break from the approach of his predecessor, who denied the virus was an issue, predicted it would miraculously disappear and undermined his own government's effort to slow its murderous spread.\n The plan Biden is proposing -- masking, social distancing and a new push to speed up a disastrously slow vaccine rollout -- will require a concentrated effort by a united country; a metaphor, in a sense, for his entire philosophy and approach to the presidency.\n \"I promise you this: As the Bible says, weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this, together,\" Biden said.\n The days to come will show whether the new President's faith in his country is justified.",

        "body_text": "On Wednesday at noon, Joe Biden became the 46th president of the United States. He was not arrested beforehand. Nor were any of the other high-profile Democratic politicians who attended the inauguration. Donald Trump didn't declare martial law. He flew to Florida quietly.\n And thus died one of the longest-lasting and most widespread conspiracy theories of last four years -- organized loosely under the flag of the group known as QAnon. Adherents to the conspiracy theory, which had become a sort of conspiracy catch-all for people who saw Trump as some sort of savior figure, were left wondering what the heck happened.\n So, where does Q go next? Or is it over? I reached out to CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, who has been covering the movement adeptly for CNN, to answer those questions -- and more.\n Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n Some believers seem to be coming to the realization they have been duped. For some of them, it  was confirmation of suspicions they have had for a while. They feel like Trump has betrayed them.\n I was at a QAnon event in Arizona back in October and one of the guys who was speaking at it, someone who is a major peddler of the conspiracy theory, was telling the audience to stay patient, that even though the conspiracy theory was three years old at that point and the big round-up of Democratic politicians didn't happen -- it would happen and everything would be fine after Trump's reelection.\n Guys like that, who have social media accounts and sell QAnon merch to cash in on the conspiracy theory, are already coming up with ways to spin the conspiracy theory forward -- some are even trying to say Biden is actually a QAnon guy.\n The guy with the horns on his head who is in all the pictures from the Capitol and has now been arrested was a big QAnon believer. He was at that event in Arizona, too, and I saw him outside Trump's rally in Dalton, Georgia, two days before the insurrection.\n A lot of these guys really thought they could get away with doing this because they so believed in the conspiracy theory and they so believed that they were doing what Trump wanted them to do.\n I think seeing them now being rounded up and eventually prosecuted sends a message to QAnon followers that they can't act with impunity. Though it is also going to create some QAnon martyrs.\n In our story published today, we spoke to a guy who says he isn't a QAnon follower, but he does espouse some of its conspiracy theories.\n I met him in the early hours of the morning in DC on Wednesday and he was repeating a conspiracy popular among QAnon followers that Trump would stop the inauguration of Biden using martial law.\n He also said the election was stolen and that it was left-wing radicals responsible for the violence here on January 6.\n I caught up with him after the inauguration when reality was settling in. While he accepted he was wrong about martial law -- for him the lies about the stolen election and the left-wing radicals were still the truth.\n And so there are possibly millions of Americans who have been indoctrinated in conspiracy theories, and just because Biden is the President, that is not going away.\n It might get even worse for some now that the major social media platforms are kicking off a lot of QAnon accounts (at least for now) it is forcing some believers to darker corners of the internet where they will see more wacky theories and might get radicalized further.\n One of the great challenges, I think, in 2021 is how America is going to deal with that very issue. We have a domestic radicalization problem with disinformation at its core.",

Thank you #KamalaHarris\" wrote Lynell Miller in a post to Twitter with a photo of her girls sharing an embrace.\n Miller told CNN the last year has been full of so many teachable moments for her children, and Inauguration Day was a day to learn about grace, hope and potential. \"It means that I can be an astronaut when I grow up,\" said Miller's 6-year-old daughter Eleanor.\n Three generations of women in Gary Williams Jr. family sat together to watch Harris take her oath.\"This is what it's about. Three generations. My mother, my wife, and my daughter watching history,\" wrote Gary Williams to Twitter. \"A Black woman being sworn in as Vice President of the United States of America. Thank you @KamalaHarris and congratulations!\"\n Sarah Johnson said her son Uly was excited to watch the moment. \"Overjoyed my five-year-old son got a half day to watch the inauguration and even more overjoyed that he'll grow up with @KamalaHarris as the VP! #WomenInLeadership\" she wrote to Twitter.\n Johnson said it's important for her to raise a son who sees strong women in leadership, especially strong women of color in leadership. \"I think it makes all of us better and our country better, \"she said.\n Dr. Rachelle Winkle-Wagner held her daughters close as they watched with excited grins. \"One of my top parenting moments was today -- seeing Kamala Harris being sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor with my two daughters,\" she wrote in a post to Twitter.\n Winkle-Wagner told CNN the moment allowed her to feel connected to generations of women from all backgrounds who fought for women's rights. Her oldest daughter, Eleanor, said seeing Harris take the oath of office was the moment she knew that she could run for president.\n \"Watching #inaugurationday playing with my brown US citizen son has been truly special #kamalaharris\" wrote Gunjan Manocha, a first-generation immigrant from India, who is raising her son with her husband in the US.\n \"Today's ceremony gives people like us hope,\" she told CNN. \"People with daughters, people with son's of color, people raising their kids to be better decent human beings.\"\n Adina Davidson's daughter, Aaliyah, watched closely as Harris was sworn in. \"Madam Vice Present. We see you,\" she wrote in a post to Instagram.\n \"As a mother it meant that my daughter would not just hear me tell her she can be anything she wants to, if she puts her mind to it,\" Davidson told CNN. \"She will actually be able to see it for herself.\"",

        "body_text": "Some Peruvian medics are going on hunger strike to demand more funding as cases of Covid-19 spiral in the country, according to a statement from Peru's Social Security National Medical Union (SINAMMSOP) published Wednesday.\n The health workers began their hunger strike Tuesday in front of Peru's Ministry of Labor in capital city Lima. About a dozen medics from the national social security union have been taking part in protests there as the health system struggles to cope with a second wave of Covid-19.\n \"We have begun a hunger strike,\" said Teodoro Quinones, a doctor taking part in the protest, according to Reuters.\n Quinones said the strike would last until Peru's Labor Minister removes the head of the country's Health Social Security, Fiorella Molinelli, who oversees government efforts to set up temporary health and isolation centers for Covid-19 patients.\n As of Thursday, Molinelli, has not commented on the union's demands.\n The protesters have been sharply critical of the government's approach to the pandemic, and are asking for increased investment in the health sector.\n \"Our ICUs are collapsing and we are not receiving any response and we are seeing the indifference of a government that assigns us the budget,\" Peruvian nurse Ketty Solier told Reuters Tuesday.\n \"We urgently need to acquire this equipment to prevent more Peruvians from dying. The Peruvian state has a constitutional obligation to guarantee the accessibility of health services and right now they are denying access to hospitals because we no longer have the capacity to provide patients with what they need so much,\" she added.\n \"People are infected, there are no ICU beds, soon there will be no more hospitalization. Again we are going to see people dying in the streets. About the vaccine, we have no hope for the vaccine, we do not know when it will arrive,\" Ronald Casta\u00f1eda, a relative of a Covid-19 patient, told Reuters.\n ICU occupancy rates are at 90% in some parts of Peru, according to Pan American Health Organization Director Carissa Etienne, who described struggling health systems throughout Latin America at a virtual press conference on Tuesday.\n The hunger strike is just one of many protests by Peru's medics and health workers in recent days, as a second wave of Covid-19 engulfs the population. The country has recorded more than one million total cases and more than 39,000 Covid-19 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU.)\n \"We are starting on a second wave [of Covid-19 cases]. This wave is rising. I can tell you that we've made some calculations and we are more or less right were we were in mid-April, and the figures keep ascending,\" Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti told local media Monday.\n On Tuesday, Peru's interim President Francisco Sagasti approved a decree to finance the set-up of more than 16 temporary isolation centers across the country and to hire additional staff to expand health services, according to a Tuesday press note from the Ministry of Health.\n Sagasti became president in November 2020, becoming the third president to be sworn in in just over a week as the country struggled with political turmoil amid the pandemic.\n CNN's Tatiana Arias reported from Atlanta, Zamira Rahim wrote from London",

You can sign up right here.\nStocks have reached records on hopes that stimulus spending and vaccination programs will trigger a recovery in corporate earnings later this year. But for companies like United Airlines (UAL), the situation is only becoming more dire.\n What's happening: The airline told investors after markets closed on Wednesday that its losses are mounting and emphasized plans to keep cutting costs. Shares are down more than 2% in premarket trading.\n Such news is in sharp contrast to the view from the broader market. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both hit all-time highs on Wednesday as tech stocks continued their ascent.\n Of particular note was Netflix (NFLX), whose shares rallied nearly 17% on Wednesday after the company said it had passed 200 million subscribers as people stayed home during the pandemic. It's considering using extra cash to fund stock buybacks.\n \"After internet access, Netflix may be the most important subscription we have at home,\" Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said in a research note Thursday.\n United, meanwhile, is struggling just to make it to the other side of the crisis, which has triggered a plunge in demand for flights. The company has borrowed billions of dollars to keep funding its operations, but still burned through an average of $33 million per day last quarter. It doesn't expect its profit margins to exceed 2019 levels until 2023.\n Investor insight: While Netflix shares have rallied 73% over the past year, United Airlines' stock is down 47%.\n Such divergence is a reminder that a huge gap still exists between those that can take part in the pandemic economy and the companies still stuck on the sidelines as vaccination efforts ramp up.\n Plus, while the US economy may experience rapid growth in the second half of 2021, any boom won't be felt evenly across sectors.\n \"Admittedly, analysts' forecasts for earnings in sectors that have benefited from the restrictions to activity during the pandemic, like communication services, health care and information technology, are quite upbeat,\" Simona Gambarini of Capital Economics told clients this week. \"But the earnings of firms in sectors like real estate, energy and financials, which have been hit really hard by the crisis, are still expected by analysts to be much lower on average in 2021 than in 2019.\"\n Businesses are welcoming President Joe Biden's swift moves to reassert America's commitment to global alliances and his plan to prioritize immigration reform.\n The latest: Part of a raft of executive actions, Biden reversed several of Trump's attempts to withdraw from international agreements shortly after he was sworn in. He began the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halted the United States' departure from the World Health Organization.\n \"Business Roundtable strongly supports the US rejoining the international effort to combat climate change and create a healthier, more sustainable future,\" the powerful lobby said in a statement.\n Big picture: Many businesses worried that America's disengagement during the Trump era meant they'd have less of a voice when setting policy, while the direction of travel in many other advanced economies was clear.\n The US Chamber of Commerce also applauded the climate move and said it was \"encouraged\" by Biden's commitment to fixing the nation's immigration system. He intends to provide a multi-year pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.\n There's already tension on other fronts, however. Companies are extremely apprehensive about an increase in corporate taxes and regulation, which Biden pledged on the campaign trail. Business groups also criticized Biden's decision to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline permit.\n \"It will harm consumers and put thousands of Americans in the building trades out of work,\" the US Chamber of Commerce said in a separate statement.\n Biden is now president of the United States, and Democrats have gained control of the Senate along with the House. My CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica asks: Does that mean it's finally the time for Congress to pass a big, bold infrastructure spending bill that can help boost the economy?\n There were high hopes for movement on infrastructure over the past four years. Ultimately, not much happened \u2014 save for extending funding for the Obama-era Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act for an additional year when it was set to expire in September 2020. The money for the program now runs out at the end of September.\n More will be needed, and some experts say it is doable even in a politically fractured environment.\n \"With the slim majority the Democrats have in the Senate, infrastructure spending is probably going to be one of the less controversial measures and could be implemented,\" said Gautam Khanna, senior portfolio manager with Insight Investment. \"A $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion package \u2014 somewhere in that zone \u2014 could get through.\"\n Investor insight: Some of that optimism is already reflected in markets. The iShares US Infrastructure ETF, which tracks companies that would benefit from greater infrastructure spending, has jumped 17% since the November election. The S&P 500 is up 14% over the same period.\n Fifth Third (FITB), Signature Bank (SBNY) and Truist (TFC) report results before US markets open. IBM (IBM) and Intel (INTC) follow after the close.\n Also today:\n The European Central Bank announces its latest policy decision at 7:45 a.m. ET.First-time claims for US unemployment benefits last week post at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect another 910,000, a sign of labor market weakness. US housing starts and building permit data also arrive at 8:30 a.m. ET.",

        "title": "Biden inherits a raft of global crises (including some unknowns)",
        "body_text": "US President Joe Biden's foreign policy to-do list is long, complicated, and may soon hit speed bumps left by his predecessor.\n In the past four years, tensions with China and Iran have grown, Russia has gone rogue, North Korea has become a greater nuclear threat and relationships with allies have been damaged. But perhaps the biggest impediment to Biden is that much of the previous president's overseas dealings were shrouded in secrecy.\n At his inauguration, Biden's message to allies -- and by implication to America's enemies too -- was simple: \"to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we've come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.\"\n But engagement won't be easy, as his picks for top administration jobs revealed during confirmation hearings the day before. Biden's predecessor was unorthodox in the extreme, meeting with enemies like Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un one-on-one, leaving many in his administration and the world wondering what he'd agreed to.\n Antony Blinken, Biden's choice for Secretary of State, told a Senate hearing several times that the new administration doesn't know the scale of the problems they are inheriting.\n In Afghanistan, where a US troop drawdown continues, based on the previous administration's agreement with the Taliban, Biden's team has yet to be made aware of the full details concerning the deal.\n Blinken told his Senate confirmation hearing, \"we have to look carefully at what has actually been negotiated ... to understand fully what commitments were made, or not made by the Taliban.\"\n Several Afghan officials, speaking in the past year on the basis of anonymity to protect their government's relationship with the previous administration, said they were opposed to the US-Taliban deal because it endangered Afghans, and want Biden to end it.\n Saudi Arabia, another US ally, also presents Biden with challenges.\n Blinken told senators the administration's priority would be discovering the extent of America's involvement in Saudi's war in Yemen \"first and foremost, making sure we understand exactly what support we're actually currently providing.\"\n Relations with Saudi, a particularly close ally of the last administration, could get rocky. Blinken told the hearing, \"we will end our support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen,\" though he also hinted they might be prepared to find a degree of compromise, saying, \"we need to do to help defend Saudi Arabia against aggression directed at Saudi Arabia, including from Yemen.\"\n Perhaps where the bilateral relationship risks greatest damage is over the lingering fallout from the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 at the hands of a hit team sent from Riyadh.\n Biden's new Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, said she would release an unclassified report into Khashoggi's murder to Congress, telling senators, \"absolutely I will follow the law.\"\n Relations with close ally Israel won't be straightforward either following the last administration's tight embrace. Biden will keep the US embassy in Jerusalem, but according to Blinken will reset to the traditional US policy of pushing for a \"two-state solution\" saying, \"the challenge of course is how to move forward.\"\n But it is America's enemies, according to Blinken, that will take priority, with Russia being \"very high on the agenda.\"\n In a break with many in the last administration, Blinken openly criticized Russia's President over the arrest of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. \"It is extraordinary how frightened Vladimir Putin seems to be of one man,\" he said, adding that the challenge posed by Russia \"is urgent.\"\n It is China, however, that poses the biggest test to US power, according to Blinken, who said \"there is no doubt that it poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the United States.\"\n Biden's pick for Secretary of Defense, retired General Lloyd Austin, said the same during his hearing: \"Asia must be the focus of our efforts and I see China in particular as a pacing challenge for the department.\"\n Evidence of that came shortly after Biden was sworn in, with Beijing imposing sanctions on 28 former members of the previous US administration, accusing them of \"a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs.\"\n The move followed a series of final moves by the outgoing White House targeting China, including sanctions aimed at officials and a declaration on its final day that the Chinese government had committed genocide against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups in its western region of Xinjiang.\n When Blinken was asked by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham if he agreed with his predecessor that the Chinese Communist Party had \"engaged in genocide regarding the Uyghur Muslim population,\" Blinken said \"yes.\"\n However, Beijing has also appeared to indicate it is willing to cooperate with Biden's new administration. At a regular press briefing Wednesday, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry asked Biden to look at China rationally and objectively, meet China halfway and, in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, push China-US relations back towards the right track of healthy and stable development as soon as possible.\n Biden's answer has already begun, signing executive orders, including re-joining the Paris climate change accord his predecessor withdrew from, and in so doing, according to Blinken, mustering vital support from allies that will provide a \"source of strength for us in dealing with China.\"\n The early signs for Biden are good, and the outpouring of support from allies has been strong.\n European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking for almost half a billion European Union citizens, said Wednesday:  \"This new dawn in America is the moment we've been waiting for so long. Europe is ready for a new start with our oldest and most trusted partner.\"\n Atop the EU's priorities is getting Biden to reverse the previous administration's course on Iran and rejoin the 2015 multinational nuclear deal. According to Blinken, that could be possible \"if Iran comes back into compliance. We would too.\"\n A question possibly emerging now is who jumps first. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that \"the ball is in the US court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact.\"\n Jen Psaki, Biden's communications director, told reporters in the administration's first news briefing that Biden wants to \"lengthen and strengthen the nuclear constraints on Iran and address other issues,\" all of which Iran has previously rejected.\n Iran's foreign minister said Biden's predecessor had been \"relegated to the dustbin of history in disgrace,\" adding, \"Perhaps new folks in DC have learned.\"\n In the meantime, Iran continues increasing its illegal stockpiles of low and medium enriched uranium, as well as making prohibited uranium metal shortening its path to a nuclear bomb.\n At his hearing, General Austin testified, \"If Iran were ever to get a nuclear capability, most every problem that we deal with in the region would be tougher to deal with because of that.\"\n President Biden has indeed inherited a plate full of pressing foreign policy problems. If he plays them right, America's allies will help, and the world can get a little safer.",

        "title": "Congress approves waiver for Biden defense secretary pick Lloyd Austin",
        "body_text": "Both chambers of Congress on Thursday approved a waiver to permit retired Gen. Lloyd Austin to serve as secretary of defense in the Biden administration.\n Austin, who would be the first African American to run the department, had to be granted a waiver from a law requiring a defense secretary to wait seven years after active-duty service before taking the job. The House passed the waiver Thursday afternoon, followed by Senate approval of the measure.\n Ahead of the vote, Austin, who retired in 2016, had been reaching out to top House and Senate lawmakers who would need to agree to pass legislation to grant the waiver, something approved only twice before in history, including for James Mattis to run President Donald Trump's Pentagon in 2017.\n President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary must, in effect, to win two votes: one from both chambers of Congress to grant the waiver and another from the Senate to confirm him for the position, and Thursday's votes to green-light the waiver mark the first step in that process.\n Congressional Democratic leaders are trying to move swiftly to confirm Cabinet members and other key officials following Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.\n To win confirmation, Austin must overcome objections from some lawmakers to allowing a recently retired general to assume the top civilian post at the Pentagon.\n He addressed those concerns directly at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, saying, \"If confirmed, I will carry out the mission of the Department of Defense, always with the goal to deter war and ensure our nation's security, and I will uphold the principle of civilian control of the military, as intended.\"\n \"I understand and respect the reservations some of you have expressed about having another recently retired general at the head of the Department of Defense,\" he said at the hearing. \"The safety and security of our democracy demands competent civilian control of our armed forces, the subordination of military power to the civil.\"\n Rep. Adam Smith, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said on Monday that he had sent a letter to House Democrats urging them to vote in support of a waiver for the nomination.\n \"I have no doubt that civilian control of the military will be completely upheld by Secretary-designate Austin when he is our Secretary of Defense,\" the Washington state Democrat tweeted.\n \"I also strongly believe it is critically important that Secretary-designate Austin be confirmed as quickly as possible after President-elect Biden becomes President on January 20th,\" he said.\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.\n CNN's Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Annie Grayer and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

Thank you so much to everyone for supporting me and my words. As Yeats put it: \"For words alone are certain good: Sing, then,\" she wrote on Twitter Wednesday evening.\n Gorman, 22, is the writer of \"The Hill We Climb: Poems,\" and \"Change Sings: A Children's Anthem.\" The titles are currently topping both Barnes & Noble and Amazon's best sellers lists. The poem Gorman No. 1 on Amazon's list.\n The poet is joined by two other notable Black authors near the top of Amazon's list: Meena Harris, Vice President Kamala Harris' niece, takes the third spot with a children's book titled, \"Ambitious Girl\" followed by \"A Promised Land,\" Former President Barack Obama's memoir. Born and raised in Los Angeles by a single-mother and sixth-grade English teacher, Gorman started writing poems when she was a child, but found performing terrifying due to a speech impediment.\n She overcame that fear by drawing confidence from former President Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr., and practicing songs from the Broadway musical \"Hamilton.\"\n From celebrities to politicians, Gorman's words resonated with many and praise on social media was not in short supply.\n \"Wasn't @TheAmandaGorman's poem just stunning?\" She's promised to run for president in 2036 and I for one can't wait,\" Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter.\n \"I have never been prouder to see another young woman rise! Brava Brava, @TheAmandaGorman! Maya Angelou is cheering and so am I,\" Oprah Winfrey said on Twitter. Winfrey gave Gorman a ring in the shape of a caged bird from New York-based brand Of Rare Origin (a tribute to African American poet Maya Angelou) and a pair of gold hoop earrings from Greek designer Nikos Koulis.\n CNN's Chandelis Duster and Allyssia Alleyne contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "California health officials have given providers the all-clear to \"immediately\" resume administering the Moderna vaccine from a specific lot after pausing earlier this week due to possible allergic reactions.\n The state's health department previously said it was aware of fewer than 10 people who received shots from the lot and required medical attention.\n \"Out of an abundance of caution, we recommended that providers pause the distribution of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine lot 41L20A on Sunday evening. Yesterday, we convened the Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup and additional allergy and immunology specialists to examine the evidence collected,\" state epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said in a statement Wednesday.\n Health experts found \"no scientific basis to continue the pause,\" Pan added.\n Moderna said earlier this week 37 different states got shipments from the lot, which included more than 1.2 million doses, adding that most had likely been used.\n More than 330,000 doses from the lot were distributed to 287 providers across California between January 5 and January 12. Tens of thousands of doses may have already been administered when the state's health officials made their initial announcement, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) previously said.\n But CDPH said Sunday fewer than 10 people at a San Diego clinic who received the Covid-19 vaccines from the lot required medical attention over the span of 24 hours. The state said it was not aware of anyone at any of the other 286 sites who had similar allergic reactions after receiving the vaccine from the lot.\n The latest findings, Pan said Wednesday, \"should continue to give Californians confidence that vaccines are safe and effective, and that the systems put in place to ensure vaccine safety are rigorous and science-based.\"\n \"Members of my family who have qualified to receive the vaccine as health care workers or because of their age have already received the COVID-19 vaccine, and I encourage every Californian to get the vaccine when it's their turn,\" Pan added.\n CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Evidence shows Capitol rioters brutally attacked police with flagpoles, fire extinguishers and fists",
        "body_text": "The unprecedented images spoke for themselves, but as prosecutors start filing criminal charges against pro-Trump rioters who attacked the US Capitol, new evidence is emerging of the horrifying scenes police officers faced while fighting for their lives that day.\n Body camera footage from DC police, testimony from law enforcement officers and social media posts from rioters all chronicled in federal court documents are painting a fuller picture of the hand-to-hand combat between law enforcement and supporters of former President Donald Trump during the violent insurrection that he incited on January 6.\n Officers were beaten with whatever the rioters had with them, according to court documents, including an American flag and a fire extinguisher. Scuffles near broken glass led to scrapes and bruises. Some rioters threw punches, while others hurled verbal insults at police.\n One US Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, was killed during the melee. More than 100 other police officers were injured, including members of the Capitol Police and Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department. At least 15 officers were hospitalized after the insurrection.\n Federal prosecutors have already charged dozens of people who allegedly participated in the riot, but the most serious charges have come against people involved in attacks against police. And the hundreds of pages of newly unsealed court documents are telling a horrifying story.\n One Texas resident who is facing charges allegedly incited the crowd before entering the Capitol through a broken window. He shouted into a bullhorn, \"If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon,\" and \"this is not a peaceful protest,\" according to court documents.\n Prosecutors say a retired Pennsylvania firefighter, Robert Sanford, 55, threw a fire extinguisher at a group of police officers on the Capitol's western terrace. The fire extinguisher struck three officers in the head, including one who was later sent to the hospital for medical evaluation.\n Sanford's lawyer did not respond to request for comment. He told the Associated Press that his client got \"caught up in the mob mentality.\"\n In another incident, Arkansas resident Peter Stager battered a DC officer with a flagpole that was holding an American flag, according to prosecutors. Court documents described a harrowing scene where the officer was dragged on the ground and surrounded by rioters. On Thursday, prosecutors unsealed charges against a Michigan man who was allegedly involved in the same assault and used a hockey stick to pummel the officer.\n Stager told an FBI tipster that he thought he was attacking a member of the violent left-wing group Antifa, even though photos from the scene clearly show the officer wearing a police vest. A lawyer for Stager declined to comment about the charges.\n Separately, another group of attackers surrounded one DC police officer and repeatedly tasered him in the neck, causing a heart attack. The officer, Michael Fanone, previously recalled to CNN that he begged the rioters to spare his life. \"I just remember yelling out that I have kids,\" he said.\n CNN previously reported that many US Capitol Police officers felt betrayed by their leadership, with officers left in previous positions throughout the attack, woefully unprepared and vastly outnumbered by the pro-Trump mob. Officers told CNN that they heard colleagues pleading for help, both for specific emergencies unfolding and for a big-picture plan to re-take the Capitol.\n Some participants in the riot were armed with bear spray and other weapons. Others simply meandered around the building and gawked at statues. But for the first time since the War of 1812, federal forces inside the Capitol found themselves engaged in hand-to-hand combat.\n One defendant, Mark Leffingwell of Seattle, was allegedly involved in a fistfight with police.\n \"Leffingwell attempted to push past me and other officers,\" US Capitol Police Officer Daniel Amendola wrote in a sworn affidavit one day after the insurrection. \"When he was deterred from advancing further into the building, Leffingwell punched me repeatedly with a closed fist.\"\n A lawyer for Leffingwell did not respond to a request for comment.\n Some scuffles got out of hand. While one officer tried to block rioters from entering the Capitol through a broken window, he fell to the ground, which was \"covered in shaards of glass,\" according to charging documents against a father and son that came to DC from Delaware.\n Another rioter warned police inside the Capitol that they should stand down if they didn't want to get hurt by the mob of Trump supporters that was approaching, according to court papers.\n Bodycam footage included in one criminal complaint showed the perspective of the police officers who were swarmed by dozens of rioters. According to the court documents, some of the rioters chanted \"f--- the police,\" even though many carried \"thin blue line\" flags, which are associated with groups that typically argue that law enforcement is unfairly attacked by liberals.\n One Black police officer previously told CNN that \"there was a lot of racism\" coming from the pro-Trump rioters, and that he was called racial slurs and epithets by some of the attackers",

        "body_text": "The formal dress and matching coat worn by first lady Jill Biden Wednesday night for inaugural festivities were designed with inspiration from new administration's message of unity, says the designer Gabriela Hearst.\n \"Unity makes strength, and it is needed for the road ahead,\" Hearst said in a statement.\n In his inaugural address, President Joe Biden repeatedly emphasized his commitment to bringing the country together in the wake of Donald Trump's divisive presidency.\n \"I've never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day. There isn't anything we can't do if we do it together,\" Biden said.\n Jill Biden's cashmere coat featured embroidered flowers representing every state and territory, each flower taking approximately two hours to apply. The coat also has an embroidered quote from Benjamin Franklin on the lining, an homage to Biden's career as a teacher: \"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.\"\n The dress under the coat also featured the embroidered state flowers, placed along the organza bodice and sleeves. The Delaware state flower -- the peach blossom -- was positioned purposefully above Biden's heart.\n The dress and coat were both made in New York City's garment district, using materials that included existing available fabrics \"to minimize the impact on the environment,\" said Hearst.\n The dress and coat will be donated at some point to the Smithsonian's First Ladies' Collection, as most every first lady inaugural gown has been for decades.\n Hearst's designs were often worn by Ivanka and Melania Trump over the last four years, even though Hearst was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's administration and policies. Both Trump women bought Hearst's clothing off the rack.\n \"She looks great in the clothes which were purchased directly from a retail partner. Unfortunately, her husband's political stands do not align with our core values and belief. I am a woman and I am an immigrant,\" Hearst said when asked at the time about how she felt about Melania Trump wearing her designs.\n In 2017, Hearst revealed a collection inspired by Kamala Harris and Tammy Duckworth and other female politicians.\n Hearst is originally from Uruguay.",

        "title": "Florida issues new Covid-19 vaccine residency rules to cut down on 'vaccine tourism'",
        "body_text": "Florida issued new health guidelines Thursday in an attempt to cut down on \"vaccine tourism,\" requiring that Covid-19 vaccines be given only to permanent and seasonal residents.\n State Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees signed a Public Health Advisory prioritizing Florida residents for the vaccines, days after Gov. Ron DeSantis said publicly that the shots should be reserved for part-time or full-time residents of the Sunshine State.\n \"We're only doing (shots) for Florida residents,\" DeSantis said Tuesday in Cape Coral. \"You've got to live here either full-time or at least part-time.\"\n At another news conference in Rockledge on Tuesday, DeSantis differentiated between \"snowbirds,\" who live in Florida in winter months, and those just stopping in to try to get vaccinated.\n \"Now we do have part-time residents who are here all winter,\" he said. \"They go to doctors here or whatever, that's fine. What we don't want is tourists, foreigners. We want to put seniors first, but we obviously want to put people that live here first in line.\"\n As of January 19, Florida has vaccinated more than 39,000 people who reside out-of-state, including over 1,000 who have received the recommended two doses, according to data from the Florida Department of Health. That's about 3.5% of the 1.12 million people who have been vaccinated in Florida. The state's data does not differentiate between tourists and part-time residents.\n The revelations sparked frustration among Floridians unable to get vaccinated, forced to wait in hours-long lines or stymied by confusing or flailing websites.\n But the issue is not specific to Florida. Vaccine tourism is the result of a few key factors: the shortage of vaccine compared to demand; the disorganized start to administering the shots; and the lack of consistent federal guidance, which has created different vaccine availability between states and even between counties.\n Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said vaccine tourism highlighted the failures of the slow-moving federal vaccine rollout.\n \"If we're still in this situation a month from now, we're going to be in a lot of trouble,\" he said.\n Florida had allowed anyone 65 and older to get vaccinated, regardless of where they live, making it one of the first states to open to that age group.\n In contrast, many other US states have residency requirements and instruct people to bring ID, mail, or rent statements to prove it. A number of states have also hewed closer to the CDC vaccine committee's recommended Phase 1b guidelines that say vaccines should go to adults age 75 and up and frontline essential workers.\n Naturally, people desperate for the vaccine, able to travel and lucky enough to get a vaccine appointment on finicky websites or hotlines, have gone far and wide to get them.\n Mark and Connie Wallace, who live in Shelby County, Alabama, told CNN affiliate WBMA they drove almost two hours into Georgia to get vaccinated at a Publix pharmacy.\n \"They knew that we were coming from out of state and they said that that was fine,\" Connie Wallace said, \"so we didn't feel like we were pushing anybody else out, which we didn't want to do.\"\n Connie is 68 and has underlying health issues related to her heart, WBMA reported. The couple managed to get a vaccine appointment online and so ventured to Carrollton, Georgia, to get inoculated.\n \"I would have gone eight hours away if I had to,\" Mark Wallace told WBMA.\n Similar interstate vaccinations have been seen at major metropolitan areas that cross borders.\n New York City has vaccinated health care workers or other essential workers like teachers or firefighters who work in the city but live outside the five boroughs. According to NYC data, about 73% of those NYC has vaccinated live in the city, 15% live in another part of New York state, and the rest live in New Jersey, Connecticut, or another state or did not provide their residence.\n Because the federal government allots vaccine based on population, this has created an uneven rollout.\n Two weeks ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence asking him to allocate more doses to \"New York City and other commuter jurisdictions who are vaccinating more than their residents.\"\n Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said he recognized that a New Yorker might be frustrated to see a commuter from New Jersey crossing state lines to get vaccinated.\n But as long as the vaccine is being used rather than sitting untouched, it's not a problem from a public health perspective.\n \"Rather than 'it's my vaccine, not yours,' (getting) vaccine in arms is what we want,\" he said. \"I would hope we quickly have enough vaccine so we don't have to belabor these somewhat petty issues.\"\n The end-goal is to vaccinate enough Americans to reach herd immunity, generally estimated to be around 70 to 80% of people. Schaffner indicated that the high demand for the coronavirus vaccine is essentially a good problem to have at this point.\n \"There are people who are eager to get the vaccine -- boy, that's a good thing,\" he said. \"So let's not ding their resourcefulness and imagination.\"\n Hotez said he didn't see vaccine tourism as a moral issue, but he emphasized that traveling during the pandemic has its own risks. And he noted that every state is similarly struggling to administer enough vaccines because of the federal problems.\n \"Vaccine tourists are most likely setting themselves up for disappointments,\" he said.\n CNN's Maria Cartaya contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden inheriting nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan and must start 'from scratch,' sources say",
        "body_text": "Newly sworn in President Joe Biden and his advisers are inheriting no coronavirus vaccine distribution plan to speak of from the Trump administration, sources tell CNN, posing a significant challenge for the new White House.\n The Biden administration has promised to try to turn the Covid-19 pandemic around and drastically speed up the pace of vaccinating Americans against the virus. But in the immediate hours following Biden being sworn into office on Wednesday, sources with direct knowledge of the new administration's Covid-related work told CNN one of the biggest shocks that the Biden team had to digest during the transition period was what they saw as a complete lack of a vaccine distribution strategy under former President Donald Trump, even weeks after multiple vaccines were approved for use in the United States.\n \"There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,\" one source said.\n Another source described the moment that it became clear the Biden administration would have to essentially start from \"square one\" because there simply was no plan as: \"Wow, just further affirmation of complete incompetence.\"\n The incoming White House now faces intense pressure to make good on the promises that Biden made during the campaign and the transition phase to drastically turn things around on the pandemic and conduct himself entirely differently from Trump when it comes to the virus and vaccine distribution. During the transition period, Biden was openly critical of what he described as a \"dismal\" rollout of the Covid vaccines under the Trump administration, making clear that he placed significant blame on his predecessor for the situation he would ultimately inherit.\n Two Covid-19 vaccines were approved for use in the United States before Trump left office. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 16.5 million vaccine doses had been administered as of January 20 -- far short of the last administration's goal of administering 20 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020.\n The new administration has asked some of the key players who worked on Covid and vaccines under Trump to resign from their roles, including Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Moncef Slaoui and Surgeon General Jerome Adams. It has kept on others such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is now serving as Biden's chief medical adviser on Covid-19. Adams was asked to stay on as an adviser.\n In a White House press briefing Thursday afternoon, Fauci rejected the suggestion that the Biden administration would have to build a distribution plan from \"scratch.\"\n \"We're certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,\" Fauci said, adding that the Biden administration is \"amplifying\" in significant ways existing vaccine distribution efforts.\n \"I mean we're coming in with fresh ideas, but also some ideas with ... the previous administration. You can't say it was absolutely not usable at all,\" Fauci said.\n Prior to Inauguration Day, some of Biden's Covid-19 advisers had wanted to be careful not to be overly critical in public of the Trump administration's handling of the virus and vaccine, given that the Biden transition team was already having a hard time getting critical information and cooperation from the outgoing administration, a source said.\n Now that the transition of power has taken place, the Biden administration is hoping that they can quickly start to get a clearer picture of where things actually stand with vaccine distribution and administration across the country, going through something of a \"fact-checking\" exercise on what exactly the Trump administration had and had not done, they added.\n CNN has previously reported that the Biden team's most urgent concerns on Covid-19 include potential vaccine supply problems, coordination between federal and local governments, as well as funding, staffing and other resource needs for local governments. That is in addition to the emerging Covid variants, which the new White House -- in consultation with scientists and experts -- is watching warily.\n Biden has made clear that slowing down the spread of Covid-19 and getting 100 million vaccine shots into Americans' arms in his first 100 days in office are of utmost priority -- goals that will shape whether Biden's first years in office are ultimately deemed successful.\n Within hours of being sworn into office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on all federal property, a part of his campaign promise to push for a federal mask mandate during his first 100 days in office.\n \"This is going to be the first of many engagements we're going to have in here,\" Biden said in his first appearance in the Oval Office as president. \"I thought with the state of the nation today there's no time to waste. Get to work immediately.\"\n On Biden's first full day in office on Thursday, the White House is focusing on Covid-19 by rolling out a national strategy for getting the pandemic under control including numerous executive actions related to vaccination and testing.\n Criticizing the \"lack of cooperation\" from the Trump administration as an \"impediment\" for the new administration, White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters on Wednesday that he was still confident that the administration can meet its 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days target.\n \"For almost a year now, Americans could not look to the federal government for any strategy, let alone a comprehensive approach to respond to Covid,\" Zients said. \"And we've seen the tragic costs of that failure. As President Biden steps into office today ... that'll change tomorrow.\"\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

        "title": "Biden White House press secretary pledges to share 'accurate information with the American people'",
        "body_text": "\"Let's do this again tomorrow,\" President Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki said at the close of her first White House press briefing on Wednesday, and many Americans, regardless of political bent, profession, state, or identity, said: Yes please.\n Others were more than happy to tune out the news about the new administration -- and that was a welcome change too. During the Trump years, many people felt that his antics were impossible to ignore.\n For all the talk about, and appeals to, Trump fans who wanted to watch the press corps bullied and bashed, most Americans don't want that. They never did. Most Americans want to know what is real and true so that they can make the best decisions for their families. That's what Psaki is promising to provide -- reliable, regular info -- and that's what the press will insist on.\n Biden's first day, and Psaki's first day, sent a message that functional government is back. Psaki confirmed that she will hold daily briefings. She told the reporters in the room that she will butt heads with them sometimes -- we \"will disagree,\" of course -- but that's okay because \"we have a common goal, which is sharing accurate information with the American people.\"\n During the press briefing, CNN's Jim Sciutto tweeted, \"Here's the thing: this is the norm. Taking questions. Answering questions. Not attacking journalists as enemies of the people. Sometimes battling. Always challenging. A functioning relationship between our government and the media.\"\n \"Functioning\" is a good thing, despite what MAGA media talking heads may claim. \"Functioning\" is nonpartisan. \"Functioning\" means a steady stream of informative press releases from the White House. \"Functioning\" means actual information about the president's calls rather than bland claims about how he's making \"many calls.\" Many Republicans knew that Trump's anti-media attacks were damaging, and they cringed when his White House was consumed by his own narcissism. They knew that the country deserved better.\n \"It's just mesmerizing to watch a functional government doing functional government-type things,\" Van Jones said after the briefing. \"There was a press conference and there was a human, and that person said words, and the words made sense, and somebody asked a question, and that person answered.\"\n The Presidential Inaugural Committee pulled off a flawless series of performances on Wednesday. From Garth Brooks to Amanda Gorman... from Tom Hanks to Sarah Fuller... the day was \"as exquisitely choreographed as a Balanchine ballet,\" as the WaPo theater critic Peter Marks wrote. Of the inaugural ceremony, he wrote, \"it all came across as tone-perfect.\"\n \"This was not just a transfer of power, it was a profound change of attitude,\" David Axelrod said on CNN after the fireworks show.\n Anderson Cooper summed up the entire day this way: \"They acknowledged the pain but they also embraced the promise. They acknowledged the grief but they also embraced the greatness of America. And the two can exist at the same time -- the pain and the promise.\"\n During his inaugural speech, Biden vowed to defend the truth and said the country must come together to \"defeat the lies.\" At Psaki's briefing, Peter Alexander followed up on this, asking for specifics. \"The battle for truth may be as tough a fight right now as is the battle against coronavirus,\" he said. \"How do you and President Biden plan to combat disinformation that in many ways led to that assault we witnessed two weeks ago today on the Capitol?' Psaki said \"there are a number of ways\" to do so, adding that one method is to provide 'accurate information' and data to the public...\n It's too early to know. Yahoo WH correspondent Hunter Walker observed: \"Biden's staff seems to be very eager to avoid the freewheeling, loud Oval Office sprays that were part of Trump's press strategy... Before he disappeared post-election, Trump spoke directly with the press in scrums and sprays far more often than his predecessors. I suspect Biden's team is looking to return to a more traditional engagement, but I imagine it will be hard getting that genie back in the bottle...\"\n \"A rational, experienced president is going to be very, very boring,\" former WH chief of staff Leon Panetta told John Dickerson. Writing for The Atlantic, Dickerson said that \"a president who tries to fit this mold might not keep the country riveted, but he will be effective.\" Three other key lines from his column:\n -- \"The great battle of our time is the fight between reality and fantasy.\"\n -- \"Even the most exquisitely boring president will not be able to use facts, briefings, and patient explanations to fully overcome the incentives of politics and partisan media.\" But \"if a president is ever to build bridges to the other party, it will not be through insults and baseless assertions that must be taken on faith.\"\n -- \"Sometimes, by staying out of the way, a president can create space for our attention to turn elsewhere.\"",

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 21 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nUS President Joe Biden assumed office yesterday, tearing up his predecessor's legacy as he made the pandemic his priority.\n After being sworn in as President, Biden referred to Covid-19 as a \"once in a century virus that silently stalks the country,\" during his inauguration speech. \"We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities,\" he added, as an ensemble forecast by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projected 100,000 more deaths in the next few weeks.\n Biden's urgency to turn the pandemic around took form later that day as he signed a series of executive orders that halted the Trump administration's withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO); restored the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense (an office gutted by the Trump administration); and mandated masks on federal property.\n Regular White House press briefings made a comeback after ending in April when Trump suggested injecting disinfectant could be a cure for coronavirus (it's not, don't do it). New press secretary Jen Psaki said yesterday \"truth and transparency\" had returned to the briefing room, and the White House will combat misinformation by giving accurate information to the American people \"even when it is hard to hear.\"\n She added that the White House will require daily Covid-19 testing, N95 masks for staffers, and stringent requirements on social distancing -- in a bid to model good pandemic behavior. The President \"has asked us also to be models to the American people,\" she said, in stark contrast to Trump and his administration, which largely ignored government mask and social distancing recommendations.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, who remains as chief medical adviser, represented the US during a virtual WHO meeting Thursday, where he thanked the health body for leading the global Covid-19 response. He also announced that the US will resume regular engagement with the organization and fulfill its financial obligations. Today will also see Biden address the crushing threat of the pandemic, signing more orders focused on getting the pandemic under control.\n \"Healthier days lie ahead,\" the new CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, promised in her first statement, but getting there will require a rapid acceleration of Covid-19 testing, surveillance and vaccination. \"We must also confront the longstanding public health challenges of social and racial injustice and inequity that have demanded action for far too long,\" she said.\n Wednesday's numbers mark a significant increase in the share of doses administered out of the total distributed. Previously that share had stayed below 40%. However, a note on the CDC's Covid Data Tracker site indicates that the agency is \"refining how the number of doses distributed is reported,\" which could affect this calculation.\n The US vaccine rollout has not been smooth, with the nation lagging behind several other countries in its Covid-19 vaccination efforts, according to a recent CNN analysis of government data. Sources with direct knowledge of the new administration's Covid-related work told CNN one of the biggest shocks that the Biden team had to digest during the transition period was what they saw as a complete lack of a vaccine distribution strategy under Trump, even weeks after multiple vaccines were approved for use in the United States.\n Send your questions here.

Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415.\n New research out this week provides reassuring evidence that people vaccinated against coronavirus are protected against emerging new variants. Two teams tested two of the new variants against blood taken from people who had received the full two-course dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer vaccine, Maggie Fox reports.\n While the mutations in the new variants of the virus -- one first seen in Britain, and another first identified in South Africa -- did allow them to evade some of the immunity induced by vaccination, it was far from a complete escape, the two teams reported separately.\n China's National Health Commission has announced a series of domestic travel restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 as the country prepares for mass movement of people to celebrate Lunar New Year. Millions of Chinese migrant workers who plan to travel back to the countryside are now required to present a negative Covid test result from within seven days of departure. People from medium- or high-risk areas are being discouraged from traveling altogether.\n This comes as Chinese officials reported 144 new Covid-19 cases across the country on Wednesday, including 18 imported infections. All residents in Beijing's Daxing district have been banned from leaving since Wednesday due to the rising numbers of cases.\n California health officials have given providers the all-clear to \"immediately\" resume administering the Moderna vaccine from a specific lot after pausing earlier this week due to possible allergic reactions. It comes as most coronavirus metrics improve in the state, which has been the epicenter of the virus in the US. But the severity of cases in the state and the death toll remain high.\n California added 22,403 new cases Wednesday, which is well below the average daily number for the state of around 38,000, but also reported 694 new Covid-19-related deaths Wednesday -- the second-highest single-day toll to date. And with a limited supply of coronavirus vaccine, state epidemiologist Erica Pan said it may take four to five months to get all Californians over the age of 65 vaccinated.\n Zimbabwean foreign minister Sibusiso Moyo -- known for going on state television in 2017 to announce the military's takeover of power from the late president Robert Mugabe -- died after catching Covid. Amazon wasted no time in reaching out to newly installed US President Joe Biden about prioritizing its essential workers in his administration's vaccine distribution plans.

It's probably due to the pandemic.\n Anosmia -- a condition known as \"smell blindness,\" or loss of smell -- is a common symptom of Covid-19 (and other viruses), and can severely affect ability to taste, since the senses are intertwined. And while most people regain their sense of smell or taste within days to weeks, experts say some may not regain their sense of smell after months.\n For instance, Kaya Cheshire is still missing 90% of her sense of smell since contracting a mild case of Covid-19 last July. At her doctor's suggestion, Cheshire recently began \"scent training,\" using strong-smelling things like rose, lemons, cloves, garlic, eucalyptus and menthols to retrain her brain.

        "body_text": "Someone is waking up happy this morning after a single winning ticket was announced for the $730 million Powerball jackpot. It's the fourth-largest prize in Powerball history. Wanna share?\n (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n Speeches of unity, social distancing and lots of fancy coats: President Joe Biden's inauguration had it all. Though without the typical crowds or the presence of the outgoing President (Donald Trump left for Florida before the pomp and circumstance), Biden's inauguration had all the hallmarks of the tradition. He and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in just before noon ET. Biden delivered an inaugural address promising to stand for all Americans, even those who don't like him. He and Harris then mingled with former presidential families and outgoing VP Mike Pence. They listened to patriotic performances by singers and a poet and participated in a wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery. Harris later swore in three new Democratic senators, including two from Georgia whose victories sealed the slight Democratic power advantage in the chamber. White House press secretary Jen Psaki laid out new expectations for the media, vowing transparency and honesty. Around the world, leaders welcomed the new Commander in Chief, with the European Commission President calling it a \"new dawn in America.\"\n Inauguration Day wasn't all ceremony, though. Once in office, Biden got straight to work undoing some of the Trump administration's most divisive policies. Biden moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change and halt construction on the southern border wall. Also on the immigration front, the Department of Homeland Security announced it is pausing deportations for 100 days, with some exceptions, as a kind of reset to help ensure policies are fairly and effectively enforced. In his first 100 days, Biden has pledged to, among other benchmarks, oversee the administration of at least 100 million Covid-19 vaccines, pass a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and further reform the immigration system. And the new President soon could reverse or amend other policies, especially related to immigration and racial justice.\n Just a few days after the US hit the devastating mark of 400,000 coronavirus deaths, the CDC predicts that another 100,000 fatalities will come by mid-February. However, the agency's new leader, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, says \"healthier days lie ahead.\" As one of his first actions in office, Biden installed a mask mandate on federal property and has encouraged states to follow suit. He also reversed former President Trump's decision to leave the World Health Organization. More positive vaccine news has arrived, too: Studies suggest vaccinated people are, in fact, protected from Covid-19 variants. Not so positive? The looming dangers of the Lunar New Year season in China. If you recall, that was one of the first large-scale challenges after the pandemic began, and China is instituting travel limits to prevent superspreader events.\n At least 43 people have died and another 10 were rescued after a boat carrying West African migrants capsized yesterday off the Libyan coast. The tragedy marks the first known migrant shipwreck of 2021. Hundreds of people lost their lives in such shipwrecks last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Central Mediterranean crossings such as this week's were the most deadly. The pandemic has only worsened the crisis, as more people are fleeing from economically devastated areas.\n Alexey Navalny, the staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin who was poisoned months ago and is now detained near Moscow, has released a large-scale investigation into the President's wealth. The report from Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation contains allegations of vast corruption schemes related to a sprawling palace they say belongs to Putin. The estate is estimated to be worth around $1.4 billion, and the report details convoluted and corrupt ways they say Putin has financed the property and his general wealth. A spokesperson for the Russian President says Putin does not own the property and called the allegations an \"old story.\"\n At least 28 people were killed and 73 others injured in an attack at a busy market, a security source at Iraqi Joint Operations Command told CNN.\u00a0It is the first attack of its kind in\u00a0Baghdad\u00a0in nearly two years, the source said.\n When you think about it, those are probably the most precious bootprints in the known universe.\n The VP's stepdaughter brought the sparkle ...\n ... and the former first lady brought the (sartorial) drama.\n Yeah, the whole isolation and crushing, multi-faceted cosmic stress will do that to ya.\n That's how many high-ranking Trump administration officials are the target of new sanctions from China. The Chinese government has accused the officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, of \"prejudice and hatred against China.\"\n \"The new dawn blooms as we free it\n For there is always light,\n if only we're brave enough to see it\n If only we're brave enough to be it\"\n This is an apfelregal (literally \"apple shelf\"), an organ-like instrument that gets its charming name -- and charming sound -- from the shape of its pipes.

        "title": "To save democracy, Joe Biden hopes to repair White House's relationship with the media",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden wants to restore America's faith in its democracy. He's starting by repairing the government's broken relationship with the press, the reporters of truth responsible for holding politicians accountable.\n Former President Donald Trump and his administration were at war with facts. In his routine effort to spread falsehoods big and small, Trump labeled the press as \"the enemy of the people,\" regularly riling up his supporters to attack the media, and avoiding facing the press at daily briefings \u2014 in one stretch, for nearly a year.\n In stark contrast, Biden made a concerted effort in his first moments in office to reset the White House's relationship with reporters. Biden referenced truth several times in his inaugural address Wednesday, and Press Secretary Jen Psaki held her first briefing just seven hours into the new presidency.\n \"We must reject the culture where facts themselves are manipulated \u2014 and even manufactured,\" Biden said in his inaugural speech.\n The urgency of a facts-first administration was made clear when an insurrectionist mob attacked the Capitol on January 6. Incited by the big lie about a stolen election that Trump and his supporters manufactured, rioters desecrated America's greatest symbol of democracy, leaving five dead in the siege's wake.\n \"Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson: There is truth and there are lies \u2014 lies told for power and for profit,\" Biden said in his address. \"And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders \u2014 leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation \u2014 to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.\"\n Biden's speech foreshadowed \"a serious attempt at a healthier relationship\" with the press, Riley Roberts, an Obama administration speechwriter, told CNN Business.\n Each of the Trump administration's four press secretaries declined to hold daily briefings for long stretches. His third press secretary,  Stephanie Grisham, held zero televised briefings, although she appeared regularly on Fox News.\n When they held briefings, Trump's press secretaries routinely berated the press, calling them \"fake news,\" claiming Trump was a victim of unfair reporting.\n To repair the White House's fractured relationship with the press, Psaki held a far more collegial and \"normal\" daily briefing Wednesday. She pledged to hold daily weekday briefings and to tell the truth.\n \"I have a deep respect for the role of a free and independent press,\" Psaki said, addressing the reporters in the room. \"We have a common goal, which is sharing accurate information with the American people.\"\n Although Psaki noted the media and the White House won't always agree, she and Biden acknowledged that dissent and holding politicians to account is the bedrock of American democracy.\n \"The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation's greatest strength,\" Biden said in his inaugural address.\n \"When Biden talks about the crisis in our democracy, he sees the press as one of those core institutions of democracy that has been harmed,\" Dylan Loewe, Biden's former speechwriter and Kamala Harris' memoir collaborator, said in an interview.\n The Biden administration wanted to make that clear from the jump, as well as signal a desire to shift the tenor of that relationship, PBS Newshour's White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor told CNN Business.\n \"After four years of a president who routinely lied and attacked reporters, it is clear [Biden and Psaki] are trying to rebuild trust,\" Alcindor said, adding that it is essential that journalists move forward and focus on truth, justice and transparency.\n Looking ahead at the future of journalism under the Biden administration, a well-informed press will lead to a well-informed public. And after enduring a tumultuous relationship with Biden's predecessor, it's crucial that journalists remain critical.\n The briefing room will likely feel less combative and more transparent, and the distribution of factual information will provide reporters with a stronger foundation to work from when they are producing stories and aiming to inform the public.\n \"We, as reporters, will be pushing for information, pressing for details and holding Biden accountable,\" Alcindor said, indicating that journalists will fact-check Biden the same way they fact-checked Trump.",

        "body_text": "Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \"Burning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\" Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nWednesday was certainly a day of celebration. After a month of turbulence, danger, and political instability, President Joe Biden was sworn into office. The transition of power happened. A new commander in chief, who is committed to the health of our democratic institutions, started his term.\n Many commentators breathed a sigh of relief. One of the most common refrains of the historic day was: \"the system worked.\" In his inaugural address, Biden himself proclaimed: \"democracy has prevailed.\"\n Of course, this is true. Donald Trump has left the White House. The violence that rocked Capitol Hill on January 6 was not repeated.\n But just because the constitutional system worked doesn't mean it was inevitable that this would happen. It didn't work so much as it survived. Indeed, what was extraordinary about the past few weeks was just how frail our constitutional system can be in an era of intense polarization and when one party has been radicalized. When a President and his party are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve and retain power, it's possible that the system we cherish won't function. Had Republicans controlled the House of Representatives or had the election been closer, it isn't hard to imagine how the effort to overturn the results might have been successful.\n Under tremendous stress, the system depended on individuals and organizations who took steps to rein in the chaos. There were of course the millions of voters and activists who mobilized over the years to make certain that Democrats and independents leaning their way turned out and enjoyed a sizable popular vote victory in 2020.\n Everyone understood that if the results looked like 2000, chaos would erupt. Were it not for the hard work of activists like Stacey Abrams and the New Georgia Project, for instance, Georgia wouldn't necessarily have turned blue. There were thousands of suburban women who have been doing the hard work of registering and canvassing at the local level since 2016 to make certain that a reckless commander in chief did not win reelection. Organizations such as Indivisible worked tirelessly throughout the election. With the pandemic threatening the ability of Americans to vote in person, it took a huge push by all of these groups and other volunteers to work the phone banks, send the texts and go online to make sure that everyone understood how to send in their vote.\n The system also wouldn't have worked had it not been for the judges ruling on challenges to voting in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania who rebuffed the administration's campaign to discredit legitimate votes based on false claims of voter fraud. The judges spanned those appointed by Democratic presidents to others appointed by Trump himself, none of whom were willing to move forward with his claims. Had any of them done so, the dominos could have fallen very quickly in a different direction.\n \"Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy,\" wrote Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, in the unanimous decision of the US Circuit Court of Appeals. \"Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\" Two other judges -- appointed by President George W. Bush -- signed onto the decision.\n There were election officials throughout the swing states who refused to be intimidated by the President. There was nothing inevitable about their doing so. Many faced serious threats from the pro-Trump mob for their refusal to overturn the election. \"It has to stop,\" Georgia Republican election official Gabriel Sterling said of the threats during a news conference in early December. \"Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language ... This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It's too much.\"\n We needed the talented reporters who worked within a chaotic media landscape to keep a clear eye on what was happening in the post-election period. There were numerous stories over the past month that kept hammering away at the falsehoods behind the President's claims, pushing back against allegations of massive fraud and showing through reality-based analysis what was real. More reporters and headline writers were willing to talk directly about what the Republicans were doing in honest terms, calling out lies for what they are.\n Members of Congress deserve credit for stepping back into the chambers to finish the certification process after having their lives threatened on January 6. Although some Republicans continued with their groundless election fraud rhetoric, many returned trembling to make sure that the mob did not win.\n The system also depended on leaders in the armed forces who publicly made clear that they served the country, not the President, and to everyone who made sure that Wednesday's events ran smoothly. Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman, who escorted Vice President Harris at the inauguration, heroically moved the rioters from where US senators were hiding during the electoral vote certification process.  Had the rallies and violence that took place on January 6 happened on Inauguration Day, the situation could have been perilous. But after the massive failures of the insurrection, this time all the authorities involved made sure that the events in Washington could proceed smoothly.\n These are perilous times, and we shouldn't try to move forward in order to magically heal. The problems exposed in our system are real. We can't always depend on people doing the right thing. That means we need our new leaders to spend time investigating what happened to make sure that stronger checks and balances are put into place to prevent any unhinged presidents from doing what Donald Trump did in future lame-duck periods. Otherwise, the outcome might be very different the next time around.\n This piece has been updated to note the role of Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman, who was honored at the Inauguration.",

        "body_text": "Questions have arisen over the constitutionality of former President Donald Trump's impending trial in the Senate. Trump is the first president to be impeached twice and would be the first ex-president to have his impeachment tried in the Senate while out of office.\n House Democrats are expected to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate soon but the timing remains unclear. Sources have told CNN it could be as early as Friday.\n Following Trump's most recent impeachment in the House, former US Circuit Court Judge J. Michael Luttig weighed in on some constitutional questions, writing on January 12 in the Washington Post that \"Congress loses its constitutional authority to continue impeachment proceedings against\" Trump after he leaves office because \"the Senate's only power under the Constitution is to convict \u2014 or not \u2014 an incumbent President.\"\n Since then, several Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst and Roger Marshall, have said they don't think it would be constitutional to convict Trump in the Senate after he's left office.\n Senate Democrat Richard Blumenthal called arguments questioning the constitutionality \"bogus\" saying that \"[T]here's nothing in the Constitution that prevents any federal officer from being tried after they're out of office.\"\n Under the Constitution, the House can impeach a President for \"treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Then the Senate holds a trial and needs a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the President from office. Another vote would be necessary to bar the then ex-President from holding office again, but this vote would require only a simple majority.\n The Constitution doesn't specifically address convicting an ex-President but simply says \"The President,\" VP and all civil officers \"shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n A January 15 Congressional Research Service report notes that while the Constitution \"does not directly address\" the issue, most scholars have concluded that Congress does have the authority to impeach and convict a former President.\n In op-eds for the Washington Post and the New York Times, respectively, Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe and CNN legal expert Steve Vladeck, argue that such a trial is constitutional in part because the Senate's role in an impeachment is defined by two separate judgments: one to remove and then subsequently another to disqualify.\n Tribe noted that even though a former officer such as the President can no longer be removed from office, that \"has no bearing on whether such an ex-officer may be barred permanently from office upon being convicted.\"\n And according to Vladeck, the Senate's power to disqualify an individual from future office is \"the primary evidence\" that trying the impeachment of a former officer is constitutional.\n \"Were it otherwise, an officer facing impeachment, or an officer who has already been impeached and is about to be removed, could also avoid disqualification simply by resigning,\" Vladeck wrote.\n Yale University law professor Akhil Reed Amar agreed, telling CNN's Joan Biskupic that \"It would be absurd if you could escape by resigning one step ahead of the gavel.\"\n Biskupic also reported that Tulane Law School professor Ross Garber, who asserts that the Senate may try only a sitting president, nonetheless said the 1993 precedent, in which Mississippi federal judge Walter Nixon unsuccessfully challenged Senate trial procedures in his impeachment case, would likely make it difficult for Trump to find a court that would hear his appeal.\n \"I think the reasoning of Nixon (case) could be a problem for any Trump litigation effort,\" Garber told CNN, adding that \"it is very unlikely the Supreme Court would stop the Senate in its tracks in a direct Trump challenge to its jurisdiction.\"\n In addition to the Nixon case, a Congressional Research Service report from November 2019 cites -- as precedent -- the 1876 impeachment trial of Secretary of War William W. Belknap, who was tried and acquitted even after he'd resigned his office. The Senate ultimately upheld its authority to try Belknap even after his abrupt resignation -- though some senators who voted to acquit indicated they did so because they felt the Senate lacked jurisdiction over Belknap once he was no longer in office.\n CNN's Joan Biskupic contributed to this article.",

        "title": "Biden pushes to reopen schools within 100 days",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden is pledging to reopen most K-12 schools within 100 days -- an ambitious goal as Covid cases surge and teachers across the country fight some plans to reopen.\n Teachers' union leaders say they are pleased with Biden's sense of urgency and focus, but they warn that the 100-day pledge may need to be a goal rather than a fixed target.\n Biden signed several executive actions Thursday, his second day in office, to help support the reopening goal and establish a national strategy to get the coronavirus under control, but the measures stop short of requiring schools to reopen within any set time frame.\n One executive order directs the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services to provide reopening guidance to schools with a focus on masking, testing and cleaning. A separate presidential memorandum offers reimbursement to schools for purchases of personal protective equipment through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund.\n Biden's reopening policy is in stark contrast to former President Donald Trump's threats to withhold federal relief funding from schools if they didn't reopen for in-person learning, which neither Trump nor Congress ever put into action.\n On a call with reporters Wednesday, Carole Johnson, Biden's Covid testing coordinator, acknowledged that the reopening timeline may need to be extended.\n \"The health and safety of students, educators, staff and families is paramount. The administration will always be honest about the challenges we face, including addressing how and whether changes in the pandemic may impact the reopening of schools or the ability of schools to reopen,\" Johnson said.\n While many districts across the country are open, about half of K-12 students are currently attending virtual-only schools. Teachers have resisted reopening plans in major cities like Washington and Chicago.\n Union heads describe having a close working relationship with the Biden team but argue that the 100-day goal is a big challenge.\n \"I'm on board with the goal, but I'm very concerned about this new variant. None of this is done in isolation,\" Weingarten said.\n National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the 100-day pledge sends a strong message that reopening schools is a top priority for Biden but that it's \"not about the days, it's about the urgency he's putting on the issue.\"\n \"It's an aggressive plan, no question,\" Pringle added, noting there's \"nothing educators want to do more than be back in person safely with their kids.\"\n Teachers' unions and Democrats have long argued that the ability to open schools also depends on the resources available. Biden is pushing Congress to approve another $170 billion for K-12 schools, colleges and universities to help them operate safely in person or facilitate remote learning. Congress approved $82 billion in aid for schools in December, which Biden has said he views as a \"down payment.\"\n The new funding would be part of a broad $1.9 trillion relief package that would also include expanding unemployment benefits and direct stimulus checks. Congress, where Democrats now control both the House and the Senate, could take up the bill as early as next week. But it will take time for that money to make its way to school districts even if it's approved.\n The American Federation of Teachers is calling for five specific things schools will need to reopen: tools like masks and cleaning supplies to mitigate the spread of the virus in buildings, testing and contract tracing, accommodations for at-risk teachers, quick vaccinations for teachers, and honesty and transparency about the guidance.\n Bechara Choucair, Biden's pick to head vaccine coordination, said Wednesday that the administration will call on states to open up vaccine eligibility to teachers, along with first responders, grocery store workers and people over 65.\n This story has been updated with the signing of the executive orders.",

        "title": "Newly discovered giant galaxies dwarf the Milky Way",
        "body_text": "Our universe may be filled with unseen giants. Astronomers have discovered two giant radio galaxies, which are some of the largest-known objects in the universe. This revelation suggests that the enormous galaxies may be more common than previously believed.\n The study published Monday in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n Astronomers found the two galaxies in new radio maps that were created using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.\n Radio galaxies, which can be quite common, are brightest in radio wavelengths of light. Centaurus A is a well-known radio galaxy to astronomers. It's the fifth brightest galaxy in the sky and is about 12 million light-years from Earth.\n Centaurus A features a supermassive black hole at its center, which releases powerful jets that flow perpendicularly to the galaxy's disk -- a common structure for radio galaxies.\n Giant radio galaxies, however, are more rare and have jets that exceed 22 times the size of our Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, which is also fairly common, and looks like it sounds: a spiral-shaped galaxy with a central bar-shaped structure made of stars.\n Now, astronomers have found two giant radio galaxies in a rather small patch of sky.\n \"We found these giant radio galaxies in a region of sky which is only about 4 times the area of the full Moon,\" said Jacinta Delhaize, lead study author and research fellow at the University of Cape Town, in a statement.\n \"Based on our current knowledge of the density of giant radio galaxies in the sky, the probability of finding two of them in this region is less than 0.0003 per cent. This means that giant radio galaxies are probably far more common than we thought!\"\n Just because the galaxies are massive doesn't mean they're the easiest to spot, which is why astronomers didn't observe them until now.\n \"These two galaxies are special because they are amongst the largest giants known, and in the top 10 per cent of all giant radio galaxies,\" said Matthew Prescott, study coauthor and research fellow at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa, in a statement.\n \"They are more than 2 Mega-parsecs across, which is around 6.5 million light years or about 62 times the size of the Milky Way. Yet they are fainter than others of the same size. We suspect that many more galaxies like these should exist, because of the way we think galaxies grow and change over their lifetimes.\"\n Astronomers still don't quite understand why only some radio galaxies grow to this massive size. Some believe that the giant radio galaxies are the oldest, which has allowed their radio jets to increase outward over several hundred million years.\n If that's the case, astronomers think there should be more of them in the universe than those they have recorded.\n The MeerKAT telescope, located in the Karoo region of South Africa, includes an array of 64 radio dishes and has been operational since July 2018. The powerful telescope is sensitive to faint radio light, which allowed researchers to find the giant radio galaxies.\n The telescope array is a precursor to an upcoming telescope, the transcontinental Square Kilometer Array, which will begin construction in both South Africa and Australia this year and begin observations in the mid-2020s.\n The array will include thousands of dishes and up to a million low-frequency antennas in an effort to build the world's largest radio telescope. Despite the fact that these dishes and antennas will be in two different parts of the world, together they will create one telescope that has over 1 million square meters of collecting area, meaning that astronomers can survey the entire sky much more quickly than with other telescopes.\n It will also exceed the image resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and image large portions of the sky in sensitive detail.\n The Square Kilometer Array may discover more radio galaxies and shed light on how galaxies evolve.\n \"In the past, this population of galaxies has been hidden from our 'sight' by the technical limitations of radio telescopes,\" Delhaize said. \"However, it is now being revealed thanks to the impressive capabilities of the new generation of telescopes.\"",

And how in 2021, in the middle of a pandemic, do we celebrate the inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the second Roman Catholic President and the oldest ever elected? Can't party with Covid-19.\n So, would you settle for something like ... I don't know ... a digital pep rally?\n If you've watched Joe Biden run for office or deliver a stemwinder sometime during his 36-year run in the US Senate, you know how good a cheerleader he is for the large-d-and-small-d democratic faith.\n Maybe it was providential, then, that Joe Biden's Very Big Day was capped Wednesday night by the first and maybe (one fervently hopes) last socially distant inaugural celebration, mostly live and nationally televised, mostly, from the Lincoln Memorial.\n Even if you didn't know who was on the guest list for \"Celebrating America\" in advance, it only took a couple of guitar strokes sheathed in darkness to let you know that The Boss was going to set the table for this one.\n And Bruce Springsteen, with grizzled assurance and a veteran's panache, opened the proceedings all by himself, in a pea jacket and a weathered axe, with \"Land of Hopes and Dreams.\" His lyrics carried forth the hard-driving big-ticket effects of the musical performances at the swearing-in ceremonies almost eight hours earlier with Lady Gaga's stirring performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and Jennifer Lopez's laser-focused mix of \"America the Beautiful\" with Woody Guthrie's populist anthem, \"This Land is Your Land.\"\n Springsteen's lyrics and minimalist delivery pretty much picked up where Guthrie's left off: \"... this train, dreams will not be thwarted/This train faith will be rewarded/This train hear the steel rails singing/This train, bells of freedom ringing ...\"\n Springsteen said before he began that he was cold and host Tom Hanks looked and sounded somewhat shivery and slightly creaky as he welcomed millions of viewers to an all-but-vacant Capitol Mall. Hanks' tone and the prevailing atmosphere seemed less like a celebration at first and more like the start of an earnest, but semi-solemn mass Zoom meeting bridged by brass fanfares.\n It soon became clear, though, that this 90-minute broadcast wasn't a party designed solely for the glitterati and well-heeled corporate donors and politicos. \"Celebrating America\" delivered pretty much what it promised: a cross-country salute to front line workers -- teachers, nurses, delivery truckers -- who, in the prevailing sentiment of the night's narrative, kept the country going, educated its children, helped its needy, cared for its sick in the past ten months of shutdown and economic trauma.\n They had their say -- as did both Biden, who, standing in near-ghostly light in front of the text of the Gettysburg Address on a Lincoln Memorial wall, provided variations on themes delivered in his inaugural address by warning once again of the unprecedented crises facing America, requiring of citizens \"the most useful thing in a democracy: unity.\" The newly minted, history-making Vice President Kamala D. Harris also had her own spot-lit moment, chiming in with her own encouraging words for Americans and insisting that however daunting those crises alluded to by the President, \"American aspiration\" would help get them through.\n The pre-taped musical interludes -- as musical interludes go -- were a mixed bag: Jon Bon-Jovi warbling George Harrison's \"Here Comes the Sun\" as the sun was rising over a Miami pier; Justin Timberlake and Ant Clemons meeting up in a Memphis stage to sing of \"Better Days\" ahead (the neon-lit grit of the scenery upstaging the pop stars); Tim McGraw and Tyler Hubbard duetting on \"Undivided\"; John Legend hurling \"Feeling Good\" live into the dark District skies; Lin Manuel-Miranda reciting one of the President's favorite verses from Seamus Heaney's \"The Cure of Troy.\"\n As pep rallies go, it was well organized. But it didn't quite make one's heart levitate -- until towards the end when Demi Lovato pretty much saved the night with a breathtaking cover version of the late Bill Withers' \"Lovely Day\" that was braced by a heartwarming human quilt of Americans of all races, genders, ages and regions lip-synching, dancing and vogue-ing to Lovato's vocals. Little wonder that the President and the first lady were shown dancing with one of their grandchildren to the music before Katy Perry's vocal fireworks helped set off the biggest display of actual fireworks anybody could remember seeing on the Mall.\n I guess pyrotechnics are easy when you don't have to move a lot of people out of the way. Never mind. Another Inaugural Ball tradition was broken Wednesday night. After all, as Biden and Harris indicated, there's a lot of work to do Thursday.",

        "title": "Here's what Intel's new CEO must do to turn the company's fortunes around",
        "body_text": "Pat Gelsinger has a massive task ahead of him when he takes over as Intel CEO next month.\n The semiconductor company, whose products have served as the brains of countless computers and other important technologies, has in recent years lost its position as the industry's undisputed leader. Among the biggest challenges Intel faces: unprecedented competition from former steadfast partners, major delays in its next-generation chips, the departure of top talent and an activist shareholder banging at the door.\n \"I've always sort of wanted my career to be where the center of action is at \u2014 where is the disruption and maximum innovation going on?\" Gelsinger told Samsung President and Chief Strategy Officer Young Sohn in an October interview, prior to the Intel announcement.\n Investors are counting on Gelsinger \u2014 Intel's former chief technology officer and current CEO of software giant VMWare (VMW) \u2014 to bring that kind of vision back to Intel. The company's stock jumped 11% after Intel announced his hiring last week.\n But lately, Intel's competitors have bested it on Wall Street \u2014 over the past two years, Intel's shares have grown nearly 26%, versus the almost 169% growth in the PHLX semiconductor index (SOX). In that time, AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares are up around 398% and 300%, respectively.\n \"These are structural issues that will take many many years to fix,\" said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. \"He has a monumental challenge.\"\n The share price, among other concerns, sparked activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point to press for change at the company earlier this month.\n Outgoing CEO Bob Swan is handing over a company still in relatively good financial shape. When Intel reports earnings Thursday, Wall Street analysts expect it will post $75.4 billion in annual revenue for 2020, up almost 5% from the prior year.\n But analysts say that may not last as Intel works to engineer a turnaround.\n Investors and customers expect Gelsinger to articulate a plan to address Intel's manufacturing issues. He'll also have to chart a path for new areas of growth, as analysts say it's unlikely Intel will ever regain the market dominance it once enjoyed in its core PC business. That kind of pivot may not be easy for a 52-year-old, $72 billion company in the semiconductor industry, where developing a robust tech roadmap can take years.\n \"I think if they cannot get back on track, the competition now is much stronger than it ever has been, ever,\" said Alan Priestley, vice president analyst at Gartner. \"So the competition will continue to gain share at Intel's expense.\"\n Intel is known for manufacturing its own chips \u2014 a distinction that was seen as a competitive advantage until the company fell off its typical two-year upgrade schedule and began trailing its rivals in producing the most advanced microprocessors.\n Intel in recent years struggled to move from a 14-nanometer to a 10-nanometer chip. And in July, Intel announced its 7-nanometer chips \u2014 originally expected to arrive at the end of 2021 \u2014 would also be delayed by about six months. The company last week said it has made \"strong progress\" on 7-nanometer technology and will provide an update during Thursday's earnings report.\n Meanwhile, rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) continue moving ahead with developing even smaller, more powerful chips.\n TSMC produces chips for Intel rivals, and that's helped AMD steal share in the crucial PC and data center markets. TSMC earlier this year announced plans to build a $12 billion manufacturing facility in Arizona by 2024 to ramp up production of 5-nanometer chips. It is also in the process of developing 3-nanometer processors, executives said during its earnings call last week.\n Gelsinger will have to decide whether to outsource some advanced chip production to a competitor, likely TSMC, something Swan suggested the company might do. Analysts say it would be surprising if Intel completely spun off its foundries, as AMD did about a decade ago, but outsourcing some production could help it fill gaps in its product line as it fixes the manufacturing issues.\n \"They need to figure out whether they can get their technology back on track, or just give up and do what everybody else does and buy from TSMC or other foundries,\" said Wayne Lam, senior director of research at CCS Insight. \"How much can you fall behind before you say, 'Okay, well, it's not worth trying to catch up?'\"\n Investors were hoping for an update on Intel's plans related to potential outsourcing during the Thursday earnings, but the company may now wait to announce a strategy until Gelsinger can make the call. Whatever he decides, there is unlikely to be a quick resolution.\n \"Any manufacturing fixes (such as outsourcing partially to TSMC) are unlikely to produce results until late\" 2022 or 2023, or to help improve margins over the next two years, Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note Tuesday.\n At the same time, Intel must contend with a changing competitive landscape.\n In addition to the threat AMD poses to its PC business, Intel is also losing business from Apple. The iPhone maker in November released three new Macs using its own custom-designed microprocessor fabricated by TSMC. Apple says the new M1 chip will bring performance improvements compared to the Intel chips it previously used, including faster speeds and better battery life.\n \"Apple has done some interesting things in terms of the core design and memory architecture to drive up its performance ... [made possible] by doing it itself,\" Gartner's Priestley said. \"The challenge with using standard components from a vendor like Intel is you take what Intel provides, or if you want something specific, you have to wait and intercept it on its development cycles.\"\n Intel told CNN Business earlier this month that Apple's decision frees it up to \"figure out how we go out and compete against those [Apple] products.\" Intel said it would focus on delivering the best experiences on Windows, Chrome and Linux, while it competes against Mac products.\n At a staff meeting last week, Gelsinger told Intel employees that the company has to \"deliver better products\" for PCs than anything \"that a lifestyle company in Cupertino\" makes, a likely reference to Apple, according to a report from The Oregonian.\n Beyond losing a customer, the technology underlying Apple's new chips could have broader implications for Intel. While Intel's (and AMD's) microprocessors are based on an x86 architecture, Apple designed its new M1 chips based on a technology licensed from ARM, which Apple has been using in mobile devices for years.\n While there are already some ARM-based laptops on the market, Apple's new Macs could be a problem for Intel if they end up becoming a successful proof point for ARM-based chips in PCs.\n The move will likely encourage some other PC makers to explore building more ARM-based products to \"deliver similar capabilities in the Windows ecosystem to that which Apple is delivering in the Mac OS ecosystem,\" Priestley said. However, he added that it could take time for software developers to catch up to the switch to ARM, which could be a backstop for Intel, especially in the enterprise business.\n \"You must be able to offer new independent solutions to retain those customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away,\" Third Point's Loeb said of Apple (AAPL), as well as other tech giants like Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), in his letter to Intel earlier this month.\n There is also the challenge that microprocessors (CPUs), historically Intel's strong suit, are increasingly sharing the stage with other components \u2014 such as graphics processing units designed for AI applications in data centers, which Nvidia (NVDA) has invested heavily in \u2014 in terms of their importance to computing ecosystems.\n \"You have to fix the CPU roadmap within a world that's making the CPU less relevant,\" Rosenblatt's Mosesmann said. \"Everybody else is investing in other areas. You have to innovate in these other areas as well.\"\n He added: \"Intel is a different company going forward, and we'll have to find out where their key competency is.\"\n Some experts are hopeful that Gelsinger's experience running companies reliant on Intel technology will provide important insight as to what customers want and need.\n \"Pat, at VMware, was a customer of Intel \u2014 he knows what businesses are looking for, he knows what applications need more processing, he knows exactly where opportunities are at [the] hardware level,\" said Ambuj Kumar, CEO of cloud software firm Fortanix, a customer of Intel. \"I'm hoping that he can lead Intel's product development in that direction.\"",

        "title": "Fact check: 11 false claims Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has tweeted in the last month",
        "body_text": "A rookie Republican congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, was suspended from Twitter on Sunday for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted election misinformation.\n Greene has a long history of embracing baseless conspiracy theories. And she has been a serial tweeter of false claims -- about the election, the Capitol insurrection and other subjects -- since she won her seat in November.\n Below is a fact check of 11 false claims Greene has tweeted in the last month alone, including three related claims about the integrity of the election. After CNN emailed her congressional office to offer her the opportunity to comment on any of these findings, her communications director, Nick Dyer, had only a brief response, \"Here's our comment: 'CNN is fake news.'\"\n Defending President Donald Trump against accusations that he incited the Capitol insurrection, Greene argued: \"The timeline doesn't fit the narrative. Trump supporters could not have listened to President Trump's speech at the WH and then been 'incited' by him to walk to and attack the Capitol.\"\n Abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America tweeted the following about the insurrection: \"Anti-choice extremists, white supremacists, and violent misogynists all converged this week to attack our country. But the thing is, these groups already have a lot of overlap. What we saw was horrifying and devastating. But it wasn't surprising.\"\n Greene responded that the Capitol attack was \"terrible and shouldn't have happened\" -- but then added that all of the people who died as a result of the insurrection were White, \"so I'm not sure where your white supremacy bs is coming from.\"\n The FBI alleges that Bryan Betancur, who has been charged for alleged involvement in the insurrection, is \"is a self-professed White supremacist who has made statements to law enforcement officers that he is a member of several white supremacy organizations.\" The FBI alleges that a confidential source says that another man who has been charged, Timothy Louis Hale-Cusanelli, is \"an avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer.\"\n A third man who has been charged, Robert Keith Packer, is alleged to be the man seen at the insurrection wearing a \"Camp Auschwitz\" shirt. The FBI alleges the shirt \"appears to be a symbol of Nazi hate ideology.\"\n A fourth man who has been charged, Anthime Joseph (Tim) Gionet, is an Internet personality who is known for his role in the racist and anti-Semitic \"alt-right\" movement and who attended the infamous White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n The charges against these men were announced after Greene's \"bs\" tweet, but nonetheless, there was never any basis to accuse NARAL of making up the claim that white supremacists were present at the Capitol. In addition, a variety of symbols used by white supremacists had been seen at the Capitol during the insurrection.\n The publication Insider has reported that Gionet has disputed the assertion that he is a white nationalist. Packer did not respond to CNN requests for comment before his arrest. Betancur and Hale-Cusanelli did not immediately have lawyers listed in an online federal system.\n Greene tweeted that \"there was MASS voter fraud on a scale that should terrify every American regardless of political party.\"\n In court, even Trump's own legal team often declined to allege mass fraud -- focusing instead on complaints about law and process. But the Trump team lost case after case anyway.\n We'll address three related claims under this one heading.\n Greene repeatedly called the presidential election \"stolen.\" She repeatedly referred to some of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral votes as \"fraudulent.\" And she explicitly claimed that Biden \"lost\" the election and Trump \"won.\"\n Greene criticized Gabriel Sterling, a senior official in the office of Georgia's top elections official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. She tweeted, \"You ran a Nov 3rd election that was stolen bc you idiots at the SOS mailed out millions of absentee ballots to any one and everyone while GA was an open state.\"\n Georgia was not one of the states to send an absentee ballot to every eligible registered voter; a ballot was only sent to an eligible voter who requested one. Georgia does not require any excuse to vote absentee, but this no-excuse policy was created by state Republican leaders in 2005, not by Raffensperger himself.\n Greene tweeted: \"... Georgia state leaders refused to listen to Georgia tax payers. They refused to change anything after allowing @realDonaldTrump's election to be stolen. And they refused to #StopTheSteaI with our two senate seats.\"\n Greene tweeted, \"202,377 more votes cast than voters voting in Pennsylvania! This is called election fraud.\"\n The day after Twitter banned Trump's @realDonaldTrump account, Greene tweeted, \"Yesterday they crushed the First Amendment. You can see what's coming next. I vow to do everything I can to protect American's Second Amendment rights.\"\n Greene tweeted, \"ZERO Democrats have condemned the political violence of BLM/Antifa terrorists that lasted the entirety of 2020. Instead, each of them fanned the flames of hate.\"\n Republicans are entitled to argue that Democrats should have issued such condemnations more forcefully or frequently, or that they should have been more explicit in identifying the perpetrators, but it's just inaccurate to say or suggest they didn't issue the condemnations at all.",

        "body_text": "Drivers will still be required to pay constant attention to the road, for instance. In the words of automated driving experts, these systems are \"feet off\" and \"hands off,\" but they will not be \"eyes off\" or \"mind off.\"\n Bryan Reimer, a transportation researcher with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AgeLab, said it will be decades before people can buy truly self-driving cars in which humans ride solely as passengers.\n Until then, people will experience greater levels of \"collaborative driving,\" in which people still play a critical role by overseeing the computers and machinery operating the vehicle and by driving themselves in complex situations, he said.\n Still, the technology that will be rolled out by the major automakers this year will do more than most so-called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, do now.\n Tesla's Autopilot  -- currently considered one of the most advanced systems -- still requires drivers to regularly grasp the steering wheel, even though the car will hold a lane, change lanes and even take highway interchange ramps on its own. Driver assistance systems in cars from other automakers like Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Nissan, also require drivers to regularly grip the steering wheel.\n GM's Super Cruise system allows drivers to completely let go of the steering wheel while driving on selected highways. It was introduced in 2017 on the Cadillac CT6 sedan, which was discontinued last year. An improved version is coming this year on the Cadillac Escalade SUV and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans.\n This new Super Cruise system will handle lane changes on its own when requested by the driver using the turn signal. It will also be easier to turn the system on, according to GM.\n Super Cruise only works on highways that have been previously laser-mapped in three dimensions by the company. That detailed 3D map data is combined with \"regular\" digital maps to allow the vehicles to stay in their lanes even while navigating curves and avoiding other vehicles. GPS positioning and the vehicles' radar sensors and cameras are used to enable drivers to unhand -- and unfoot -- all the controls.\n Drivers still need to pay attention, however. A camera above the speedometer and tachometer makes sure the driver is looking at the road at all times. Or, at least, almost all the time. If the driver looks away from the road for more than a few seconds, the system will stop working.\n That's important because Super Cruise, like other ADAS, isn't intended to replace a human driver. It's just supposed to relieve the driver of the mundane tasks of maintaining a lane position and avoiding other cars. But it can be tempting to think the machine has it all under control.\n \"We're human. I mean, I'm no longer fully engaged in this,\" said MIT's Reimer. \"I'm willing to, you know, perhaps trust the automation a little more than I should until something goes disastrously wrong.\"\n Tesla has said it will roll out its Full Self-Driving software in the early part of this year and has been beta testing a version of the software. But Tesla's claim has been met with skepticism by many. Tesla has blown past several of its self-imposed deadlines before and there are doubts about whether the technology will even be \"self-driving.\"\n For now, Tesla still warns that drivers must pay attention at all times while any of its vehicles' driver assistance systems are operating.\n \"To complete the ability, to get what I would call a robust and reliable model of the environment around the vehicle, you would need to add a fourth sensing technology, in addition to cameras, radar and ultrasonics,\" said Kay Stepper, senior vice president for automated driving and driver assistance engineering at the auto parts supplier Bosch. \"Now [you'd have to add] lidar.\"\n MIT's Reimer agrees. Without the accuracy of lidar, it just isn't possible to completely release humans from the task of driving.\n \"Doing it successfully nine out of 10 times is probably feasible,\" said Reimer. \"Doing it reliably enough that I'm willing to walk on the street [with these cars around]? Different story.\"\n GM and Ford's hands-free systems do not use lidar sensors, but they still require a human driver to pay attention at all times.\n \"They will not release an actual full self-driving product for some time, possibly several years, barring major breakthroughs,\" Brad Templeton, an autonomous driving industry consultant, said of Tesla. \"Even with a major breakthrough they won't do it this year or next.\"\n Funkhouser pointed to Tesla's other recent advancements, such as giving its cars the ability to recognize and respond to stoplights and stop signs. In Consumer Reports' testing, she said that technology was found to be unreliable, failing to stop at some stop signs and then slamming to a halt needlessly at some yield signs. She expects Full Self-Driving to be something similar.\n \"So what I have been expecting to see is a little bit more of this gimmicky type of stuff that's not actually very useful,\" she said.",

Driver is the author of \"More or Less Dead: Feminicide, Haunting, and the Ethics of Representation in Mexico.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nLike millions of other Americans, I was infected with Covid-19 in 2020 -- part of a wave of suffering that came as a direct result of the way the Trump administration failed to manage the pandemic. While I thankfully recovered, it wasn't lost on me that I got sick while reporting on the plight of meat processing workers in Arkansas whose pleas to be seen and heard amid the pandemic were going largely ignored. At the end of four years of a presidency in which journalists like me were regularly declared \"enemies of the people\" and after recovering from Covid-19, I began 2021 wondering how to recover my hope for democracy and sense of faith in the citizens of the United States.\n The idea of needing to be in Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day gripped me and wouldn't let go, even after the January 6 insurrection: I had to witness the inauguration of Vice President Kamala Harris, the only woman in my lifetime -- in my mom's and my grandma's and all women in the US's lifetime -- to be elected to the position. I knew I had to be there, but I wasn't expecting to leave with a transformed understanding of what the voice of true power in America could sound like.\n Arriving in DC the week before the inauguration, shortly after the White supremacist attempt to take the Capitol, I found myself in the unusual position of -- for the first time in my professional life -- ordering body armor and a helmet which, in light of the storming of the Capitol, was recommended for all journalists covering the inauguration.\n In DC, despite 25,000 National Guard troops and an increased police presence on the streets, I found joy and inspiration in what from now on I will call the Amanda Gorman Effect, after the surge of joy and rapt attention the inaugural poet brought forth from the nation and from the women who spoke to me on the streets of DC.\n The day of the inauguration, normally some 200,000 tickets are distributed to members of Congress and their constituents. Because of the pandemic and the security concerns, Congress was limited to tickets for themselves and one guest. As the National Guard and police blocked off the streets around the White House and the Capitol and set up checkpoints in preparation for the inauguration, the streets became eerily quiet. I decided to go to Black Lives Matter Plaza (a pedestrian area near the White House, renamed as such in June 2020 by the city's mayor) -- where some Biden supporters had assembled to celebrate.\n At Black Lives Matter Plaza, there were girls and women like me who, despite the tension in the city created by the level of militarization, wanted to be present for the beginning of a new era, one in which women like Harris and Gorman, the youth poet laureate, will redefine what power looks and sounds like.\n Tiffany Jamel, 22, wore a \"Black Lives Matter\" mask and a shirt that read \"Why be a racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic, when you could just be quiet?\" She said that she began college right after Trump was elected and after graduation, she knew she wanted to come and see what she thought would be the defining inauguration of her life. She drove from Florida to Washington, DC, with two friends to witness the inauguration and described the experience as surreal -- she admitted that until that moment, she didn't think we would see a woman as president or vice president in her lifetime.\n Activist Nadine Seiler, 55, said she had been occupying the plaza to protect it from racists -- even sleeping there -- since October. She wore a knitted pink pussy hat and face mask that read MADAM in pink and VP in blue. She had seen the White supremacists march towards the White House on January 6 but had never imagined that they were going to be successful in storming the Capitol. She told me that some Black Lives Matter supporters she knew in the area had been afraid to come to the plaza on Inauguration Day for fear of being harassed or threatened.\n Smokey Sims, a BLM activist who had been occupying the plaza and supporting Seiler, said of Harris, \"I am glad we've got a woman in office. I'm glad she's Black. I'm glad she's Asian. And hopefully she'll be president next. That's what I want.\"\n At the inauguration ceremony, Gorman -- a woman the same age as Jamel -- held the world's attention as she recited her poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" saying, \"The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, if only we are brave enough to see it -- if only we are brave enough to be it.\"\n And in that moment, Jamel and her friends saw that power looks like a 22-year-old poet armed only with her words and a coat the color of sunshine and power looks like a 56-year-old Black and South Asian woman with her husband -- the supportive second gentleman -- by her side.\n Gorman, who dreamed of being president as a girl, described herself as a \"skinny Black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother.\" The shadow of violence that loomed over the inauguration was eclipsed by her light, by the way her words began to heal a divided nation.\n After four years in which we have all endured the images, words and actions of (mostly) male White power, so many of us are ready for this brave new beginning, one in which we are reminded of the magic of poetry and the way words, arranged just so, can bring us together.",

        "body_text": "We have entered the era of coronavirus anniversaries.\n Today marks one year since the announcement of the first patient with Covid-19 in the United States. It happened in Washington state, where a male in his 30s who had just returned from visiting Wuhan, China, started experiencing symptoms and quickly sought help at a clinic.\n Unlike in the movies or on TV, where a sick patient staggers into a hospital waiting room infecting everyone nearby, the doctors and public health experts in Washington state were prepared: They had been carefully monitoring what was going on in China and had been running drills to practice what to do when  -- not if -- an infected patient arrived at their doorstep. This patient was tested, hospitalized and isolated, contact-traced, treated and eventually released. Even though this person became the first patient identified, he was almost certainly not THE first case in the country.\n Over the course of the last year, one patient has grown exponentially into 24 million confirmed in the US alone -- a number that is surely only the tip of the iceberg, the cases we know about.\n Anniversaries are important and meaningful to us. They're a way of marking the passage of time and noting historical events, delineating the Before and After. And with the start of our second year dealing with this novel coronavirus, which almost exactly coincides with the start of 2021, we will be noting many more Firsts of the Covid-19 Pandemic: the first complete lockdown of a city, Wuhan (1/23); the first time the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (1/30); the first death outside of mainland China (2/2); the introduction of the name \"Covid-19\" -- the disease caused by the novel coronavirus -- into the popular lexicon (2/11); the first known US death (2/29)-- although health officials would later amend that milestone (2/6). And I'll never forget March 9, the first time I, on CNN, used the word \"pandemic\" to describe what was happening. Two days later, WHO did the same.\n All these firsts make me think about the significance of the word \"novel.\" When was the last time we, as adults and as a society, truly experienced anything for the first time, or have been in a situation for which we had no context?\n When we hear of a novel -- or new -- anything, one of the first things we, as humans, start doing is contextualizing or looking for similar examples among the things we are familiar with. We try to understand the contours of this new entity by comparing it to what we already have stored in our memories and experiences. We look for patterns, similarities, overlap.\n It's human nature.  But, too often, that  sort of thinking gets in our way.\n When this novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, emerged, many scientists, public health officials and doctors -- myself included -- looked to other deadly coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, for clues to predict how it would behave. We also tried to compare it to the seasonal influenza virus and to past flu pandemics, like the one caused by the H1N1 subtype, which set off both the 2009 and the 1918 pandemics.\n I remember putting my head down deep into this, taking in all the information I could: reading research papers and unpublished pre-proofs; talking to colleagues in China, South Korea, Japan and at my hospital; talking to experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and global health expert Peter Daszak, whose research has been key to understanding the origin and impact of emerging diseases. And I remember, everybody had a theory about some aspect of this novel coronavirus -- even my mother had a theory.\n In the earliest days, we thought human-to-human transmissibility was unlikely, that masks weren't particularly helpful, that it might not be deadlier than the flu, that people couldn't spread it asymptomatically or through the air. Maybe we hoped these things would be true, and the pandemic wouldn't be as devastating as it has been.\n But we were wrong. We quickly  learned that SARS-CoV-2 was much deadlier than the flu, and much more easily transmissible than either of its close cousins, SARS and MERS. We came to terms with the sobering reality that aerosolized particles and asymptomatic carriers are significant drivers of its relentless spread.\n The point is, I don't think anyone would have predicted -- or wanted to predict -- we'd be dealing with a global pandemic of this magnitude one year later. We didn't want to face such a grim future.\n Even the way former President Donald Trump communicated to me that he didn't want to panic the American public likely contributed  to the problem. But being honest and direct, and telling people the truth, is sometimes hard. I deal with this as a doctor all the time. A traumatic brain injury after a car accident on the way to work. That headache: the early sign of a brain tumor. I have learned that presenting a problem alongside a plan doesn't soften the blow of terrible news, but it can help mitigate the panic, which really serves no purpose. It also makes it much more  likely people will take the issue seriously, rather than simply feeling helpless, which can lead to disbelief and ignoring the problem altogether.\n If I had known in January of last year that we'd still be living this Covid lockdown life, and that I'd still be conducting interviews from my basement until, say, a vaccine was developed, in many ways it would have been a very difficult pill to swallow. But in at least one way it would have been easier: There would be a calendar, a timetable, about how things should progress -- and a tangible end. The certainty of a countdown to zero, as opposed to the inherent ambiguity of counting up for what feels like forever. We're not nearly as good at counting up as we are at counting down. However painful, when we countdown, we still have the anticipation of an end date.\n Anniversaries are also a time to reflect, to look back on this experience and assess what we got right versus what we got wrong.\n We got a few big things right: We made remarkable progress in scientific and medical arenas, like developing protocols and therapeutics -- both repurposed and new -- for people who got sick. Most notable of all, we managed to develop several vaccine candidates and even authorized two with astonishing speed.\n But we also got too many things wrong -- most consequentially and tragically the public health basics, the things that are far easier to do but not as flashy: wearing a mask and staying physically distanced from those not in our household. We eschewed the inexpensive mask that slips on easily, yet embraced the billion-dollar breakthrough vaccine that takes a Herculean effort to develop and distribute.\n The truth is, especially for many of us in the developed world, we want science to rescue us -- but it can't rescue us from ourselves; our own human nature. And our human nature is not good at dealing with what it can't see.\n The other day, someone asked me what big breakthrough I would like to see for a future pandemic. Aside from the obvious ones -- avoiding a future pandemic, developing an effective vaccine, having access to effective medications, amassing reliable data\u2014here's a crazy idea I would love: fluorescent dye that basically gives the virus just a little bit of color. So if someone is infected, you could see a little plume of glowing green particles coming out of their nose and mouth. Not to scare people or gross them out, but because we are so much better at dealing with things that we can tangibly identify than an invisible threat. Trying to get people to believe in what they can't see, trying to prove a negative (for example, reliably conveying all the deaths mask-wearing prevented) has always been the challenge in all preventive medicine.\n Looking forward, I am optimistic, medically-speaking. I think once most of us are vaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 will become like the other circulating coronaviruses, an annual nuisance but not an existential threat.\n The image of the United States as a public health leader, however, has been tarnished by the events of the last year and its inability to control the pandemic at home. It's a fact, and we can't spin the statistics to our advantage: We have 4% of the world's population but 25% of known Covid infections and 20% of deaths. Can the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country's premier public health agency, regain some of its lost prestige domestically and abroad? I believe with hard work and time, it can.\n But beyond that, the country will be scarred psychologically and emotionally for a long time, especially the people who have lost family members to Covid-19, the health care workers who fought tirelessly -- sometimes in the face of disbelief or worse -- to care for the sick, the children of all ages who lost a year of school and struggled to catch up, the families who lost income from layoffs or suffered other economic catastrophes, the owners who had to shutter their businesses. The list goes on.\n I have no doubt we will get through this. And hopefully there will be lessons learned, but more importantly, lessons remembered -- because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, and the price we've paid as a society during this pandemic is too high to let that happen again. This past year has most certainly taught us that.\n CNN Health's Andrea Kane contributed to this report.",

Luckily, there is laughter to be found.\n The hell you say!\n The actor hosts \"History of Swear Words,\" a new Netflix series that is both educational and funny. With the help of experts and celebs, the six-part series \"explores the origins, pop culture-usage, science and cultural impact of curse words.\"\n The \"Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" star teamed up with writer Bess Kalb for the year-end -- and still timely -- Amazon special.\n Hosted by \"2 Dope Queens\" star Phoebe Robinson, the show also features Sarah Silverman, Tiffany Haddish and Natasha Rothwell sending up the year -- and reminding us that comedy isn't just for the boys.\n Keegan-Michael Key is just the man to host this new Audible Original podcast.\n The \"Key & Peele\" star shares some of his personal memories about sketch comedy while delving into its history.\n \"There's a Chinese proverb that states 'The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now,'\" Key said. \"The good news is when it comes to comedy and sketch, most of the seeds and trees were planted tens or hundreds or even thousands of years ago. And every day we are reaping their fruit and making some pretty damn fine sketch comedy pies.\"\n He's just one of the stars of the Netflix mockumentary \"Death to 2020.\" This comedic look back at a year we all want in our rearview mirror is brought to you, ironically enough, by the creators of \"Black Mirror.\"\n See how it all connects from history to current times? How funny is that?\n Men don't have a monopoly on crime.\n That's the premise behind the BET docuseries \"American Gangster: Trap Queens,\" featuring stories about women who held their own as crime bosses, such as Perrion Roberts, former drug ringleader turned criminal justice reform advocate.\n The second season is narrated by rapper Lil' Kim and is currently streaming on BET+.\n Academy Award-winning actress Anna Paquin stars in this series about a group of relentless publicists who are tasked with doing whatever it takes to protect their celebrity clients.\n We can think of a few who might need their help.\n \"Flack\" starts streaming on Amazon Prime Friday.\n Written by Neil Cross and inspired by his novel \"Burial,\" the plot centers around a man (Russell Tovey) who has never been able to forget the worst night of his life: a party that led to the sudden, shocking death of a young woman.\n Only he and an eccentric old acquaintance know what really happened ... and they've resolved to keep it that way. But secrets have a way of revealing themselves.\n Hulu starts streaming the four-part series on Friday.\n It's not true that \"Nobody Is Listening.\"\n That's the title of Zayn Malik's third studio album. The former One Direction member and model Gigi Hadid's baby daddy goes by just his first name these days.\n Honestly, the R&B singer can call himself whatever he wants with an album full of tunes this smooth.\n \"Nobody Is Listening\" is out now.\n If Maggie Lindemann has her way, the future of rock is female.\n The 22-year-old singer has won fans by blending genres including punk and pop (see Lindemann's remake of her own song \"Friends Go,\" with famed Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker) and for her social media presence.\n Check out her EP, \"Paranoia,\" which drops Friday.\n \"Insecure\" is ending with its fifth season and I'm trying not to be in my feelings about it.\n \"Peaky Blinders,\" \"Shameless,\" \"Grace and Frankie\" and \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" are just a few of the shows calling it a wrap this year.\n Thankfully, we can take solace in the fact that there is a ton of good content out there just waiting to be discovered, so chin up.\n US President Joe Biden issued a call for unity across the nation during his inauguration speech on Wednesday, and the performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks echoed that.\n Watching the three artists, each talented and reflective of our culturally diverse nation, reminded me we are still one nation, under God.\n Let's hope we move forward, together.",

        "body_text": "The Trump administration aimed to vaccinate 20 million Americans against Covid-19 by the end of 2020 but fell short of that goal even at the end of the term. Now, President Biden's promise to administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office will be put to the test.\n More than 17.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered since the first Pfizer/BioNTech shot was administered on December 14, according to the latest data from the CDC, for an average pace of about 462,000 shots per day.\n While significantly behind early promises overall, the pace of vaccination has steadily improved over the past five weeks. The number of doses administered in the last seven days was more than 10 times that of the first seven days of vaccine administration in the United States. And with additional vaccines in the works, as well as commitments from the new Biden administration and current manufacturers, it could continue to improve.\n In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci said it's likely that vaccine administration will meet -- and perhaps even outpace -- President Biden's plan.\n \"I feel fairly confident that that's going to be not only that but maybe even better,\" the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said on Good Morning America on Thursday.\n In any case, the US is still many months away from vaccinating enough people to end the pandemic.\n The two vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US -- those made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- both require that an individual receive two doses to be fully vaccinated. Another vaccine in development from Johnson & Johnson would require only a single dose.\n If Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines remain the only ones on the market, about 500 million total doses must be administered before all adults in the US are fully vaccinated -- two for each of the 250 million or so adults who live in the US. Currently, none of the current coronavirus vaccines are authorized for people younger than 16.\n In the past seven days, about 914,000 doses have been administered daily. If vaccination continues at this same rate, every adult in the US could be fully vaccinated by summer 2022, according to a CNN analysis.\n If vaccination picks up to 1 million shots per day, in line with Biden's promise, that timeline could bump up to spring 2022.\n To fully vaccinate all adults in the US by the end of the year, the pace would have to increase to about 1.3 million doses administered per day.\n While vaccinating the full population is ideal, it's likely not necessary to start a return to normalcy.\n Herd immunity -- when a sufficient proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease and spread from person to person is unlikely -- would be expected to happen sooner.\n Estimates for the share of the population that must be protected to reach this threshold vary as more is learned about the coronavirus. Most predictions land in the 60 to 70% range, including those cited by the World Health Organization.\n But last week, Fauci indicated that range could be more like 70 to 85%.\n \"If we get that, we would develop an umbrella of immunity,\" he told CNBC. \"That would be able to protect even the vulnerables who have not been vaccinated, or those in which the vaccine has not been effective.\"\n Assuming three-quarters of US adults must be fully vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the US could reach this threshold by February 2022 if vaccination continues at the same rate as the past seven days -- about 914,000 doses administered daily, according to a CNN analysis.\n If vaccination picks up to 1 million shots per day, herd immunity in the US could be reached by the end of 2021.\n At a Harvard Business Review event on Tuesday, Fauci said the effects of herd immunity may begin by fall.\n \"If we do that efficiently -- from April, May, June, July, August -- by the time we get to the beginning of the fall, we should have that degree of protection that I think can get us back to some form of normality,\" he said.\n Despite recent reports that the US government does not have a stockpile of vaccine reserved for second doses as previously described, manufacturers have committed to the availability of supply.\n \"We have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US. We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,\" Pfizer said in a statement to CNN.\n Pfizer has committed to provide 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of July, and Moderna said it will deliver a total of 200 million doses by June, or the end of the second quarter of the yar.\n Timelines for herd immunity and overall vaccination coverage could also accelerate if more single-dose vaccines are authorized for use in the US.\n However, even if the United States reaches some level of herd immunity, the situation may be different in other parts of the world.\n Last week, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, warned that global herd immunity should not be expected this year.",

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\"When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade?\"\n This was the opening line of the captivating inaugural poem delivered by 22-year-old poet laureate Amanda Gorman. Her electric presence and poetic eloquence served to set the optical lens through which we would see Joe Biden's inauguration: light triumphing over dark.\n The dark and divisively opposing forces of the past couple of months were always hellbent on raining on Joe Biden's parade. But perhaps in a sign of the outgoing President's quickly diminishing influence, gentle snowflakes performed a graceful dance to Earth on cue, just as incoming President Biden was about to make his appearance on the inaugural stage. Then, the sun broke out and beamed brightly over the first few bars of the national anthem.\n A mere mask could not conceal Vice President Kamala Harris' beaming smile. Her glistening eyes told the whole story. In fact, every dignitary on stage displayed the kind of joyful celebration normally reserved for greeting returning war soldiers.\n By contrast, Donald Trump's inauguration speech four years ago was a dreary and dismal affair, laced with rhetoric of \"American carnage.\"\n No wonder that a Council on Foreign Relations policy expert deemed it one of the two worst inauguration speeches of all time (the other being James Buchanan's, which blamed the country's persisting problems on the distraction of the slavery debate.)  At Biden's swearing in, the reassuring theme of light and hope took center stage. What he needed to execute was an oratory high-wire act, balancing the stark reality of the \"cascade of crises\" he said we simultaneously face with the call to write an American story of hope and decency.\n It was an oratorical high point for Biden. He used the full range of his voice to underscore both the enormity of today's challenges and his unwavering belief in the promise of tomorrow. At moments when he was seeking to build confidence and optimism among Americans that brighter days lie ahead, his voice projection dipped lower to create an intimate yet intense heartfelt reassurance. In referencing the January 6 rioters, he declared that stopping the will of our democracy \"will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever,\" his voice swelling louder with determination and conviction.\n The speech captured the spirit of many presidential calls for unity and healing that preceded it. It drew from Abraham Lincoln, whose reference to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 read, \"If my name ever goes down in history, it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.\" Biden's standout line about uniting the country was, \"My whole soul is in this.\"\n It was one part Franklin D. Roosevelt, transforming \"the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself,\" into \"together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.\"\n It also tapped into the iconic John F. Kennedy line, \"ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,\"  when the President quoted from one of his favorite songs, \"American Anthem\": \"When my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you.\"\n The speech was the kind of enormous olive branch to adversaries that only Joe Biden could wield with any degree of sincerity. It was his call to disarm: \"We must end this uncivil war.\"\n But perhaps the most dramatic optic was the backdrop, the Capitol itself. On Inauguration Day, it was replete with all the majesty and splendor customary of every inaugural that has preceded it. Looking at the pomp and ceremony amidst all the patriotic bunting, it was hard to reconcile that just two weeks earlier, an angry, insurrectionist mob had smashed windows and desecrated the very cradle of American democracy. The fact that there were no visual remnants of that horrific episode helped reinforce democracy's resilience and the prospect that the soul of the country, what Joe Biden has said many times that he was fighting for, could be reborn.\n What perfectly augmented Biden's message of light triumphing over darkness was the way the ceremonies and its setting were bathed in the sun's radiance. If Americans are to have faith that the country can successfully unite during a time of multiple crises and divisiveness, then the optimistic optics of the day got things off to a good start.",

        "body_text": "Lanhee J. Chen, Ph.D., is the David and Diane Steffy Fellow in American Public Policy Studies at the Hoover Institution and the Director of Domestic Policy Studies in Public Policy at Stanford University. He previously served as policy director on the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and senior adviser on policy to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nFew issues have been as polarizing over the last several years as health care reform. Much of the rancor extends back to the partisan passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and was inflamed by Republican efforts to repeal the law in 2017.\n As President Joe Biden begins his tenure, with narrow majorities in both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, he will need to work with lawmakers in both parties to advance his legislative agenda. Even though Democrats now control both chambers, most legislation will still need to clear a 60-vote threshold to assure final passage in the Senate, and bipartisan support for his initiatives will therefore be crucial to ensure their passage.\n Biden has advocated for some health policy changes that are unlikely to garner Republican support -- for example, a proposal to create a public health insurance option or one to lower the Medicare eligibility age. But there are other ideas that would be more popular and even pass with bipartisan votes in the US Senate. Biden should turn his focus to these.\n First, the President can address two problems that have produced bipartisan solutions in the past -- prescription drug costs and so-called \"surprise\" medical billing, where patients are unexpectedly charged for services.\n In 2019, a bipartisan group of senators agreed on a number of reforms to address prescription drug pricing. Their legislation included, for example, capping out-of-pocket costs in Medicare's prescription drug benefit; requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase the list price for their drugs faster than inflation to pay a rebate; and mandating price transparency measures for drug-makers seeking to unveil a new medicine or increase prices on an existing one. While each of these measures alone may not do much to impact drug costs, together they constitute a consequential package of reforms that could garner substantial support in the Senate. All that's left is presidential leadership to get it across the finish line.\n Similarly, there was bipartisan support before the pandemic for policies to address so-called \"surprise\" medical bills, such as those received from out-of-network physicians during emergency treatment. It's an issue that has high political salience, and voters say they want to see solved. But bipartisan negotiations on legislation to address surprise medical billing eventually stalled because deep-pocketed special interest groups spent millions of dollars opposing the reforms and lawmakers couldn't agree on the exact mechanism to determine how much providers would get paid.  The policy disagreements weren't fundamentally partisan, however, and strong leadership from Biden could help break the logjam and produce a compromise set of reforms.\n Second, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration made a number of temporary policy changes to increase access to telehealth and other technologies that make it easier for patients to get care. For example, it increased the type of telehealth services covered for Medicare patients, made it easier for providers to furnish telehealth across state lines and provided telehealth services at federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics.\n The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of leveraging technology to ensure access to our health care system, particularly where in-person visits are difficult. Millions of Americans -- including many with conditions that place them at higher risk of adverse outcomes if they catch Covid-19 -- have used telemedicine and other technologies to safely get access to health care since the start of the pandemic.\n However, without further action, these reforms will go away. Biden should work with Congress to enshrine these changes into law and make them permanent -- for example, by incorporating them into a Covid relief package soon after he takes office.\n Finally, Biden may be able to work with moderate Republicans to extend coverage under the Affordable Care Act, a law that the Supreme Court seems unlikely to overturn anytime soon, if ever. While the ACA dramatically expanded the number of Americans with health insurance, almost 30 million still remained uninsured in 2019. Both parties must compromise to address this challenge. Democrats must drop their insistence that coverage expansions come primarily by way of even more widespread expansions of state Medicaid programs, the government-run health insurance that many low-income Americans use. Conservatives have opposed these expansions because they don't want to put more people on government-run insurance and have long had concerns about fraud and the quality of care provided in Medicaid.\n For their part, Republicans should set aside their blanket opposition to the ACA and find ways to tweak the law so that it works better. It's up to Biden to convince enough Democrats to accede to a deal and a few Senate Republicans to come together with a willingness to address the coverage conundrum.\n The outlines of a deal, based on these terms, could be relatively straightforward: Congress could provide states with funding to partially expand their Medicaid programs in conjunction with greater flexibility to give additional assistance -- via tax credits or other subsidies -- to low-income residents looking to purchase private insurance. Neither side would get all of what they're looking for, but this \"goldilocks\" approach could be the ticket to increasing the number of Americans with health insurance -- particularly in states like Texas and Florida, where governors and legislators have consistently opposed full Medicaid expansion. This compromise would allow both sides to claim some measure of political credit for an important accomplishment.\n Since passage of the ACA in 2010, presidents have largely resorted to unilateral executive action to make health care policy changes. But more consequential and durable reforms will require Biden to find a way to work both with progressives who are looking to replace what we have now with Medicare-for-all and Republicans who believe the ACA remains fundamentally flawed. Neither of these points of view will win out over the next four years, so it's up to Biden to convince skeptical Republicans, in particular, that there are actually a few things they can do together to improve America's health care system.",

        "title": "The China trade war is one thing Joe Biden won't be rushing to fix",
        "body_text": "US President Joe Biden is inheriting a tense and messy relationship with China from his predecessor.\n From a grueling trade war to a slew of sanctions on the country's most prominent tech companies, the Trump administration spent the bulk of the last four years piling pressure on the United States' biggest economic rival. Things only became more heated in recent weeks as Washington slapped additional restrictions on Chinese business and investment.\n \"It is difficult to see a US reversal of the recent hawkish trends in China policy, given the increasingly negative views on China in the US,\" Sylvia Sheng, a global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a research note this week.\n Biden's cabinet nominees are already starting to bolster that view. Janet Yellen, his pick to lead the Treasury Department, promised Tuesday to take on China's \"abusive, unfair and illegal practices.\"\n \"China is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers, and giving away subsidies to corporations,\" she told the Senate Finance Committee, echoing some of the Trump administration's biggest criticisms of the world's second largest economy.\n The Trump administration agreed to what was billed as a \"truce\" with Beijing in early 2020, almost two years after starting the trade war by slapping heavy tariffs on Chinese goods. As part of that deal, the two countries agreed to reduce some tariffs and allow Beijing to avoid additional taxes on almost $160 billion of the country's goods. China also agreed to purchase $200 billion worth of US products over the next couple of years.\n That agreement hasn't exactly played out as intended. As of November, China was on pace to purchase only about half of that amount, according to an analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n There are plenty of other loose ends, too. Trump never resolved some of Washington's biggest complaints about Beijing, including its favoritism for state-owned enterprises and his accusation that the country steals US technology. (Chinese officials have repeatedly denied such allegations and argued that any tech secrets handed over by American companies were part of agreed deals.)\n \"It might be tempting to go back to the good old days and just tie back together those frayed trade links,\" wrote Roger Kay, a tech analyst at Endpoint Technologies, in a report this week. But the US-China relationship was \"one-sided,\" he added, pointing out that Beijing has often demanded American companies partner with Chinese ones and hand over large stakes in their operations, among other requirements.\n While removing tariffs on Chinese goods likely won't be a big priority for Biden, several experts \u2014 and Yellen herself \u2014 said the new administration will want to make better use of its major alliances to craft a more predictable trade strategy. It's hard, for example, to see Biden attacking Washington's longtime European allies the way Trump did.\n Biden \"continues to say he wants to approach China via a coalition of other democracies, and that will take time to build,\" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. \"The [China] relationship is too important to ignore, but I don't see him rushing into anything.\"\n Biden will also have to navigate escalating tensions in technology and business. Those likely aren't going to subside, given bipartisan support for the view that China poses a major threat to US national security.\n After targeting telecoms equipment maker Huawei and social media platform TikTok, Trump ratcheted up the pressure on China as his term wound down. During its last few weeks, his administration imposed a series of harsh penalties on Chinese companies that will make it hard for Biden to easily reset relations, even if he wanted to.\n Chipmaker SMIC (SMICY), smartphone maker Xiaomi and a handful of other firms have been banned from accepting American investment, for example. And the New York Stock Exchange recently halted trading in three big Chinese telecom companies and several other firms to comply with the investment ban, which applies to companies that Washington deems to be affiliated with or supportive of the Chinese military.\n Some of Trump's recent actions \u2014 including an order that would ban US transactions with some Chinese apps \u2014 were not fully implemented during his time in office. Others, including his attempts to ban TikTok and Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat app, have been tied up in court. It's not clear whether Biden will try to see those measures through.\n But \"even if there is a return to measured language and diplomacy, we could see more strategic decoupling from Chinese digital companies\" under Biden, Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore, told CNN Business last week. He pointed to the possibility that Alibaba's (BABA) cloud services could face the kind of global backlash that Huawei's 5G business has run into.\n Some experts are more optimistic about how Biden might proceed.\n \"We expect Biden's team to focus on domestic issues,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a Wednesday research note. \"Although Biden's cabinet candidates have talked tough on China, we believe his strategy would be more consensual and less disruptive to financial markets.\"\n But others maintain that the prospect of worsening US-China tensions still exist. The consultancy Eurasia Group sees US-China tensions as one of the biggest risks of 2021, adding that Biden will likely enlist allies from the European Union, Japan and India to push back on China.\n \"The new administration will have some successes \u2014 suspicion of China is broadly growing,\" wrote Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer and Chairman Cliff Kupchan in a report this month.",

        "title": "'Walker' gets a new look with Jared Padalecki as the Texas Ranger",
        "body_text": "Occasionally a reboot comes along that's so different from the original you wonder why they bothered. \"Walker\" is one of those, dropping the \"Texas Ranger\" part of the title from the CBS series that signed off 20 years ago, and trading in Chuck Norris for \"Supernatural's\" Jared Padalecki, in what feels more like a family drama than a butt-kicking crime show.\n Part of that revised profile has to do with airing the series -- described as a \"reimagining,\" but really just a means of leveraging the name -- on the CW, a younger-skewing network than CBS. Indeed, that's especially true compared to the '90s when \"Walker\" patrolled Saturday nights along with Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" and \"Touched by an Angel,\" shows that disproportionately appealed to more rural communities seeking the TV equivalent of comfort food.\n Far from a taciturn loner, Cordell Walker comes home to Texas after an extended assignment out of town following the death of his wife. He comes back to a big, rambunctious family, including a pair of children (Violet Brinson, Kale Culley) harboring more just than the usual TV-teen resentments and rebellion, since dad shuffled them off to stay with their grandparents (Molly Hagan and \"The X-Files'\" Mitch Pileggi) while he was away.\n As for work, Walker is a bit of a dinosaur, told in no-uncertain terms that the old ways of police work have \"got to evolve,\" which might be a not-so-subtle cue to viewers that the previous show's \"kick first, ask questions later\" mentality was no longer going to fly.\n \"I'm learning,\" he says, in a way that sounds unexpectedly sincere.\n Other than the cowboy hats and drawls, there's not much to indicate the setting initially. Walker does get a new female partner in Micki Ramirez (Lindsey Morgan), who -- through a rather hastily incorporated run-in with a criminal -- pretty quickly earns his respect.\n CBS has enjoyed a fair amount of success with revivals like \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"Magnum P.I.\" and MacGyver,\" and name recognition is an asset just in terms of getting attention. Truth be told, if this show was titled \"Miller,\" odds are you wouldn't be reading word one about it here.\n The secret sauce here might be Padalecki and his easy-going charm, which after a 15-year run on \"Supernatural\" have almost become part of the CW's DNA. One suspects many of his fans will simply be happy to see him back in action, but even for them, \"Walker\" represents a relatively low-key way to get your kicks.\n \"Walker\" premieres Jan. 21 at 8 p.m. on the CW, which is half-owned by CNN parent WarnerMedia.",

        "title": "'Welcome Back America': Newspapers around the world react to Biden's inauguration",
        "body_text": "The culmination of Joe Biden's journey to the Oval Office was seen far beyond Washington DC on Thursday, with images of his inauguration splashed across the front pages of newspapers around the world.\n Papers in most countries marked the dawn of the Biden era with pictures of the new US President taking the oath of office, and many highlighted the slew of executive orders he signed on his first day.\n Some front pages also reflected on the end of the tumultuous Trump era, and a handful took a parting swipe at the former President -- a decision indicative of the relief much of the international community felt as his time in office drew to a close.\n But for the most part, it was Biden who commanded the spotlight. Here's a selection of front pages from various parts of the world.\n Canada's National Post was one of many papers to pick out Biden's proclamation, made in his inaugural address, that \"democracy has prevailed.\"\n It noted Biden's message of healing, writing that \"an extraordinary, sometimes violent, transition of American power came to a peaceful end Wednesday.\"\n The UK's Guardian newspaper highlighted the same line, splashing a picture of Biden delivering his speech across its front page, while The Daily Telegraph, focused on another line -- Biden's call to end \"this uncivil war\" that has divided the US.\n Britain's tabloid papers approached the inauguration with typical zeal, ignoring the high-minded rhetoric of Biden's speech in favor of a swipe at his predecessor. \"Don's Gone... Let's Go Joe!\" the Daily Mail wrote. The Metro encouraged Biden to \"Now Make America Great Again,\" re-purposing Trump's long-running slogan. The Daily Mirror called Wednesday \"A day of hope\" and the Daily Express said it was a \"Big Moment for the US and Britain.\"\n Scottish newspaper The National went so far as to bid \"good riddance\" to Trump -- adding the words \"you're fired\" in reference to the former president's past role on TV series \"The Apprentice.\"\n But the most irreverent front page came from the Daily Star, which superimposed Trump's face onto a picture of the Incredible Hulk.\n Biden has spoken frequently of his Irish heritage, and his win was marked by front page headlines across the country. The Irish Examiner called it \"A New Day,\" while The Irish Times said he \"reset the tone\" with his address.\n \"Welcome Back America\" was the message on the front of La Stampa, one of Italy's most-read newspapers. Trump was widely unpopular across western Europe, and many EU leaders expressed relief at the beginning of Biden's term.\n Spain's El Mundo welcomed Biden with the frank assessment that \"There is much to heal in the US.\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said after Biden was sworn in: \"Today is a great day ... We'll work with the US for democracy and the reinforcement of a more just, sustainable & inclusive global governance.\"\n Most of Australia's Thursday papers went to print before Biden was sworn in, so many focused on Trump's departure -- with a fairly clear stance on the outgoing leader. \"Don Let the Door Hit You on the Way Out\" was the West Australian's blunt sendoff, while the tabloid NT News opted for a pun in its equally dismissive farewell.\n The Guardian picked up on Biden's promise to lead all Americans, not just those who voted for him. Nigeria's Burna Boy was included on Biden's official inauguration playlist on Wednesday.\n The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based daily for English readers, featured a picture of Biden with his wife, Jill Biden, and the Second Family waving during the ceremony.\n Meanwhile, Gulf Today referred to Trump as a \"trumped-up leader\" in its front page coverage of the inauguration of Biden, which featured an image of the 46th president taking the oath.",

        "title": "Lifesaving Covid-19 antibody treatments are plentiful, but still sitting on the shelf",
        "body_text": "To treat Covid-19 patients with monoclonal antibodies -- one of the few lifesaving treatments available -- Piedmont Healthcare in Georgia had to restructure office areas, lay in new IT and recruit staff.\n They had to do it all over the holidays. During a pandemic.\n \"It's been a massive effort on a lot of people's part,\" said Scott McAuley, executive director of pharmacy for Piedmont, who had to figure out how to create the Covid-19 monoclonal antibody treatment program.\n Giving someone these treatments is not as simple as swallowing a pill. Because they are infectious, patients undergoing this treatment need to be kept separate from others. A nurse in full protective gear needs to administer the treatment for about an hour and then monitor the patient for another.\n \"It does prevent hospitalizations, but the logistics of it have been daunting and of course staffing with nurses in our current national health crisis has its own struggle as well,\" McAuley said.\n Piedmont's program now treats about 250 Covid-19 patients a week, but around the country, health officials have said the treatments haven't been used nearly enough in the months they've been available.\n In Michigan, for example, less than 10% of available Covid-19 monoclonal antibody treatments have been used, Dr. William Fales, the medical director at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said during a news briefing last week.California health officials told CNN that facilities in their state had administered 8% of monoclonal antibody stock on hand during the week of January 13.\n Since the therapies received an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in November, US Department of Health and Human Services said it has allocated nearly 800,000 courses. As of Monday, it has delivered 454,087 courses of Eli Lilly's bamlanivimab and 96,923 courses of Regeneron's cocktail, casirivimab/imdevimab.\n But as the Biden administration rolls out its own national strategy to control the pandemic, it's not clear exactly how many of the distributed antibody treatments have actually treated patients, or where. That information is not posted on the HHS website or tracked on state dashboards.\n HHS told CNN in early January that average utilization of the antibody therapies was at 25%. Eli Lilly said Wednesday that utilization for both antibody therapies authorized in the United States rose to 39%, according to information Operation Warp Speed shared with the company last week.\n Outgoing Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams last week urged doctors to prescribe the treatments \"much more frequently,\" and told people who test positive to seek them out.\"We need you to ask your provider about monoclonal antibodies as a way of keeping you out of the hospital,\" Adams said.\n \"The medications, these therapeutics are not being used as much as I, or the doctors on the task force, or the experts, career experts here in the HHS feel that they should be. I want to remind everyone that we're not helpless in our crusade against the virus.\"\n A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, Molly McCully, said in an email the company is seeing \"steady improvement in utilization week to week.\" She added the company is partnering with the government to raise awareness about the treatments.\n Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokesperson, said the company recognizes there \"have been challenges with the last 10 yards in terms of easily administering the antibody to patients.\"\n \"Our team has worked so hard to develop and test this medicine in record time, and obviously we want it to reach as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible,\" Bowie said in an email.\n \"Given the antibody rollout coincided with a surge in the virus in most states, it's been understandably difficult for healthcare providers/centers that are already maxed out,\" Bowie said. \"But we are on calls every day with government leaders who are responding to patient/physician feedback and working to make sure more Americans have access to these medicines.\"\n Regeneron said it has also been trying to educate providers and raise awareness through social media.\n Education seems to be working. North Dakota, for example, said that it, too, has been trying to help get the word out to clinicians and the public. It's also something contract tracers mention when they reach out to people to let them know they've been exposed to someone with Covid-19.\n \"Initially there was a lot of skepticism with these medicines,\" said Dr. Joshua Ranum, the vice president of the North Dakota Medical Association. \"Now there has been a very aggressive public outreach here. I've seen a lot more patient awareness and acceptance and we've seen some pretty dramatic results with efficacy.\"\n While use of monoclonal antibody treatments was \"low\" it has been steadily growing, according to North Dakota public information officer Heather Steffl. She said use of the treatments has grown from 450 infusions during the first six weeks to an average now of 650 a week.\n And it has helped. Steffl said the state has seen \"success\" with the treatments and a decreasing number of hospitalizations.\n One health care system that has embraced the treatments is South Dakota-based Sanford Health, which manages 46 hospitals and 200 senior care locations in 26 states.\n Sanford said it has treated more than 1,400 patients to date with both Lilly and Regeneron antibody therapies.\n \"Don't get me wrong, there was a little bit of a build to do this,\"  said Dr. Jermey Cauwels, Sanford's chief physician. \"But quite honestly, when we saw that this is something that is going to help us through the worst of the crisis, we said 'Let's see how fast we can set this up.' \"\n Sanford's electronic record system was one key to the program's success, Cauwels said. It's now set it up to automatically flag when someone tests positive for Covid-19. The system notifies a group that quickly determines if the patient is eligible for the treatment and if they are, Sanford calls to get them into clinic as soon as possible.\n Cauwels said the treatments have already prevented at least 40 hospitalizations, several deaths \"and more than a year's worth of hospital days.\"\n \"That's just for doing this for a couple of months,\" Cauwels said.\n \"We had lots of anxiety about setting it all up, but once we got it up and running, it has just been very rewarding to see patients so appreciative,\" Ollis said. \"And the staff, they're feeling very hopeful that there's now something that they can actually do to help the patient and hopefully stop the disease process from getting so bad.\"\n CNN's Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Emergency physician Dr. Alex Yeats had just whipped up what seemed like an appetizing dinner option when his wife let him know she wasn't having anything to do with it.\n \"It was black bean pasta with almonds and turmeric chunks and I was like 'I'm not eating that, it's disgusting,'\" said Sarah Yeats, 31, an emergency nurse from Atlantic Beach, Florida.\n The couple both work at a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, and she had contracted Covid-19 at work and brought it home in August.\n Like many people who have gotten the coronavirus, they noticed shortly after testing positive that they'd lost much of their sense of smell and taste.\n For weeks, they'd been coaxing any sensation they could muster from foods by dousing chicken in lemon juice, throwing fistfuls of fresh herbs at soups and salads and getting daring with textures in an attempt to bring some excitement to the table.\n The day Sarah noticed she no longer found turmeric chunks acceptable atop pasta, she said, was when she realized her sense of taste might be rebounding.\n Anosmia \u2014 a condition known as \"smell blindness,\" or loss of smell \u2014 is a common symptom of Covid-19 (and other viruses), and can severely impact people's ability to taste, since the senses are intertwined.\n \"It appears that loss of smell or taste are some of the most specific indicators of Covid-19, in particular early indicators,\" said emergency physician and CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. \"Even without having any other symptoms, including congestion, (Covid-19 patients) report that they cannot smell or taste.\"\n And while most people regain their sense of smell or taste within days to weeks, Wen said, \"there are still many who have not regained their sense of smell after months.\"\n People still need to eat, of course, and they're modifying their meals as a result.\n A few days after testing positive for the virus in mid-December, Althea Mullarkey, 53, suddenly realized she could no longer smell the strong gardenia scent of her shampoo.\n She tore through the house, sniffing everything she could find, and realized her sense of smell had vanished.\n The self-described foodie who lives in New York's Hudson Valley said she no longer likes the mouthfeel of eggs, since she can't taste them. And she doesn't want to waste her blunted sense of taste on a good piece of blue cheese, a former favorite.\n Recently, Mullarkey said, she ate leftover \"spicy-sweet coleslaw with pulled pork\" for breakfast. Her go-to dinner has become lemon-dill hummus squeezed with more lemon, a side of pitted kalamata olives and a piece of toasted naan slathered with spicy oil.\n \"I can taste the salt and pepper and lemon and I like the crispy textures,\" Mullarkey said, but none of the layers of flavors she used to love experimenting with in the kitchen are coming through.\n There is a simple explanation for that, said Dr. Marta Becker, an otolaryngologist with Philadelphia-based BergerHenry ENT Specialty Group, who's part of a team developing an app for long-haul Covid-19 patients to track their symptoms.\n \"Some sensations of our food \u2014 spicy hot pepper, mintiness \u2014 are things we experience with the hot and cold sensors of our mouth,\" she said. \"You can get the acid, heat, even saltiness, but not the layers of things like cilantro and chipotle.\"\n Most of our sense of what we think of as taste, Becker said, isn't really taste at all.\n \"All the interesting things about our food that we use to identify things like cheese and fruits and chocolate and coffee are not done with our mouth,\" she said. \"They're done with our nose.\"\n \"We don't think it's very common for people to actually lose their sense of taste (with Covid-19). If you really drill down, it's the olfactory function in the nose that's not working.\"\n That might explain why texture, color and even rituals around cooking have become more important to some people right now.\n \"Texture has become a lot more important to me,\" said Alex Yeats, 42. He and Sarah eat salmon several times a week because it has a fuller, more umami body and a better mouthfeel than a flaky white fish, which \"just tastes dry.\"\n \"I wanted to make sure there was green in everything,\" Sarah said. \"Foods that are white and gray, they're just so unappealing now.\"\n Immersing in the processes of cooking and meal planning each week also helped her keep interested in food prep. \"Having Covid inspired us to use our raclette oven because it's a process for cooking that makes it fun.\"\n Phantom smells are a common topic in online Covid-19 support groups.\n Even months since their diagnoses, the couple have gotten whiffs of jet fuel and cigarette smoke where there was none. Mullarkey said she has smelled such intense phantom smoke and ash odors, they've nearly made her gag.\n According to Becker, that's promising news.\n \"A lot of people get trash, or smoke, something rotten or burning rubber,\" Becker said of phantom smells her patients have noted. \"It's really gross, but it's usually a good sign things are trying to sort themselves out. When recovery happens, sometimes the wires can get crossed.\"\n While it's still unknown why people lose their sense of smell with Covid-19, Wen said \"it's thought that the coronavirus doesn't affect nerve cells that control smell but rather the cells around them.\"\n That, too, is considered good news for recovery, since supporting cells regenerate easier than neurons.\n \"When the cells grow back, it might take some time and retraining to get back to normal,\" she said.\n Retraining her sense of smell is something that Kaya Cheshire \u2014 who said she's still missing 90% of her sense of smell since contracting a mild case of Covid-19 last July \u2014 has been trying out, along with adding far more herbs and spices than usual to her food.\n \"I really miss smell,\" said Cheshire, 28, who lives in London and is head of marketing for WorkClub. She said she'd have Covid-19 \"five times\" to get her smell back.\n \"It's so nostalgic to smell food cooking,\" she said. \"Adding lemon or cloves and those aromatic things enhance everything and make me feel like I'm not missing out as much \u2014 even though I know I am.\"\n At her doctor's suggestion, Cheshire recently began \"scent training,\" using things like rose, lemons, cloves, garlic, eucalyptus and menthols that have a really strong smell to retrain her brain.\n \"I'm trying to think about how things used to smell so I can remember them and recognize that scent again,\" she said.\n Becker said it's a tactic she recommends to patients since there is no cure for anosmia.\n \"Retraining your brain to what things smell like so you can remember is a bit mysterious,\" she said. \"But using the memory to retrain the neurons can work in both directions. The memory can help you smell, and the smell can help you remember.\"\n And you don't need a fancy essential oils kit, she said. \"Just use the things you have to match that smell up with the memory of your smell.\"\n That could be something aromatic and nostalgic for dinner, too.\n Sarah Yeats \u2014 who has recovered most of her sense of smell and taste, but not all \u2014 recently made a bowl of ramen brimming with cilantro and green onions in a rich broth.\n \"I'm trying to serve foods that seem more flavorful and look prettier,\" she said.\n For her husband, Alex, the dish was a form of memory itself.\n \"Since I remember what it smells and tastes like, I can imagine it, and it's helpful,\" he said.\n Terry Ward is freelance writer based in Tampa, Florida.",

        "title": "Biden's solicitor general will play critical role in early efforts to undo Trump policies",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden will name a powerhouse lawyer, Elizabeth Prelogar, to serve as acting solicitor general, in an acknowledgment that the office charged with representing the government before the Supreme Court will face an enormous workload both reversing Trump administration legal positions and developing a defense strategy as Biden's executive actions come under inevitable legal challenge.\n Under normal circumstances, when an election produces an administration of a different political stripe, the solicitor general plays a key role managing a wave of potential reversals on certain issues. As Biden replaces Donald Trump, however, it could look more like a tsunami.\n In the short term, for instance, the solicitor general's office is likely to notify the court of a new position in a blockbuster dispute concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act, defending the law rather than seeking to overturn it -- but also in other cases tied to controversial Trump policies, some of which the Biden administration may attempt to rescind before the Supreme Court can rule on them.\n Under the Trump administration, the solicitor general's office was particularly aggressive defending a broad array of Trump's policies in hot button areas such as immigration, religion and abortion, often asking the justices to jump in before an issue had made its way through the lower courts.\n Biden has yet to put forward his nominee for the permanent job. The solicitor general is the person who traditionally represents the US government in cases at the Supreme Court and regularly jousts with the justices in their majestic red velvet lined chamber -- or, as with current practice, over the telephone.\n In the interim, Prelogar will be in the forefront. She is a veteran of the Office of Solicitor General having served as an assistant in the office and also worked recently as an adviser to former special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election.\n Prelogar worked as a former clerk to Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for Attorney General, as well as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. Biden has yet to nominate a full-time solicitor general, and once that person is confirmed, she will be the principal deputy.\n \"She's a spectacular lawyer with impeccable integrity and is ideal for this role in the Department,\" said Andrew Goldstein, a former top Mueller team prosecutor.\n But while moving quickly, the Biden solicitor general's office also must be careful so as not to irritate justices who expect the government to be an honest broker acting in the long-term interests of the United States, not on the particular whim of one president or another. The court treats government lawyers with special solicitude, but in turn, the justices expect a level of consistency even when an election triggers a change of party in the executive branch.\n \"The credibility of the office in great measure depends on the idea that judges actually believe that is what you are doing,\" Kagan, who served as President Barack Obama's solicitor general before her eventual elevation to the high court, said in 2018.\n Kagan said the office made clear that its mission was supposed to serve the interest of the United States.\n \"I think changing positions is a really big deal that people should hesitate a long time over, which is not to say it never happens,\" she allowed.\n \"It's always a sensitive matter when the Solicitor General has to change positions,\" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center said in an interview. \"But Biden's pick will have no choice but to do so in a number of high-profile cases.\"\n In the case of the Affordable Care for instance, already there are blue and red states lined up on both sides of the issue. But the Trump administration argued that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the entire sprawling law should fall -- leaving the health care of millions in legal limbo.\n It may only be a symbolic move that won't change the outcome of the case, but the new solicitor general will likely make clear to the court that the administration believes the signature legislative achievement of Obama's administration is on solid legal ground. The justices heard arguments on November 10.\n Because the lawsuit was brought by Texas and other GOP-led states, rather than the Trump administration itself, the Biden Justice Department can change its stance but that wouldn't result in the case becoming moot.\n On February 22 the justices are scheduled to hear arguments concerning funding for Trump's border wall. And on March 1 they are scheduled to take on Trump's policy that mandates that non-Mexican asylum seekers stay in Mexico as they await hearings in the United States.\n How the Biden administration and court will proceed is an open question. The President on Wednesday ended the national emergency that the Trump administration had used to divert money for the border wall. And it is suspending the program regarding asylum seekers.\n The next day the court will consider a case concerning the Voting Rights Act.\n Although not scheduled for oral arguments yet the court has also agreed to hear two cases concerning the Trump administration's effort to allow states to impose work requirements in their Medicaid programs.\n \"Every cross-party transition raises these kinds of issues, but this one seems different in two respects,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"First, the court has an unusually high number of cases challenging the old administration's policies on its docket this term, raising the specter that a number of those cases go away if and when the new administration rescinds them. Second, the Trump administration has been unusually aggressive in its litigation posture before the Justices -- whereas the Biden administration may be inclined to move slower on high-profile, hot-button cases.\"\n Along with cases on the docket, the justices are also currently considering whether to take up additional cases linked to Trump -- some of which might become moot after he is no longer in office. Cases that are currently pending concern Trump's Twitter feed, two cases concerning whether he violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, others concerning restrictions that bar family planning clinics that  receive federal funds from making referrals for abortion as well as petitions related to immigration.\n And there is an emergency petition arising from Trump's personal lawyers who are asking the court to block the release of his tax returns to a NY prosecutor.\n On his first day as president, Biden released several new executive actions and promised more to come. Critics are likely to race to court to try to stop them.\n \"The Biden administration should take a both/and approach to executive action and legislative priorities,\" Wydra said. \"There is a lot of damage from the Trump administration that can and should be addressed immediately through executive action -- on police reform and immigration issues, for example -- while simultaneously pushing Congress for broader and more permanent legislation,\" she said.\n The solicitor general position needs Senate confirmation which often takes some time.\n If Biden -- perhaps thinking that he might get a Supreme Court appointment in the near term, perhaps from a retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer \u2014 wants to take a page from the Obama/Kagan playbook he could name someone like California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger so as to prepare her for a potential seat on the high court. But Kruger may not want to leave a good job to face a bitter confirmation battle that might in short order lead to another battle for the high court.\n No less than Chief Justice John Roberts once served as a deputy in the office. At his confirmation hearing in 2005 he spoke of the experience.\n \"I always found it very moving to stand before the Justices and say, 'I speak for my country,'\" he said.\n For legendary Justice Thurgood Marshall, working as solicitor general was the \"best job I've ever had.\"\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Buttigieg eyes more mask restrictions on 'all modes of transportation'",
        "body_text": "Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the Biden administration will look at \"all relevant authorities\" at its disposal toward a federal mask mandate on all forms of transportation, part of his confirmation hearing that could put the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor on the path to becoming the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet secretary.\n \"We are prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the President's executive order to ensure that across all modes of transportation, workers, passengers, commuters are protected,\" Buttigieg told Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts during his confirmation hearing before the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\n Buttigieg, who gained national attention during his upstart presidential campaign, is also expected to play a central role in President Joe Biden's push for a bipartisan infrastructure package. During the campaign, Biden proposed spending $1.3 trillion over 10 years to build schools, roads, bridges, railroads and pipes, expand broadband access and usher in a \"100% clean energy economy.\"\n \"We need to build our economy back, better than ever,\" Buttigieg said. \"The Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden's infrastructure vision creating millions of good-paying jobs, revitalizing communities that have been left behind, enabling American small businesses, workers, families and farmers to compete and win in the global economy, and tackling the climate crisis.\"\n Buttigieg often spoke about infrastructure on the campaign trail from the perspective of a small-town mayor, arguing that local governments like the one he once ran needed people in Washington who understood their needs and issues.\n Buttigieg said in his nomination hearing that he would also work to implement reforms to prevent disasters like the Boeing 737 Max crashes, and is willing to make personnel changes, including at the Federal Aviation Administration, where some top-ranking positions are currently vacant.\n \"Engineers and the FAA should be in the driver's seat,\" said Buttigieg.\n Some top Democrats believed that Biden wanted to get Buttigieg, 39, a top post as a way to elevate a rising star in the Democratic Party. Buttigieg's future aspirations are no secret, but the former mayor's political future in his conservative home state has long been a roadblock.\n Buttigieg served as South Bend mayor from 2012 to 2020, and served as an intelligence officer in the US Navy Reserves for six years. He was deployed for six months to Afghanistan in 2014.\n After he returned, Buttigieg came out as gay in a 2015 essay for the South Bend Tribune. Later that year, then-Mayor Buttigieg won reelection.\n Buttigieg often spoke about being gay during his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and for many LGBTQ Americans, he became a symbol of progress. His marriage to Chasten Buttigieg and presidential campaign normalized being gay and married in presidential politics.\n \"I'm proud to have him by my side, and I want to thank him for his many sacrifices and his support in making it possible for me to pursue public service,\" said Buttigieg of his husband.\n While the Senate is now controlled by Democrats, the nomination hearing before the committee is chaired by Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, because Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer have not yet reached a deal on how to share power in a 50-50 Senate.\n That agreement will not only determine the number of seats that each party holds on Senate committees, but also will give Democrats the power to rule them. Until then, the Senate will operate under the rules of the last Congress, when the GOP led the Senate.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.\n CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Manu Raju, Pete Muntean and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Impeachment trial hangs over Biden's first days in office",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden is calling for unity, but with an impeachment trial of an ex-President around the corner, a long list of nominations still to be confirmed in the US Senate and Republicans already casting doubt on the need for another massive Covid-19 relief package, don't expect the mirage of bipartisanship to last long.\n Biden's agenda isn't going to sail through the narrowly-held Democratic Senate. In the House, the new President will have to contend with competing factions for moderates and progressives who each believe they've been handed a mandate to govern.\n Bottom line: The Biden team is just getting started and the US Senate is still getting organized. There's a lot of wrinkles to iron out in the days ahead, and the goodwill isn't going to last long, especially once lawmakers are confined to their desks starting at 12 p.m. ET every day dealing with an impeachment trial.\n Important to watch Thursday: All eyes are on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and what she does with the articles. She has a news conference scheduled for 10:45 a.m.\n The reality is no one knows yet how long this trial is going to be. Talks are ongoing. Democrats will hold their normal caucus call Thursday to talk about this. As CNN reported on Wednesday night, the aim is to move this trial along quickly. No one wants this hanging over Biden's agenda for the next month.\n An expedited trial? Sure. But a reminder that it will still take a majority of senators voting to move to a vote on conviction to end this. That means rank-and-file members have to be satisfied that the trial has been long enough to be fair. Likely, leaders will have a goal in mind when they start, but they need a majority of the Senate to decide they've had enough. Democratic members are fully aware that they are setting a precedent here. If they move too fast in the name of trying to get to Biden's agenda, they risk setting a standard that a president (or ex-president) can be convicted in a matter of days.\n As one Democratic source close to this process told CNN on Thursday morning \"anything is possible, but people are just throwing things out there.\" Last week, the source said \"people were floating a three-month trial.\"\n Pelosi has kept her plans on when exactly she will transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate extremely close. But, as CNN's Manu Raju reported on Wednesday night, there is talks she could transmit them soon and potentially the Senate could begin some of the ceremonial aspects of an impeachment trial as soon as Friday. For the last several days, the House impeachment managers have been working through their arguments and how they plan to lay out their case, but it's important to consider that we still don't know.\n Some Republicans are ready to move on. Others want to hold former President Donald Trump accountable and the well-respected Republican leader Mitch McConnell isn't revealing to his colleagues if he'll vote to convict Trump.\n CNN's Raju and Ted Barrett's story on Wednesday night captured the tension perfectly. Republicans are sending out a warning to McConnell that if he votes to convict Trump, there will be a price to pay.\n Already, you've seen members of the House Freedom Caucus trying to oust their No. 3 GOP Leader Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, for voting to impeach Trump in the House. Those efforts are a long shot. But, the intraparty schism right now is real as Republicans sort out what the party is without Trump at the top of the ticket.\n You are seeing Republicans approach impeachment with three separate views. You have a small number of Republicans who have signaled  that they think the country cannot move on without holding Trump accountable. You have some Trump allies continuing to stand by him and a growing number of Republicans who don't condone the Trump's actions on January 6, but are arguing that moving ahead with an impeachment trial of an ex-president is a fruitless, damaging process. You even have some Republicans arguing it's not constitutional at all to impeach an ex-president. Republicans are expected to talk Thursday about this on a regularly scheduled conference call.\n Yes, Biden has plans for another economic relief package and a massive overhaul of the country's immigration plan. But, those items aren't simply going to be picked up and passed without changes.\n Aides and Democratic members CNN is talking to warn that Biden's plans are good starts, but there are items that progressives and moderates want to see added and subtracted. A new Democratic administration means that Democrats believe they have a real shot at finally getting some of their agenda items through.\n As always, the complication comes when members begin really digging into these proposals and laying out their wishes. This is when some of the cracks that exist between what the progressives in the party and what the moderates in the party begin to show themselves.\n Biden's team is well aware of how legislating works. It's why you have seen the transition hosting policy briefs with various factions of the House Democratic caucus. It's why you see a group of 16 bipartisan senators planning to meet in the next several days with Biden's Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese.\n But all you have to do is look at how many messages were coming out on immigration on Wednesday to understand that Biden's legislative proposals are just starting points. You had Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, talking on the floor about passing the DREAM Act, a more narrow proposal than the one Biden's team has laid out. And Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, suggesting that there was still more work to do to try and reach out to Republicans and get some of them on board.\n The Senate hasn't officially passed their organizing resolution yet that establishes how many members are on each committee and how McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Schumer plan to run the 50-50 Senate.\n Democrats earlier this week thought they were being generous offering McConnell essential a mirror of the 2001 agreement between Trent Lott and Tom Daschle that split committees evenly and allowed Republicans and Democrats to preside over the Senate.\n The sticking point is still over the filibuster and McConnell's insistence that the organizing resolution includes some language to enshrine it. But progressive Democrats are making it clear to Schumer that he shouldn't cave on this even though it's unlikely Schumer would ever have the votes to do-away with the filibuster given that he'd need every one of his members to agree to it. It's putting Schumer in a tough position. In other words, this is adding even more complication to getting Biden's nominees through and voted on.",

        "title": "Divisive policies and actions from Trump-era that Biden could decide to alter",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden assumed the office intent on healing a deeply fractured country and reversing former President Donald Trump's divisive legacy.\n \"A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear, and now arise political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat,\" Biden said during his inaugural speech on Wednesday.\n For the past four years, the Trump administration embraced policies and initiatives targeting immigrants and undermining the nation's progress on civil rights. All while the President's own words incited violence and bigotry.\n Contrary to his predecessor's anti-immigration rhetoric, Biden unveiled a comprehensive plan right away that included a multi-year pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. On his first day in office, nine of the 17 actions he took directly reverse Trump's policies.\n Here's a look at some of the Trump-era policies and actions involving immigration, equality and bigotry that Biden is planning to tackle or that he could decide to alter:\n The policy ended in 2018 but officials are still scrambling to fix the problems it caused. Last year, lawyers said they haven't been able to reach the parents of 545 children from separated families -- and that hundreds of those parents were likely deported without their children.\n One of Biden's executive actions undoes Trump's expansion of immigration enforcement within the US.\n The policy, officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols, was implemented in 2019 amid an increase in migrant arrivals at the southern border, with officials arguing that it would deter migrants from making the journey north.\n Nearly 55,000 migrants, many of whom are from Central America, have been sent back to Mexico, where they have been left to wait for weeks, if not months, in regions deemed dangerous by the US State Department.\n In another effort to seal the US off from immigrants and refugees, the Trump administration spent billions on building a border wall.\n The Trump administration took a series of steps to erect additional barriers along the southern border, including declaring a national emergency to access additional funds, filing dozens of lawsuits to acquire private land, and waiving environmental and contracting laws to expedite construction.\n On Wednesday, Biden's order halted the construction of the border wall by terminating the national emergency declaration used to fund it.\n A federal judge ordered authorities to fully restore the program in December, allowing newly eligible immigrants to file new applications.\n Trump also spent years limiting the number of refugees coming into the country. For the current fiscal year, his administration set the lowest cap the US has seen in decades. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration enacted what critics described as unnecessary immigration restrictions, including new rules for international students, and blocked thousands of guest worker visas.\n During his first day in office, Biden fortified DACA.\n In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the third version of the travel ban after the previous iterations were challenged in court. The current policy restricts entry from 13 countries to varying degrees, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, along with Venezuela and North Korea.\n The administration has argued that the travel ban was vital for national security and ensures countries meet US security needs, by requiring a certain level of identity management and information-sharing requirements.\n On Wednesday, Biden reversed the Trump administration's restrictions on passport holders from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n He railed against the players, saying they were outraged about \"something that most of them are unable to define\" and reiterated his belief that players who don't stand for the National Anthem should be penalized.\n The protests began in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, sat and then knelt before several preseason and regular-season games. He said he did so to protest police shootings of African American men and other social injustices faced by Black people in the United States.\n Last year, Trump called the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement a \"symbol of hate\" and described people demonstrating for racial justice as \"thugs.\"\n Former US Attorney Jeff Sessions spoke against consent decrees and police investigations, arguing that the cases can lower police morale.  Before Sessions left the department in November 2018, he put in place a memo that required consent agreements to be \"narrowly tailored\" to the injuries caused by misconduct and limited the use of court monitors, among other stipulations.\n The rule was enacted in 2015 as a way to bolster the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which outlawed restrictions on selling or renting homes to people based on race. In 1973, Trump and his father were accused in a federal civil rights case of violating those restrictions. The case was eventually settled after Trump attempted to counter-sue.\n Despite the Fair Housing Act being in effect for decades, many neighborhoods remained segregated, with communities of color less likely to have access to good schools, health care and public programs necessary to help citizens rise out of poverty. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule was considered essential to further level the playing field for underprivileged populations.\n The President's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, considered quitting and the corporate titans who composed his business advisory council stepped down but the controversy appeared to have had few long-term consequences within the White House.\n In a national address days after the shooting, Trump called on the nation to condemn racism and White supremacy. But he stopped short of acknowledging his own divisive and racist rhetoric.\n A year before, a gunman killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, an incident considered the deadliest attack ever on Jews in the US. Federal prosecutors filed hate crime charges against the suspect, who previously claimed Jews were helping transport members of migrant caravans from Central America.  The Trump administration described the group of migrants as a national security threat.\n While Trump denounced the Pittsburgh shooting, the massacre widened a national debate over the President's divisive rhetoric. Some people, including a local rabbi, said the President's hateful speech had led to the massacre.\n Hours before the insurrection, Trump had addressed a crowd of supporters gathered on the Ellipse near the White House, fanning false allegations of voter fraud and telling them to \"fight like hell.\"\n \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we're probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong,\" he said.\n Trump was impeached for a second time because of his role inciting the insurrection.\n Biden called for racial justice and unity in America on Wednesday, acknowledging that the nation has been deeply divided by political forces and systemic racism.\n In his inaugural speech, Biden denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the nation needs to be repaired and healed.\n \"To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: Unity. Unity,\" Biden said, speaking from the same platform that had been stormed by armed insurrectionists two weeks ago.\n He acknowledged that speaking of unity can sound foolish these days, but the struggles the nation faces are not new.\n \"I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality of racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart,\" he said, before adding that the better angels of the nation have always prevailed.\n CNN's Eric Bradner, Betsy Klein and Christopher Hickey contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The religious books used during the swearing-ins -- and the symbolism behind them",
        "body_text": "There were a number of notable swearings-in on Wednesday (though the President's oath arguably received the most attention). Aware of the attention their ceremonies would receive, the five elected officials who began their terms this week chose the religious texts they'd take their oaths on with care.\n The Bibles -- and, in Sen. Jon Ossoff's case, Hebrew Scripture -- that President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and more used for their swearings-in this week reflect the values important to them: Family. Faith. Equality -- fitting themes for a presidency, and by extension, a Congress, that seeks to be defined by unity and healing.\n President Biden was sworn in on a 19th-century Bible that's been in his family since the late 1800s. Biden has used the five-inch thick Bible with a Celtic cross on its cover every time he's taken an oath of office, from his first Senate swearing-in in 1973 to his second swearing-in as vice president in 2013.\n His late son, Beau Biden, also used the Bible when he was sworn in as Delaware's attorney general in 2007.\n Vice President Harris was sworn in with two Bibles -- one that belonged to former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice in the nation's highest court, and another owned by Regina Shelton, Harris' former neighbor in California whom she considers a \"second mother.\"\n The Rev. Raphael Warnock took his oath in the Senate using a Bible gifted to him by members of Ebenezer Baptist Church when he became senior pastor, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Since 2005, Warnock has helmed the historic Atlanta church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached until his assassination. Ebenezer was the site of Rep. John Lewis' funeral in July.\n Jon Ossoff, the first Jewish senator from Georgia, was sworn in with a Hebrew Scripture that belonged to lauded Atlanta Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n Rothschild was former rabbi of the Temple, Atlanta oldest Jewish congregation -- also where Ossoff celebrated his bar mitzvah. Rothschild helmed the congregation during the early 20th century, when he denounced segregation, advocated for racial justice alongside MLK and shepherded Temple members after the building was bombed.\n The first Latino to represent California in the Senate and Harris' successor, Padilla took his oath with his mother's Bible, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n \"As the proud son of immigrants from Mexico, I'm committed to working as hard as my parents did to build a better future for the next generation,\" he tweeted after his swearing-in.\n Members of Congress aren't bound to using Bibles to take their oaths of office. According to the  Constitution, they are only bound \"by oath or affirmation\" to support the Constitution and no religious text is required as a qualification for office.\n Three presidents didn't use Bibles for their swearings-in: John Quincy Adams used a volume of law; Theodore Roosevelt took his oath without any books or religious texts -- he became president after his predecessor WIlliam McKinley died; and Lyndon B. Johnson used a Catholic missal belonging to President John F. Kennedy after Kennedy's assassination.\n In 2007, Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim member of Congress, took his oath with a Quran -- a choice that incensed some members of the House at the time. In 2019, Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, the first Muslim women in the House of Representatives, were sworn in with their own copies of the Quran (though Tlaib considered using Thomas Jefferson's copy of the Muslim text).\n Though not a lawmaker, former ambassador to Sweden and Liechtenstein Suzi LeVine made an unusual choice for her 2014 swearing-in. Instead of a physical text, she took her oath with an Amazing Kindle e-reader and a digital version of the Constitution. It may've been a wink to her career in tech -- before her ambassadorship, LeVine worked for Microsoft.\n CNN's Devan Cole and Amanda Jackson contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Instacart is cutting more than 1,800 jobs, including its only unionized workers",
        "body_text": "Last February, a group of Instacart employees who worked as in-store shoppers at a Mariano's grocery store in Skokie, Illinois, voted to unionize in a historic moment for the gig economy.\n Nearly one year later, those workers have been informed that their jobs are being cut as part of a broader change to how Instacart does business with some grocers, including Kroger and Kroger-owned Mariano's stores.\n Instacart has informed the local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents the Instacart Skokie Mariano's bargaining unit, that approximately 366 Instacart in-store shoppers for Kroger-owned stores nationwide, including those at the Skokie Mariano's store, will lose their positions, according to a letter sent this week by a labor attorney representing Instacart.\n In total, Instacart is cutting more than 1,800 in-store shoppers, according to the letter, including those at the Kroger-owned stores, as a result of changes in how it works with partners. For pickup orders, grocers are increasingly using Instacart's platform to receive orders but leaning on their own workers, rather than Instacart's, to fulfill them.\n \"As a result of some grocers transitioning to a Partner Pick model, we'll be winding down our in-store operations at select retailer locations over the coming months,\" Instacart said in a statement. \"We're doing everything we can to support in-store shoppers through this transition.\"\n In a statement to CNN Business, a Kroger spokesperson said, \"the Kroger family of companies was not involved in Instacart's decision to suspend its in-store operations model. For those who are looking for a career opportunity, we have thousands of retail roles available.\"\n Instacart's employees at the Mariano's in Skokie are a rarity for the company and the gig economy broadly. Instacart has fewer than 10,000 part-time employee shoppers, who are entitled to benefits and protections that on-demand companies have largely fought against providing to their contract workers, including the right to unionize. The employees at Skokie became the first, and so far only, Instacart workers to vote to unionize, prompted by frustration at the company's use of algorithms to rate workers and its focus on speed.\n The layoffs make clear that Instacart, which added hundreds of thousands of contract workers during the pandemic, has been rethinking its relationship with some grocers, potentially jolting the livelihoods of some of its workers. It also highlights how tenuous union protection remains in the tech industry more broadly.\n \"As the union for Instacart grocery workers in the Chicago area and grocery workers nationwide, UFCW is calling on Instacart to immediately halt these plans and to put the health of their customers first by protecting the jobs of these brave essential workers at a time when our communities need them most,\" UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement.\n One of the impacted shoppers at the Mariano's store in Skokie, who was involved in the unionizing effort, said they came so far only to lose their jobs. \"I have a whole bunch of mixed emotions about the whole thing,\" the worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, told CNN Business.\n For months, the bargaining unit had been negotiating a contract with Instacart after last February's vote to unionize with UFCW. \"Then, it's just like okay, they're just changing the business model. ... I'm really angry.\"\n Instacart said in the letter it plans to \"transition\" how it works with Kroger \"no sooner than mid-March,\" ticking off a few options for impacted workers. Kroger already operates a Pickup service for groceries staffed by its own employees.\n It also said it could assist the workers to become contract workers, who do not enjoy the same benefits and protections as employees, and that it will offer separation packages of $250 to $750 based on tenure.\n Instacart has two shopper workforces. It has in-store shoppers, who are part-time employees of Instacart and work inside a particular store -- in this case, Mariano's -- to shop for items ordered by customers and then hand them off to a delivery worker who either contracts with Instacart or works for the grocer. It also has full-service shoppers, who it treats as contract workers; they both shop and deliver orders to customers' homes. Instacart counts roughly 500,000 of these workers.\n Unlike the contract workers who largely receive no benefits and protections, in-store shoppers are paid an hourly wage; they're also eligible for benefits such as unemployment, social security and Medicare, and more recently they were able to accrue sick pay.\n In the letter, Instacart said these part-time employees are \"significantly more expensive on a cost per-delivery basis\" than its contract workers in \"certain markets or retailers, including Kroger owned stores.\" Relying on the contract workers to both shop and deliver, Instacart wrote, \"will streamline Instacart's selection and delivery processes, reduce overhead costs and administrative burdens, and eliminate or reduce unproductive time and delivery delays.\" Further, it said the transitioning of work at Kroger \"will not adversely impact Instacart's customer service standards.\"\n This stands in contrast to Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta's comments in 2015 when the company first introduced the part-time employee role. He said \"the data showed\" that the employee model \"improved the quality and efficiency of order picking and made for a better customer experience.\"\n Notably, Instacart said in this week's letter that, beginning in 2018, it \"started reducing the number of [in-store shoppers] it employs in several regional markets, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis, San Diego and parts of Texas.\"\n Instacart's business has boomed during the pandemic, sending its private valuation soaring, and the company is expected to go public this year.\n Kroger is just the latest example of how Instacart's relationship with grocers and its workers is evolving. As CNN Business previously reported, Aldi and Sprouts similarly changed how they work with Instacart, resulting in the loss of jobs for Instacart's part-time shopper employee workforce as it has continued to scale up its contract workforce throughout the pandemic.\n The company said in a blog post this week about its evolving partnerships with grocers that it will also be piloting a new feature for its contract workers to shop and pack groceries to be picked up at the store by customers in order to meet the growing demand for pickup orders.",

        "body_text": "China says that it is a \"victim\" of misinformation after Twitter restricted the account of the Chinese embassy in the United States.\n \"In the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of [Uyghur] women in Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted,\" the tweet read, citing a report from state-run newspaper China Daily.\n At a regular briefing in Beijing on Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson defended the embassy's actions.\n \"We hope Twitter can uphold the principle of objectivity and impartiality, not to show double standards on this issue, but to strengthen screening, and identify what is false information, what are rumors and lies, and what is fact and truth.\"\n China's far western Xinjiang region has long been associated with reports of the forced sterilization of people from the Uyghur minority, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group residing in the area. Chinese officials have denied the allegations.\n The United States has officially determined that China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups who live in Xinjiang.\n \"This genocide is ongoing, and... we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state,\" former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Tuesday, on the last full day of the Trump administration.\n News of the Twitter restriction was first reported by Bloomberg.\n A Twitter spokesperson said that the tweet had violated the company's content policy, which prohibits \"the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity.\"\n The embassy's account, meanwhile, will remain locked until the Tweet is deleted, according to Twitter. In similar cases \u2014 including one involving former President Donald Trump's account \u2014 Twitter has required the user to manually delete the post in question before regaining the ability to post.\n The Chinese embassy, for its part, has not tweeted since January 9.\n It is not clear whether the embassy intends to delete the post to restore its account. The delegation in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular US business hours.\n Twitter and other social media companies have been grappling with the consequences of how their platforms can sometimes be used to spread incendiary speech. Such concerns led several platforms to ban Trump outright earlier this month after he incited a riot at the US Capitol.\n In December, the European Commission proposed vast new oversight and transparency laws for social media. The proposed law would even require the platforms to disclose their algorithms for advertising and recommended content.\n \"I hope that there will not be some kind of overreach in measures adopted that will silence speech or take the wrong approach,\" said Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit that defends online civil liberties, referring to global efforts to regulate the space.\n Twitter is one of several US-based social media platforms that are blocked in China, along with Facebook (FB) and Instagram. Despite this, Chinese diplomats and agencies have increasingly been using Twitter to promote Beijing's interests around the world.\n \u2014 Brian Fung, Scott McLean and CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have moved out of their Washington, DC, home, and have signed a one-year lease on a luxury condo in Miami at the Arte, an expensive oceanfront residential building, a source familiar with the couple's move confirmed to CNN.\n The last of their moving trucks departed the now-vacant property in the Kalorama neighborhood of DC Thursday. Trump's and Kushner's items are scheduled to be delivered to Miami, said a source with information on where the trucks were headed.\n The Wall Street Journal was first to report the Trump-Kushner Miami rental.\n CNN reached out to a representative for Ivanka Trump and has not immediately received a response.\n Rents at The Arte, which is noted for its triangular shape, hover in the $40,000-per-month range and units typically sell for between $7 and 15 million.\n The condo puts the family closer to the lot of land they purchased last month for $32 million on exclusive Indian Creek Island, also in the Miami area. The source familiar with the couple's move told CNN the family intends to use the condo as they develop and build what they are for now intending to be a more permanent home at Indian Creek.\n \"(Indian Creek Island) is one of Miami's most private and sought after neighborhoods, frequented by high net-worth individuals seeking privacy,\" said Dora Puig, who has during her career sold more than $3 billion worth of real estate and is the owner of a luxury boutique brokerage in the area. (Puig was not involved in the sale or purchase of the Trump-Kushner transaction.)\n Puig said the extreme security measures at Indian Creek enjoyed by residents is one of the main reasons wealthy people are willing to pay into the tens of millions for a piece of land and views of the water surrounding it, waters monitored around the clock by armed private security.\n Before leaving office, former President Donald Trump signed a memorandum extending US Secret Service protection by six months for all his children, according to a senior US official.\n Mar-a-Lago, which is about an hour's drive from Indian Creek, is not a viable option for the Trump-Kushners to set permanent roots, mainly because it is a club with paying members and very little in the way of privacy -- perfect environs for her attention-loving father.\n CNN has reported on Ivanka Trump's desire to perhaps run for political office in Florida. Trump had a taste of what the state might hold for her politically during her many campaign stops there last fall to stump for her father; she visited Florida multiple times in the run-up to the presidential election, drawing capacity audiences at events as well as raising millions of dollars at fundraisers.\n Trump and Kushner, their three young children and two live-in nannies resided in the Kalorama rental during their tenure working as senior advisers in the White House.",

        "title": "Here's how to buy bitcoin without all the risk of buying bitcoin",
        "body_text": "Bitcoin is up more than 260% over the past 12 months -- a stellar ride -- yet owning the asset is fraught with risks including wild swings in cryptocurrency prices. But there are several ways for investors to get a piece of the bitcoin boom without investing directly in bitcoin.\n Several companies that are cashing in on bitcoin's rise are publicly traded, including Galaxy Digital (BRPHF), the cryptocurrency investing firm run by bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz, a top bitcoin bank called Silvergate (SI) and bitcoin mining firm Riot Blockchain (RIOT). Investors who want exposure to bitcoin can also buy the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n There's also lots of excitement about an upcoming IPO: Coinbase, a top bitcoin exchange, is set to go public later this year. And many more established companies, such as PayPal, are benefiting from the bitcoin bump.\n \"There are ways to get exposure to bitcoin without owning bitcoin,\" said Daniel Polotsky, CEO and founder of CoinFlip, a bitcoin ATM that lets users buy cryptocurrencies with cash.\n To be sure, crypto-related stocks can be volatile despite the dramatic increase in demand for bitcoin over the past year.\n Earlier this week, for example, Janet Yellen -- President Joe Biden's pick for Treasury Secretary --  made skeptical comments about cryptocurrencies and sparked another sell-off. That comes shortly after a strategist at Bank of America dubbed bitcoin euphoria \"the mother of all bubbles\" And there have been recent stories of investors losing their crypto wallet passwords, leaving them unable to access their bitcoin.\n Bitcoin-related stocks are also unpredictable and can sometimes plunge even on good news. That's because their prices are so closely tied to bitcoin prices.\n Silvergate, which reported earnings Wednesday after the market closed, plunged nearly 15% Thursday. That might be excessive given that the bank noted that its digital currency deposits more than doubled in the fourth quarter to $5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter.\n \"2020 was a year of significant growth and expansion for our business...as investment in digital currencies increased among the institutional investor community,\" said Silvergate CEO Alan Lane in a press release.\n Lane is referring to the fact that high-profile money managers such as Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and Anthony Scaramucci have all embraced bitcoin as of late.\n The interest from well-known money managers is a main reason why Mike Venuto, portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), a fund that invests in bitcoin and blockchain technology companies, owns Silvergate.\n Venuto, who also holds Galaxy Digital in the fund as well as bitcoin miners Riot Blockchain, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Hive Blockchain (HVBTF), said he's looking for the pure-play companies in crypto that stand to benefit the most from bitcoin's rise.\n \"These are more mature companies with real financials,\" Venuto said.\n Their stock prices have fluctuated wildly recently along with bitcoin. But Venuto dubbed the miners the \"picks and axes\" of the industry -- companies that should do well as long as bitcoin prices head higher.\n His fund also owns larger blue chip stocks that are benefiting from surging bitcoin demand.\n Venuto likes Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, because it is also the majority owner of Bakkt, a crypto futures trading platform. Bakkt announced earlier this month it plans to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company named VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings.\n And Venuto's fund also invests in digital payment giants Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL), which now allow users to trade bitcoin. BTIG fintech analyst Mark Palmer upgraded PayPal's stock to a \"buy\" on Thursday, citing the company's recent move into crypto as the main motivation.\n Palmer said in a report that PayPal's cryptocurency business could add more than $1 billion to the company's annual revenues by next year and that the payment platform \"is poised to play a leading role in promoting the acceptance of crypto\" for both investors and merchants.\n The bitcoin bonanza should help Square along with MicroStrategy (MSTR), a software company that recently made waves by saying it was putting some of its corporate cash into bitcoin.\n These stocks could be better bets for investors not comfortable mining cryptocurrency themselves, said Hong Fang, CEO of OKCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n \"Look at Square: A lot of its growth is from its bitcoin business,\" she said. \"Square is now a crypto stock, to be honest.\"\n That's another reason some think crypto-related stocks could continue to benefit. More big money managers may join so-called mom and pop investors and scoop up shares in companies such as Square, PayPal and the upcoming Coinbase IPO.\n That makes the recent bitcoin spike different from the surge more than three years ago, said Alda Leu Dennis, general partner of Initialized Capital, a venture capital firm with a stake in Coinbase.\n \"The 2017 bitcoin runup was driven more by retail investors,\" she said. \"Now there is wider adoption of bitcoin and more institutions investing in it.\"",

        "title": "Google agrees to pay French publishers for news",
        "body_text": "Google will pay news publications in France for the use of their content online in a landmark agreement that could soon be replicated elsewhere in Europe under new copyright laws.\n The tech company and APIG, which represents French news media, said in a joint statement on Thursday that they have agreed on principles for how news publications should be compensated for the distribution of their content on Google (GOOGL) platforms after months of talks.\n Google has long tussled with publishers over how it displays their content, with media companies arguing the search giant should pay them for the privilege.\n When new rules went into effect last year in France requiring publishers to be paid for snippets of news stories displayed in search results, Google announced it would only display headlines. In April, the French competition authority ruled that Google had abused its market dominance and ordered the company to negotiate with French publishers.\n Google and APIG said on Thursday that compensation will be based on criteria such as \"the publisher's contribution to political and general information, the daily volume of publications, and its monthly internet traffic,\" they added. The statement did not provide details on how much publishers would be paid.\n Google will now negotiate licensing agreements with individual publishers. It has already signed deals with a handful of daily newspapers and magazines, including leading titles such as Le Monde and Le Figaro.\n APIG President Pierre Louette, who is also CEO of Les Echos Le Parisien, which publishes France's oldest financial newspaper, said the agreement recognizes the rights of publishers to copyright protection and marks \"the beginning of their remuneration by digital platforms for the use of their online publications.\"\n The European Union overhauled its copyright laws in 2019, making platforms such as Google (GOOG) and YouTube responsible for copyright infringements committed by their users. The new rules, which were fiercely contested, also require search engines and social media platforms to share revenue with publishers if their content is displayed.\n France is the only EU country so far to have translated the Copyright Directive into national law, but other EU countries are expected to follow before an implementation deadline of June 7 this year.\n Google announced last year that it would pay publishers more than $1 billion over the next three years through a new program for licensing news that could help struggling newsrooms, which have lost advertising dollars to social media platforms. Google has signed agreements with nearly 450 publications across a dozen countries so far, the majority of which are local and regional.\n Australia has also moved to introduce laws requiring tech giants to pay for displaying news content. The government slammed Google last week for preventing local news websites from appearing in some searches, according to the BBC. Asked for comment on Thursday, Google said it was \"currently running a few experiments\" on search users in Australia to \"measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other.\"\n \u2014 Hadas Gold contributed to this article.",

        "body_text": "You wouldn't know it from her commanding delivery at the inauguration, but up until a few years ago, National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman struggled to overcome speech impediment.\n For much of her life, including when she was still an undergraduate at Harvard, Gorman had trouble pronouncing the letter \"R.\"\n To practice saying the letter, she'd listen on repeat to one song she said was \"packed with 'R's'\" -- \"Aaron Burr, Sir\" from Lin-Manuel Miranda's historical opus, \"Hamilton.\"\n \"I would try to keep up with Leslie Odom Jr. (who played Burr in the original Broadway cast) as he's, you know, doing this amazing rap,\" Gorman told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, following her triumphant inaugural performance. \"I would say, if I can train myself to do this song, then I can train myself to say this letter.\"\n Sure enough, rapping along with Odom Jr. and Miranda's fast-paced rhymes worked, and Gorman's performance of her piece, \"The Hill We Climb,\" ranked among the highlights of President Joe Biden's inauguration.\n Overcoming a speech impediment is a milestone she shares with the 46th President, as well as a love for \"Hamilton\" (the original Broadway cast performed at the White House while he was Vice President and reunited in 2020 for a Biden campaign video).\n Gorman said she owes a lot to the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical, calling it \"part of (her) speech pathology.\"\n \"It's why I included it in the inaugural poem,\" she told Cooper. \"Also, beyond that, I think 'Hamilton' is such a great kind of American cultural piece of what it means to be a better country.\"\n Gorman snuck in a few references to \"Hamilton\" in her stirring poem, some of which Miranda caught. He lauded her performance in a tweet.\n \"You were perfect. Perfectly written, perfectly delivered,\" he wrote. \"Every bit of it. Brava!\"\n Politicians and cultural titans like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey echoed Miranda's praise. In her fleeting moments on the inaugural stage, as Gorman called on the American people to summon the bravery it takes to \"be\" the light, she became a light for the country, too.",

        "title": "Woman accused of involvement in Pelosi laptop theft during Capitol riot released to home confinement",
        "body_text": "A Pennsylvania woman who is accused of being involved in the theft of a laptop from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during the Capitol riot was released from federal custody to home confinement on Thursday.\n Riley Williams, 22, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has been charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct, entering the restricted space of the Capitol, obstructing or impeding an official proceeding as well as aiding and abetting the theft of government property. She was arrested on Monday.\n She will remain at home with electronic monitoring, is ordered not to communicate with possible co-defendants and has travel restrictions.\n In an amended court filing, prosecutors allege that Williams appears to have filmed a gloved hand lifting a laptop off a table in the Capitol on January 6. Authorities do not allege that she stole the device.\n \"There is text across the video clip that reads: 'they got the laptop.' Given how loud Williams' voice is, it seems likely that she was the one holding the cell phone camera,\" an FBI special agent wrote in an affidavit, referring to a video seen by investigators.\n Lori Ulrich, Williams' attorney, said in court that the allegations brought forth against her client were by an ex-boyfriend and are \"overstated.\"\n \"It is regrettable that Ms. Williams took the President's bait and went inside the Capitol. However, based on our initial investigation and preparation for today, it is our position that the allegations surrounding the theft of Speaker Pelosi's computer came in part from a former abusive boyfriend,\" Ulrich said. \"He has threatened Ms. Williams in a number of ways.\"\n Pelosi confirmed the laptop theft during an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, calling it \"a violation not only of my office but of my connection to my constituents.\"\n \"That happened to be one that we use for Zooms and stuff like that, I think. I don't know what other information could be on there, but that person doesn't know, and they would jeopardize all kinds of information,\" Pelosi said.\n In announcing the decision to release Williams from federal custody on Thursday, Magistrate Judge Martin C. Carlson said she was being released \"because the Constitution has prevailed\" and blasted her alleged actions as \"antithetical\" to constitutional values.\n \"We know now that the mob failed and the Constitution prevailed. The Constitution prevailed ... because Congress, stepping over the wreckage of its Capitol, met and confirmed with the vice president of the United States the vote of the Electoral College, setting the stage for the latest peaceful transition of power yesterday,\" the judge said.\n CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Couples struggle with sleep problems in the Covid-19 pandemic",
        "body_text": "Dave Russell is a light sleeper, but he never had any issues sharing a bed with his girlfriend, Izzy James, before the pandemic.\n Things began to change in March. Lockdown significantly altered Russell's daily life. Like many people, he started working from home and limiting his contact with others, and he began to struggle to sleep through the night.\n Before the coronavirus, Russell and James would spend most of their working days apart in separate offices outside their home. For the last nine months, the two have both been working from their studio apartment in London.\n \"We were literally sitting opposite each other for the whole day, and then when the workday was finished, we would just move to the sofa,\" he told CNN. \"It felt like we were in the same room all of the time.\" Because they were.\n Couples are having to spend more time together under enormously stressful circumstances during the coronavirus pandemic, and it's affecting their ability to get enough sleep.\n Sharing a bed and sleep-related problems can be connected, experts say. Sleep specialists say they are currently treating quarantined couples struggling to sleep in the same bed, and it's creating and compounding problems in their relationships.\n \"Sleep amongst couples is completely interdependent,\" said Wendy Troxel, a senior behavioral and social scientist at the nonprofit RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California. \"When you share a bed with another human being, your sleep is affected and it affects the other person who shares the bed with you.\"\n Research has backed this up. If a person's sleep is disrupted by their partner during the night, it can lead to an argument in the relationship the following day, according to a 2013 study from the University of California, Berkeley.\n New York-based clinical psychologist Orna Guralnik, host of the Showtime series \"Couples Therapy,\" agreed.\n \"There are petty little grudges that accumulate,\" she said.\n \"There is a hyper-focus on the other person, and not enough distance between people to feel their independent existence. You put that in the context of sleeping together all night -- it becomes too much, too symbiotic for people.\"\n Many people have a heightened sense of awareness when they share a bed with their partner, especially if it is somebody who they are currently in conflict with, behavioral sleep medicine specialist Britney Blair said.\n Arguments during the day can cause anxiety that can disrupt a healthy sleep cycle, said Blair, who works at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine in Palo Alto, California. Sleep is the most vulnerable state for the human body, she said -- and the part of the brain that regulates our sleep, the hypothalamus, is sensitive to any external tension.\n \"If that primitive part of the brain perceives anything as wrong, it's not going to allow sleep to happen. It does not know the difference between a saber-toothed tiger who has just entered the cave and you need to be vigilant, or if you had an argument with your partner and you need to be vigilant.\"\n Some lockdowns have led to breakups, which Sara, who didn't want to share her last name for privacy reasons, experienced firsthand. Constant arguments with her now ex-boyfriend left her on edge and sleep deprived. While initially welcoming the thought of how convenient working remotely might be as the pandemic began, she soon realized that things at home were becoming quite claustrophobic.\n \"Right before the pandemic, I was working crazy hours, I was always exhausted, and it was super stressful because I was also going to school,\" she told CNN.\n \"I thought, working from home or taking a break might actually be helpful, but being stuck with him in an apartment made me realize that no matter how stressful the job was, I absolutely needed that. I was using it as an escape from the relationship.\"\n Meanwhile, Russell's solution was to move. After six months of living in a tightly enclosed studio, he and his partner have recently moved to a larger space. It has allowed him to go to bed in a separate room. The new arrangement has improved his sleep but -- as he admitted -- it's not the ideal situation for intimacy in the relationship.\n Sara employed the same tactics in the early days of her lockdown by shifting from a shared bed with her then-boyfriend to the couch, a move that improved her sleep.\n Yet a few months ago, the two moved from New York to California and into a smaller studio, leaving her with no ability to \"sleep on the couch or sleep anywhere else.\"\n What's worse? They've broken up in recent weeks but still live together because her ex is unemployed right now, and she doesn't want to put him through more hardship in such a challenging economic environment. She has had an even harder time sleeping while he is still around.\n Being in the same space continually can be even harder with children at home. With many schools closed for the foreseeable future, the added pressure of being a working parent can lead to a real struggle to get any rest at night. Troxel at the RAND Corporation has seen an increase in this pattern among sleep deprived patients at her clinic.\n \"If you're constantly battling with your spouse because you're sharing a very tight space and trying to balance your work with your children, it can tilt the scale towards being more vigilant rather than feeling safe and having your spouse help you wind down at night,\" she said.\n For some couples, the situation has gotten so desperate that they are even attempting a sleep divorce, of sorts, in an effort to catch an hour or two of rest.\n Guralnik is treating couples \"using all sorts of pretty intensive devices to create some semblance of a boundary. So anything from going to sleep at separate times, earplugs, one person falling asleep on the couch, all of these ways to mimic boundaries where they do not exist anymore.\"\n It's not just the lack of physical boundaries during the day that is hurting a couple's sleep cycles. Without the regimented schedule of a commute to and from the office, or dropping the kids off at school, people are embracing their more natural circadian rhythms. Those who prefer to stay up late or get up early can now fully embrace their inner morning lark or night owl, which can lead to sleep issues if a couple isn't in sync.\n \"One partner may be more of a night owl naturally and that's only exacerbated when they don't have to wake up in the morning to get off to work. The other partner might naturally be more of a morning person. She stays up watching Netflix, he goes to bed and then she gets into bed later and might disrupt his sleep,\" Troxel said.\n That's not surprising, according to a 2016 study published in the Journal of Biological and Medical Rhythm Research, which found that couples who don't complement each other's sleeping patterns have more relationship conflict, lesser sexual activity and poorer relationship satisfaction.\n In Sara's case, the pandemic has exposed some preexisting issues, which helped to accelerate a breakup that may have been coming anyway. But for others, some relationships might come out of their current predicament in a better place and resolve their problems.\n With the safest option being to stay at home these days, Blair told CNN that there will be some who are able to pass the Covid-19 stress test and \"learn to work through their sleep issues because they don't have a choice and might actually come out closer.\"\n Ever the optimist, Russell remains confident that \"there will come a point where things are the way they used to be\" when it comes to sleeping with his girlfriend, once we reach the end of the current health crisis.",

        "body_text": "The European Union has joined a growing number of international voices calling for a probe into Ugandan election abuses and violence that left more than 40 people dead in the lead up to the polls.\n Opposition candidates were harassed by security forces, the media was suppressed by the government, and observers' offices were raided, said the EU Council of Ministers in a statement on Wednesday.\n It called on all parties to refrain from violence and for \"election challenges and complaints to be addressed in an independent and transparent manner.\"\n Uganda's longtime leader President Yoweri Museveni was declared the winner for a record sixth term, amid an internet blackout and allegations of abuse.\n Wine -- a singer-turned-politician, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi -- has been under house arrest after the military surrounded his home on Friday. He maintains the election was rigged.\n \"I thank all friends in Uganda and abroad who continue to stand with us until we put an end to this indignity,\" he said in a tweet on Thursday.\n The 18-month old niece of Wine's wife, Barbara Itungo Kyagulanyi, is in the residence and her father has been denied access because nobody is allowed to leave or come into the compound, Wine said on Twitter.\n Human rights groups spoke out against Wine's detention and the political climate in the country as President Museveni embarked on an election victory tour of the country Thursday.\n \"It is neither a crime to stand for president nor to want to challenge the election results in court,\" said the regional director of the human rights NGO, Deprose Muchena, in a statement.\n \"This continued confinement is politically motivated and a blatant violation of their human rights. It must be lifted immediately and without any conditions.\"\n In the weeks leading up to the election, there were several incidences of violence and human rights violations said Human Rights Watch.\n \"The abuses included killings by security forces, arrests and beatings of opposition supporters and journalists, disruption of opposition rallies, and a shutdown of the internet,\" said the international human rights NGO in a statement.\n Museveni's senior press secretary, Don Wanyama, referred CNN to the police when contacted about Wine's house arrest, implying that the President knew nothing about the detention.\n \"Why would he?\" Wanyama said. \"Stop Musevenising everything. Talk to the police.\"\n The Ugandan Police Force did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n The police said in a tweet they made arrangements with Wine to access his lawyers on Tuesday, but they claim he refused to meet them.\n In a press briefing on Wednesday, the minister for foreign affairs, Sam Kutesa, said the conduct of some of the presidential candidates was in \"open defiance\" of the electoral commission's guidelines.\n Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor for United States President-elect Joe Biden, described the house arrest as \"deeply concerning\" on Sunday.\n On Saturday the US State Department called for authorities to address election \"irregularities.\"\n The United States ambassador to Uganda, Natalie E. Brown, was blocked by Ugandan security forces from visiting presidential candidate Bobi Wine on Monday.\n Uganda's internet shutdown was described by Netblocks founder Alp Toker as a \"textbook case of pre-meditated, pre-election internet blackout,\" as connectivity was restored after five days.\n This impeded the work of journalists, observers, and party agents, said the EU ministers.\n The internet shutdown was needed to \"stop the vitriolic language and incitement to violence,\" said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a tweet on Wednesday.",

        "title": "Many Biden White House staff are working from home in another break from Trump",
        "body_text": "When President Joe Biden walked into the White House on Wednesday holding hands with his wife, it all seemed so normal -- or at least as normal as a pandemic presidency can be.\n As a signal the White House will now operate in the manner the government recommends in the middle of a pandemic, many of Biden's staffers will continue working from home in the coming days and weeks.\n Officials said they received new government computers and phones that were activated at noon on Wednesday, allowing them to conduct official business from living rooms, kitchens and home offices.\n While many of the West Wing's individual offices have been assigned, the building will not be at capacity, as it was for much of last year despite the pandemic. The few places that did implement some work from home requirements under Trump, such as the National Security Council, will continue having officials work remotely.\n National Security Council staff who arrived to work at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Thursday were largely sent home and told they will be teleworking for the foreseeable future due to stricter Covid-19 measures being imposed by the administration.\n According to an administration official, only \"continuity of operations\" staff will be allowed to work inside the building, which includes national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his top advisers, as well as the heads of a few key directorates and other key personnel.\n Other staffers who need to access top secret information would be allowed in on an ad hoc basis, this official said. Many staffers who had been going in previously are being told that they'll have to stay home.\n That doesn't include Biden's top staffers such as chief of staff Ron Klain and press secretary Jen Psaki, who were in the building on Wednesday when Biden arrived for the first time.\n But other mid-level and lower level staffers will work from home, a departure from Trump aides who mostly continued coming to work without wearing masks.\n Psaki said during her press briefing on Wednesday that all staffers entering the complex will be required to undergo a Covid test, wear an N95 mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Plexiglass barriers were also mounted on desks in the West Wing, something Trump officials had resisted.\n \"The President has asked us to also be models to the American people, and that's vitally important to us as well,\" she said.\n Acting as a role model for the country rather than an undermining influence was another sign of Biden's intent on reviving the way White Houses used to run.\n After a thundering four years of chaos, there were other signs the volume would be set a little lower.\n Biden's daily schedule had been written without a bumptious declaration he would be toiling morning to night. Swearing in staff remotely from the State Dining Room, the President warned against infighting and disrespect -- \"I'll fire you on the spot\" -- rather than admitting he actually liked his underlings at each others' throats.\n The executive orders he inked in the Oval Office had been vetted ahead of time by administration lawyers. There was no midnight scramble to ensure they were legal or competing factions trying to insert different language. He did not hold them aloft and slowly pan his signature for the cameras.\n The tweets came and went and no one was fired. Tom Hanks was involved.\n After a four-year presidency governed by turmoil and active disregard for the phrase \"how things are done,\" Biden's entry into the White House ushered a conscious return to tradition and protocol.\n It was hardly a mistake. Biden ran as the candidate who could repair the basic institutions and conventions former President Donald Trump had shattered. And he promised his years in government would bring a level of competence to a country ravaged by coronavirus, which the previous administration badly mismanaged.\n Returning to \"how things are done\" was Biden's calling card. And on his first day as president, in big ways and small, he ensured things were done as they were.\n At her first daily briefing, the White House press secretary opened by calling on The Associated Press, a tradition that had been discarded, and managed to answer questions without a slew of insults -- and without any mention of crowd size.\n The first foreign leader phone call on Biden's list was planned and announced ahead of time: Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, maybe the country's least controversial ally.\n Photo-ops occurred without half-hour parlays with reporters that obscured their original intent. A model of Air Force One redesigned in brash red and black that once adorned the Oval Office was gone, the fate of its new color scheme unclear.\n \"I haven't had the opportunity to dig into that today,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said when questioned about the airplane paint job, relegating an issue that once preoccupied hours of presidential time to the back burner.\n Biden's aides have long sought to tie his institutional knowledge and respect for traditions to an ability to repair the nation's problems. They paid attention to things such as language and optics to project a readiness for the job, even subconsciously.\n From the start, his campaign released daily schedules listing Biden's activities in the established style of a president, even when he went for days without anything on them. His events were staged in ways that brought to mind a president's official engagements, even while Trump's official engagements usually resembled campaign events.\n Just like the President himself, the team Biden brought with him to the White House has more experience in government than any administration in memory. Led Klain, who has worked in two previous administrations, Biden's team is stocked with alums from President Barack Obama's White House and other areas of government.\n When they arrived to the West Wing on Wednesday morning, many knew their way through the warren of offices and meeting rooms. Unlike Trump's team, which went for several days without figuring out how to switch on the lights in the Cabinet Room, Biden's aides know how the building works.\n So, too, do they know how government typically operates -- or at least how it operated before Trump came along.\n Officials say one of Biden's primary goals in his first days is to stabilize the country and restore a sense of normalcy after a divisive four-year stretch under Trump. For a country exhausted by the daily turbulence of Trump's presidency, a more traditional commander in chief could return the White House to the back of Americans' minds rather than existing as a pervasive anxiety.\n \"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path,\" he said during his inaugural address on Wednesday.\n That isn't necessarily how Trump's supporters see it. They saw the previous President's willingness to abandon the norms of the presidency as a sign he was abandoning a system that had left too many people behind.\n His tweets, which ceased this month when Twitter suspended his account, were a balm for those tired of staid political correctness. His unvarnished press availabilities provided a direct view into his thinking, even if they were usually riddled with lies.\n The management style he employed -- which could generously be described as uncontrolled chaos -- ensured he was the focus of attention all the time. He believed having advisers duke it out in front of him usually led to the best possible outcome.\n Decorum became self-defined; while Trump insisted that he be granted the utmost respect because of the office he held, he offered little in return to the system of Democracy that put him there.\n Ironically, Trump seemed to relish the more traditional aspects of his job the most: the military reviews, the brass bands, the shows of deference.\n But he openly acknowledged that his style wasn't normal. He called it \"modern-day presidential.\"\n Biden, at least during his first hours in office, is going for regular presidential.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Vivian Salama contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "While scrolling through the slew of photos of the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday morning, one jumped out to me as emblematic of the truly historic nature of what happened Wednesday in Washington.\n Here's the photo:\n Taken by photojournalist Joshua Roberts, the picture shows Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, presumably watching the fireworks display that followed the televised inaugural celebration on Wednesday night. The couple are framed by the Lincoln Memorial.\n It's a striking image. Harris, the first female vice president and the first Black and South Asian vice president, framed by the man known as the \"Great Emancipator.\"\n It was, for me, a moment of affirmation and possibility that America has -- and always must -- represent.\n At a moment even Biden acknowledged is historically tough -- \"Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now,\" he said in his inauguration speech Wednesday -- the photo of Harris celebrating at a monument to the man who fought and won the Civil War functions as a reminder that progress toward a more ideal union continues apace.\n No, it's not always as fast as we want or expect. And not always in a perfectly straight line. The election of Barack Obama, the country's first Black president, was followed by the election of Donald Trump, for example. Two weeks before Harris wrote her name into the history books on the West Front of the US Capitol building, violent rioters were swarming that same space to protest false claims that Biden and Harris hadn't actually won.\n History -- and progress -- proceeds in fits and starts. But it proceeds.\n And so, 158 years after the Emancipation Proclamation and 101 years after women were granted the right to vote, Kamala Devi Harris stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as the vice president of the United States.

        "title": "Defense Department slams brakes on border wall as it reviews Biden order",
        "body_text": "The Defense Department will pause construction of the wall along the US-Mexico border as it reviews President Joe Biden's executive order calling for construction to grind to a halt.\n The Army Corps of Engineers, which provides direction and oversight of border projects, \"will take the appropriate actions in accordance with the (executive order),\" said Raini Brunson, a spokesperson for the agency, later adding that contractors involved in construction have been told not to install any additional physical barriers.\n \"Only construction activity that is necessary to safely prepare each site for a suspension of work will occur over the next few days,\" Brunson said.\n Biden took an immediate shot at one of his predecessor's key legacies Wednesday evening when he signed a proclamation calling for border wall construction to come to an end.\n \"It shall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall,\" Biden's proclamation reads.\n Over the last four years, billions of dollars had been put aside for additional barriers on the US-Mexico border, prompting a slew of lawsuits and pushback from environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers. Days from the end of his term, former President Donald Trump paid the wall a visit, citing it as an accomplishment of his administration.\n The majority of the roughly 455 miles constructed during Trump's presidency replaced old, dilapidated barriers with a new enhanced wall system, a marked difference from the fencing previously constructed in some regions. Forty-nine miles have gone up where no barriers previously existed, according to the latest figures from US Customs and Border Protection.\n \"(Wednesday's) proclamation will likely result in what's called a suspension of work on the border wall,\" said Travis Sharp, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. \"During the suspension of work, the contractor must keep track of any additional expenses caused by the delay, so that the government can potentially reimburse those expenses later.\"\n A federal judge in California has already directed the administration to provide an update on how the new executive order affects an ongoing border wall case.\n The government has a long-standing authority to terminate contracts, though such actions can come with their own challenges and at a cost, according to contracting experts. There are costs incurred before construction starts, such as planning costs, land acquisitions and manufacturing expenses and pre-positioning equipment. If contracts are terminated, there may also be the need to pay costs associated with cleanup, demobilization and potentially restoration of land for safety and environmental reasons. The costs will ultimately depend on the size of the contract and how much of the project has been completed so far.\n Former acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan acknowledged those challenges as the administration moved to strike additional contracts. \"They could terminate those contracts if they want to, but that's going to be a very lengthy, messy process,\" Morgan said late last year.\n Part of the obstacles facing the Biden administration has to do with cases seeking to seize private land for wall construction. To that end, Ricky Garza, a staff attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal advocacy group representing landowners in land seizure cases, called the proclamation \"disappointing.\"\n \"Biden as a candidate pledged not to build another foot, dismiss lawsuits. That's what a lot of us were counting on,\" Garza said. \"There haven't been any new lawsuits, but in the 200-plus that exist, there's been a steady drumbeat that things are moving. ... It's as if nothing has changed.\"\n In December, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas sent a letter to Biden, along with other lawmakers, urging his team to immediately prioritize ending the national emergency declaration, dismissing land seizure lawsuits, terminating wall contracts and rescinding environmental waivers.\n Cuellar expressed confidence in the proclamation released by the Biden White House Wednesday.\n \"That executive order is very important because it terminates the national emergency declaration that allowed Trump to grab money from other departments,\" Cuellar told CNN. \"The President definitely has met my expectations and I'm very, very happy about that.\"",

        "title": "Facebook's oversight board will decide whether Trump should be banned",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump's future on Facebook and Instagram is now up in the air.\n Facebook (FB) has referred its previous decision to suspend former President Donald Trump's posting privileges to its independent Oversight Board for review, the company said in a blog post Thursday.\n Facebook said it wants the Oversight Board's binding ruling on the matter given its significance.\n \"We think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld,\" wrote Facebook VP of global affairs Nick Clegg. \"While we await the board's decision, Mr. Trump's access will remain suspended indefinitely.\"\n John Taylor, a Facebook Oversight Board spokesman, told CNN Business that, under its framework, the board will have 90 days to review the decision but \"we expect to act more quickly than that.\"\n Facebook and Instagram banned Trump's account from posting for at least the remainder of his term in office and perhaps \"indefinitely\" after his supporters stormed the US Capitol building to protest the election. Twitter, Trump's preferred social media platform, banned him permanently.\n In a blog post, the Oversight Board said Trump or his page administrators will be able to submit their feedback on the Facebook decision to the board as it contemplates whether to uphold or overturn Facebook's decision.\n \"The Oversight Board launched in late 2020 to address exactly the sort of highly consequential issues raised by this case,\" the board said. \"The Board was created to provide a critical independent check on Facebook's approach to the most challenging content issues, which have enormous implications for global human rights and free expression.\"\n Jamal Greene, a co-chair of the Oversight Board, told CNN Business that the case will be viewed and decided through three main lenses: whether Trump's content truly violated Facebook's own platform policies; whether Facebook's decision is consistent with its own stated values; and whether Trump's suspension largely aligns with -- or undercuts -- international human rights principles.\n It will be the oversight board's most high-profile and consequential case so far. The board, which was created to serve as a kind of Supreme Court for appealing and evaluating Facebook's content moderation decisions, only started taking cases in the fall.\n Kate Klonick, an assistant law professor at St. John's University who studies technology and online speech, predicted many will view the case as Facebook's \"Marbury v. Madison moment,\" referring to the pivotal US Supreme Court case that established the judicial system's role in reviewing laws and government actions.\n \"The Board can establish its seriousness and jurisdiction/power over FB,\" she tweeted. \"That could be good for the Board but it also means that it's very risky for establishing legitimacy, esp. so early in its history.\"\n Given social media platforms' tendency to play follow-the-leader on consequential content enforcement decisions, the Oversight Board's ruling could have vast ramifications, according to Evelyn Douek, a lecturer at Harvard University Law School.\n \"There is no greater question in content moderation right now than whether Trump's deplatforming represents the start of a new era in how companies police their platforms,\" she wrote in a blog post. \"The past few weeks have also shown that what one platform does can ripple across the internet. ... For all these reasons, the board's decision on Trump's case could affect far more than one Facebook page.\"",

        "title": "Biden orders investigation into Russian misdeeds as admin seeks nuclear arms treaty extension",
        "body_text": "The White House has ordered an intelligence review of Russian misdeeds ranging from the SolarWinds hack to alleged bounties on US troops, but will pursue an agreement with Moscow on an issue of mutual concern: nuclear arms control.\n \"Even as we work with Russia to advance US interests, so too we work to hold Russia to account for its reckless and adversarial actions,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a briefing Thursday.\n \"To this end, the President is also issuing a tasking to the intelligence community for its full assessment of the SolarWinds cyber breach, Russian interference in the 2020 election, its use of chemical weapons against opposition leader Alexey Navalny and the alleged bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan,\" she said.\n President Joe Biden's intel chief, Avril Haines, was sworn in on Thursday and overseeing the assessment will be one of her first major tasks.\n The launch of the review signals that Biden is prepared to take a more critical approach on countering Moscow than his predecessor, Donald Trump, who failed to forcefully condemn Russia over those incidents.\n However, Psaki told reporters that the Biden administration is prepared to work with Russia on the New START Treaty, telling reporters that \"the United States intends to seek a five year extension ... as the treaty permits.\"\n That landmark nuclear arms control agreement expires on February 5.\n \"The President has long been clear that the New START Treaty is in the national security interests of the United States, and this extension makes even more sense when the relationship with Russia is adversarial, as it is at this time,\" she said.\n \"New START is the only remaining treaty constraining Russian nuclear forces and is an anchor of strategic stability between our two countries,\" Psaki added.\n Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby hailed the move and noted that \"we cannot afford to lose New START's intrusive inspection and notification tools.\"\n \"Failing to swiftly extend New START would weaken America's understanding of Russia's long-range nuclear forces,\" he said in a statement Thursday. \"Extending the treaty's limitations on stockpiles of strategic nuclear weapons until 2026 allows time and space for our two nations to explore new verifiable arms control arrangements that could further reduce risks to Americans.\"\n \"Just as we engage Russia in ways that advance American interests, we in the Department will remain clear-eyed about the challenges Russia poses and committed to defending the nation against their reckless and adversarial actions,\" Kirby said.\n Russia's ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, was due to meet with President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on Thursday to discuss the treaty, according to Russian officials who spoke to CNN as they entered the State Department for meetings with other US officials on Thursday afternoon.\n CNN previously reported that Biden advisers indicated that the administration would not seek a shorter extension on the landmark deal. Biden has expressed support for extending the deal with Russia and using it as a foundation to pursue future arms control arrangements.\n Arms control experts had warned that allowing the treaty to lapse could prove catastrophic and on Thursday praised the news, first reported by The Washington Post, that the new administration planned to move forward with a full extension.\n Daryl Kimball, the director of the Arms Control Association, called it \"the common sense, no nonsense, adult decision.\"\n \"The New START Treaty is essential for US and Russian security, it's the only treaty left regulating the world's two largest nuclear arsenals,\" he told CNN.\n \"The Russian arsenal is the single biggest threat to the existence of the United States, so extending this treaty, by the maximum allowed by the treaty, makes sense. It provides the time that will be necessary to negotiate follow-on agreements,' he explained.\n \"Those negotiations will be extraordinarily difficult because we have over a decade of accumulated problems that have that have to be resolved in the US-Russian nuclear relationship.\"\n Kimball noted that Moscow was in favor of an unconditional five-year extension and predicted that, \"barring unforeseen complications, completing this agreement is a matter of working through the technicalities within the next two weeks.\"\n US officials told CNN last month that the full breadth of the US-Russia relationship will be examined by the team. The Biden administration will also prepare a \"cost imposition strategy\" to respond to Russia -- not just for the massive hack of US agencies, but also for Russia's other disruptive actions -- measures that will include sanctions, according to the officials.\n With regard to the New START Treaty, Secretary of State-designate Antony Blinken said during his confirmation hearing Tuesday that Biden intended to seek an extension of the treaty, but suggested he had not made a decision on the length of that extension.\n Blinken noted that Biden \"couldn't really engage\" on the issue during the transition because he was \"very cognizant of the fact we have one president at a time.\"\n The Trump administration went back and forth with the Russians on the terms of a shorter extension to the longstanding treaty after efforts to create a new trilateral treaty with Russia and China failed.\n CNN's Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A federal judge has denied Parler's request for a court order blocking Amazon from kicking the social media app off its platform, marking yet another setback in Parler's efforts to get back online.\n Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a ruling on Thursday saying that Parler had not met the legal requirements for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.\n That decision does not end the litigation, but it does mean that the court will not force Amazon Web Services to allow Parler back onto its cloud hosting platform. Amazon's move effectively kicked Parler off the public internet.\n Parler, the alternative social media platform favored by the far-right, had sued AWS earlier this month after AWS claimed Parler did not do enough to remove instances of incitement from its website.\n Amazon previously said Parler's lawsuit has \"no merit\" and argued in a legal brief that Parler had \"demonstrated unwillingness and inability to remove from the servers of Amazon Web Services ('AWS') content that threatens the public safety.\"\n Parler CEO John Matze said in a court filing Monday that Parler does not have the resources to host itself on its own servers. Parler tried to seek a hosting alternative to AWS from at least six different potential providers after it became clear Amazon would no work with it, but Parler was turned away, according to a court filing.\n Parler's website suddenly reappeared online Sunday afternoon with a message from Matze: \"Hello world, is this thing on?\" It remains unclear who may actually wind up providing the servers on which Parler's social network will run.",

Does that mean I've jumped the shark a bit? Is everything still cool?\" he told Apple Music Country.\n But then he changed his tune.\n \"And then I realized that somebody had told me that she was in her seventh-grade math class when she wrote the song, so it made me feel a little bit better about that because she was so young writing it. So I didn't feel like I was that terribly old,\" he said.\n It ended up being the beginning of a friendship that led to them collaborating on McGraw's 2013 song, \"Highway Don't Care.\"\n Since then, Swift has gone on to become one of the biggest names in music.",

        "title": "Republicans position themselves for 2024 with Trump's future looming large",
        "body_text": "Republicans are already making moves toward the 2024 election, jockeying to succeed former President Donald Trump now that he has departed Washington, either by picking up his mantle or by trying to steer the party in a new direction.\n A handful of ambitious GOP politicians are positioning themselves against President Joe Biden and building the political operations that will allow them to travel and campaign with fellow Republicans.\n Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the failed 2016 GOP presidential candidate who bolstered Trump's effort to throw out states' 2020 votes, aimed for blue-collar workers this week with a message lambasting Biden's decision to re-enter the Paris climate accord, asking: \"Paris or Pittsburgh?\" He is offering to send those who sign up for his email list \"Pittsburgh > Paris\" bumper stickers.\n Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations, last week launched a political action committee called \"Stand for America\" that she told supporters in an email that she is focused on the 2022 midterms. \"There is nothing 'normal' about an agenda focused on socialism, defunding the police, the Green New Deal, and Medicare for All,\" Haley wrote, characterizing the agenda of some progressive Democrats, which Biden does not share.\n And in what seemed to be a nod to his own ambitions, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a countdown to Election Day 2024 Thursday morning on Twitter. \"1,384 days,\" he wrote.\n \"Not having a Republican in the White House opens it up so that other people feel that they have an opportunity for 2024,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the Republican chairman in Iowa, traditionally the first state to vote in the presidential nominating process.\n Kaufmann pointed out that, with a governor's race and a Senate contest on the ballot in Iowa in next year's midterms, \"there's going to be opportunities for people to come into the state before 2022 to be helpful to some of our candidates, and those races will heat up very, very shortly.\"\n It's far too early to gauge the forces that will steer the 2024 Republican presidential primary, with Biden's presidency in its infancy and Trump's future clouded. Presidential primaries typically do not kick off until after the midterm elections. Still, potential candidates typically spend the two preceding years building political infrastructures and campaigning for potential allies.\n And on the Democratic side, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a close Biden ally, insisted over the weekend that the President will run for re-election in 2024.\n \"He is planning to run again,\" Coons told Politico. \"He knows that we are at the middle of an absolute turning point, a pivot point in American history. And he's up for the challenge.\"\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden is not focused on politics at this point, and will \"wait until sometime into his first term to speak more about his political plans moving forward.\"\n For the GOP field, the Senate's upcoming impeachment trial is the first key milestone. If enough Republicans join Democrats to convict Trump, they could bar him from ever running for federal office again -- staving off years of speculation about whether Trump would seek another term. But if Trump isn't convicted by the Senate, then he would loom large in the 2024 picture.\n That could force Republicans who worked in his administration -- former Vice President Mike Pence, Pompeo and Haley among them -- as well as Trump's allies on Capitol Hill who are eyeing 2024 -- to proceed cautiously.\n \"The last thing they need to do is look like they're trying to cut the president off at the pass, if you will. They need to be seen as being helpful and being productive,\" said Drew McKissick, the South Carolina Republican Party chairman.\n Trump \"actually had coattails\" in Iowa, Kaufmann said, and any Republican considering a run in 2024 faces \"a lot of wait and see\" as Trump makes decisions about his own political future.\n Kaufmann said any Republican senator who votes to convict Trump in the Senate's upcoming impeachment trial, though, would \"be DOA if they actually voted for that.\"\n Tied to questions about Trump's own future is whether Republican voters will look for someone who was a close ally over the last four years, or will seek a new direction after Trump became just the fifth president in the last 100 years to lose their bid for another term.\n The group of close Trump allies could include Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, the two Republicans who led the effort to reject the Electoral College votes that made Biden president, as well as Pompeo, and potentially even Trump's children.\n Pence faces a precarious path too, after a falling-out at the end of the Trump presidency over Pence's refusal to attempt to block the counting of Electoral College votes from states where Trump baselessly claimed there had been voter fraud. In his hometown of Columbus, Indiana, on Wednesday, in his first remarks after attending Biden's inauguration and departing Washington, Pence stuck to his familiar public approach of heaping praise on Trump. But it's not yet clear whether Republican voters would reward him as Trump's loyal lieutenant, or penalize him for their break in their final weeks in office.\n Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Florida Sen. Rick Scott both made highly unusual moves in 2020, paying for their own advertisements in swing states backing Trump. Those senators have signaled they'll make up a \"no caucus\" of sorts, along with Cruz and Hawley, positioning themselves against nearly everything that Biden proposes.\n Haley, meanwhile, has distanced herself from Trump in some ways. She called him \"badly wrong\" for stoking the January 6 riot at the US Capitol during a speech earlier this month to the Republican National Committee, and said his actions were \"deeply disappointing.\"\n \"His actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history,\" she said then.\n Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of the fiercest GOP critics of Trump's actions, including his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has also not ruled out a 2024 bid.\n \"I do want to be a part of the discussion about where we go as a party and where we go as a country so I'm going to try and continue to be involved and speak up and let people know what I think we should do,\" Hogan said in a December interview aired on Bloomberg.\n Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime Trump ally, broke fiercely from Trump late last year. He aired television ads urging Americans to wear masks, and referred to Trump's efforts to overturn the election results as an \"absurdity.\"\n \"Republicans now need to say, thank you, Mr. President, for your service. Thank you for the good things you did while you're in office that we agree with, and we now need to move on to make sure that we're stating Republican principles that matter to the people in this country ... and the fundamental challenge for Republicans is to move on,\" Christie said on ABC in December. \"Move on.\"",

He said that \"innocent people could be hurt in this war.\"\n It was a not-so-subtle suggestion that Biden and Democrats might use the power of the federal government to wrongfully target their political opponents.\n The other arms of right-wing media were not much friendlier.\n Newsmax TV, the right-wing cable channel that promoted the lie that the election had been stolen from former President Donald Trump, featured segments Thursday night bashing Biden's \"radical immigration agenda\" and saying he had \"contradict[ed] himself in 'unifying' speech.\"\n Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk-radio, said Biden's speech might have been \"one of the least memorable inaugural speeches that there's ever been.\"\n Limbaugh framed the speech like this for his audience: \"In this speech Biden called us domestic terrorists and then called for unity in the same breath.\"\n On the right-wing web, Breitbart featured front page headlines Thursday referring to Biden as \"GLOBALIST JOE\" and declaring that \"CORPORATISTS SALIVATE\" at his presidency.\n The top headline on the far-right Gateway Pundit website Wednesday falsely claimed the election had been \"stolen\" from Trump.",

        "body_text": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Thursday that Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu has died of Covid-19.\n Mthembu was one of the government's key leaders in its response to the pandemic and the public face during many Covid-19 press briefings.\n \"It is with deep sorrow and shock that we announce that Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu passed away earlier today from COVID-related complications. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time of loss,\" President Ramaphosa tweeted.\n \"Minister Mthembu was an exemplary leader, an activist and life-long champion of freedom and democracy. He was a much-loved and greatly respected colleague and comrade, whose passing leaves our nation at a loss,\" Ramaphosa added.\n On January 11 Mthembu tweeted that he had contracted Covid-19.\n \"Today I visited the Military hospital in Tshwane to get medical attention for an abdominal pain. After undergoing some tests, I tested positive for Covid-19,\" he said.\n Mthembu then thanked the South Africans who wished him a speedy recovery and said the country \"must overcome Covid-19.\"\n John Steenhuisen, the leader of the Democratic Alliance, which is the opposition party in South Africa, said he was \"devastated\" to learn about the minister's passing.\n \"Was such an honour to serve alongside this true South African patriot. Condolences to his family and friends and the colleagues in his party,\" he said in a tweet.\n As of Wednesday South Africa's Department of Health reported 1,369,426 cases of Covid-19 and 38,854 deaths.\n Ramaphosa extended coronavirus restrictions in the country on January 11, citing a \"massive increase\" in Covid-19 cases driven by a variant discovered there last year.\n In addition to extending the existing measures, Ramaphosa announced that 20 land borders will be closed until February 15.\n Mthembu was an anti-apartheid activist who first became involved in politics in the 1970s.\n He was harassed and intimidated by apartheid police and during the Bethal terrorism trial was charged with sabotage, treason and terrorism, but was acquitted, according to South African presidency website.\n Under President Nelson Mandela, he was the ANC party spokesperson from 1995-1997 and again from 2009-2014.\n CNN's Eoin McSweeney contributed to this report",

        "title": "Costco is (finally) testing out curbside pickup for groceries",
        "body_text": "Costco has held off on offering curbside pickup for groceries for years. Now, in a shift, it's trying it out at three stores in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n Costco announced last week that it would start offering members of the warehouse club in the area same-day pickup on 2,000 grocery and general merchandise items. There's a $100 order minimum to choose pickup, and a $10 fee on each order because the model \"adds an additional expense to our low-cost business model and limited markup structure,\" the company says on its website.\n The company previously only offered pickup on expensive items like jewelry and electronics, saying it was costly to offer more broadly. Some Wall Street analysts have questioned whether Costco should expand the service to other goods as curbside pickup explodes in popularity.\n Richard Galanti, chief financial officer at Costco, said that the company wanted to test it out in a small market.\n \"We're always trying different things. We still scratch our head a little bit on it. We figured we'd try it in a discrete market where there's just a limited number of locations,\" he told CNN Business. \"And it's really nothing more than a test at this point.\"\n Costco (COST) has dedicated parking spaces for customers driving in to grab their orders at each of the stores in Albuquerque. Employees prepare the online orders and bring them out to customers' cars. Customers will shop for orders and pay through Costco's website.\n Costco's test comes as rivals, such as Walmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods, have also expanded their own curbside pickup offerings during the pandemic.\n Costco's new pickup option has a higher minimum order threshold and fee than other chains. Walmart, Kroger and Whole Foods offer free grocery pickup for orders above $35.\n In the past few years, Costco has said curbside pickup for groceries doesn't make sense to offer, mainly because the club doesn't have much room in its jam-packed stores and parking lots to pull off the logistics of pickup. The option requires a staging area inside the store for workers to assemble orders, extra cooler space to keep items fresh and dedicated parking spots for customers driving in to come grab their groceries.\n \"You have to have a place to store the stuff,\" Galanti said in interview last year. \"You can't store it at room temperature. You've got to separate it into refrigerated, frozen and dry.\"\n Costco, which operates on razor-thin profit margins, also says it's too expensive for its business to have employees dedicated to putting together customers' orders and bringing them out to their cars.\n And Costco wants shoppers to come into warehouses, where they often make unexpected purchases while browsing around. Pickup takes away this opportunity for Costco to drive sales.\n \"We want you to walk the warehouse and see what we have to offer,\" Galanti said.",

The show is the first series for Rhimes under her Netflix deal.\n So, it doesn't come as a huge surprise that Rhimes' production company revealed Thursday on Instagram that the series will indeed return. The announcement came in the form of a letter written by the character Lady Whistledown, who is essentially the gossip columnist in their city.\n \"Dearest Readers,\" Lady Whistledown wrote, \"The ton are abuzz with the latest gossip, and so it is my honor to impart to you: Bridgerton shall officially return for a second season. I do hope you have stored a bottle of ratafia for this most delightful occasion.\"\n The announcement also pointed out that production will begin this spring and that Lord Anthony Bridgerton, played by Jonathan Bailey, will \"dominate the social season.\"",

        "title": "Emerging evidence suggests new coronavirus variant could be problematic for vaccines ",
        "body_text": "As researchers around the world race to see if new coronavirus variants will pose a problem for the vaccines, a second study in two days says a variant from South Africa could possibly do just that.\n The variant was first spotted in South Africa in October and has now been found in more than a dozen countries.\n In both studies, the work was done in the lab and not in people, so more research is needed to gauge the true threat of the new variant.\n In the most recent study, which was small, researchers took antibodies from six people who were hospitalized with Covid-19 before the new variant was discovered. They found to varying degrees, that antibodies for all six of the survivors were unable to fully fight off the virus.\n \"I think the evidence is building that these mutations -- and I think other mutations -- will emerge across the globe -- and are emerging already -- that are escaping antibodies from previous infection,\" Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute and the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, told CNN. \"It's concerning.\"\n It's unclear whether this means someone would be vulnerable to the new variant if they'd already had Covid-19, or what this might mean for people who've been vaccinated.\n Sigal's findings were very similar to those of a study released Tuesday by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa.\n \"When you see two groups independently arriving at same basic answer, that good -- there's more consonance that they are correct,\" said Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n A third study, also released Tuesday, showed that mutations in the new variant allowed them to evade some of the immunity induced by vaccination, but it was far from a complete escape.\n That study looked at far fewer mutations in the variant than the South African studies examined.\n None of the studies were peer reviewed or published in medical journals.\n While scientists work out whether these variants are particularly dangerous -- and studies are underway in several labs worldwide -- one thing is clear: Get the vaccine if you can.\n \"I would for sure get it if I could,\" Sigal said. \"My father-in-law had the opportunity to fly to Israel and get it, and I was shooing him out of the house because you can't get it here in South Africa.\"\n In his research, Sigal found that antibodies from all six study subjects failed to fully fight off the new variant.\n \"One participant had a fairly good response, but nobody escaped unscathed,\" he said.\n The study was posted on the website for KRISP, the Kwazulu-Natal Research Innnovation and Sequencing Platform. The other two studies were posted on a pre-print server.\n In the study that had similar findings, blood was drawn from 44 people in South Africa who'd had Covid-19. Nearly all of their cases were confirmed to have occurred prior to September, which is before the variant was spotted in South Africa.\n The researchers then looked to see whether their antibodies would fight off the new variant.\n For about half of the 44 people, their antibodies were powerless against the new variant. For the other half, the antibody response was weakened, but not totally knocked out.\n In the third study, done at Rockefeller University, researchers looked at blood from 20 people who had received either the Moderna or the Pfizer vaccine. Different mutations in the viruses did allow some escape from some types of antibodies, but the volunteers' immune systems threw an army of different types of antibodies at the viruses.\n The Rockefeller study looked at fewer mutations than the two South African studies. It looked at three key mutations on the spikes that sit atop the coronavirus, since that's the part of the virus targeted by the vaccines.\n \"That's useful, but still not the complete story,\" said John Moore, a vaccine researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n The South African studies, however, used the virus itself, or a model of it, which contained eight spike mutations.\n John Bonifield and Amanda Sealy cotributed to this report",

        "title": "Astronaut artifacts on moon -- like Apollo landers and Neil Armstrong's bootprint -- now protected by US law",
        "body_text": "(The Conversation)It's hard to care about bootprints sunk in soil 238,900 miles away as humanity suffers the combined burden of an unforgiving virus and a political unease. But how humans treat those bootprints and the historic lunar landing sites upon which they are found will speak volumes about who we humans are and who we seek to become.\n On December 31, 2020, the One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act became law. As far as laws go, it's pretty benign. It requires companies that are working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on lunar missions to agree to be bound by otherwise unenforceable guidelines intended to protect American landing sites on the moon. That's a pretty small pool of affected entities. However, it is also the first law enacted by any nation that recognizes the existence of human heritage in outer space. That's important because it reaffirms our human commitment to protecting our history -- as we do on Earth with sites like the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu, which is protected through instruments like the World Heritage Convention -- while also acknowledging that the human species is expanding into space.\n I am a lawyer who focuses on space issues that seek to ensure the peaceful and sustainable exploration and use of space. I believe that people can achieve world peace through space. To do so, we must recognize landing sites on the moon and other celestial bodies as the universal human achievements they are, built on the research and dreams of scientists and engineers spanning centuries on this globe. I believe that the One Small Step Act, enacted in a divisive political environment, demonstrates that space and preservation truly are nonpartisan, even unifying principles.\n It is only a matter of decades, perhaps just years, before we see a continuous human presence on the moon.\n While it would be nice to think that a human community on the moon would be a collaborative, multinational utopia -- albeit located in what Buzz Aldrin famously described as a \"magnificent desolation\" -- the fact is people are once again racing one another to reach our lunar neighbor.\n The US Artemis project, which includes a goal of sending the first woman to the moon in 2024, is the most ambitious mission. Russia has reinvigorated its Luna program, setting the stage to put cosmonauts on the moon in the 2030s. However, in a race once reserved for superpowers, there are now multiple nations and multiple private companies with a stake.\n India is planning to send a rover to the Moon this year. China, which in December implemented the first successful lunar return mission since 1976, has announced multiple lunar landings in the coming years, with Chinese media reporting plans for a crewed mission to the moon within the decade. South Korea and Japan are also building lunar landers and probes.\n Such private companies as Astrobotic, Masten Space Systems and Intuitive Machines are working to support NASA missions. Other companies, such as ispace, Blue Moon and SpaceX, while also supporting NASA missions, are preparing to offer private missions, including for tourism. How are all these different entities going to work around one another?\n Space is not lawless. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, now ratified by 110 nations, including all of the current spacefaring countries, offers guiding principles supporting the concept of space as the province of all humankind. The treaty explicitly indicates that all countries and, by implication, their nationals have the freedom to explore and free access to all areas of the moon.\n That's right. Everyone has the freedom to roam wherever they want -- over Neil Armstrong's bootprint, close to sensitive scientific experiments or right up to a mining operation. There is no concept of property on the moon. The only restriction on this freedom is the remonstration, found in Article IX of the treaty, that all activities on the moon must be carried out with \"due regard to the corresponding interests of\" all others and the requirement that you consult with others if you might cause \"harmful interference.\"\n What does that mean? From a legal standpoint, no one knows.\n It can reasonably be argued that interfering with an experiment or a lunar mining operation would be harmful, cause quantifiable damage and thus violate the treaty.\n But what about a derelict spacecraft, like the Eagle, the Apollo 11 lunar lander? Do we really want to rely on \"due regard\" to prevent the intentional or inadvertent destruction of this inspiring piece of history? This object memorializes the work of the hundreds of thousands of individuals who worked to put a human on the moon, the astronauts and cosmonauts who gave their lives in this quest to reach the stars, and the quiet heroes, like Katherine Johnson, who fueled the math that made it so.\n The lunar landing sites -- from Luna 2, the first human-made object to impact the moon, to each of the crewed Apollo missions, to Chang-e 4, which deployed the first rover on the far side of the moon -- in particular bear witness to humanity's greatest technological achievement thus far. They symbolize all we have accomplished as a species, and hold such promise for the future.\n The One Small Step Act is true to its name. It's a small step. It applies only to companies that are working with NASA; it pertains only to US lunar landing sites; it implements outdated and untested recommendations to protect historic lunar sites implemented by NASA in 2011. However, it offers significant breakthroughs. It is the first legislation from any nation to recognize an off-Earth site as having \"outstanding universal value\" to humanity, language taken from the unanimously ratified World Heritage Convention.\n The act also encourages the development of best practices to protect human heritage in space by evolving the concepts of due regard and harmful interference -- an evolution that will also guide how nations and companies work around one another. As small a step as it may be, recognizing and protecting historic sites is the first step to developing a peaceful, sustainable and successful lunar governance model.\n The bootprints are not protected -- yet. There is a long way to go toward an enforceable multilateral/universal agreement to manage the protection, preservation or memorialization of all human heritage in space, but the One Small Step law should give us all hope for the future in space and here on Earth.\n Michelle L.D.

        "title": "Jaime Harrison officially elected Democratic National Committee chair",
        "body_text": "Former South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison has officially been elected the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, winning the organization's election after President Joe Biden selected him for the top political job.\n Harrison, who unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in 2020, will now be asked to guide the top committee at a time when Democrats have control of all three key bodies in Washington, the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n \"I have no intention of letting victory turn into complacency, because we have seen what happens when we don't invest everywhere. I plan to get to work to lift up the Biden-Harris administration, build on our progress and strengthen our party,\" Harrison said.\n Harrison's task, unlike that of his predecessor Tom Perez, will be to act as a megaphone for Democratic accomplishments in the coming years and push back against Republican attacks, all in the hope that the party avoids losing its majorities in the 2022 midterm elections.\n \"The job of doing the work is on the Hill and in the White House; the job of making sure that message gets out and it is promoted and disseminated to voters and so those voters have an understanding of it, I believe that's the job of the DNC,\" Harrison told CNN in an interview before he was officially elected chair. He went on to describe the job as getting \"that message out\" so people \"understand this is what you get when you have Democrats in control.\"\n Harrison had long been seen as the only candidate for the job of DNC chair and Biden made his selection official shortly before he was inaugurated. The former Senate candidate officially took the job on Thursday after the members of the Democratic National Committee met virtually to approve Biden's slate of nominees.\n There was no suspense to the election: The only slate of candidates submitted was the one proposed by Biden's transition team, multiple Democratic officials tell CNN.\n \"My friends, in spite of everything we have been though in the last year, I am excited because today we are embarking upon a new mission to build back better and bring hope back to this great nation,\" Harrison said in his first address to the DNC.\n He also nodded to the need for Democrats to make inroads in reliably Republican states and rural America.\n \"We are done looking at the map, ignoring the red, while we focus on a few purple areas,\" Harrison said. \"We are done with just focusing on our cities while forgetting those living on dirt roads. When I look at the map, I see an entire country at stake.\"\n In addition to Harrison, a series of high-profile Democrats will be taking on leadership roles at the DNC under Biden.\n Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is now the committee's vice chair of civic engagement and voter protection, while Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Rep. Filemon Vela Jr. of Texas are all vice chairs. Virginia McGregor was approved as committee treasurer, while Jason Rae will continue in the role of secretary and Chris Korge as national finance chair.\n Perez will leave his DNC post after four years at the helm. The former Obama labor secretary took over the committee in 2017, when it was rudderless, scandal-prone and unable to raise serious money after years of neglect by the Obama administration. Perez worked to rebuild the committee and focused on two key issues: investing in the infrastructure of the party and rebuilding trust in the DNC after the committee became a source of controversy during the 2016 nominating fight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n \"We had to rebuild our infrastructure and rebuild trust, and I believe we have made great progress in both those areas,\" Perez said during remarks on Thursday.\n He leaves the committee in a significantly better place than he found it. The DNC helped Biden shatter fundraising records during the 2020 campaign and is now well positioned with a strong small-dollar donor based that was nearly nonexistent four year earlier.\n \"Frankly,\" Perez told the audience on Thursday, \"we inherited a Radio Shack and turned it into a Fifth Avenue Apple store.\"\n Harrison, however, will be asked to do something much different -- and his power will be somewhat constrained by the politics of the White House, which will have direct control of the committee. Jen O'Malley Dillon, Biden's deputy chief of staff and former campaign manager, will have operations of the committee within her purview, meaning she will work to ensure that the political committee's work is in step with Biden's political goals. O'Malley Dillon was the executive director of the DNC after Obama's 2008 election.\n Ken Martin -- the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party -- was reelected Thursday to be the president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, an organization within the DNC that coordinates among all the state parties.\n \"I look forward to continuing our party's work of electing champions for justice, freedom, fairness, and opportunity for all Americans,\" Martin said in a statement in response to his reelection.\n Perez, a diehard Buffalo Bills fan, ended a tribute to his tenure by joking about some time off.\n \"Please don't call me between 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock this Sunday,\" he said, a nod to the Bills playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs.",
