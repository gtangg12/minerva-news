        "body_text": "Errol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nRemember that time a violent mob smashed its way into the Capitol, killed a police officer and occupied the Senate chambers, hunting for terrified members of Congress who were forced to hide?\n Remember how some in the mob constructed a gallows with a hangman's noose outside the Capitol, then rampaged through the halls searching for the vice president and the speaker of the house -- the officials second and third in line of succession to the President -- chanting \"Hang Pence!\" and \"Where's Nancy?\"\n And remember how the specific goal of the violent attack -- overturning the election of President Joe Biden -- was being advanced by sycophantic lawmakers who shamefully tried to invalidate the votes of an estimated 10 million Americans in Arizona and Pennsylvania and declare Donald Trump the winner?\n Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri apparently hope you don't remember any of that. Or that you'll treat it like one more bit of the normal back-and-forth of politics.\n Not this time.\n Cruz and Hawley, like others who endorsed and/or sought political benefit from the lies that brought chaos at the Capitol, are up against an enraged public. A public that will never forget one of the most vicious and serious attacks ever launched against American democracy.\n Law enforcement officials are diligently tracking down and arresting lots of people -- nearly 100 as of this writing -- suspected of participating in the mob attack. The probe is expanding to include members of far-right organizations like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\n But what about the people who were attacking democracy from inside the Capitol building? What about the lawmakers who dishonestly pretended that, despite multiple recounts and dozens of legal rulings, the 2020 election was somehow so tainted that the outcome should be overturned?\n What, in short, about Cruz and Hawley?\n Seven senators filed an ethics complaint against Cruz and Hawley, calling their support for the wholesale overturning of election results \"improper conduct reflecting on the Senate\" that should result in an investigation and \"recommendations for strong disciplinary action, including up to expulsion or censure, if warranted by the facts uncovered.\"\n That sentiment was echoed by members of the public, who made the phrase \"As a Texan\" trend on Twitter on the day the ethics complaint was filed, with one person tweeting, for example, \"As a Texan, as an American, I'm outraged in the treasonous actions from @SenTedCruz to incite an armed insurrection at the Capitol. @tedcruz resigning is an easy out, he must be expelled.\"\n Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group, tweeted: \"There is no room in Congress for people who incited the January 6th insurrection like Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley. They must go.\"\n Predictably, the opportunists Hawley and Cruz have struck a defiant tone, with Hawley vowing to \"never apologize\" for trying to overturn election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, and Cruz telling a Texas radio station: \"What I was doing and what the other senators were doing is what we were elected to do, which is debating matters of great import in the chamber of the United States Senate.\"\n What the senators may not understand is that there's a very big difference between debating matters of legitimate dispute -- like where to set tax rates or how to fund bridges, roads and schools -- and giving credence and political support to dangerous, fact-free conspiracy theories.\n It's unlikely that the Senate will expel Cruz and Hawley from their ranks: Such strong measures haven't been taken since the 1860s, when a raft of traitorous lawmakers -- including two each from Texas and Missouri -- were kicked out for supporting the Confederacy against the United States.\n But Cruz and Hawley now stand exposed as the kind of cynical politicians whose misleading statements, phony outrage and outright lies contributed to the attack on the Capitol, and on the recently concluded election.\n Their colleagues in Congress and the public at large have been put on notice that some leaders have been playing with political dynamite -- and that we must not risk letting them do so ever again.",

        "title": "Senate impeachment trial arguments to start February 9",
        "body_text": "The second Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is scheduled to begin on February 9 after Senate leaders reached a deal to push it back, giving Trump's legal team more time to prepare and Senate Democrats a chance to consider Covid-19 legislation and to confirm President Joe Biden's Cabinet.\n House Democrats will formally walk over the single article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Monday evening, but the agreement between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will push back the substance of the trial until February. Without an agreement, the trial would have started the afternoon after the article was transmitted to the Senate.\n \"We have made good progress in our efforts to determine the timing and structure of the impeachment trial of Donald J Trump,\" Schumer said Friday evening announcing the trial schedule, saying it would begin the week of February 8.\n Under the agreement, the ceremonial functions of the trial will occur next week, with the articles being presented on Monday and senators being sworn in as jurors on Tuesday. Then the trial will pause, while the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial itself to begin.\n A delay to the impeachment trial also makes sense for Democrats because the trial had threatened to stall the confirmation of Biden's Cabinet, as well as put a stop to any consideration of another Covid stimulus package, as Senate Republicans said Friday they would not allow the Senate to confirm nominees at the same time the trial is going on. The trial's timing had been one of several logistical hurdles the Senate is tackling amid broader negotiations between Schumer and McConnell over how the 50-50 Senate will be governed.\n McConnell had proposed delaying the trial until early February, arguing that Trump's legal team should be given ample time to prepare after the House's swift impeachment of Trump for \"incitement of insurrection\" earlier this month. The timeline Schumer announced Friday evening is one week earlier that what McConnell had proposed, but the Kentucky Republican's team praised the agreement Friday.\" This is a win for due process and fairness,\" said McConnell spokesman Doug Andres.\n The length of the trial is still an open question and will depend both on whether the House impeachment managers seek to call witnesses and the length of senators' questions for the legal teams. But sources say most believe the trial will be shorter than the three-week 2020 impeachment trial for Trump.\n The timing for the trial had remained unsettled on Friday morning as the negotiations continued between Senate leaders. On Friday morning, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would transmit the impeachment article to the Senate on Monday, in effect setting a deadline for the Senate to cut a deal on the trial timing.\n \"We are respectful of the Senate's constitutional power over the trial and always attentive to the fairness of the process, noting that the former president will have had the same amount of time to prepare for trial as our Managers,\" Pelosi said Friday. \"Our Managers are ready to begin to make their case to 100 Senate jurors through the trial process.\"\n Republicans made clear Friday that Biden's agenda would have been frozen until the Senate finished the trial, had it taken place next week.\n \"We won't be doing any confirmations, we won't be doing any Covid-19 relief, we won't be doing anything else other than impeaching a person who's not even president,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of Senate GOP leadership.\n Cornyn said Republicans haven't given consent to bifurcate the trial days to take up nominations during the trial. \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" he said.\n In order to convict Trump, Democrats need a two-thirds majority, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote to convict Trump, assuming that all 50 Democrats do. Ten House Republicans joined with Democrats to impeach.\n Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, considered a swing GOP vote, said Friday that the process \"has to be fair.\"\n \"My thought process is to see what happens as this unfolds,\" she said. \"You know, we learned this morning that Speaker Pelosi is going to transmit the article on Monday. As I understand, right now, there hasn't been an agreed-to schedule on the pre-trial. I think what McConnell laid down was eminently reasonable, in terms of making sure that we got process. Got to have process and the process has to be fair. So yeah, so we've got to get started, I guess.\"\n The Biden administration has publicly taken a hands-off approach to the impeachment process has publicly taken a hands-off approach to the impeachment process. Biden has never had a strong appetite for impeaching Trump, advisers say, but he also has little desire for allowing the Senate trial to drag out any longer than necessary.\n \"We need to move past this,\" a Biden official told CNN. \"The only way for that to happen is for the trial to begin.\"\n But Biden said at a White House announcement Friday that he saw the upside to waiting on the trial.  \"The more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better,\" he said.\n A faction of Senate Republicans has argued that the impeachment trial would be unconstitutional because Trump has already left office. It's an argument that Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has suggested Trump's legal team should adopt.\n \"I think it's obvious that the post-presidential impeachment has never occurred in the history of the country for a reason, that it's unconstitutional, that it sets a bad precedent for the presidency and it continues to divide the nation,\" Graham said Friday.\n But Schumer pushed back on that argument, noting that both liberal and conservative legal scholars have said there is precedent for an impeachment trial of a former official.\n \"The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump,\" Schumer said. \"It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial. But make no mistake, there will be a trial, and when that trial ends, senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump incited the insurrection against the United States.\"\n McConnell said Friday that the Senate should give Trump a \"full and fair process\" to mount his impeachment defense.\n \"This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process over in the House. The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages the Senate or the presidency itself,\" McConnell said. \"Senate Republicans strongly believe we need a full and fair process where the former president can mount a defense and the Senate can properly consider the factual, legal, and constitutional questions at stake.\"\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.\n CNN's Lauren Fox, Alex Rogers, Ali Zaslav, Jessica Dean, Annie Grayer, Jeff Zeleny and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A school district in Georgia is mourning the loss of two educators who died within hours of each other from Covid-19.\n Dana Johnson and Cynthia Lindsey, employees in Cobb County Schools in metro Atlanta, both lost their battle against Covid-19 on Thursday, according to Connie Jackson, president of the Cobb County Association of Educators. GoFundMe pages for the two educators confirmed the deaths.\n Johnson was a teacher at Kemp Elementary School and suffered from pre-existing conditions. Lindsey was a paraprofessional at Sedalia Park Elementary.\n A third educator in the county, Patrick Key, died on Christmas Day from Covid-19. An art scholarship has since been established in his honor.\n \"Teachers are willing to take a bullet for our kids. We shouldn't have to be willing to, in the middle of a pandemic, die from a disease because we want to be teachers,\" Jackson said.\n In a statement to CNN, the Cobb County School District said Johnson and Lindsey were valuable members of their team and expressed condolences to their families.\n \"Every member of our school community has been impacted by the ongoing battle against COVID-19,\" said the school district in the statement. \"We continue to ask our staff, students, and families to follow public health guidance -- wear masks and social distance -- so we can stay as healthy as possible.\"\n Georgia has struggled with the pandemic, including Cobb County.\n The county of about 760,000 people has recorded 57,000 cases and 672 Covid-related deaths, the Cobb County Covid dashboard said.\n According to the Cobb County Schools website, there are 388 active Covid cases in the school district as of Friday. The district serves about 107,000 students.\n So many students and staff have had to quarantine recently that the school district canceled all in-person classes the week of January 18.\n In-person and virtual classes are expected to resume on Monday, January 25.  In an announcement on Friday, the district said it is committed to offering face-to-face and remote learning options for all families.\n \"The separation period will allow our staff and students to return on January 25 after a time of quarantine, better prepared to teach and learn in face-to-face and remote classrooms to honor the instructional delivery models our families have chosen,\" said the school district.\n But some teachers and parents want all-virtual classes.\n A group of them stood outside the school district offices last Thursday during a board meeting to protest. And more than 6,500 people have signed an online petition for all-virtual classes.\n Jackson told CNN she has been speaking out at every board meeting trying to present the school board with different teaching alternatives. One of those options includes keeping at-risk educators teaching from home.\n \"It's just wrong to keep risking people's lives,\" said Jackson.\n A Cobb County elementary school teacher, Justin Julian, told CNN the teachers of Cobb County have been emotionally impacted by the deaths of their coworkers, especially those who are worried about the virus.\n \"It's a lot to take on our shoulders and it's exhausting trying to fight this fight all the time,\" he said.\n Julian said teachers want the option of working from home.\n \"A lot of the teachers want virtual, they want a virtual environment. They think that that's the safest for not only for them, but the community and to lessen the community spread,\" Julian said.",

He was charged with felony theft and released on bond the same day, according to online jail records.\n Brown is accused of creating more than 40 returns ranging from $75 to over $87,000 for nonexistent items and putting refunds on several credit cards, according to the police. Detectives allege he stole more than $980,000 over two weeks before corporate employees from the grocery store chain noticed the fraudulent transactions and contacted the police, the news release said.\n Brown purchased two vehicles with the money, but totaled one of them before his arrest, the police statement said. It did not give details on the number or type of guns that police allege he purchased.\n A substantial part of money was returned after his arrest, but Gwinnett Police Corporal Collin Flynn said they are still calculating the exact amount.\n CNN was not able to reach Brown for comment and it is unclear whether he has an attorney.\n In a statement to CNN, Kroger says it cannot comment on the ongoing investigation.",

The man suffered lacerations to his calf and is in good condition, officials say.\n The shark was estimated to be 8 feet in length, the department said in a press release. Authorities remain at the scene and are advising beachgoers to stay out of the water.\n The incident is the second shark attack of the year in Hawaii.

The chances of being bitten by a shark are less than one in a million, according to the Department of Land and Natural Resources.",

The guard members, who on Thursday night were unceremoniously relegated to the parking garage near the Capitol to sleep on the ground, expressed their thanks.\n The first lady made her unscheduled stop at the Capitol after a planned visit to Whitman-Walker Health in downtown Washington, just a handful of blocks north of the White House.\n Whitman-Walker is a nonprofit federally qualified health center that offers community-based health and wellness services, and specializes in LGBTQ and HIV care, according to a statement from the East Wing. The clinic also offers cancer support and navigation services to patients and caregivers. Biden was given a tour of the facility and listened as administrators outlined what has been working for them during the pandemic to reach patients, and what has not.\n \"Everybody needs more mental health work,\" said Biden, noting the overwhelming challenges facing health care providers and patients being outlined by a member of Whitman-Walker staff.\n \"We're in your corner,\" she added.\n Like President Joe Biden, the first lady stressed the importance of getting a handle on the coronavirus.\n \"The first thing we have to do is address this pandemic,\" she said, clapping her hands for emphasis. Shortly thereafter, she was off to the Capitol to greet the troops and hand out the homemade cookies.\n \"You are all the best, thank you so very much,\" said Biden, who posed for a group photograph. The troops saluted her back, letting out a loud \"hoo-ah!\" in appreciation.",

        "body_text": "A Grand Traverse County commissioner in Michigan got up and grabbed a gun during a board Webex meeting while a local woman asked board members to denounce the Proud Boys, video from the meeting shows.\n Keli MacIntosh, a 72-year-old retired nurse and regular attendee of the board meetings, spoke at the Wednesday gathering about the importance of denouncing the activities of the Proud Boys in support of a woman who spoke before her on the same topic.\n The first woman criticized the board for allowing members of the group to speak during a March meeting regarding making the county a \"gun sanctuary.\"\n The woman and MacIntosh told the board that normalizing the Proud Boys, a far-right group, is harmful to the community and asked the commissioners to denounce their actions in light of the US Capitol riot on January 6.\n \"It's really hard to tell the difference between the Proud Boys and the message they want through our state, how that's different from what's happened in Washington,\" MacIntosh said during the meeting. \"Welcoming such a group and having that message go out has changed the environment in Northern Michigan from a hunting culture to that of a gun culture. And I am just really concerned.\"\n As she lamented about the Proud Boys being invited to speak about gun rights,  Board Vice Chair Ron Clous got up and returned with a large gun, which he briefly held against his chest before putting it down.\n MacIntosh said that she saw Clous get up out of the corner of her eye while she was speaking, but was shocked when she saw what he came back with.\n \"My request was, can you please make a public statement denouncing the Proud Boys, and his statement was to shove an assault rifle in my face,\" MacIntosh told CNN. \"I didn't think he was going to shoot me through the screen or anything like that. But the first thing I thought is, how does anyone feel free to speak up lest they do not test the temper of the commissioner, or you will be reamed over the coals by them.\"\n Clous has not responded to CNN's request for comment on the events during the meeting. He told The Record Eagle he retrieved his rifle in response to the board being asked to denounce the group.\n \"I was going to chime in as well,\" Clous said. \"I was just going to show the rifle and show that I fully support the Second Amendment, but then I opted not to ... I was in my home.\"\n Since the events of January 6, MacIntosh said she felt compelled to ask the board to publicly denounce the actions of the Proud Boys, especially because of what has happened in the state regarding extremism in the last several months.\n But after the first woman finished speaking, Rob Hentschel, chair of the board of commissioners, stopped the public comment period to address the claims that the Proud Boys were getting preferential treatment.\n \"I'm going to take a brief pause right now because of the insinuation of racism in this board, and because I take that very seriously. If any particular commissioner would like to denounce any particular hate group that's fine,\" Hentschel said.\n He challenged some of the claims about the March meeting at which the \"gun sanctuary\" was discussed before defending the Proud Boys themselves.\n \"I'm not a member of Proud Boys. I did not give a Proud Boy 20 minutes of time in the commissioner's meeting. But I do know a few Proud Boys, I've met a few. I've met Black Proud Boys, I've met multi-racial Puerto-Rican Proud Boys, and they informed me they also have gay Proud Boys. I don't see how that's a hate group. And I don't really appreciate this forum being used to spread misinformation about me or groups.\"\n MacIntosh, who was called on for public comment right after Hentschel's declaration, said that she was already very nervous to speak because she thought she might get called out in the same way. Time was called before she could finish her remarks.\n About 10 minutes later, she started receiving calls from the community asking if she was OK and if she felt safe. She said she's gotten enormous support from the community, including offers for her to temporarily stay somewhere else or even people volunteering to guard her house.\n When asked by CNN if he thought Clous's actions were appropriate, Hentschel said he wouldn't make a judgment on that, but that he \"probably would not have done it myself.\"\n \"Mr. Clous did not break any rules or laws in what he did,\" Hentschel said in a statement. \"The claims of intimidation are greatly exaggerated. The speaker has been a regular commenter for over 2 years who has often criticized but always been welcomed by the Grand Traverse County Board of Commissioners.\"\n Clous also told the Record Eagle he won't denounce any group, including Black Lives Matter, the NFL or LBGTQ.\n \"The only thing I know about them (Proud Boys) is when they came and spoke to us,\" Clous said. \"They were probably the most respected folks that got up and talked (at the March meeting). They were decent guys and they treated us with respect\"\n MacIntosh said that she has filed a report with the Michigan State Troopers, but it is unclear where it will go from there. When asked if she plans to speak up again in future meetings, she laughed and responded with a forceful \"Yes.\"\n \"I might seem like a little old gray-haired lady to these people, but I'm going to stay there,\" she said. \"We cannot back down, the reason our country is like this is because not a single person in Washington said anything to what was going on. We cannot let this go unchallenged, we cannot not fight.\"",

She is the host of the podcast \"Kill Me Now,\" available on iTunes or at  judygold.com/podcast. She is also the author of \"Yes I Can Say That,\" from Dey Street Books. Follow her on Twitter @JewdyGold. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\nEach morning for the past four years, I have arisen from a tormented slumber like this:\n EGO: \"Don't look at your phone. Don't do it.\"\n ID: \"Stop it, I have to.\"\n EGO: \"Judy, there is nothing you can do about it. You have to relax.\"\n ID: \"I have to look! Something big is happening, I can feel it. Something terrible happened while I slept!  WHAT DID HE DO??? WHAT DID HE DO NOW!?!?! WHERE'S MY PHONE!\"\n Not today. This morning I picked up my phone immediately, but it was not for news about Trump. It was for a different FOMO (fear of missing out). The FOMO...on something really funny.\n I couldn't wait to chuckle at the latest Bernie meme -- Bernie Sanders in a chair waiting at the nail salon; Bernie next to Churchill at Yalta; Bernie on the park bench with Forrest Gump; Bernie sitting on an I-beam with a 1930's skyscraper crew suspended over New York City; Bernie with the Golden Girls; at someone's kitchen table with a bottle of milk; with Big Bird; with Spiderman; being painted by Bob Ross; and on and on. I couldn't wait to share it with my texting pod, re-tweet, put it in my Instagram story, rinse and repeat. LOL, LMFAO, HA HA!! \"Did you see this one?\"\n It started with a funny enough real picture of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, socially distanced and a little cranky-faced on a folding chair on the Capitol steps in a drab GoreTex jacket and big, brown hippy mittens, arms and legs folded for warmth, glasses and paper mask askew at President Joe Biden's inauguration.  As soon as the world laid eyes on that image Wednesday, it exploded across photoshopping screens and then the internet.\n Bernie Sanders -- the long-serving, self-described democratic socialist, the scourge of economic inequality and now the powerful incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee -- has inadvertently provided us with something we have been robbed of for the past four years, good old fashioned laughter.\n Whatever political party you pledge allegiance to, whatever your socio-economic background, immigration status, language, gender, race, sexual orientation, religion...there is a Bernie meme for you. Bernie Gangnam stylin', Bernie with Chewbacca, or playing chess in the Queen's Gambit. Bernie on the subway.\n Great comedy often comes from being a fish out of water. Sen. Sanders, attending what is arguably the most watched fashion forward outdoor event of the next four years in a Burton jacket zipped to his ears and those mittens (handmade by a teacher from Vermont) -- like he's headed to the post office in Rutland -- was everything this country needed. Who knew?\n Great comedians and satirists understand that there is nothing funnier than the truth. (The truth -- something else we have missed.) And for all of the pomp and circumstance and talk of unity at the inauguration, it was Bernie Sanders, I would argue, who brought it home. No matter what anyone was wearing, singing or saying, sitting behind them was this unpretentious and completely authentic older gentleman exhibiting what everyone was probably thinking, \"Hurry up! I'm freezing!\"\n A meme is only a meme -- I know. But why don't we think of this moment of silly hilarity as something more: a much-needed olive branch. Think of all the people you have avoided, shunned, unfriended and all but disowned because of their politics. Think of the times you saw an email or text from someone you vowed never to speak to again, and you furiously and immediately deleted it.\n I can pretty much guarantee that there is a Bernie meme out there for them. One that might just be disarming enough to reopen the lines of communication. Maybe it's Bernie in your soup; Bernie in your shower; Bernie at your bat mitzvah; Bernie in an Edward Hopper painting; Bernie at your pap smear; Bernie at the Last Supper' Bernie at your family's Thanksgiving table; on the surface of the moon -- it doesn't matter where or why, it's just funny.\n Comedy is a uniter that evens out the playing field. It relieves stress and tension, and it's truly the best medicine. As the writer Madeleine L'Engle once said, \"A good laugh heals a lot of hurts.\"\n So, why not put Bernie somewhere, anywhere, in a meme of your own, send it off and let the healing begin.\n Oh, and in case you're wondering, Bernie's jacket is sold out. So are the gloves.",

Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Cori Bush of Missouri on Friday led a group of 35 lawmakers in urging President Joe Biden to commute the sentences of all federal prisoners on death row.\n In a letter sent Friday, the lawmakers urge Biden \"to take swift, decisive action,\" saying that \"commuting the death sentences of those on death row and ensuring that each person is provided with an adequate and unique re-sentencing process is a crucial first step in remedying this grave injustice.\"\n \"We look forward to working with your administration to enact just and restorative policies that will meaningfully transform our criminal legal system for the better. By exercising your clemency power, you can ensure that there would be no one left on death row to kill. Given the historic nature of your administration, this would be an unprecedented -- but necessary -- action to reverse systemic injustices and restore America's moral standing,\" according to the letter.\n There are currently 49 people on federal death row, 21 of whom are White, 20 who are Black, seven who are Latino and one who is Asian.\n A commutation is different from a pardon in that the prisoners would have their sentences reduced but would not be cleared of the charges or have to be released from prison. If Biden chose to take the lawmakers' advice, he could replace the death sentences with sentences of life in prison.\n The three-page letter included co-signers Democratic Reps. Karen Bass of California, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ritchie Torres of New York.\n It is the second letter Pressley has sent to Biden on the topic, pushing him to act quickly to end the federal death penalty. Her first letter, on December 15, came five days after the execution of Brandon Bernard, telling Biden that \"with a stroke of a pen, you can stop all federal executions.\"\n Pressley proposed legislation to eliminate capital punishment in July 2019, when then-Attorney General William Barr announced restarting federal executions. In the time since that bill was introduced, 13 men and a woman have been executed by the federal government, all in the last months of the Trump administration as the coronavirus pandemic raged.\n \"Congress is right: President Biden must go further than just not carrying out executions and should immediately commute all federal death sentences. When the Supreme Court, without any explanation, vacates lower court stays to allow the execution of a woman whose mental illness leaves her with no understanding of why she is being executed, we know the federal death penalty system is broken beyond repair,\" said Kelley Henry, attorney for Lisa Montgomery, who became the first woman federally executed in nearly 70 years on January 12.\n Biden has previously said that ending the federal death penalty is on his list of plans for criminal justice, but he has yet to address the topic since he took office.\n When asked on Wednesday whether there would be a moratorium on the federal death penalty, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: \"The President, as you know, has stated his opposition to the death penalty in the past. He remains -- that remains his view. I don't have anything more for you in terms of future actions or mechanisms, though.\"",

        "body_text": "Dr. Deborah Birx \"always\" considered quitting then-President Donald Trump's White House coronavirus task force and was troubled by colleagues' perceptions that she had become political, she said in an interview clip released Friday.\n \"I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that, um, every day?\" Birx told CBS' Margaret Brennan in a clip from an interview that will be released in full on Sunday.\n \"Colleagues of mine that I had known for decades -- decades -- in that one experience, because I was in the White House, decided that I had become this political person, even though they had known me forever,\" she said. \"I had to ask myself every morning: Is there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic? And it's something I asked myself every night.\"\n When asked whether she had ever considered quitting, she replied, \"Always.\"\n Birx, who served as the White House's coronavirus response coordinator under Trump, retired on Wednesday, according to a recently updated US Department of State website. She often sought to toe the line between directly contradicting Trump on the pandemic and accurately portraying the data she pored over. In the fall, Birx ultimately ceded White House turf to top Trump adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, while hitting the road to spread her public health message.\n Birx acknowledged during the interview that she knew the election outcome would be a factor in the administration's communication about the pandemic.\n \"When it became a point where I could -- I wasn't getting anywhere and that was like right before the election, I wrote a very detailed communication plan of what needed to happen the day after the election and how that needed to be executed. And there was a lot of promise that that would happen,\" she said, adding that she had never withheld information herself.\n CNN reported in November that Birx had privately told colleagues she had not yet been contacted by anyone on then-President-elect Joe Biden's team, and had privately expressed interest in keeping her role as coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force or a similar position within a Biden-led government. Her work did not translate into a spot on Biden's new 12-member coronavirus task force.\n In December, Birx told Newsy that she would assist in the transition to the Biden administration and would \"be helpful in any role that people think I can be helpful in, and then I will retire.\"\n CNN's Ben Tinker and Arman Azad contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Thousands of National Guard troops could remain in Washington until March",
        "body_text": "Discussions are taking place about keeping thousands of National Guard troops in Washington until March because of concerns about potential unrest during the upcoming impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and around President Joe Biden's first joint address to Congress, two defense officials told CNN.\n The concerns stem from what defense officials say is ongoing chatter about demonstrations picked up by federal law enforcement. On Thursday, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser referenced \"intelligence from our federal partners that would suggest that we need more presence,\" but she did not elaborate.\n CNN reported Thursday that most of the 25,000 National Guardsmen who were brought to Washington to help secure the city through Biden's inauguration following the deadly riot at the Capitol earlier in the month would be sent home within five to 10 days, according to a statement from the National Guard Bureau. Approximately 15,000 troops will return home \"as soon as possible,\" though the planning and process to begin moving them may take a few days.\n There are some agencies requesting ongoing support, the National Guard Bureau said, and about 7,000 Guardsmen are expected to stay through the end of the January, but CNN has learned that discussions are taking place about potentially extending that deployment.\n One defense official told CNN the deployment could last at least through Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate, while a separate defense official said it could last until Biden makes his first address to a joint session of Congress.\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Friday that the impeachment trial is due to begin on February 8, and Biden's first joint address to Congress is yet to be scheduled but is expected to take place in the coming weeks.\n The news of a potential extension of the National Guard deployments comes as CNN reported Friday that a series of miscommunications had left Guard members searching for an adequate rest area Thursday night when they were moved from the Capitol into a nearby parking garage.\n Guard members ended up having to spend several hours resting on the concrete in the garage before the mistake was fixed and they were moved back to the Capitol Visitor Center.\n In a briefing with reporters Thursday, Christopher Rodriguez, director of the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency for the District of Columbia, said Washington had made a request for continued National Guard support in the coming days.\n \"We have requested, because we do anticipate that there will be another national special security event occurring, the joint session of Congress. On behalf of the Metropolitan Police Department, we've made a request for continued National Guard support with traffic management and crowd control through January 30,\" Rodriguez said.\n Incidents in Washington have calmed down, a law enforcement official said, but not to a level where anything greatly changes in terms of security concerns. The Capitol and events surrounding it remain a target, the official said.\n The ongoing deployment, however, would be \"voluntary,\" and governors will have to agree to keep forces in the city.\n Fewer than 250 of the approximately 25,000 National Guardsmen in the city for inauguration have tested positive for Covid-19, according to a defense official, but the fear remains among some troops that coronavirus is spreading during their deployment -- especially when packed into tight quarters like on Thursday.\n One Guardsman who spoke with CNN Thursday after troops were directed to the parking garage was worried about the confined indoor space. \"We've already had just some in my unit alone test positive for Covid, and they're just keeping us packed together with caution tape in small areas,\" said the Guardsman, who added that more than 20 troops from his unit are quarantining.\n The Department of Defense does not release coronavirus numbers for specific units or areas, and repeated queries to the National Guard Bureau regarding positive coronavirus tests in troops deployed to the capital have gone unanswered.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n Oren Liebermann contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Accused of abandoning two babies in the US, this Chinese celebrity has sparked a national debate about surrogacy",
        "body_text": "At first, it seemed like a classic celebrity romance.\n Zheng Shuang, 29, was one of China's most popular actresses after shooting to fame a decade ago. Zhang Heng, 30, was a talented producer for a variety show. In 2018, the pair went public with a set of couple selfies, and often appeared affectionately in the spotlight afterward -- even co-starring in a popular reality series.\n The couple was believed to have split while two surrogate mothers they hired were pregnant with their kids, with Zheng accused of abandoning the babies.\n A Chinese media outlet subsequently publicized alleged photos of the children's birth certificates, which showed they were born in December 2019 and January 2020 in the US. Zhang and Zheng were named as their parents.\n It also published a recording of an alleged phone call, during which Zheng's parents allegedly suggested abandoning the children or giving them up for adoption, while Zheng allegedly expressed frustration that abortion was not a viable option given the mothers were 7 months' pregnant at the time.\n The allegations shocked many in China, where family ties are typically treasured, and ignited outrage on social media. It has also sparked debate about surrogacy in a country that officially opposes the practice, yet has a booming underground market for it.\n The scandal exploded on Weibo after Zhang's post, with the associated hashtag racking up more than 3 billions views and drawing a torrent of criticism against Zheng. And the backlash was not limited to the online sphere.\n Within days, Zheng was censured by state media, and condemned by China's ruling Communist Party (CCP) agencies. \"Surrogacy is clearly banned in our country, and its disregard of life makes one bristle with anger,\" state broadcaster CCTV said in a commentary.\n The CCP's top commission overseeing political and legal affairs accused Zheng of \"taking advantage of legal loopholes\" by seeking surrogate mothers in the US, calling her actions \"definitely not law-abiding.\" \"Surrogacy is banned in China as it uses women's uteruses as a tool and sells life as a commercial product,\" the commission wrote.\n Zheng was dropped by several international brands, including luxury fashion label Prada.\n Responding to the firestorm, Zheng wrote on Weibo Tuesday that \"this is a very sad and private matter for me.\" She did not directly address allegations over the surrogacy dispute, but said she \"did not violate the state's instructions while on Chinese soil and respected all laws and regulations while abroad.\"\n Technically, Zheng was right.\n While surrogacy has long been in the Chinese government's crosshairs, deemed a threat to its strict population control policies, the country's national legislature has never passed legislation explicitly outlawing it.\n But the document did not ban individuals or agencies from commissioning or providing surrogacy services, or list any according punishment. The legal limbo has led to a growing underground domestic surrogacy industry, driven by huge demand, while other Chinese couples are going abroad for surrogacy services.\n The US, where commercial surrogacy is allowed for foreigners in some states, has become a top choice for the wealthy Chinese elites, thanks to its mature industry and high safety standards.  A child born in the US will also come with American citizenship -- a bonus for some Chinese parents.\n Debates over the ethical issues of surrogacy have taken place across the globe, with opponents warning that the practice can lead to the exploitation and trafficking of women, the commodifying of the female body and children, and the deepening of inequality between rich and poor.\n But the stern official condemnation of Zheng's actions comes from a government that has for decades been criticized for using forced abortion and sterilization to limit the number of children in each family. While China's one-child policy was relaxed in 2016 -- allowing couples to have two children -- the country now has a falling birth rate and a rapidly aging society, meaning it is in urgent need of more newborns to avert a looming population crisis.\n The Chinese government has resorted to a flurry of policies to encourage young people to get married and have children -- to very limited success. However, it still bans the commercial use of many reproductive technologies, such as egg freezing, that would give women the freedom to have children later in life.\n Surrogacy, along with other forms of reproductive assistant technology, provides an opportunity for infertile couples to have biological offspring. According to a 2009 survey from the China Population Association, 12.5% of Chinese at childbearing age -- or 40 million people -- were infertile. There are also demands for surrogacy from a large pool of older couples who lost their only child, or who simply want a second now they can, as well as a growing number of LGBT couples.\n While Chinese health authorities and other government agencies have launched periodic crackdowns, including a joint campaign in 2015 by a dozen government departments on surrogacy services, it has been to no long-term avail.\n That has led some experts to suggest Beijing should legalizing the practice at home, to bring more protection to surrogate mothers and address the growing demand from infertile couples and older parents in the wake of the relaxation of the one-child policy. But many oppose the idea and call for surrogacy to be outlawed, citing a wealth of ethical issues.\n Yuan Xiaolu, a Chinese lawyer, told state-run news agency Xinhua the \"lost cost\" for violating regulations is an important reason for the underground market to outlast the crackdowns.\n A lack of regulation over the industry also means there's little protection for surrogate mothers and babies.\n Last week, state-run news website The Paper reported that a couple canceled an agreement with a surrogate mother in southwest China upon discovering she had syphilis during her pregnancy. The surrogate mother ultimately raised the child herself, but was still unable to get her registered three years later as she had sold the child's birth certificate on the black market to pay her hospital bills after having a C-section delivery.\n Following Zheng's controversy, there have been renewed calls for China to ban all forms of surrogacy outright. But some analysts say that will simply drive the practice further underground, as demand will likely only increase in the future.\n Whether the government will respond with another round of crackdowns, or propose legislation to explicitly outlaw the practice, remains to be seen.\n But what appears certain is that Zheng's career as an A-list actress has taken a blow. While public outrage on Chinese social media was mainly aimed at her seemingly unmaternal instincts, and allegedly leaving her estranged partner alone and unable to return home with two American-born children due to the pandemic, it was clear the state had taken greater umbrage with her sidestepping its rules on surrogacy.\n On Wednesday night, China's National Radio and Television Administration issued a commentary on Zheng's scandal. \"(She) circumvented the law to seek surrogacy overseas, then wanting to abandon (her babies), actors like her lack personal virtue,\" the commentary said.\n \"We won't give the chance and platform to celebrities embroiled in such scandals to make public appearance.\"",

        "body_text": "After bringing federal charges against more than 125 people accused of being part of the violent mob that stormed the US Capitol, now comes the hard part.\n Law enforcement officials say they are moving from the so-called low-hanging fruit arrests and charges to more complicated cases, focusing on the extremist groups that participated in the attack.\n That effort will take months to try to piece together, in part, because unlike some of the early arrests of suspects -- who gleefully posted on social media or even live-streamed their involvement -- many alleged attackers took pains to hide their identities and their involvement.\n Hundreds of more arrests are still expected, officials have said.\n Prosecutors have said in detention hearings they are working on bringing seditious conspiracy charges -- a prospect that Washington, DC, acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin raised publicly early on.\n But with a new administration now running the Justice Department, taking such a major step on a rarely used law would likely require sign-off from the new Biden administration officials at Justice headquarters.\n For now, the department is led by acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson and acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin. It's unclear whether they would want to be the ones to sign off on sedition charges, with Senate confirmation likely still weeks away for Judge Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco, Biden's picks for the top two jobs. If department officials decide to wait for Garland to arrive, it could slow the work underway.\n The Civil War-era law brings up to 20-year penalties for plotting to overthrow the US government and to use force to oppose US government authority or to delay the execution of a US law. Last summer, amid street protests following the police killing of George Floyd, then-Attorney General William Barr encouraged federal prosecutors to use the law against leftist protesters, a move that no one made.\n The most recent use of the law came during the Obama administration, but a judge dismissed seditious conspiracy charges against members of a militant group in Michigan that had discussed attacks against federal and local authorities, because they hadn't done enough to directly attempt to thwart the federal government.\n The law was used successfully in 1995 against Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and a group who plotted to destroy landmarks in New York. And in the 1980s, a Puerto Rican separatist was sent to prison on seditious conspiracy and other charges for a campaign of bombings.\n Garland and Monaco both have government experience confronting domestic terrorism.\n In 1995, Garland -- then a senior official at the Justice Department in Washington -- flew to Oklahoma City to supervise the aftermath of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, at the time the deadliest domestic terror attack in the country's history.\n Monaco, who has led the Justice Department's National Security Division, was only weeks into a position as then-President Barack Obama's chief adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism when two self-radicalized Boston brothers planted two bombs on the parade route of the city's marathon.\n The Boston bombing and other jihadi-inspired attacks were the most pressing concern for counterterrorism authorities at the time, but Monaco also played a leading role in some of the earliest instances of what would become a wave of White supremacist threats, like the 2015 massacre at one of the oldest Black churches in the country, Charleston's Mother Emanuel.",

        "title": "Prospects of convicting Trump erode as GOP grows vocal against Senate impeachment proceedings",
        "body_text": "The path in the Senate to convict Donald Trump is extremely slim, with a growing number of Republicans expressing confidence that the party will acquit the former President on a charge that he incited the deadly insurrection aimed at stopping President Joe Biden's electoral win.\n After Democratic leaders announced they would kick off the process to begin the impeachment trial on Monday, Republicans grew sharply critical about the proceedings -- and made clear that they saw virtually no chance that at least 17 Republicans would join with 50 Democrats to convict Trump and also bar him from ever running from office again.\n In interviews with more than a dozen GOP senators, the consensus was clear: Most Republicans are likely to acquit Trump, and only a handful are truly at risk of flipping to convict the former President -- unless more evidence emerges or the political dynamics within their party dramatically change. Yet Republicans are also signaling that as more time has passed since the riot, some of the emotions of the day have cooled and they're ready to move on.\n \"The chances of getting a conviction are virtually nil,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.\n \"I don't know what the vote will be but I think the chance of two-thirds is nil,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of his party's leadership who called the Democratic push to begin the trial \"vindictive.\"\n \"From listening to the dynamic -- and everything to this point -- it's going to be tough to get even a handful,\" said Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, referring to possible GOP defectors. \"I think so many are getting confused by the fact that we're doing this - and everybody has views that it's kind of a constitutional concern.\"\n The GOP arguments are now coming into sharper focus, claiming the proceedings are unconstitutional to try a former President and contending that the trial is moving on too short of a timeframe to give due process to Trump, claims that Democrats resoundingly reject. But those arguments, Republicans believe, will allow them a way out of convicting Trump without endorsing his conduct in the run up to the deadly mob that ransacked the Capitol on January 6. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is likely to land in the same spot as much of his conference, GOP senators believe, although the Republican leader has said he would listen to the arguments first before deciding how to vote.\n Politically, most Republicans are not eager to break ranks and draw the kind of attacks that came the way of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last week for the second time in his presidency, this time on a charge of inciting an insurrection.\n \"Many view it as a game of shirts and skins,\" said one GOP senator, referring to how many of his colleagues view the proceedings as a strictly partisan affair.\n For the Democrats, the calculation is also tricky. If they seek a longer trial -- even as long as the 21 days of Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020 -- with witnesses, they could satisfy some Republicans who are arguing that the trial must give adequate opportunity for Trump to make his case. Yet, doing so could eat away at the first full month of the Biden presidency, while a shorter trial would alienate some Republicans.\n \"I'm not for any witch hunts,\" said Cornyn, who noted he'd be less likely to convict if it were a short trial with no witnesses. \"This needs to be a fair and respectable process because whatever we do, it's not just about President Trump. This is about setting a new precedent and as you know, once we do things around here and there is a precedent for it, then that's the rule for the next time this happens.\"\n Among the most likely GOP defectors are Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. But Republican leaders who monitor their conference closely don't see much of a chance that the list will swell to 17 senators unless something dramatically changes or more is learned about Trump's role in stoking the violent mob.\n \"There's less than a handful of Republicans in play,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who is lobbying his colleagues to stick with Trump or risk \"destroying\" their party.\n And even some who had been viewed as possible swing votes are critical of Democrats for trying to start the trial immediately, rather than abiding by the timeline proposed by McConnell to push off the floor proceedings until later in February.\n \"It's very problematic, I would say, for the folks who are bringing this right now from a timing standpoint,\" said Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, who has been critical of Trump's conduct and also is up for reelection in 2022. \"I think it's going to be very important whether or not there's due process.\"\n Added Murkowski: \"I think what McConnell laid down was eminently reasonable, in terms of making sure that we got process. Got to have process and the process has to be fair.\"\n Collins, the Maine Republican who has been sharply critical of Trump's conduct, said that she is consulting with \"constitutional scholars\" about the proceedings. Asked about the GOP senators' assessment that Trump almost certainly won't get convicted, she said: \"That's not an unreasonable conclusion, but I just don't know.\"\n McConnell himself has privately viewed Trump's handling of the riots with disdain and has told people they amounted to at least an impeachable offense, while even saying the mob was \"provoked\" by the former President. But McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he is undecided -- and several Republicans told CNN this week that he could be at risk of losing his perch atop the Senate GOP conference if he votes to convict Trump.\n And in the last two days, McConnell has publicly made the case to give Trump's team more time to prepare. With much of the GOP conference now lining up against conviction, Republicans speculate that the GOP leader will likely vote to acquit as well.\n One of the key hurdles the House Democratic managers will have with Republicans is convincing them that a trial is constitutional, as a group of Senate Republicans have argued in recent days that a trial for an ex-president who is now a private citizen is unconstitutional. Such an argument could give Republicans a reason for voting to acquit Trump without addressing his conduct surrounding the insurrection at the Capitol earlier this month.\n \"I think it's obvious that the post-presidential impeachment has never occurred in the history of the country for a reason, that it's unconstitutional, that it sets a bad precedent for the presidency and it continues to divide the nation,\" Graham said Friday.\n It's a debate that enters into unprecedented territory, as the Senate has never held an impeachment trial for a President who has left office because such a scenario never arose. But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional. Legal analysts say there's precedent for a Senate impeachment trial of a former official, as the Senate tried Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 after he resigned just before the House voted to impeach him.\n \"It makes no sense whatsoever that a president \u2014 or any official \u2014 could commit a heinous crime against our country and then be permitted to resign so as to avoid accountability and a vote to disbar them from future office,\" Schumer said Friday.\n Republican defenders of Trump push back.\n Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who has generated blowback for joining with House Republicans to try to overturn Pennsylvania's election results, distanced himself from Trump's remarks at the January 6 rally where he urged his supporters to go to the Capitol that day, calling them \"inflammatory\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n But when asked how they should hold Trump accountable, Hawley said: \"Breaking the Constitution and using an unconstitutional process is not the way to do it.\"\n CNN's Ali Zaslav, Ali Main and Olanma Mang contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Greg Bardsley is the author of the novels \"Cash Out\" (2012) and \"The Bob Watson\" (2016) from HarperCollins Publishers. A former columnist and speechwriter, he lives in the San Francisco Bay area. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nAs a child, my dad was so small that people called him Minnow.\n His size often invited teasing, ridicule and bullying. One day in grade school, it culminated with an older (and much larger) bully challenging my dad to a fight in front of everyone after school.\n As my dad would tell me, his stomach was tied in knots for the rest of the day. He didn't want to fight, and he knew that if he did fight, he almost certainly would get beat up. Hounded by giddy classmates all day \u2014 \"Minnow, what are you gonna do?\" \u2014 my dad told them that he would show up for the fight. He knew that if he cowed, the bully would be emboldened and things for everyone would only get worse.\n Frothy excitement engulfed the school as news spread that Minnow would fight the bully. Finally, the school bell rang, and my dad walked to the specified location, followed by a throng of curious classmates. Fear gripped him.\n When my dad finally arrived, the bully wasn't there.\n My dad waited. And waited.\n The bully never showed.\n My dad said he learned an important lesson that day. For bullies, fear and intimidation is their oxygen. Fear and intimidation give them power. And while some bullies will fight, a great many more are relying on you to cower \u2014 it is the secret of their power.\n As things turned out, \"Mellow Minnow,\" as he was known, would later become a Golden Gloves boxer and would finish his career as one of the top flyweights in the United States. He said that during the Korean War, a few larger GIs made the mistake of trying to push him around.\n Most people who knew my dad would never have guessed this part of his history --\u2014 that the affable, kind, quiet and self-deprecating Iowa native with bifocals and a comb-over was once a fighter, and that he would stand up for himself, for others and for what was right, if needed.\n Ever since the Trump mob followed the call of their leader and descended on the Capitol on January 6, I have thought a lot about the parallels of my dad's story and the fears many of us have felt.\n Some members of Congress reportedly voted against electoral certification on January 6 because they were afraid for their physical safety. MAGA bullies threatened to descend on state capitals with more violence. They threatened to attack Washington, DC. They showed us their guns and hatred. Fear ensued, and some argued that this week's presidential inauguration should be moved indoors. Others suggested that we should \"go easy\" on the insurrectionists so as not to trigger more terror and violence.\n Instead, people decided to stand up to the bullies.\n In recent weeks, hundreds of domestic terrorists have been arrested. People across the political spectrum have stepped up and identified radicalized friends or family members who participated in the insurrection. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in impeaching our top bully, despite numerous death threats from the mob he egged on.\n Local and state Republicans have been recognized for refusing to be bullied into overturning election results in their communities. Even the losing vice president refused to leave the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, determined to execute his duty and protect our democracy even as the MAGA mob hunted for him in the Capitol, chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n More than 25,000 soldiers arrived in Washington DC, to face any bullies who might show up with their guns, swastikas, Confederate flags and bully clubs. And this week President Biden took the oath of office outdoors, right where the attempted coup had unfolded only fourteen days earlier. People faced their fears, and they ensured the orderly and democratic transfer of power.\n People stood up to the bullies, who never showed up. That includes our top bully, who chose to flee town.\n This week we are reminded that fear and intimidation are diminished when people come together and stand up to the bullies. We have learned that there are enough leaders (and citizens) who will not appease \u2014 because history tells us that appeasing fascists, thugs and bullies never works. People stood up for what was right, and the bullies lost a bit of their dark power.\n I wasn't planning on sharing the story of my late father. Then this weekend as I cleaned out our office closet, I found a photo of him and his American Legion boxing team \u2014 Minnow, the little guy who faced his fears and stood up to the bully, and in doing so found new power and light.",

We are committed to developing policies and strategies based on facts, on objective and rigorous analysis, and on our respect for constitutionally protected free speech and political activities,\" Psaki said Friday at the White House press briefing.\n She said the initial work will fall into three areas. First, she announced President Joe Biden tasked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to compile a \"comprehensive threat assessment, coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremism,\" adding that the analysis will come from across government and non-governmental agencies.\n She also said the administration will build the National Security Council's capability to focus on combating domestic extremism.\n \"As a part of this the NSC will undertake a policy review effort to determine how the government can share information better about this threat, support efforts to prevent radicalization, disrupt violent extremist networks and more,\" Psaki said.\n Finally, Psaki said the administration will be \"coordinating relevant parts of the federal government to enhance and accelerate efforts to address DVE.\"\n \"This considered NSC convened process will focus on addressing evolving threats, radicalization, the role of social media, opportunities to improve information sharing, operational responses and more,\" she said.\n In response to the announcement, the FBI Agents Association, which represents thousands of sworn bureau personnel, called Friday for federal domestic terrorism legislation.\n \"Congress should immediately pass legislation to make domestic terrorism a federal crime,\" a statement from the association read, adding that federal legislation is \"a necessary action that would help make it clear that political violence -- no matter the ideology or the person behind it -- is unacceptable. FBIAA looks forward to working with the Administration and Congress in the important effort to combat domestic terrorism.\"\n The FBI Agents Association has long been a vocal supporter of a domestic terrorism statute, which the organization believes would provide agents with greater tools to combat domestic threats.\n This story has been updated with a statement from the FBI Agents Association.\n CNN's Josh Campbell contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The face mask that could end the pandemic",
        "body_text": "Getting Americans masked up is a top priority for the Biden Administration.\n Biden, who calls wearing masks \"a patriotic act,\" signed an executive order Wednesday -- his very first as president -- to ask Americans to wear masks of their choice for the first 100 days of the new administration. The executive order also requires mask use on all federal property, though in this case, not just any old mask will do.\n On Wednesday after the inauguration, White House press secretary Jen Psaki showed off her bright white N95 mask in the press briefing room. \"I wore it out, of course, here today and will continue to do that,\" Psaki said after removing her medical-grade mask and before turning to questions.\n N95 masks are considered the gold standard in personal protective equipment because they block 95% of large and small particles utilizing a unique electrostatic filter.\n The filter works by trapping neutral particles like bacteria and viruses before they pass through the mask,  protecting the wearer and those around them. It's similar to how socks might get stuck to a blanket in the dryer. The N95 mask, which costs roughly $5, also fits securely to the face, eliminating most of the leakage that may occur with a loose-fitting cloth or paper mask.\n Studies have shown that masks significantly decrease the chances of transmitting or contracting the coronavirus. But not all masks provide equal protection. Depending on the fabric and number of layers, homemade and simple cloth masks have a range of effectiveness that can be as low as 26%, which leaves the wearer vulnerable.\n Some experts like Brigham Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School physician Dr. Abraar Karan have been advocating for public use of N95 masks from the start of the pandemic. In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Dr. Karan outlined why N95s are critical at this stage of the pandemic.\n \"If for four weeks the country essentially wore these masks in those risky settings like that indoors, what kind of difference do you think it would make?\" Gupta asked.\n \"This would stop the epidemic,\" Karan responded.\n The quality of protection a face mask can provide is crucial. A respiratory illness like the coronavirus is transmitted through aerosols, tiny particles that waft and hang in the air. Some virus-carrying particles are small enough to travel through or around lower-quality masks, making the wearer vulnerable to inhalation of viral particles.\n \"We know now that aerosols spread best when there is poor ventilation, crowding and close contact that's prolonged,\" Karan told Gupta in an interview. \"So we were arguing that actually in those settings, cloth masks alone are not going to block aerosols.\"\n Karan is not the only expert who has been vocal in support of better quality masks for the general public. Former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \"encouraging Americans to wear higher-quality masks is a simple step that might make a difference.\"\n The biggest problem is lack of supply. This week marked a full year of the coronavirus, and the Biden Administration has committed to invoking the Defense Production Act more often to boost manufacture of N95 masks and other critical supplies. Experts hope manufacturing will hit a speed to be able to sufficiently supply the population.\n \"An N95 that's well-fitted clearly is the best that you can do,\" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN Friday. \"You could get production of that at a much higher rate now.\"\n Karan believes N95 masks could be an essential asset in reopening the economy as the vaccine rollout remains sluggish and quarantine fatigue soars.\n \"If we have better personal protection for people, they can more safely go back to work. They can more safely re-engage, especially if testing and tracing is not where we need it to be,\" Karan said.\n \"This was going to be one way to get people back in and get the economy back up.\"\n Some European countries are already taking that step to prevent coronavirus spread within their borders. Earlier this week, Germany and France mandated that all citizens wear high filtration masks like the N95 in all public places.\n After months of treating coronavirus patients, Karan says it's time to invest in making sure masks people wear are even more effective. \"Focus on getting better masks to as many people as possible, focus on the messaging around masks, be consistent with your messaging, make masks part of American culture to stop the epidemic.\"\n The key here is to always wear a mask whenever you're in public. One study in Lancet Digital Health found that a 10% increase in mask-wearing could lead to a three-fold increase in the odds of maintaining control over virus transmission in a community. The ability to control the spread of the coronavirus is in our hands...and on our faces.",

At the time, he faced a deportation order after years of checking in with ICE.\n Chicas says he never expected to spend so long in sanctuary.\n \"I had no idea what I was getting into,\" he told CNN this week in a phone interview as he packed and prepared to leave. \"I thought it would be three or four months.\"\n But months turned into years.\n His family lives nearby in Raleigh and visited whenever they could. And from his confines on the grounds of St. John's Missionary Baptist Church, Chicas -- a pastor himself -- continued ministering to his flock via live Facebook videos and occasional in-person meetings.\n In his sermons, he often preached about the power of redemption. Using drugs and alcohol put him on a dangerous path, he says -- one that led to a conviction for DUI and domestic abuse and eventually a deportation order. Since 2002, Chicas says he's been a changed man.\n And he said this week that he's grateful the Biden administration's policies are giving him another chance. He's looking forward to spending more time with his family -- visiting parks and beaches and going out for ice cream.\n \"It's going to be a beautiful change,\" he said.\n A new Biden administration policy took effect on Friday, blocking most deportations for 100 days while officials review policies and ensure \"a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety,\" according to a Department of Homeland Security news release.\n It's not clear what will happen after that 100-day window ends, but Chicas says he's confident the new President \"has a different heart from the government that just left\" and will come up with a solution to help him and millions of other undocumented immigrants.\n It's not clear whether other immigrants who've taken sanctuary in churches are leaving. A growing number of undocumented immigrants sought protection in churches during the Trump as the government intensified its crackdowns on illegal immigration. An ICE policy limits the agency from arresting anyone in \"sensitive locations\" -- schools, hospitals or houses of worship -- except in extenuating circumstances.\n In 2018, around 50 people were living in sanctuary inside churches nationwide, according to Church World Service. Officials from the organization didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from CNN for updated data.\n Chicas said he spent many days in sanctuary feeling forgotten, isolated and full of anguish about the future.\n But there were brighter moments, too.\n \"I met so many people. ... I've come to realize that there are hundreds and hundreds of Americans that have a good heart and love immigrants,\" he said. \"I've seen it with my own eyes.\"\n CNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark nearly convinced then-President Donald Trump to remove then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and use the Department of Justice to undo Georgia's election results, The New York Times reported Friday.\n Clark -- who appealed to the former President's false claims of election fraud -- met with Trump earlier this month and told Rosen following the meeting that the then-President was going to replace him with Clark. Clark would then move to keep Congress from certifying the election results in then-President-elect Joe Biden's favor, according to the paper.\n Rosen demanded to hear the news straight from Trump, according to the paper, and arranged a meeting on the evening of January 3 -- the same day that Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state official to find enough votes for him to win Georgia, came to light.\n During the meeting, Rosen, another top Justice Department official and Clark gathered with Trump, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other lawyers. Trump had Rosen and Clark state their cases for him, the Times reported. The Times cited two officials who compared Rosen's and Clark's opposing arguments during the meeting to an episode of \"The Apprentice,\" Trump's old reality TV show.\n Citing four former Trump administration officials, the paper reported that an agreement among department leadership that they would all resign if Rosen were fired helped sway Trump from removing his acting attorney general. The notion of department pandemonium, congressional investigations and blowback from fellow Republicans seemed to resonate with Trump, who after nearly three hours decided to allow Rosen to stay and determined that Clark's plan would not work, according to the Times.\n CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. Clark told the Times that its report contained unspecified inaccuracies and that he could not speak to his conversations with Trump or department lawyers.\n \"Senior Justice Department lawyers, not uncommonly, provide legal advice to the White House as part of our duties,\" he told the paper. \"All my official communications were consistent with law.\"\n Trump declined to comment to the Times. One of his advisers told the paper that the former President had pushed for investigating \"rampant election fraud that has plagued our system for years\" and \"any assertion to the contrary is false and being driven by those who wish to keep the system broken.\"\n The Times reported that Trump had pressured Rosen from the onset of his role as acting attorney general to appoint special counsels to investigate baseless claims that the election's integrity had been widely compromised, and specifically to probe Dominion Voting Systems, which Trump falsely claimed had perpetuated widespread fraud.\n Rosen refused, telling Trump that such a move would be inconsistent with the department's lack of findings of voter fraud, the paper reported. Trump continued to press him, questioning why the department had not found evidence and accusing it of failing to advocate for him, while Rosen and Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue resisted. Unbeknown to them, a Pennsylvania politician had connected Trump with Clark, who told the then-President he agreed that fraud had tainted the election results, according to the Times.\n Clark, who had become the acting head of the civil division in September, was quickly embraced by Trump after their meeting, per the paper.",

        "body_text": "His predecessor tweeted insults and made menacing threats against America's allies but US President Joe Biden proved just as formidable for Canada with a stroke of pen.\n In his first few hours in office Wednesday, Biden made Canada the first foreign casualty of his campaign promises and revoked the construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have taken Canadian oil into the American market.\n Biden has said for months that as part of his climate agenda, he would cancel the project. But the decisive speed of his executive order gave Canada no right of reply.\n Even Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who backs the Keystone XL pipeline, tweeted that the executive order amounted to a slap in the face for Canada.\n \"This is a realpolitik moment, it's a reality check that America always looks after American interests and it's high time we do the same in Canada,\" said Goldy Hyder, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, in an interview with CNN.\n Biden's actions are an opening salvo for America's allies; a clear indication that although the new President is committed to restoring old relationships, a shrewd, calculated self-interest, rooted in the domestic political agenda, will define his foreign policy.\n Biden called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Friday in his first call to a foreign leader.\n A government source who was briefed on the call described it as \"warm and friendly\" and substantive. Both leaders agreed that fighting the pandemic will be their top priority.\n In private, both men repeated the comments they have made about the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline. Trudeau was said to have told Biden that he was disappointed and that it would cost jobs on both sides of the border.\n Biden said that he was making good on a campaign promise.\n \"We're relieved that tariffs are not being announced by tweets, but I think that outside of those things changing, the fact is American politics as such has not changed that much,\" said Hyder.\n During the phone call with Trudeau, Biden underscored his commitment to multilateralism.\n A readout of the call released by Trudeau's office Friday night reads, \"The leaders reiterated their firm commitment to multilateral institutions and alliances.\"\n The readout also stated that \"the Prime Minister and President agreed to consult closely to avoid measures that may constrain bilateral trade, supply chains, and economic growth.\"\n But earlier Friday, Trudeau was more plainspoken and realistic about Biden's approach, especially when it comes to trade.\n \"It's not always going to be perfect alignment with the United States, that's the case with any given president but in a situation where we are much more aligned on values, on focus, on work that needs to be done to give opportunities for everyone while we build a better future, I'm very much looking forward to working with President Biden,\" said Trudeau during a press conference Friday.\n But those \"values\" will be tested again next week as the Biden administration outlines its priorities for a \"Buy American\" approach to the economy, an approach that some in Canada believe will lead to more trade protectionism.\n \"Buy American is going to be the next big test,\" said Hyder, adding that it will pose a challenge for Canada as well as other allies.\n \"What's good for America is strong trading relationships, energy security, reliable partners and allies that can be there for you, right? That's what we need to make the case for,\" Hyder said.\n But making that case in the hyperpartisan atmosphere of Washington will be more complicated as the US tries to recover from a debilitating pandemic.\n Before and after getting elected, Biden promised to tighten \"Buy American\" rules. This is another campaign promise that could yet again sideswipe Canada and swing at other allies too.\n Biden has proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in spending for things like infrastructure projects that would be fulfilled using principally American raw materials and products.\n The \"Buy American\" campaign could yet receive the legislative backing its needs to make it enforceable. That, in turn, could make it indistinguishable from an \"America First\" doctrine.\n European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed Biden's inauguration Wednesday by declaring in a speech that \"after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House.\"\n But at a press briefing this week, European Council President Charles Michel seemed to take a more pragmatic approach.\n \"We have our differences and they will not magically disappear. America seems to have changed, and how it's perceived in Europe and the rest of the world has also changed,\" Michel said, adding that Europe would defend its interests.\n Canada will likely be the first ally to strenuously defend its interests, no matter how warm the relationship between Trudeau and Biden.",

        "title": "Miscommunication and confusion led to National Guard troops being pushed out of Capitol",
        "body_text": "A series of miscommunications around an unprecedented security situation left National Guard troops searching for an adequate rest area Thursday night when they were moved from the Capitol into a nearby parking garage.\n Guard members ended up having to spend several hours Thursday night resting on the concrete in the parking garage before the mistake was fixed and they were moved back to the Capitol.\n The exact chain of events that led to the Guard members moving to the garage is unclear, and by Friday afternoon a series of conflicting explanations and finger pointing only added to the confusion about why the troops were given the impression they were no longer welcome in the Capitol even as their job of protecting it is ongoing.\n The resulting confusion and finger-pointing was impressive even for Washington. The National Guard was quick to blame Capitol Police as the authority that directed their troops to vacate the premises Thursday night, but Capitol Police immediately and forcefully denied any involvement. By Friday afternoon, the two units had put out a joint statement seeking to resolve the conflict, but that missive still left unanswered the question of who gave the initial order to move.\n According to one source with the Administrative Office of the Courts, an agency that occupies the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary building where the garage is located, it was the National Guard that decided to use the parking garage after being shown the facility on January 19.\n According to a source in the Senate Rules Committee, plans were made to move the resting locations for Guard troops out of the Capitol during the heightened security days around the Inauguration. The committee set up alternative accommodations for the troops to move into office buildings during that time frame with the expectation that they would be able to return on Thursday.\n But a breakdown of communication appears to have occurred during discussions of how to recreate designated spaces for troops on Capitol grounds.\n Several sources on the Senate Rules Committee confirmed the committee held a staff call on Thursday evening to discuss future plans for the troops. According to the Rules Committee aide, the goal was for the troops to be accommodated in the Capitol Visitor's Center instead of Senate space in the Capitol Complex so that those offices could be used for Senate business starting Monday.\n Even though relocation was being discussed, an aide on the Rules Committee told CNN there was never a request issued to completely remove the troops from the complex.\n \"The Rules Committee has always understood that there would be National Guard troops located in the Senate Office Buildings until the end of their mission,\" the aide said.\n Still, the National Guard maintains they were instructed to leave by the USCP.\n \"The National Guard continues to assist and support the US Capitol Police. As Congress is in session and increased foot traffic and business is being conducted, Capitol Police asked the troops to move their rest area,\" to the Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center garage, the National Guard Bureau said in their initial statement around 7 p.m. ET Thursday.\n On Friday the National Guard released another statement to say that all troops have returned to using Capitol buildings for their break areas and that they had been informed that the initial request for them to relocate \"was made without the knowledge of the Congressional members.\"\n Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee James Inhofe claimed that a single officer made the call without checking with his superior on the Senate floor Friday.\n \"This is what happened. There was one uniformed police officer who issued an order, without authority or without going through the chain of command\" Inhofe said. \"We are going to be able to identify who that person was, we'll make that publicly.\"\n Inhofe, who said he has spoken to acting Chief of Capitol Police Yogananda Pittman and Chief of Staff of the Army James McConville about the situation added \"this isn't a blame game. But I do want to know what happened to make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n Statements from the National Guard, Capitol Police and the Sergeants at Arms in both the House and Senate have all denied that they were the ones that gave the order.\n \"I want to assure everyone that, with the exception of specific times on Inauguration Day itself while the swearing-in ceremonies were underway, the United States Capitol Police did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities\" Pittman said in a statement.\n A House aide familiar with Capitol Police also refuted the accusation that the guidance to move troops out of the Capitol came from a Capitol Police officer, saying, \"Obviously we're reviewing that but there was no directive given to the National Guard to move, they did that on their own volition.\"\n This aide instead suggested that the National Guard misinterpreted an offer from a judicial office building for more space as an order to vacate from Capitol Grounds. The aide told CNN that an individual from a judicial office building where the National Guard ended up, known as the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building, offered use of their facilities as extra space to the National Guard that the source says the National Guard misinterpreted as an order to vacate Capitol grounds and relocate.\n \"That's what my understanding of what happened, is that somebody reached out directly to the National Guard, probably should have gone to the Capitol Police or the architect of the Capitol to do that, and then the National Guard moved,\" the source told CNN. \"What our understanding is this guy tried to be helpful, and offer up some space and, and somehow that was misconstrued as an order to leave.\"\n As lawmakers demand answers around who ordered the National Guard troops to be moved late Thursday, discussions are also underway about how to prevent similar problems from arising going forward, a source familiar with those talks told CNN.\n In the days immediately following the January 6 attack, there was a scramble to find hotel rooms for the influx of National Guard members pouring into Washington. A state official acknowledged at the time that \"suddenly finding hotel rooms for 6,000+ guard members in the middle of a pandemic is a monumental task\" but that DC quickly provided lodging.\n While every National Guard member currently in Washington has a hotel room and a bed to sleep in, that does not minimize the issue that arose last night, the source said.\n One issue currently being discussed is the fact that Guard members are currently working on 12-hour shifts with short rest periods in between. This means that it does not make sense for them to drive back to their hotel rooms, the source said, noting that lawmakers are currently discussing the possibility of shortening those rotations to eight-hour shifts in order to allow the Guard members more time to return to their hotels.\n CNN's Oren Liebermann and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

He said he didn't read most of the mail but kept some as a reminder.\n \"There were times during the chase when I was so angry and tired and sick of it all that I wished I could get on a plane and not get off until I was someplace where they never heard of Babe Ruth,\" he wrote in his \"I Had a Hammer\" autobiography.\n \"But damn it all, I had to break that record. I had to do it for Jackie (Robinson) and my people and myself and for everybody who ever called me a (N-word).\"\n Legendary baseball announcer Vin Scully acknowledged the importance of what Aaron did during his play-by-play of the game for the Dodgers, calling it a \"marvelous moment for baseball ... the country and the world.\"\n \"A Black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol, and it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron,\" Scully said as Aaron was mobbed by his teammates and family at home plate.\n A native of Mobile, Alabama, Aaron grew up in the 1930s and '40s deep in the heart of the segregated South -- an African-American man without access to organized baseball teams, fields or equipment.\n Former UN Ambassador Andrew Young, who has been friends with Aaron since 1965, said the hate and threats throughout the slugger's life \"rolled off his back like water off a duck's back.\"\n \"It says a lot about the way his mother and father raised him,\" Young told CNN Friday. \"He was a child of the South, he was a child of racism, but he never let it bother him publicly. He never let it slow him down or change his focus in life.\"\n Aaron joined Young and other African American leaders at Atlanta's Morehouse School of Medicine earlier this month to receive the coronavirus vaccine. The event was part of a campaign to encourage confidence in the vaccine in communities that have struggled with America's history of racism in medical research.\n Reaction to Aaron's death and remembrances poured out on Friday from the world of sports and politics.\n \"Hank Aaron was one of the best baseball players we've ever seen and one of the strongest people I've ever met,\" former President Barack Obama said on Twitter.  \"Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Aaron family and everyone who was inspired by this unassuming man and his towering example,\" he said.\n \"The former Home Run King wasn't handed his throne,\" former President George W. Bush said in a statement.\n \"He grew up poor and faced racism as he worked to become one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Hank never let the hatred he faced consume him. Henry Louis Aaron was a joyful man, a loving husband to Billye, and a proud father.\"\n Former President Jimmy Carter said the death of their \"dear friend\" saddened him and his wife, Rosalynn.\n \"One of the greatest baseball players of all time, he has been a personal hero to us,\" Carter said. \"A breaker of records and racial barriers, his remarkable legacy will continue to inspire countless athletes and admirers for generations to come.\"\n Aaron's friend and former Braves teammate, Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker, said Aaron had been the most important influence on his life, next to his father.\n \"He was the best person that I ever knew, and the truest, most honest person that I ever knew. He taught me how to be a man and how to be a proud African-American,\" Baker said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n \"He taught me how important it was to give back to the community, and he inspired me to become an entrepreneur. Hank impacted my life, my family and my world, both on and off the field. He was a great man,\" he said.\n Scully tweeted that Aaron \"meant so much more to baseball and the country than just being one of the game's top home run hitters. He truly was a very special man.\"\n The Chicago Cubs tweeted: \"A baseball legend who transcended the sport.\"\n Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement that \"Mr. Aaron was part of the fabric that helped place Atlanta on the world stage.\"\n Bottoms told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Atlanta residents' hearts were broken.\n \"Hank Aaron, for as big as he was on the world stage, this was our hometown hero,\" she said.\n Bottoms said she saw Aaron with his wife the day she took her mother to get her vaccine at Morehouse.\n \"They are out and about in our community. Huge philanthropic presence in our community and just salt of the earth people,\" Bottom said.\n \"Rest in Peace to American hero, icon, and Hall of Famer Hank Aaron,\" basketball legend Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson tweeted.\n \"We will miss you,\" Bernice King, the youngest child of civil rights icon the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote. \"Your leadership. Your grace. Your generosity. Your love. Thank you, #HankAaron.\"\n Aaron's Alabama childhood was marked by an obsession with baseball. He was kicked out of high school when he cut too many classes to listen to Brooklyn Dodgers games on a pool hall radio.\n When Aaron's hero Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to integrate Major League Baseball, came to Mobile in 1948, Aaron cut class to hear the Dodger speak at a drugstore. Later that day, he told his father that's what he wanted to do with his life.\n Robinson, Aaron wrote in his autobiography, \"gave us our dreams.\"\n \"When I was growing up in Mobile, Alabama on a little dirt street, I remember my mother about 6 or 7 o'clock in the afternoon,\" Aaron told CNN in 2014. \"You could hardly see and I'd be trying to throw a baseball and she'd say, 'Come here, come here!' And I'd say, 'For what?' She said, 'Get under the bed.'\"\n His family would hide under the bed when \"the KKK would march by, burn a cross and go on about their business and then she (my mother) would say, 'You can come out now.' Can you imagine what this would do to the average person? Here I am, a little boy, not doing anything, just catching a baseball with a friend of mine and my mother telling me, 'Go under the bed.'\"\n After leaving high school, Aaron played for the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League.\n Years later, with a Class A team based in Jacksonville, Florida, Aaron wrote that the mayor advised him that he should \"suffer quietly\" when he heard racist shouts from fans.\n Fans hurled rocks. They mocked the black players by wearing mops on their heads, and throwing black cats onto the field. The FBI investigated death threats. The players knew to ignore the hate, but \"we couldn't help but feel the weight of what we were doing,\" Aaron wrote in his autobiography.\n That hate only intensified when he chased the home run record of the venerable Sultan of Swat, as Ruth was known. Hate mail poured into the Braves stadium. The FBI also investigated several death threats and kidnapping plots against Aaron's children. An armed guard started accompanying Aaron.\n \"I've always felt like once I put the uniform on and once I got out onto the playing field, I could separate the two from say an evil letter I got the day before or an event 20 minutes before,\" Aaron told CNN. \"God gave me the separation, gave me the ability to separate the two of them.\"\n Aaron shone brightly on the baseball diamond. He had 3,771 hits over 23 big league seasons, a milestone he would have still achieved without any home runs, according to the Braves. On May 17, 1970, Aaron became the first player in history in the 3,000-hit, 500-home run club.\n The 1957 National League MVP led Milwaukee to a World Series victory that year. He was an All-Star a record 25 times.\n He was one of baseball's most consistent hitters with a .305 career batting average. He batted .300 mark 14 times, hit 30 home runs in a season 15 times, and drove in 90 runs 16 times. He also won three Gold Glove Awards playing primarily in right field.\n Aaron held baseball's career home run record until he was passed in 2007 by Barry Bonds, whose feat was tarnished by a steroid scandal. Bonds finished his career with 762 homers.\n Aaron remains baseball's all-time leader in RBI's with 2,297 and total bases with 6,856. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, his first year eligible.\n In 1999, MLB created the Hank Aaron Award, given every year to the best hitter in both the American and National Leagues.\n Aaron worked in the Braves front office since retiring from his playing career in 1976 -- most recently as a senior vice president, according to the Braves. He founded the Chasing the Dream Foundation, a charity for children, in 1995. He served on the board of the NAACP and was a benefactor of the Morehouse School of Medicine.\n \"A little bit of Hank Aaron rubs off on you when you get to meet him,\" Young said. \"His personality was always calm and cool and deliberate.\"\n Besides his wife, Billye, Aaron is survived by his five children, Gaile, Hank Jr., Lary, Dorinda and Ceci, according to the Braves organization.\n CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis and Skylar Mitchell contributed.",

        "title": "Hank Aaron rose to the top of baseball while facing pervasive racism. He leaves behind a powerful legacy",
        "body_text": "Baseball legend Hank Aaron is remembered today as one of the greatest to ever play the game. Crucial to his legacy is that unlike his White counterparts, he pulled off his most significant achievements while enduring pervasive racism.\n Throughout his career, Aaron experienced hate and vitriol on and off the field for the simple fact that he was an African American.\n Aaron dominated baseball at a time when part of the nation still upheld Jim Crow, a system of racial apartheid in the American South. Even after legal segregation ended, baseball fans engaged in ugly and vile tactics to remind him of what they considered to be his place in the nation's racial hierarchy.\n \"The same way Jackie Robinson had to go through hell to become a Major League Baseball player, Hank Aaron had to go through hell after doing one of the greatest things in the history of sports,\" said Peter Golenbock, author of the biography \"Hank Aaron: Brave in Every Way,\" in an interview with CNN.\n In spite of all those obstacles, Aaron persevered -- breaking the career home run record previously set by Babe Ruth and other records that he still holds to this day. He passed away on Friday at the age of 86.\n Here's a look at the racial barriers Aaron broke, and the legacy he leaves behind.\n Aaron was born in 1934 and grew up in and around Mobile, Alabama.\n Civil rights leader Andrew Young, who said he and Aaron shared a close friendship since 1965, told CNN that the racism Aaron experienced began in childhood.\n Aaron's mother would summon him from the baseball field to come home and hide under the bed because the Ku Klux Klan was riding through the neighborhood, Young said. But he was never deterred, going right back outside to finish playing when the Klan left.\n Inspired by his idol Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play Major League Baseball in the modern era, Aaron completed brief stints in the Negro American League and the minor leagues before making his way to Major League Baseball.\n During his time in the minor leagues, Aaron was met with racism both inside and outside the stadium. In Jacksonville, Florida, fans threw rocks, wore mops on their heads to mock Black players and threw black cats onto the field.\n When the team traveled around the South, Aaron would often find himself separated from his White teammates, left to make his own food and lodging accommodations.\n But Aaron pressed on, and his success ultimately landed him in his first major league game with the Milwaukee Braves in 1954. Over the next two decades, he would cement his status as a baseball icon. He was named MVP, received several Gold Glove awards, broke numerous records and led the Braves to win the World Series in 1957.\n As Aaron began to close in on Babe Ruth's career home run record in the early 1970s, the racists came out in full force. White baseball fans responded to the prospect of Aaron overtaking Ruth's record with letters containing racial slurs, hateful comments and even death threats.\n \"Everybody loved Babe Ruth,\" one of the letters read. \"You will be the most hated man in this country if you break his career home run record.\"\n \"How about some sickle cell anemia, Hank?\" read another.\n That Aaron would dare to surpass the record set by Ruth, who was White, rankled many White fans of the game. In 1973, Aaron received more than 930,000 pieces of mail -- the most by anyone excluding the country's politicians, Lew Freedman wrote in the book \"African American Pioneers of Baseball: A Biographical Encyclopedia.\"\n Though some of the mail was positive, the threats Aaron received were so serious that the FBI launched an investigation into them.\n \"In some of the letters, these people described how they would kill him,\" the late Pellom McDaniels III, curator of African American collections at Emory University's library, said in a 2014 news release. \"I thought it was audacious; some people signed their names and provided return addresses, as if it were acceptable to say these hateful things without fear of any repercussions.\"\n The racism and death threats \"rolled off his back like water off a duck's back,\" Young said.\n \"It says a lot about the way his mother and father raised him,\" Young, who visited Aaron's family in Atlanta on Friday morning, told CNN. \"He was a child of the South, he was a child of racism, but he never let it bother him publicly. He never let it slow him down or change his focus in life.\"\n Instead, the hate that came his way only motivated Aaron to work harder toward his goal.\n \"I kept feeling more and more strongly that I had to break the record not only for myself and for Jackie Robinson and for black people,\" Aaron wrote in his autobiography. \"But also to strike back at the vicious little people who wanted to keep me from doing it. All that hatred left a deep scar on me.\"\n On April 8, 1974, Aaron hit his 715th home run at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium -- finally breaking the career record held by Ruth. It was a historic moment for Atlanta, for baseball and for American history.\n Aaron ended his legendary playing career in 1976 with a total of 755 home runs.\n \"Retiring as the last Major League player to have played in the Negro Leagues, Aaron's career can be seen as a symbolic bridge from the dark days of segregation to an era of greater opportunity,\" National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial said in a statement.\n Aaron continued to speak out against racism in the sport after retirement, remaining engaged in community advocacy and the fight for civil rights.\n \"Maybe the day will come when I can sit back and be content with the changes that have taken place in America, or, at least in my part of it, which is baseball,\" he mused at one point.\n Aaron served on the NAACP board and also founded the Chasing the Dream Foundation, which funded programs that helped underserved youth develop their talents and pursue their dreams.\n In 2002, Aaron was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his humanitarian efforts. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund presented him with the Thurgood Marshall Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and established the Hank Aaron Humanitarian in Sports Award in his honor.\n In his final days, Aaron received the Covid-19 vaccine as part of a campaign to encourage other African Americans to be immunized.\n NAACP President Derrick Johnson said Aaron will be remembered for overcoming racial barriers, not only in baseball but also the civil rights movement.\n \"I would hope athletes from all sports will look at his legacy as an example of how to use their platforms for social good and to advance the causes of civil rights,\" Johnson said.\n \"He's an example of how to overcome adversity, but he is also an example of the many people who are confronted with barriers today that shouldn't be there.\"\n The news of Aaron's death reverberated across generations of baseball fans, many of whom gathered at his statue at Atlanta's former Turner Field to pay their respects.\n One of those people was Norris Herring, who described himself as a big sports fan. He told CNN that he grew up admiring Aaron's contributions to baseball and considered him a hero.\n \"My father talked about him a lot,\" Herring said. \"Growing up in that time of the civil rights movement, my father and my grandparents would talk about certain heroes they just looked up to and admired. It brought that same type of admiration to me as well.\"\n Danny Welch, who grew up in New York, described Aaron as \"so much bigger than one of the greatest baseball players of all time.\"\n \"Hank Aaron represents a higher type of individual, someone I would always aspire to be both on and off the field,\" Welch told CNN while getting emotional.\n \"I think that's why this is such an emotional day for me and for Americans and for all people around the world who know of Hank Aaron and what he represents.\"\n CNN's Austin Steele and Jen Christensen contributed to this report.",

        "title": "CDC reports record number of daily Covid-19 vaccinations as states struggle with supply",
        "body_text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported its biggest one-day increase in Covid-19 vaccinations Friday as more states said they are struggling with vaccine supply.\n The CDC said Friday that nearly 1.6 million more doses of the vaccines have been administered, bringing the total of doses given to more than 19 million.\n And 1 million new shots were reported in the previous 24-hour period, according to changes in CDC data from Wednesday morning to Thursday morning. That was only the second time a one-day increase rose above 1 million. The number of administered doses reported this week also was 22% higher than last week.\n While vaccinations are taking off, more states are complaining that they don't have enough vaccine. New York will run out of Covid-19 vaccine doses Friday after using 97% of the first doses it received, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\n In Louisiana, there's no need to set up a mass vaccination site because the state doesn't have enough vaccine doses to make it worthwhile, said Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n People in Louisiana are \"anxiously awaiting increasing allocations\" of vaccine, Edwards said Friday. \"We're gearing up now to prepare for those increasing allocations, so that while we're not doing mass vaccination events currently, we are planning and preparing for those,\" he said.\n New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state doesn't need more distribution locations either but needs more doses of the vaccines.\n \"I cannot be any more clearer. We have built the infrastructure that can handle this job. We need the doses,\" Murphy said Friday.\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the White House has asked the CDC to look into the possibility that states might run out of their allocated doses.\n \"We've asked the CDC, to look into exactly this issue, and see what can be done,\" Psaki said at Friday's White House briefing.\n After conversations with the vaccine makers on a \"very regular basis,\" President Joe Biden's coronavirus advisers are confident the supply will increase in the near future, said Dr. Vivek Murthy, Biden's nominee for surgeon general.\n \"Those conversations, I think, have given us more confidence that there is more supply coming, and that it will continue to steadily increase over the next few months,\" Murthy said Friday on a webcast sponsored by the US Conference of Mayors.\n The 19 million doses administered to people represent about 48% of the 39.8 million doses that have been distributed, according to the CDC.\n About 5% of the US population -- roughly 16.2 million people -- has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 2.75 million people are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data updated Friday morning.\n States have 72 hours to report vaccine data, so data published by the CDC may be delayed -- and may not necessarily mean all doses were given on the day reported.\n Officials hope new coronavirus vaccines will be approved and help with supply.\n Currently, the US has two approved vaccines, by Pfizer and Moderna.\n Johnson & Johnson's vaccine candidate is \"right around the corner\" from seeking emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration said Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, on Thursday.\n \"They're probably a couple of weeks away from getting the data looked at, to have the FDA evaluate whether or not we're in a situation where we could move ahead and start thinking about getting it out into the public,\" Fauci said.\n The company, assuming it receives FDA approval, plans to have \"enough vaccines for 100 million Americans by spring,\" board member Dr. Mark McClellan told CNBC on Thursday.\n That candidate would come with advantages, including that it would be a single shot, and that it doesn't require storage at extremely low temperatures, he said.\n As for another candidate in Phase 3 trials, from AstraZeneca, that is \"a bit behind, but not too far behind,\" Fauci said.\n Last week, the federal government's Operation Warp Speed program's chief adviser said he hoped the AstraZeneca candidate, if data shows it to be effective, could receive US authorization by the end of March.\n \"Hopefully the vaccine again is efficacious, as has been shown in the trials conducted in Brazil and in the UK,\" said Operation Warp Speed chief science adviser Moncef Slaoui. \"So maybe an approval somewhere towards the latter part of the month of March, and a significant number of doses available around that time.\"\n The AstraZeneca vaccine is already in use in some places, including the UK and Brazil.\n Despite challenges with distributing and administering Covid-19 vaccines, the US \"can and should\" vaccinate 70-85% of adults by the end of summer, Fauci said.\n That could bring a semblance of normalcy by the fall, according to Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n \"When you put ... the pedal to the floor, you can get it done,\" Fauci told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday night.\n If the US were to administer 1 million shots per day -- the pace required to meet President Joe Biden's goal of giving 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office -- it would take until the end of 2021 to fully vaccinate 75% of US adults, assuming every recipient needs two shots, according to a CNN analysis.\n But that time frame would shrink if some people received one-dose vaccines, such as Johnson & Johnson's candidate.\n And Fauci said Friday he believes the US can go faster than 1 million shots per day.\n \"If we can do better than that, which I personally think we likely will, then great.\"\n Fauci's assessment offers a glimmer of hope as the country has reported an average of 3,050 Covid-19 deaths a day over the last week. Forecasts predict the nation's death toll will likely top 500,000 within the next month.\n The US has averaged about 187,590 new cases a day over the last week -- down nearly 25% from the all-time peak average reached just 11 days ago, but still 2.8 times higher than the summer's peak in July, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n The CDC recently warned that new, more contagious virus variants -- like the one first identified in the UK -- could still accelerate the spread of the virus.\n Fauci said Friday that a more transmissible variant isn't yet dominant in the United States, and he's \"not exactly sure\" that it will drive a surge in cases, but it has to be watched carefully.\n \"The best thing you can do about that is to continue to uniformly adhere to the public health recommendations that we've spoken about time and again -- from the wearing of masks to the washing of hands to avoiding congregate settings,\" Fauci said. \"That's the kind of thing that prevents surges regardless of what the type of virus ... is there.\"\n In Georgia, officials are seeing high numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and the 120,000 doses allotted per week to the state is not enough to vaccinate seniors and other high-risk residents, Gov. Brian Kemp said.\n \"We will still have far more demand than we have supply,\" Kemp said.\n Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she receives calls daily from people \"desperately looking for the vaccine.\"\n The Atlanta metropolitan area \"didn't get as much of the vaccine at the beginning of the distribution as I had hoped that we would receive,\" Lance Bottoms told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"A lot of it went to other places throughout the state.\"\n Constraints on supply in New York City means there are not enough doses to vaccinate members of the city's police and fire departments, the agencies told CNN on Thursday. There are still enough for those who already have appointments made and those who had already received their first dose, the fire department said.\n Lines at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Thursday were filled largely with people over 65 years old, with some waiting for five hours for the vaccine, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.\n \"There may be a wait ... so use the restroom beforehand, bring water and snacks, and make sure your gas tank is filled up or your car is charged,\" he said.\n Murthy, Biden's pick for surgeon general, said the US needs to do more to speed up the vaccinations.\n \"We cannot take a year in order to get to the critical levels of vaccination that we need in this country,\" Murthy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. \"We've got to get there sooner.\"\n Even with reports of many people waiting in line, about 6 in 10 Americans don't know when or where to get a coronavirus vaccine, according to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n Most Americans don't know when or where they can get a vaccine, including older Americans, who are already eligible to get a vaccine in a growing number of states,\" foundation President and CEO Drew Altman said in a news release Friday. \"Understandably large numbers of people are frustrated, angry and confused.\"\n The Biden administration will \"try to build ...  (a) national clearinghouse\" that provides information on where people can get shots, said White House chief of staff Ron Klain on Thursday night.\n \"It needs to be earlier and more transparent for people to figure out how to get their shot and where to get their shot,\" Klain told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell.\n CNN's Lindsay Benson, Maria Cartaya, Andrea Diaz, Jacqueline Howard, Lauren Mascarenhas, Deidre McPhillips, Alexandra Meeks, Michael Nedelman, Evan Simko-Bednarski and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A fire that broke out at a facility of the world's biggest vaccine maker that killed five people would not affect vaccine production, the head of the company said Thursday.\n The blaze at the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the western city of Pune was brought under control on Thursday though the cause is still under investigation, according to Murlidhar Mohol, the city's mayor.\n Four people were rescued from the six-floor building but five others died, Mohol said. They are believed to have been construction workers as the building was still under construction at the time of the fire.\n Videos and images showed black smoke billowing out of the building at the company's complex. Fifteen units of the municipal corporation and fire department worked to douse the fire, Mohol said.\n Preliminary investigations suggest that \"during the building's construction, some welding work could have led to the fire,\" he added.\n Pune's fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise said Friday that the fire started on the second floor. As firefighters worked to put out the flames, the blaze reigned in another spot. The second fire was extinguished at 4:15 p.m. local time by 50 firefighters and personnel. Ranpise said they are still investigating the cause of the fire.\n \"We have learnt that there has unfortunately been some loss of life at the incident. We are deeply saddened and offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the departed,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted Thursday.\n SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, is in partnership with Oxford University and AstraZeneca to produce the Covishield vaccine. In December, the company said it was producing 50 to 60 million doses of Covishield per month, with production to be scaled up to 100 million doses in January or February.\n A family business started by Poonawalla's father 50 years ago to bring cheaper vaccines to the masses, the Serum Institute of India is aiming to produce hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccines for not only India, but also other developing countries.\n In a tweet, Poonawalla said that despite a \"few floors being destroyed,\" production of the Covishield vaccine would not be affected.\n \"I would like to reassure all governments and the public that there would be no loss of COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies,\" he said.\n Cyrus S. Poonawalla, SII's chairman and managing director, said in a statement that the fire broke out at a facility that was under constriction in the Special Economic Zone at Manjri. He said it was an \"extremely sorrowful day\" and the company would offer INR 2.5 million ($34,000) to each of the victims' families.\n Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences Thursday: \"Anguished by the loss of lives due to an unfortunate fire ... In this sad hour, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. I pray that those injured recover at the earliest.\"",

        "title": "Staggering number of wild bee species unaccounted for since the '90s",
        "body_text": "There has been an overwhelming drop in the number of wild bee species that are reported in public records over the past 30 years, according to a new study.\n Researchers looked at bee records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, an online biodiversity data collector, and found there were about 25% less bee species reported between 2006 and 2015 compared to the 1990s.\n Study author Eduardo Enrique Zattara, adjunct researcher at Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council, realized in 2018 that he could track the global population of bee species using the online data to see long-term trends of bee populations.\n His research team began searching for possible explanations as to why so many bees are missing.\n Zattara first looked at reasons the data could be artificially low, meaning that the data might not accurately reflect the number of bee species.\n One hypothesis is that less people are reporting on bee species, which means there would be less data inputted into the system. Bee trackers might also be reporting only well-known bee species as rarer ones become harder to find or identify.\n \"We analyzed several of these alternative reasons, but could not find any that on its own could explain such a large drop in the number of reported species,\" Zattara said.\n With a decline in plants and animal populations on the planet, including the honeybee, a decline in bee diversity is the most likely culprit for the drop in reported species numbers, he said.\n Loss of habitat and climate crisis could be playing a role in the declining numbers, said Kirsten Shoshanna Traynor, research associate at the Global Biosocial Complexity Initiative at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the study. As more land is urbanized, bee habitats are destroyed, which kills the next generation of bees.\n The climate crisis may be forcing bees out of their native climate zones and exposing them to dangerous weather events, Zattara said.\n He also said invasive bee species could be to blame. When foreign bees are introduced to a particular area, they can kill off the native bees.\n Looking forward, he wants to study a case in which a foreign bee was introduced in Patagonia so he can research how to reverse the damage.\n Wild bees are responsible for the pollination of 85% of the world's crops, according to the study, which was published Friday in the One Earth journal.\n Many of the foods people enjoy, such as avocados and nuts, rely on pollination, Traynor said.\n Plants have a difficult time moving the pollen, which is the male part of the plant, to the female part, so the plant can be fertilized and reproduce. Traynor calls bees \"plant sex on wings\" because they are great at pollinating plants.\n If there is a decline in wild bee populations, it will be significantly harder for plants to reproduce.\n \"As bees disappear, so do the animals that depend on them and the plants they pollinate,\" Traynor said.",

        "title": "Incoming CEO wants Intel to again be the 'unquestioned leader' in industry",
        "body_text": "Intel investors and analysts got their first glimpse at incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger's vision for the company during its earnings call on Thursday.\n Gelsinger, who starts his job on February 15, has a challenging task ahead: Intel has fallen behind competitors in manufacturing the most advanced chips, putting it at risk of losing share in key markets. But Gelsinger told analysts that Intel is not \"interested in just closing gaps\" with its rivals.\n \"We're interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology, and that's our commitment,\" Gelsinger said. He joined the earnings call along with outgoing CEO Bob Swan, though he doesn't actually take over the role for three more weeks.\n Still, it appears that investors are wary. The company's stock fell nearly 10% on Friday, although it posted better-than-expected earnings Thursday.\n The semiconductor giant reported fourth quarter earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $20 billion, beating the $1.10 in earnings per share on revenue of $17.5 billion Wall Street analysts had projected. Full year revenue hit a record $77.9 billion, up 8% from 2019. Intel also announced it would boost its quarterly dividend.\n Intel (INTC) shares initially rose Thursday after the report was released several minutes ahead of the closing bell, ending the day up 6.5%. But the company said later that evening that it had released the results early, just before the close, because of reports of unauthorized access to its earnings information, a breach the company is investigating. Shares fell in premarket trading following the news of the breach.\n Investors on Friday may also have been reacting to the plans executives discussed during the Thursday earnings call for getting the company back on track.\n A major concern for Intel has been its next generation 7-nanometer chip \u2014 the company said in July that the technology would be delayed by about six months, to late 2022 or early 2023. Meanwhile, competitors Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) have already produced 7-nanometer chips and are moving on to even more advanced technology, threatening to put Intel even further behind and helping rivals such as AMD (AMD) steal market share.\n Last month, activist shareholder Dan Loeb of Third Point wrote to Intel's board chair urging the company to consider major changes, including whether to continue manufacturing its own chips. The alternative would be outsourcing production to third-party foundries, such as TSMC's, as many of Intel's competitors do.\n Gelsinger and Swan suggested during the call that Intel is likely to keep production in-house for the 7-nanometer chip, though the company pledged to provide more details on its manufacturing plans after Gelsinger takes over.\n \"I've had the opportunity to personally examine progress on Intel's 7-nanometer technology over the last week,\" Gelsinger said during the call. \"Based on initial reviews, I am pleased with the progress made on the health and recovery of the 7-nanometer program. I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally.\"\n Gelsinger added, however, that because of the breadth of Intel's portfolio, the company will likely \"expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products.\"\n Outsourcing some production could help Intel fill gaps in its product line as it addresses its manufacturing issues, analysts say.\n \"Competitive threats remain the biggest concern,\" Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday research note. They added that AMD could gain even more market share at Intel's expense because it outsources production to TSMC, which will be making more advanced processors by the time Intel's 7-nanometer production has ramped up in 2023.\n \"The world is becoming more digitally connected, expanding the market in front of us,\" Gelsinger said. \"There is an enormous opportunity ahead for Intel, but to be able to seize these opportunities, we have to deliver the best products and stay ahead of our customers' needs. We need to become more agile in a very competitive market.\"",

        "body_text": "In a series of essays called \"The Distance,\" Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans in the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story idea.\nThis is just to say I am thinking of you, dear reader, in a time when everything feels breakable. Are you holding it together? I am not. Most days I struggle with grief and rage. I often cover my face with my hands. My fingers keep closing into fists.\n What is happening to me? To us? Maybe you're like me: afraid, anxious, nervous, or feeling whatever else you call that paralyzing sensation that radiates from below the ribcage up into your chest. You can't stop worrying about all you have left to lose. You think you might be losing your mind.\n I find myself experiencing this mental-health decline even though I have not fallen gravely ill, or lost my job, or lost my home, or been trapped in a long-term care facility, or endured any of the other major tribulations that currently afflict tens of millions of my fellow Americans. And so I wonder: If the pandemic is this bad for me, how much worse is it for you?\n \"Everyone's struggling,\" Dr. Erica Martin Richards told me on the phone. She's a psychiatrist and a medical director at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC, as well as a professor at Johns Hopkins University. She told me her patients are sicker and more anxious than usual. Research and observation tell her that other Americans are having a very hard time.\n \"Does that include you?\" I asked.\n \"It does,\" she said. And although her physician's reserve prevented her from saying too much, she admitted that the risk of infection had sometimes made her afraid to go to work.\n When this is over we will all need help. We already do now. Some of us will get it. Most will not, whether for lack of time or money or motivation. There are not enough counselors to sift through the layers of mental and emotional wreckage and give us all the attention we need. Any counselor doing the job now will also need treatment, like an Army medic wounded in battle.\n There are deficits everywhere, seen and unseen. Deficits of money. Deficits of fruit and vegetables. Deficits of routine medical and dental care. Deficits of education. Deficits of sleep, rest, productivity and lucid concentration. Deficits of love, or human touch. Deficits of eye contact. Deficits of joy, of laughter, of time with friends at the coffee shop or basketball court. Deficits of quiet solitude for overworked parents, of children's laughter for lonely grandparents. All these unpaid bills will come due: some right away, some a year or a decade from now. One way or another, all of us will pay.\n Our weaknesses, weaker. Our minds constantly wandering. Does your imagination go to strange places after breakfast? Before dinner? In the middle of a restless night, your failures and regrets playing back in a high-definition theater of guilt? Maybe that's just me.\n I am thinking of one more deficit, another unmet need. Too many people are grieving the loss of a loved one, unable to hold a proper funeral. Too often this grief is unnoticed. We look away, busy with our own lives, afraid of the mounting horror. At least I do. Let us try now to stare it in the face.\n I write this two days after the daily Covid-19 death toll reached 4,462, a new record high, the milestone largely forgotten in the noise of rioting and impeachment. Now stop and imagine with me the final departure of 4,462 souls, more than three per minute. They are lined up like jets on a runway. Every 19 seconds, another one rises up out of sight. Each one was once a little boy or girl, someone who got scared in the night and went looking for a hand to hold. Have you ever walked into a child's room at night and listened closely to make sure they were still breathing? Nineteen seconds. Here and gone. No visitors in the room.\n Now imagine everyone who loved those 4,462 people. What if they could safely gather? You'd need the largest stadium in the world. Every seat would be filled. What if all those people cried at once? Can you imagine the sound?\n I know someone who cries in the shower, sometimes quietly, sometimes with full-on convulsive sobs. The wails are muffled by the curtain and the door, and the noise of falling water, but sometimes the sound still escapes. The shower is a good place to cry. She says this cascade of water feels like the right amount of tears.\n Another soul, and another, floating up toward God. An astonishing number of departures. Our Covid-19 death toll may reach 500,000 in February. Larger than the population of Atlanta. Imagine that. My favorite city, with everyone gone. Five Points station, deserted. The playground empty at Centennial Olympic Park. Half a million people dead, and the rest of us damaged in ways we don't yet understand.\n One year after the nation's first confirmed coronavirus infection, there are reasons for optimism. New cases are decreasing. Vaccinations have begun. President Joe Biden has promised 100 million shots in his first 100 days. In the meantime, we must forgive ourselves for doing a little less. It's OK to soothe yourself with television, Dr. Richards told me. It's OK not to clean the house today. It's OK to have breakfast for dinner. It's OK to not be OK.\n There are things we can do to help ourselves and each other. Tell your friends you love them. Tell them your troubles and listen to theirs. Show up for those family Zoom calls, whether or not you feel like it. \"There are studies that show the importance of smiling,\" Richards said. \"The importance of prayer. The importance of exercising.\" She regularly does all three.\n This will get better. First it may get worse. Keep going. Hold on to someone, or something, if only a thread of hope. Reach out to the lonely, and reach out if you're alone. We are far apart, but the distance is shrinking. One day we can all be broken together.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nTech companies have been an investor favorite during the pandemic. But Wall Street is keeping its distance from two industry stalwarts after their latest earnings reports.\n Intel (INTC) beat full-year revenue expectations, hauling in a record $77.9 billion last year and announcing that it would boost its quarterly dividend to reward shareholders.\n But investors still weren't sold, as worries persist that the company is lagging behind competitors in producing the most advanced microprocessors while struggling with manufacturing delays. Incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts that Intel would consider outsourcing more production.\n Watch this space: Intel made the decision to release its results just before markets closed on Thursday following reports of unauthorized access to its earnings materials. It's investigating the breach.\n Shares jumped late Thursday, finishing the session 6.5% higher. They're now down 4.5% in premarket trading.\n IBM (IBM), meanwhile, missed revenue estimates. The 109-year-old company is betting big on cloud computing technology, and previously announced it would spin off a significant part of its business in order to double down. In the meantime, CEO Arvind Krishna said Covid-19 anxiety is weighing on sales.\n \"Our performance reflects the fact that our clients continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic and broader uncertainty of the macro environment,\" he said Thursday.\n Shares are off 8% in premarket trading.\n President Joe Biden is taking big steps to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic that's now killed more than 400,000 Americans. Amid concerns about new variants of the virus, the economic recovery could rest on whether such actions pay off.\n What's happening: Biden laid out his strategy to fight the coronavirus in remarks delivered at the White House on Thursday. He likened efforts to expand vaccine distribution, supplies and testing to a \"wartime undertaking.\"\n The president is pushing Congress to approve a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that includes $20 billion for a national vaccination program. It would also invest $50 billion to increase testing.\n There are plans for new immunization sites across the country and a role for pharmacies in every neighborhood. Biden is also asking Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration, while mandating their use on federal lands and during interstate train, bus and air travel.\n Questions about implementation and enforcement of mask mandates remain. But it's clear that the administration's fight to get the virus under control comes at a crucial juncture.\n \"We are still in a very serious situation,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, told reporters Thursday.\n One issue: Scientists around the world are scrambling to decipher what the emergence of new coronavirus variants could mean for case counts, as well as their effect on those who've been vaccinated or have antibodies.\n Where the economy is concerned, the data shows what happens when a more contagious variant takes hold and governments are forced to impose fresh restrictions.\n The United Kingdom, where a more communicable coronavirus strain has caused an explosion of cases and deaths, experienced a steep fall in private sector output this month after the government implemented the country's third national lockdown.\n The composite Purchasing Managers' Index for January \u2014 a closely-watched gauge of economic health that tracks both manufacturing output and the services sector \u2014 dropped to its lowest level since May, according to data released Friday.\n \"A steep slump in business activity in January puts the locked-down UK economy on course to contract sharply in the first quarter of 2021, meaning a double-dip recession is on the cards,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.\n In the United States, the Back-to-Normal Index from CNN Business and Moody's Analytics is back above 80%. But the UK case underlines the extent to which the virus is still holding the economy hostage.\n Investor insight: Virus jitters are weighing on Wall Street Friday \u2014 and with good reason. Stocks have touched record highs on hopes that corporate earnings will meaningfully recover later this year. But that is contingent on how quickly people can feel comfortable leaving their homes.\n \"There was always a risk ... that the spread of the virus and the resulting lockdowns could eventually take its toll and I wonder whether we're seeing signs of that,\" Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said in a note to clients.\n Google (GOOGL), locked in a fight with Australian lawmakers, is playing its strongest card.\n The latest: The company said Friday that it will shut down its search engine in the country if a controversial bill designed to benefit the news media becomes law, my CNN Business colleague Michelle Toh reports.\n The legislation would impose sweeping new rules requiring Facebook (FB) and Google to pay media organizations for the use of their news content. The two tech companies would be required to bargain with the country's news publishers on compensation in order to share or display their stories.\n At a hearing in Canberra on Friday, Google executive Mel Silva said the draft legislation \"remains unworkable,\" and would be \"breaking\" the way millions of users searched for content online.\n The company's main concern with the proposal is that it \"would require payments simply for links and snippets just to news results in search,\" according to Silva.\n Facebook is also pushing back, warning that it could ultimately be forced to block news content in Australia.\n Australian politicians bristled at Google's response \u2014 signaling a tough fight to come. \"We don't respond to threats,\" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a press conference.\n Big picture: It's no secret that the news media, which has often struggled to make money off digital products, has ceded huge swaths of the advertising market to Google and Facebook. The question is whether the problem can be solved by regulators.\n Such an approach may be gaining momentum. On Thursday, Google announced it would pay news outlets in France for the use of their content online in a landmark agreement that could soon be replicated elsewhere in Europe under new copyright laws.\n The composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the United States, which tracks the health of the manufacturing and services sectors, arrives at 9:45 a.m. ET.\n Also today: Data on existing home sales for December posts at 10 a.m. ET.\n Coming next week: World leaders and top executives gather for a digital version of the World Economic Forum, the flashy annual conference in the Swiss Alps. Without cocktail parties and the lure of skiing, will it pack the same punch?",

        "title": "Nigerian teen jailed for blasphemy has sentence quashed ",
        "body_text": "A Nigerian teen who was convicted in the northwest of the country of blasphemy has had his sentence overturned, his lawyer said Friday.\n The appellate division of the Kano State High Court set aside Omar Farouq's sentence on Thursday because he did not have legal representation at his first trial, his counsel Kola Alapinni told CNN.\n A Sharia court in Kano State convicted Farouq in August last year and sentenced him to ten years in prison after he was accused of using foul language toward Allah in an argument with a friend.\n The Sharia court judgment which was nullified Thursday described him as a 17-year-old minor, but Alapinni told CNN his client is 13.\n Alapinni said Farouq's mother had fled to a neighboring town after mobs descended on their home following his arrest.\n \"We now need to arrange safe passage for him. His life is in danger in Kano -- it will never be the same,\" said Alapinni.\n The Auschwitz Memorial in Poland has offered to fundraise to pay for Farouq's education, saying in a tweet that \"we are all part of one humanity.\"\n In a separate judgment, the court also quashed 22-year-old music studio assistant Yahaya Sharif-Aminu's death penalty sentence for insulting the Prophet Mohammed.\n He had not been allowed legal representation before or during his trial -- in contravention of Nigerian citizens' constitutional right to legal representation, said his lawyers.\n He was convicted on August 10 for making \"a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed in a WhatsApp Group,\" the judgment document stated.\n Blasphemy is an offense that carries the death sentence under Kano State's Sharia Penal Code.\n The recording was shared widely, causing mass outrage in the highly conservative, majority Muslim state, according to various reports.\n However, Sharif-Aminu's case was remitted back to the Sharia court for a retrial due to procedural irregularities, said Alapinni.\n The lawyer told CNN his team will appeal the entirety of the decision.\n \"Both cases have similar facts and the same judge. Why is one defendant free and not the other?\" he said.\n Amnesty International's country director Osai Ojigho said she welcomed Farouq's release and that \"he should not have been convicted in the first [place].\"\n \"We reiterate our stance that Aminu Yahaya Shariff  should be given a fair hearing,\" she added.\n Kano's State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, told clerics in Kano in August that he would sign Sharif-Aminu's death warrant as soon as the singer had exhausted the appeals process, according to local media reports.\n Kano State, like most predominantly Muslim states in Nigeria, practices Sharia law alongside secular law.\n In the eyes of many Nigerians, the adoption of Sharia law is a violation of the country's constitution, because they believe Article 10 guarantees religious freedom.\n \"This issue of blasphemy is incompatible with the Nigerian constitution,\" Leo Igwe, chair of the board of trustees for the Humanist Association of Nigeria, told CNN in September.\n The court upheld the legality of the Sharia Penal system in both cases, a decision which Alapinni said he will also appeal in the Federal Court.\n \"It goes to the very root of religious freedom in Nigeria,\" he added.",

        "body_text": "A Tallahassee man in his nineties begs for his 70-year-old caretaker to be bumped up in the vaccination queue. A woman over 75 in Raleigh asks what number to call to make an appointment. The daughter of a nursing home resident in San Jose wants to know why her mom has not received the Covid-19 vaccine.\n Those are not questions directed at health care workers or government officials, but at journalists. The Covid-19 vaccine roll out in the US has been slow and chaotic. Seniors with priority have had to deal with jammed up phone lines, crashing websites and long queues, forcing some to turn to their local news reporters for answers on how to get access for themselves and others.\n \"I don't even know when I'm going to get vaccinated yet \u2014 let alone answer those questions for readers,\" said Katie Bernard, Kansas government reporter for the Kansas City Star and Wichita Eagle.\n Local news reporters like Bernard are trying their best to educate their communities on the vaccine \u2014 refreshing local public health websites, attending press conferences, speaking with government officials and then synthesizing all this information into easy-to-understand stories online, in print and on air. That is typical work of a local reporter, but several told CNN Business the engagement has been shocking. A focus on service journalism has been good for business, though it has contributed to a drop in attention on investigations.\n Tallahassee Democrat reporter CD Davidson-Hiers received 167 calls and 75 text messages on January 4 regarding vaccine registrations, according to a tweet from the paper's news director. Davidson-Hiers told Poynter shortly thereafter that she stopped counting.\n In an interview with CNN Business, Davidson-Hiers likened her recent experience to working at the entrance to a theme park.\n \"It's just like, okay, this is where the restrooms are. This is where this attraction is. I know you're going to want to know where this is,\" Davidson-Hiers said. \"It's just constantly directing people.\"\n Anita Lee, a senior staff writer at the Biloxi-based Sun Herald where she has worked since 1987, said she has not gotten up much from her computer lately. She is constantly checking the websites where people in Mississippi can make appointments to receive the vaccine. Not only does she keep news articles updated, but she has also been helping individuals make appointments.\n \"I stay on the phone with people and try to help them figure out which website is going to be the best one,\" Lee told CNN Business. \"In the case of a lot of the elderly folks, they're going to need phone numbers. A lot of our print readers \u2014 and they're loyal print readers \u2014 are not able to get online.\"\n Not every call, text or email has a specific ask. Journalists have listened to community members air their grievances. Soumya Karlamangla, health reporter at the Los Angeles Times, said she \"feels like people just tweet their anxieties at me.\"\n \"I think a key part of this has been validating how frustrated people are and worried and anxious,\" Davidson-Hiers told CNN Business. \"The information, of course, is helpful, it's factual, but just being a sounding board. People are like, 'Okay, this reporter also is really overwhelmed by how quickly all of this is changing. I'm not doing anything wrong.'\"\n Karlamangla's Twitter account has become a must follow for Angelenos seeking the latest news on Covid-19 in California, where cases continue to surge. For the last year, she has tracked grim milestones, including when California become the first state to record more than 3 million Covid-19 cases. She has also provided information on where to get the vaccine. In lighter news, she recently shared her story on the rise of pet adoptions, inspiring others to posts photos of their pets.\n Bui cited business owners and caretakers who work with the elderly as  two groups of people that \"have a lot of questions.\" Others text questions about school openings and large gatherings.\n \"When I text somebody back, they're always like, 'Oh my gosh. Thank you so much. You're doing an invaluable service,'\" Bui said. \"I'm just texting. I'm glad this little thing I can do is helpful.\"\n ABC7 News, a station covering San Francisco and the Bay Area, created a Covid-19 vaccine tracker for California. Reporter Alix Martichoux told CNN Business that the project was inspired by the success of a tracker for the Bay Area's reopening plans.\n \"Earlier this week, it had 16 million pageviews,\" Martichoux said in an interview last week. \"I'm not saying that to toot our own horn, but it was just so clear that our people in California needed something very easy to understand and to tell them information that directly affected them.\"\n Some local coverage on the vaccine has focused on correcting misinformation. When a large sign appeared over a Durham highway that read \"COVID-19 vaccine makers are exempt from liability,\" The News & Observer's Adam Wagner wrote a story about the damage to public trust that a message like that can cause. He spoke to an expert to provide context around what the sign claimed.\n \"I've gone about reporting the facts as straight as possible,\" Wagner said. \"What we're getting back from readers a lot is that people are not getting enough information. People want the vaccine, but they don't know what phone number to call or they don't know what website to go to.\"\n Lee of the Sun Herald said she sees \"naysayers about masks and social distancing\" on Facebook. That misinformation has prompted her team to produce more coverage on what the \"repercussions are for failing to do this and point out when our mask mandates ended, what happened, which is more cases,\" Lee said.\n An unintended consequence of newsrooms' increased focus in service journalism is there are fewer resources devoted to investigative reporting.\n \"Watchdog reporting matters, but in times like this people are panicking for the most basic information: Do I have to pay rent this month? When am I getting my stimulus check? Can I go to the grocery store today?\" said Bui of The Arizona Republic.\n Amalie Nash, senior vice president of local news at Gannett's (GCI) USA Today Network which publishes The Arizona Republic, Tallahassee Democrat and other local papers, said that she expects more \"watchdog\" stories down the line over what went right and wrong on the local and national level.\n But Nash credited newsrooms' focus on answering questions \u2014 including direct engagement by reporters \u2014 for improvements in the business of local news. Even before the vaccine roll out, readers were tuning into and reading the news at record rates \u2014 a sign of the public's need for reliable information about Covid-19. Gannett reported it surpassed 1 million digital subscribers in the third quarter of 2020, a 31% increase from the year prior.\n \"There aren't a lot of positives, obviously, in a pandemic, but I have been heartened to see that so many readers are connecting with local news sources in ways that they didn't necessarily do before,\" Nash said. \"You've seen a lot more people understanding the value of local news... and I hope that that feeling continues past the pandemic.\"",

        "title": "Here's why protesters say they're gathering in Portland",
        "body_text": "Protesters again took to the streets of Portland, Oregon, on Thursday -- the first full day of Joe Biden's presidency -- to let the Democratic establishment know they are still fighting for racial justice, some told CNN.\n \"We wanted to symbolize that both parties are the oppressor,\" said a 25-year-old protester who wished not to be identified, fearing government reprisal. \"We've all experienced firsthand that police violence is police violence regardless (of which political party holds power). ... It doesn't make a difference to the person being beaten.\"\n \"For White people, maybe they feel there's time to let the administration work, but for Black and Indigenous people who have had a rope around their neck, there is no time,\" the protester said. \"There's no justice, so there is no peace.\"\n Biden in his inaugural speech Wednesday called for racial justice and unity in America, acknowledging the nation has been deeply divided by systemic racism and political forces. He denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the country must be healed.\n \"A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,\" Biden said. \"The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\"\n Still, protesters wearing all black clothing and gas masks took to the streets Thursday in Portland, where social justice demonstrations have endured for months. Protesters there a day earlier had vandalized the state Democratic Party headquarters and a federal US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, building, police said, and four people have been charged in connection with those events.\n CNN witnessed more arrests on Thursday night, when most people attending a protest at the ICE building were White. Indeed, the demographic of Portland's protest movement has often been criticized. Protesters say it should be neither surprising, given that the city is 77% White, nor disparaged.\n \"I want to dispel that White anarchists are co-opting this for their own gain,\" said the 25-year-old protester, who is White and told CNN he's lived in Portland for most of his life. \"There are Black and Indigenous people out there that can't have the same outward action as White people can.\"\n Some protesters' anger is fueled by their assumption the Biden administration won't take up their key demands: abolishing ICE and defunding the police, a concept that can range from reinvesting police resources in marginalized communities to disbanding forces altogether, they told CNN.\n \"There is a lot of anger and rage\" over social inequity among Americans, protester Alix Powell told CNN. And vandalism is how some people express their anger, she said.\n \"There's a lot of hopelessness in people my age and people I know who feel like no matter how you vote, no matter what you do, they're not listening,\" she said Thursday. \"A riot is the language of the unheard.\"\n \"It doesn't matter who's president: Black lives don't matter, Arab lives don't matter, they don't care about us. They just don't,\" another protester of Arab descent, who also wished to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday.\n National Black leaders are counting on the new President to unify the county and enact policies that address the disparities Black people face in housing, education, jobs, health care and voter suppression, they have said. They also want Biden to undo the harm caused by President Donald's Trump offensive rhetoric toward people of color and refusal to address police brutality in the Black community.\n Among the first three executive orders Biden signed on Inauguration Day was one meant to ensure racial equality and support underserved communities. Biden also has assembled the most racially diverse presidential Cabinet in US history. His Department of Homeland Security has paused deportations for 100 days, with some exceptions. And on Friday, he's set to sign executive orders that expand aid to low-income Americans.\n As in cities across the country, protests erupted in Portland late last spring over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and expanded to include demands for police accountability and prosecutorial reform in the cases of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Elijah McClain and other Black victims.\n The events have ranged from peaceful Black Lives Matter marches to violent demonstrations including arson and vandalism. Some have become a target for hate groups seeking to antagonize those who come out to defend the rights of marginalized communities.\n Oregon's complicated racial tensions trace to the time of the nation's founding.

        "body_text": "Magic and monologues turn out to be a potent streaming combination, conjuring a taste of the theatrical experience that many sorely miss. The latest example, \"In & Of Itself,\" transforms Derek DelGaudio's long-running stage show into an absorbing Hulu special, one that actually builds on the in-person experience by mashing together numerous shows as opposed to filming just one.\n The special was taped in New York, where DelGaudio's presentation ran off-Broadway for more than 500 performances. But the show actually made its debut at Los Angeles' Geffen Playhouse, which was notably the scene of another magic act, Helder Guimar\u00e3es' \"The Present\" and now \"The Future,\" offering a remarkable interactive virtual experience to the stay-at-home theater crowd.\n Both performers combine sleight of hand with deeply personal narratives, serving as a kind of one-person show punctuated by card tricks. DelGaudio is described as a \"storyteller and conceptual magician,\" which has the mind-expanding mix about right.\n Yet in bringing \"In & Of Itself\" to the screen, director Frank Oz (yes, the former Muppet master and filmmaker, who directed the theatrical version as well) has heightened the impact of DelGaudio's material by rapidly inter-cutting exchanges with audience members across a number of shows.\n In the most memorably unique and showstopping bit, DelGaudio asked attendees to take a card off the wall with a specific identity, saying \"I am\" and listing a wide variety of choices, from occupations to familial relationships to vague designations like \"oracle\" or \"rebel.\"\n Near the end, he then went through the audience one by one, somehow rattling off what title each of them had chosen.\n Instead of a single demonstration of that, Oz illustrates the routine by presenting a stunning medley, including several famous people (Bill Gates among them) who attended the show. It's almost the equivalent of seeing an athlete not merely make one great play but a highlight reel with dozens of them.\n Oz applies the same approach to an emotional sequence in which DelGaudio brings a guest on stage, giving them something to read that surprises and moves them. Those kind of interactions provide the biggest \"wow\" moments, although the card tricks certainly brand him as someone with whom you'd be ill-advised to play poker.\n The last several months have brought a number of theatrical presentations to premium TV, including \"Hamilton,\" \"What the Constitution Means to Me,\" David Byrne's \"American Utopia\" and now this.\n Granted, watching something like \"In & Of Itself\" in your living room isn't quite the same experience as seeing the show in an intimate theatrical setting. But for now, it's the next-best thing, and as structured, a very good one at that.\n \"In & Of Itself\" premieres Jan. 22 on Hulu.",

        "body_text": "Americans are becoming more willing to get the coronavirus vaccine when it's available to them: About 66% say they'll try to get vaccinated, according to a CNN poll, up from 51% in October.\n (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n President Biden unveiled a national strategy to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. It begins with a national vaccination campaign to administer 100 million shots during his first 100 days in office. Biden also signed executive orders to bolster pandemic response and testing capabilities, and issued a federal mask mandate for interstate travel. Dr. Anthony Fauci says he's confident the US \"can and should\" vaccinate up to 85% of the adult US population by summer's end. Meanwhile, the UK is considering closing its borders to contain Covid-19 variants and may offer money to people diagnosed with the virus as an incentive to self-isolate. And Japan insists the Tokyo Olympics will go on this summer, despite rumors of cancellation.\n More executive orders are expected to come today as Biden continues to swiftly overturn his predecessor's policies. One order focuses on raising the minimum wage to $15 for the federal workforce, and the other on expanding assistance for Americans in need. The Biden administration has its work cut out for it elsewhere, too. In coming days, the Justice Department must decide what to do with cases in which it has been expected to defend former President Trump. The White House has also ordered an intelligence review of Russian misdeeds, including the recent SolarWinds hack, at the same time it will pursue an extension of the New START Treaty, a nuclear arms control agreement with Russia that expires next month. Also on Biden's foreign policy to-do list: Figure out ways to address rising tensions with China and Iran, and deal with the growing nuclear threat out of North Korea.\n Seven Senate Democrats have requested an Ethics Committee investigation of Republican Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz to find out if their objections to the Electoral College votes may have contributed to inciting the violent Capitol insurrection. So far, prosecutors have charged more than 120 people and soon may bring more serious charges, including conspiracy. As the probe moves forward, new evidence reveals rioters attacked and threatened police officers with flagpoles and fire extinguishers, hurled insults and made clear their violent intentions. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has proposed delaying Trump's impeachment trial until mid-February to give Trump's legal team time to prepare. Trump was impeached by the House in his final days in office for his alleged role in inciting the insurrection.\n A growing number of international voices, including the United States, the\u00a0 European Union and human rights groups, are calling for a probe into Ugandan election abuses and violence that left more than 40 people dead in the lead-up to the vote. During the election, opposition candidates were harassed, news media was suppressed by the government and observers' offices were raided, the EU Council of Ministers has said. Human Rights Watch says there were incidences of violence and human rights violations as well. Uganda's longtime leader, President Yoweri Museveni, was declared the winner for a record sixth term amid an internet blackout and allegations of abuse. His opponent, Bobi Wine, has been under house arrest since the military surrounded his home a week ago.\n Twenty-two miners have been trapped underground for nearly two weeks following an explosion at a gold mine in eastern China, and officials say it could take another two weeks to get them out. At least 11 of the 22 miners -- who are trapped in different areas -- are confirmed to be alive, and most of them are getting food, medical supplies, blankets and batches of nutrient solution through a shaft. Officials say rescuers will have to drill through 70 tons of debris to reach the miners. Explosions and deaths are not uncommon in Chinese mines. In September, at least 16 workers in a coal mine died after being trapped and exposed to carbon monoxide. In 2016, a gas explosion claimed the lives of dozens of workers in another coal mine.\n All the glamor of wine on an airplane ... without the airplane.\n Oh, the ton is abuzz with excitement!\n The show continues to be a modern-day oracle.\n No one can escape the curse of the business casual sweatpants.\n You monsters!

Now, Walmart (WMT), the largest retailer in the nation, will roll out the vaccine to select stores in New Jersey, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, South Carolina and Texas, as well as in Chicago, and Puerto Rico, a company spokesperson said in an email Friday.\n Each state determines which population groups are eligible to receive the vaccine, and the vaccine will only be available to those designated groups at Walmart pharmacies. In Georgia, for example, adults ages 65 and over are currently eligible, but non-healthcare essential workers are not.\n \"We are going by what the state tells us in terms of priority groups they want our help vaccinating,\" a Walmart spokesperson said.\n The news, which was first reported by Reuters, comes as President Joe Biden and his administration seek to accelerate vaccine distribution. So far, more than 17 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the United States, according to the latest CDC data. Biden has announced a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office.\n Pharmacies and grocery stores are expected to play a major role in vaccine distribution. The federal government has a partnership program with 19 pharmacy chains, retailers and pharmacy associations across the United States, representing more than 40% of US pharmacy locations.\n Walmart (WMT) said in a blog post Friday that it expects to be able to administer 10 million to 13 million doses per month, \"when supply and allocations allow,\" across its more than 5,000 pharmacies in the United States and Puerto Rico.\n Other chains have also given targets. CVS (CVS) has said it eventually expects to be able to administer as many as 20 million to 25 million shots per month.",

It said that was expected to more than double to 750 by the end of January.\n Nigeria has recorded 114,691 COVID-19 cases and 1,478 deaths, as of Thursday.\n While wealthier countries have begun mass vaccination campaigns, African countries are scrambling to secure supplies.\n Nigeria's state governors issued a statement on Thursday in which they said the country's first vaccine doses were expected to arrive by the end of February.\n Authorities previously said the first doses, under the COVAX programme backed by the World Health Organization to secure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries, were expected by the end of January.",

Woodson Houses, a  senior housing complex, between 2015 and January 15, 2021 over money disputes, NYPD chief of detectives Rodney Harrison said during a news conference Thursday.\n \"Mr. Gavin was familiar with many of the residents in the building and ran errands for some of the elderly tenants who resided at that location,\" he said.\n The first victim, Myrtle McKinney, 82, was discovered in November 2015 with a stab wound to the neck. That case had remained open with \"very few investigative leads\" until April 2019, when another woman, 83-year-old Jacolia James, was discovered dead, Harrison said.\n Forensic evidence recovered at the scene had pointed to Gavin as a suspect in the James case, Harrison said.\n However, the NYPD could not find a connection between the murders until January 15, when a third woman, 78-year old Juanita Caballero, was discovered dead with a telephone cord wrapped around her neck.\n Investigators were then able to find a \"very definitive link\" between Gavin and the three murders, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said, without elaborating further.\n According to the criminal complaint, Gavin's own statements connect him to all three deaths.\n The complaint alleges Gavin \"pushed Myrtle McKinney into a table where a steak knife was located and it punctured her.\" The complaint also alleges that he \"choked Jacolia James and stomped on her neck three times\" and that \"a phone cord wrapped around Juanita Caballero's neck\" during a struggle.\n Gavin \"took advantage of his relationship with these women who allowed [him] into their homes, and did unspeakable acts of violence against them,\" Gonzalez said. \"I think that this arrest will have a profound impact on the sense of public safety in Brooklyn.\"\n Gonzalez said he will impanel a grand jury to hear evidence in the coming days. He added that he is \"confident\" that the jury will choose to indict Gavin.\n Investigators will also follow all leads on other incidents that may have involved Gavin, Harrison said.\n Four cameras were installed in the lobby of the 25-story building last year, according to NYPD Chief of Housing David Barrere. Though an additional 65 cameras were supposed to be placed, Barrere said the pandemic hit the building's budget.\n Those cameras are now in the process of being installed, he said.\n Gavin has been remanded and a preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place on January 27.\n CNN's Brynn Gingras, Rob Frehse, Kelly Christ and Alec Snyder contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "It's been two weeks since a violent mob -- egged on by ex-President Donald Trump and a complicit Republican Party -- stormed the US Capitol amid formal counting of the Electoral College vote to confirm Joe Biden had won the White House.\n And Josh Hawley still isn't sorry.\n Hawley, a freshman Republican senator from Missouri, was the leading voice inside the Senate to formally object to the Electoral College results in several states, including Arizona and Pennsylvania -- despite zero evidence in either state of any sort of wrongdoing or malfeasance related to the votes. (Hawley's support for the objections ensured that there would be a debate over each state's electoral votes and a vote on each.)\n While Trump was quite clearly the spark that lit the fire that led to January 6, Hawley was one of the main gatherers of the tinder that turned it into a raging inferno.\n There have been a series of consequences as a result of Hawley's aiding and abetting of the false idea that the election was somehow stolen.\n His book -- \"The Tyranny of Big Tech\" -- was dropped by Simon & Schuster, who cited \"[Hawley's] s role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom\" as the reason.\n Senate Democrats have moved against Hawley and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, filing an ethics complaint on Thursday against both men aimed at prompting an investigation into their roles in the incitement and encouragement of the January 6 riot.\n The Missouri senator's response to all of the blowback? Bring it on!\n Hawley called the Simon & Schuster decision \"Orwellian\" and promised to \"fight this cancel culture with everything I have.\" Of the ethics complaint, Hawley accused his Senate Democratic colleagues of \"brazenly trying to silence dissent.\"\n In an appearance on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News Thursday night, Hawley dismissed Biden's talk of unity in his inauguration speech.\n \"We hear a lot of talk now about unity, but sadly, I think they don't want unity, they want control and they want you to have the same opinions, voice the same opinions, toe the party line, and if you don't, then they're willing to use every power at their disposal to shut you down,\" Hawley told Carlson.\n And, it's not just his words. It's his actions, too.\n Hawley was one of only two votes against the confirmation of Lloyd Austin as defense secretary on Friday. (Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee was the other.) And earlier this week, Hawley blocked speedy consideration of Alejandro Mayorkas as Biden's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security over concerns about how the southern border will be policed by the new administration. (Biden issued an executive order shortly after taking over as president that halts construction of the border wall, a Trump pet project.)\n If you've paid any attention at all to Republican politics over (at least) the last four years, none of this should surprise you. At the core of Donald Trump's life (and political) philosophy is the idea that you should never, ever apologize because it shows weakness to your enemies. Instead, you should double down on any perceived mistakes you've committed and insist to anyone willing to listen that you were either a) right all along or b) will be proved right in the long run.\n Hawley, who would love to be the heir to the Trump coalition come 2024, has clearly taken that lesson to heart. Rather than apologizing for his role in convincing the GOP base that the election was fraudulent, he's turned the entire debacle into a fight against, in Hawley's own words, the \"woke mob.\"\n That may well be good politics for him in a Republican Party whose base still pledges near-total fealty to Trump. But it's something well short of what actual leadership looks like.",

He worked as a customer service agent for Eulen America, a contractor for American Airlines, assisting customs at Miami International Airport.\n He's one of 123,300 airline workers out of a job since February. Among air, rail, and ground transport, more than a quarter million jobs have been lost, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the recovery has been slow.\n \"There was a struggle because I used all my savings to pay my bills and pay the rent, pay my food and everything,\" Palma said of when he was first laid off.\n Eulen declined to comment, other than confirming Palma's previous employment.\n The Biden administration is now faced with an industry that is at a standstill. On Thursday, Secretary of Transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg said the department would play a key role in building back the economy.\n \"The Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden's infrastructure vision creating millions of good-paying jobs,\" Buttigieg told legislators in his committee hearing.\n In the latest stimulus bill passed by Congress during the Trump administration, $15 billion in payroll protection was allocated for US-based airlines with the caveat that 32,000 airline employees are brought back to work by the end of March. But as a contractor for American Airlines, Palma was not re-hired.\n Since then, he lost his apartment because he can't afford the $1,125 monthly rent. He survives off food stamps and receives $275 a week in unemployment, which is just enough to cover the rent for a room in a house. He says he's counting every penny and shops in the expired food isle at the grocery store.\n \"That's the only way I can eat. It's cheaper, is almost half the price, sometimes more than that,\" said Palma, who immigrated from Nicaragua 30 years ago. \"I keep it for the longest I can keep it so I can wait for my next check for the food stamps.\"\n Palma has no car, which makes getting food and looking for work harder.\n \"I can't even go it to the food banks because I have no car. Every time I'd go looking for a job, I'll have to walk so many miles,\" said Palma. \"Sometimes I can't even use public transportation.  I need the money. I need every penny I can save.\"\n And the bills keep coming. Palma has asthma and a heart condition which left him with a $12,000 hospital bill. His current medication runs him about $300 a month, and he has student loans \u2014 putting him almost $20,000 in debt.\n \"It's too much money and it's hard for me. It's going to take me years to get rid of the bill -- years,\" he said.\n Just this week, Palma received a letter from his former employer, Eulen America, inviting him back for an interview in a new position. However, the letter states the position is \"part time and hours are not guaranteed.\"\n For 21 years, Gerson Fernandes has driven a New York City yellow cab. He owns a taxi medallion, or a small plate with an identification number affixed to the hood of his cab, which allows him to operate as in independent business and driver. He bought his in 2003 for $245,000, and is still paying it off monthly. But since the pandemic began he cannot afford the $3,000-a-month payment.\n Even before Covid-19 swept the world, traditional taxi drivers were struggling in New York City. At one point the price of taxi medallions topped over $1 million, but that collapsed as drivers for ridehailing services like Uber and Lyft flooded the market. In 2018, nine taxi drivers, faced with the debt they had taken on just to afford a medallion, committed suicide.\n And then the pandemic hit.\n At the height of the pandemic, ridership dropped by 90% for yellow cabs and 85% for ride-share apps, according to the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which  analyzed New York Taxi and Limousine Commission ridership data.\n \"We've lost a lot of customers,\" said Fernandes, originally from Bombay, India. \"I feel sad that such a robust industry has been spoiled or really like gone to the ground and it's not right.\"\n The yellow cab is synonymous with New York City. Fernandes used to work 12-hour shifts picking up dozens of customers. Today, he says he is lucky to get four or five. He spends his 8-hour shifts waiting for customers at LaGuardia airport.\n \"Those days you could afford to buy a home and pay the mortgages or pay are all the money, but now it's too bad -- it's difficult to pay,\" said Fernandes.\n He says he received unemployment benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for several months when New York City shut down, but stopped collecting once he returned to work.\n Fernandes says he's seen a slight uptick in customers since the height of the pandemic, but not enough to make him whole. He is hoping New York City's Mayor Bill De Blasio will institute a rent forgiveness on his taxi medallion lease. He already owes more than $10,000 \u2014 money he does not have.\n \"I try my best, but like, how much can you try?\" said Fernandes. \"What can you do? [I have] very limited resources.\"\n Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Gerson Fernandes' first name.",

While the number of sequences did increase over those two weeks, it did not double.\n The hope was to sequence an additional 3,500 coronavirus samples per week. But only 2,250 to  2,650 additional samples were sequenced, according to CDC numbers, with more expected soon as private labs have recently come online to help in the effort.\n Hunting for new mutations is a critical part of combatting the spread of the virus. While most mutations are harmless, some might be able to spread more quickly, be more deadly, or prove resistant to coronavirus vaccines.\n The US has been criticized for having a lackluster sequencing program. According an analysis by the Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology using data from GISAID, an independent data sharing initiative, the US ranks 33rd in the world for sequences per 1,000 cases of Covid-19, falling behind countries that have far fewer resources, such as Senegal and Burkina Faso.\n \"We're not even doing as good as Ouagadougou,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, referring to the capital of Burkina Faso.\n Last week, then-President-elect Joe Biden said he would increase funding for coronavirus surveillance efforts once he was in office.\n \"We simply do not have the kind of robust surveillance capabilities that we need to track outbreaks and mutations,\" according to Biden's American rescue plan issued last week. \"Tracking the way the virus is changing and moving through the population is essential to understanding outbreaks, generating treatments and vaccines, and controlling the pandemic.\"\n On Wednesday, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters that the funding needs to come from Congress. He said the nation's ranking in the world in terms of genomic sequence testing was \"clearly unacceptable.\"\n In order to track mutations as they happen and respond quickly, sequencing in the US needs to  increase dramatically, experts tell CNN.\n \"They don't need to double their efforts. They need to at least 10 times their efforts,\" said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center.\n Scientists search for coronavirus mutations by taking samples of the virus from patients' noses and analyzing their genetic sequences.\n The CDC does genetic sequencing in its own labs, and it also funds sequencing at public health labs across the country and at commercial labs.\n Dr. Gregory Armstrong, director of the CDC's Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN at the beginning of the year that over the next two weeks, the agency hoped to increase the number of coronavirus genomes being sequenced each week, from about 3,000 to about 6,500. That's an increase of 3,500 sequences per week.\n In an email to CNN on January 10, Armstrong said \"we were targeting to have commitments\" for the additional sequences.\n The number of sequences has increased since the beginning of the year, but not by 3,500 per week. Instead, the number increased by between 2,250 and 2,650 per week, according to numbers Armstrong supplied CNN Sunday. That means the US missed its sequencing goal by 850 to 1,250 samples.\n \"They come up profoundly small, and that's tragic. And it's costing American lives,\" Hotez said.  \"Until they can figure out a way to modernize and do big things, we will never solve this problem.\"\n Armstrong said the CDC now has contracts with three private labs -- Quest, Labcorp, and a partnership between Illumina and Helix -- to do a total of 5,000 sequences each week.\n \"Those are ramping up over the next 2 weeks (it takes time to get the systems in place to get samples from all over the country and to work through issues that inevitably arise during startup),\" Armstrong wrote to CNN. \"One of the main advantages of these 5000 per week is that, compared to what CDC had been getting, they're much more representative of the US -- covering all states, providing both a more granular and more accurate picture of what's circulating here.\"\n Armstrong said in December, the CDC put $15 million out to state and local public health labs and the state labs have made a commitment to do 750 additional per week.\n Armstrong noted that this additional sequencing \"isn't coming online immediately.\"\n He said the commercial labs \"hope to be fully up in 2-3 weeks. We're dependent on the contractors for this, which have notified us that they need additional time to scale up. \u202fBut we've been very pleased with the quality of date they're providing.\"\n Armstrong wrote that the public health labs \"hope to be mostly to full capacity by January 25th (in dealing with 64 jurisdictions scattered between the Eastern US and Western Pacific, there will almost certainly be delays in some jurisdictions).\"\n CNN's John Bonifield Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Fact check: Biden falsely claims journalists had all said his vaccination goal was impossible to meet",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden delivered a factually accurate Thursday speech about the coronavirus pandemic. But then, after he signed a series of executive actions intended to address the crisis, he was asked by a reporter whether the vaccination goal he announced in December -- 100 million doses administered in 100 days -- is sufficiently ambitious.\n The question of whether the goal is too modest has arisen in part because the US is approaching a 1-million-doses-administered-per-day level even before Biden gets to implement his plans. The US has averaged 914,000 doses administered per day over the last week, according to data published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n But Biden defended the 100 million goal. He told the reporter: \"When I announced it, you all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break, man. It's a good start -- 100 million.\"\n Gupta said on CNN on the day of Biden's announcement in December that the 100 million goal was \"very doable\" given what we had heard from vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer. The next morning, CNN medical analyst Dr. Jorge Rodriguez said on air that \"it is a realistic goal\" given that Biden has a plan.\n A brief CNN analysis article said that achieving the goal would be a \"massive undertaking\" and that Biden generally faced a \"wildly daunting\" first 100 days in office. But this article, too, did not say that meeting the goal was impossible or even improbable.\n There might well be someone at some media outlet who did say that administering 100 million doses in 100 days was not possible. But Biden told the journalists in the State Dining Room that \"you all said\" it was impossible, and that's clearly not true.\n The White House declined to comment on the record. A Biden aide said on the condition of anonymity that the President was referring to early media coverage that was skeptical about the goal, not saying the goal had been described by the media as \"literally impossible.\"\n Biden could have accurately said that some of the early coverage was skeptical.\n Citing production challenges faced by vaccine manufacturers, science journalist Laurie Garrett said on MSNBC on the day of the announcement that it was \"unclear\" whether Biden could achieve the goal. A New York Times article that day described the goal as \"ambitious,\" said its fulfilment would \"require no hiccups in manufacturing or distributing the vaccine and a willingness by Americans to be vaccinated,\" and added: \"Mr. Biden's vaccine timeline is achievable, experts say, but it may be optimistic.\"\n The Times article went on to quote former Baltimore health commissioner Dr. Leana Wen, a CNN medical analyst, who said: \"Distribution has to be seamless all across the U.S., and that means every state and local health department coordinating. And there's the issue of public trust. So I certainly hope that it happens, but (it's) very optimistic.\"\n Still, neither the article nor Garrett declared the goal impossible. And the same day, The Atlantic staff writer Conor Friedersdorf tweeted that the goal was not ambitious enough.\n More recent coverage has also conveyed a mix of views. CNN reported last week that state officials were \"skeptical\" about Biden meeting the goal. But Gupta said Thursday, after Biden spoke, that he continues to believe the goal is realistic -- and added that some could argue the 100 million figure is \"undershooting, under-targeting a fair amount, in terms of what is possible.\"\n Given Biden's plans to expand vaccine availability, Gupta said, \"I think you can get to some significant numbers higher than even what they are suggesting, higher than 100 million doses in 100 days.\"",

        "body_text": "Last year brought skyrocketing unemployment and a global pandemic that battered the economy, but people were still buying homes. Existing home sales in 2020 rose to the highest level in 14 years as prices climbed to a record high.\n Home prices rose 9% in 2020 from the year before, with the annual median price of an existing home climbing to $296,500 according to a report from the National Association of Realtors. That is the highest price on record.\n Shrinking inventory, especially among lower priced homes, was one of the biggest drivers of those rising prices. The year ended with the lowest number of homes ever available.\n Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, predicts the strong activity in the housing market to continue into this year.\n \"Although mortgage rates are projected to increase, they will continue to hover near record lows at around 3%,\" Yun said. \"Expect economic conditions to improve with additional stimulus forthcoming and vaccine distribution already underway.\"\n But Yun cautions that the current market is not what he would describe as a \"healthy market,\" in which home prices rise in line with income growth and buyers have enough time to make informed decisions about a major purchase.\n \"In that sense, it is unhealthy,\" Yun said. \"Buyers are making hurried decisions.\"\n \"Homeowners are smiling because they are seeing price increases,\" said Yun. \"They can trade up to their next home purchase. But the frustration is coming from first-time buyers.\"\n That's because there are fewer homes to buy than ever before and more competition for the homes that are for sale.\n Inventory is at an all-time low, according to NAR, with 23% fewer homes for sale in December than a year ago. And the number of available homes to buy is down in all price categories except those $750,000 and above.\n \"More acute affordability challenges will emerge if inventory stays this tight and home-price growth continues to accelerate,\" said Joel Kan, the Mortgage Bankers Association's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. \"This, in turn, would be especially challenging for first-time homebuyers, who make up a third of all home sales.\"\n The strong existing home sales pace seen in the latter part of the year continued into December with sales of existing homes -- which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops -- up 22% from a year before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million.\n Homes at the upper end of the market continued to sell at a faster pace than those at the lower end of the market. While sales of homes priced at $100,000 and under dropped by 15% in December from the year before, sales were up 76% for homes sold between $750,000 and $1 million. For homes $1 million and above, the number of sales essentially doubled.\n That drop at the lower end is due to persistent low inventory, said Yun.\n \"If we had more inventory on the lower price points, we would have even greater home sales than is being reported.\"",

        "title": "Idaho's Republican governor blasts his own party's efforts to end his Covid-19 emergency declaration",
        "body_text": "Republican Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued sharp criticism of the state Legislature's efforts to repeal a Covid-19 emergency declaration in a video statement released Friday.\n \"I believe in my heart that what the Idaho Legislature is doing is harmful to our people and wrong for Idaho,\" Little said, adding, \"I urge my partners in the Legislature to stop the political gains and do what is right for the people of Idaho.\"\n The state's Senate Committee on State Affairs voted out a resolution on Tuesday to end Idaho's emergency declaration, according to the Legislature's website. Idaho's House and Senate are both controlled by Republicans.\n Idaho is among several states weathering political clashes between their governors and legislatures over their coronavirus responses. Idaho has seen 158,200 cases and 1,654 deaths from the virus, about 8,853 cases per 100,000 people -- the 15th highest rate in the country, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n Little called the declaration \"critical\" to the state's ability to receive federal assistance, adding that it \"has enabled us to quickly cut red tape and increase health care access.\"\n Maj. Gen. Michael J. Garshak, the commanding general of the Idaho National Guard, echoed the governor's sentiments.\n \"In my opinion, it would be negligent to cancel the emergency declaration at this pivotal moment, denying the citizens of Idaho the necessary support to ensure their health, safety and welfare,\" Garshak said.\n \"It is not the time to stand down -- (by) canceling Idaho's emergency declaration, we do just that,\" he added.\n The legislation, which will next be considered by the Idaho Senate, says that \"nothing in this concurrent resolution shall prevent the State of Idaho from receiving any federal funds, benefits, or resources arising out of the state of disaster emergency relating to the outbreak of novel coronavirus or COVID-19.\" It is not clear from the text of the bill how that would be the case.\n Little, in his statement, accused legislators of perpetuating myths and falsehoods in their \"irresponsible attempts to undo Idaho's emergency declaration.\"\n \"Abandon the myth that the emergency declaration somehow shuts down Idaho. Abandon the myth that the emergency declaration somehow infringes on your rights,\" Little said.\n The governor urged people to contact the legislators of his own party and \"tell them not to take away one of our strongest tools to end this pandemic.\"\n \"Tell them Idahoans' lives and livelihoods depend on it,\" Little said.\n Tensions have been rising in the state since October, when Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin -- who has repeatedly clashed with Little over his response to the pandemic -- and 10 Republican state legislators or legislators-to-be appeared in a video in which they seemed to openly question the existence of the coronavirus pandemic. They also insisted they would follow no state or local emergency orders relating to the fight against Covid-19.\n \"The fact that a pandemic may or may not be occurring changes nothing about the meaning or intent of the state's constitution and the preservation of our inalienable rights,\" says Karey Hanks, who was running unopposed for a state House seat, in the video.\n Intra-state clashes over such declarations have put a spotlight on state governments balancing public health efforts to mitigate the pandemic with popular efforts demanding to reopen the economy -- a reflection of inconsistent directives from the prior administration in the federal government's response.\n Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer extended the state's coronavirus emergency declaration by executive order in April after the Republican-controlled Legislature advanced a bill that would not have renewed the original declaration. But in October, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that Whitmer had no authority to issue or renew executive orders relating to Covid-19 beyond April 30.\n In Wisconsin, Republicans who control the Legislature and state Supreme Court have previously forced Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to the sidelines. The state high court's decision in May -- at the Legislature's request -- to block Evers' stay-at-home order was the latest in a series of moves to stop the governor from exercising power in the spring.\n CNN's Chris Cillizza, Rebekah Riess and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "First things first: No, \"The Simpsons\" cannot actually predict the future.\n Yet, as the longest-running sitcom in US history, the timeless series often finds itself aligning with \"life imitates art\" moments that happen years after airing.\n This week, for example, users on social media couldn't help but wonder at the latest coincidence between Vice President Kamala Harris' outfit during the inauguration and Lisa Simpson's outfit in an episode from 2000.\n In \"Bart to the Future,\" Lisa assumes the presidency and asks the now-viral line, \"As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.\"\n In the episode, Lisa wore a purple jacket and pearls. At Wednesday's inauguration, Harris wore a purple jacket and pearls. With Harris serving immediately after Donald Trump's presidency, comparisons by viewers were readily made.\n The similarities with the inauguration didn't stop there for Simpsons fans. Actor Tom Hanks appeared as a host during a virtual concert Wednesday evening, which aimed to keep with President Joe Biden's theme of national unity in a time of crisis.\n In \"The Simpsons Movie\" from 2007, Hanks in a cameo role pitches a proposed new Grand Canyon at Springfield, the hometown of the Simpsons.\n \"Hello. I'm Tom Hanks. The US government has lost its credibility, so it's borrowing some of mine,\" he says.\n At the end of the scene, he says, \"If you're gonna pick a government to trust, why not this one?\"\n Speculation over the show's prescient abilities is nothing new. Fans claim the show predicted, among other instances, the Siegfried and Roy tiger attack, smart watches, \"murder hornets,\" and Disney buying 20th Century Fox.\n The show's longevity and its exhausting of possible sitcom scenarios have even been referenced in other comedies, including the \"South Park\" episode, \"The Simpsons Already Did It.\"\n When asked in 2016 about predicting a Donald Trump presidency so far in advance, writer Dan Greaney told The Hollywood Reporter, \"It was a warning to America.\"\n \"And that just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane,\" he added.",

        "title": "Biden's restoring what Trump stole from LGBTQ Americans",
        "body_text": "Allison Hope is a writer whose work has been featured by CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Slate and other outlets. The views expressed here are the author's. Read more opinion on CNN.\nIn the first hours and days of the Biden administration, something precious has been returned to us. That invaluable thing that has been restored to LGBTQ Americans -- and many others -- is hope.\n Among President Joe Biden's first actions in office was to issue an executive order barring workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Another was to end the Trump administration's policies denying the existence of systemic racism and barring diversity and inclusion training. Already, the relaunched White House web site contact form invites users to choose their own pronouns, a seemingly small but deeply significant reflection of the new administration's commitment to inclusion.\n There is hope in the appointment of Dr. Rachel Levine to become the highest-ranking transgender woman nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Health at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Biden administration. \"I am proud of the work we have done as an administration to address health equity, and the work I have done personally to raise awareness about LGBTQ equity issues,\" said Levine, who is a pediatrician, in a statement when she was nominated for the cabinet position.\n Her presence bolsters Biden's promise to undo the Trump administration's harmful policies, including rules that allow health care providers to shut the door in the face of LGBTQ patients. There is hope in knowing there will be no more abominable amicus briefs on the wrong side of history -- like the ones that aimed to deny us workplace protections, equal access to goods and services or a right to open our homes to a child without one.\n There is hope in the anticipated confirmation of a gay man, Pete Buttigieg, to be transportation secretary and in the appointment of a Black gay woman, Karine Jean-Pierre, as deputy press secretary -- to name only two of the most visible among the many LGBTQ Americans called to serve in an inclusive, diverse administration.\n Levine's nomination alone is enough to make me want to dance in the streets. To at long last have someone who understands -- intrinsically, deeply and personally -- what LGBTQ Americans and particularly what transgender people face, carries the prospect of more inclusive policies and approaches. What a complete about-face from the previous administration, which actively worked to strip trans Americans, already trapped in a broken system that marginalized them, of health care access.\n I'm reminded of what the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called \"the dissenter's hope: that they are writing not for today, but for tomorrow.\"\n All the dissenting, measured in petitions signed and virtual doors knocked, in dollars donated and social media rants posted, in clever signs and fists held high at rallies, in first-time confrontations with racist uncles and hard, honest conversations with our children, has not been for naught. That dissent has, in the great words of RBG and in her honor, given way to the one thing that paves the way for endless possibilities to follow: hope for the future.\n I trust that Biden won't just undo Trump's damage and revert back to Obama-era policies. Biden will do better than that. After all, then-Vice President Joe Biden was a major force in moving the Democratic Party out of the closet on supporting the LGBTQ community. In May 2012, Biden declared his support for marriage equality, the highest ranking official to do so at the time. The move helped push President Barack Obama to also endorse same-sex marriage in a national TV interview a few days later, and, well, the rest is history.\n Biden isn't perfect. He voted for the Defense of Marriage Act during the Clinton administration and to cut off federal funding to schools teaching acceptance of homosexuality. But he has evolved, and surrounded himself with forward-thinking people who embody and embrace LGBTQ inclusivity and will help push the needle in the right direction towards equality and justice.\n What could that look like under the Biden administration? With a friendlier Congress now in place, it could mean passage of the Equality Act, which Biden has pledged to sign in his first 100 days and which would provide blanket protections against discrimination for LGBTQ people. If adopted, the measure would mitigate the patchwork of state and local laws that leave roughly two-thirds of LGBTQ Americans, according to the Human Rights Campaign's estimates, vulnerable to getting kicked out of their homes, turned away from school or denied entry to a public space simply because of their sexual or gender identity.\n LGBTQ Americans like me have shed a lot of tears over the last four years, but this week, I was weeping with relief. And, when this avalanche of emotions has subsided, when the pomp and circumstance settles, I'm hopeful we can start to let go of some of the anxiety and pessimism we've been holding onto. Only then can we allow ourselves to fully exhale into something that looks like the future, a brighter spot where our lives matter -- Black and brown, gay and transgender, immigrant and citizen, rich and poor, young and old. We feel the sun on our skin again.",

        "body_text": "Have you seen Joe Biden's tweet??!?!\n Yes, the President of the United States was up and tweeting at 7:45 Friday morning! And man, what a tweet! It was 30-second video clip from Biden's inaugural address on Wednesday, in which the 46th president said that \"with unity we can do great things, important things.\"\n He really tweeted that! DANG!\n This is, of course, a joke. Biden did sent the tweet above. But it's decidedly non-controversial. It's the sort of thing we used to describe as \"presidential\" behavior.\n Which brings me to this: The single most radical thing that Biden has done in his first 48 hours of being president is act totally and completely normally.\n He's signed a series of executive orders rolling back measures put in place by former President Donald Trump. He delivered a speech outlining the specific steps his administration would take to address the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He attended a briefing -- alongside Vice President Kamala Harris -- with his Covid-19 team. His press secretary, Jen Psaki, held press conferences on Wednesday and Thursday in which she answered questions from reporters. Cabinet nominees like Pete Buttigieg took part in their confirmation hearings before the Senate. The Senate haggled over Biden's proposed coronavirus stimulus package.\n It was all so damn normal. That it feels different speaks to the utter radicalization that Trump brought to, literally, every aspect of the presidency.\n Trump seemed bound and determined to undo absolutely every aspect of what it had meant previously to be president. \"My use of social media is not Presidential - it's MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL,\" he tweeted less than six months into his first term. \"Make America Great Again!\"\n Trump embraced the abnormality of his vision for the presidency as proof that he was, in essence, freaking out the squares. The fact that he abdicated the moral leadership that past presidents innately understood to be the core of the job was evidence that he was fighting for the people not the powerful, or something. His lies -- about everything from who was going today for the border wall to who won the 2020 election -- and the resistance they engendered among media fact-checkers in his mind were the necessary response to an establishment that was against him. His off-the-wall-tweets were his way around the media bias that threatened to suffocate conservative thought.\n He had a reason and a rationalization for everything. (Trump is an Olympic-level rationalizer.)\n It's only in the light of the utter normality that Biden has projected over these last two days that you can really see just how not-normal every last bit of the Trump presidency actually was. And how it was all just so totally exhausting. The tweets, the statements, the threats, the bullying, the policy reversals, the tweets (again) -- it all made the country feel like it was sprinting on a treadmill that just kept going incrementally faster. Or that we were all trapped on a bus that was hurtling through the country, unable to slow down. (Come to think of it, that would make a good movie plot!)\n That is not a good way to run a country -- or to live in one.\n The biggest change -- at least for me -- in the earliest days of the Biden administration, then, is the quiet. If Trump was constantly moving, chattering, tweeting and cajoling, Biden aims to present the exact opposite image to the public -- of a man who knows what he is doing and is doing so methodically and carefully.\n Who knew the normal could feel so radical?",

They joined NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who were already on the station after launching in October.\n Both spacewalks will be broadcast live on the NASA website, with coverage beginning each day at 5:30 a.m. ET. The spacewalks are scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. ET and are expected to last for six and a half hours. They will be the 233rd and 234th spacewalks in support of the space station.\n For both spacewalks, Hopkins will wear the spacesuit bearing red stripes as crew member 1 and Hopkins will wear the spacesuit with no stripes as crew member 2.\n The astronauts will focus on completing the installation of Bartolomeo, the newest payload hosting station outside the European Space Agency's Columbus module, on January 27. They will complete antenna and cable rigging to hook up power and data connections.\n The Bartolomeo platform, named after the younger brother of Christopher Columbus, is the first instance of a European commercial partnership that offers a place to conduct science and technology demonstrations outside of the space station, according to the European Space Agency.\n The Columbus module will also be upgraded with a terminal that provides an independent high-bandwidth communication link for European ground stations.\n The astronauts will install the final lithium-ion battery adapter plate on February 1. This installation wraps up work to complete the replacement of aging batteries outside the station that began in January 2017.\n During both spacewalks, Rubins will operate the robotic arm from inside the space station to assist the astronauts as they work outside.\n They will focus on other upgrades, like replacing an external standard camera with a new high-definition camera on the Destiny laboratory, and will replace camera and light assembly components needed for the Japanese robotic arm's camera system, located outside of the Kibo module.\n \"We've been talking about these two EVAs (extra-vehicular activities) for the better part of a year, so we're excited to see them executed,\" said Kenny Todd, deputy manager for the International Space Station Program at NASA during a press conference Friday.\n There are more spacewalks planned for the crew near the end of February and beginning of March.\n Glover and Rubins will pair up for the third spacewalk to prepare the station's power system for installing new solar arrays, which will increase the station's power supply.\n During these long spacewalks, the astronauts go through alternating cycles of day and night every 45 minutes, operating against the hot, bright light of the sun as well as the cold darkness of space. This happens because the space station is orbiting the Earth at 17,500 miles per hour.\n While the astronauts don't feel the direct impacts of extreme cold and heat, there is the potential for a chill, so there are heaters installed in the astronauts' gloves to keep their hands warm, said Vincent Lacourt, spacewalk flight director at NASA for the February 1 spacewalk.",

        "title": "McConnell privately says he wants Trump gone as Republicans quietly lobby him to convict",
        "body_text": "As the House prepares to send articles of impeachment to the Senate on Monday, CNN has learned that dozens of influential Republicans around Washington -- including former top Trump administration officials -- have been quietly lobbying GOP members of Congress to impeach and convict Donald Trump. The effort is not coordinated but reflects a wider battle inside the GOP between those loyal to Trump and those who want to sever ties and ensure he can never run for President again.\n The lobbying started in the House after the January 6 attack on the Capitol and in the days leading up to impeachment. But it's now more focused on Sen. Mitch McConnell, the powerful minority leader who has signaled he may support convicting Trump.\n \"Mitch said to me he wants Trump gone,\" one Republican member of Congress told CNN. \"It is in his political interest to have him gone. It is in the GOP interest to have him gone. The question is, do we get there?\"\n McConnell had proposed delaying the trial until February, but with the articles coming to the Senate on Monday, the process will likely be set in motion sooner. It would take 17 Republicans to join all 50 Democrats in order to convict. While the bar is high, some GOP sources think there is more of an appetite to punish the former President than is publicly apparent.\n \"There were 10 House Republicans who voted for impeachment. There were probably over 150 who supported it,\" said Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman and CNN contributor.\n The ongoing Republican whisper campaign, according to more than a dozen sources who spoke to CNN, is based on a shared belief that a successful conviction is critical for the future of the Republican party. Multiple sources describe this moment as a reckoning for the party.\n \"Trump created a cult of personality that is hard to dismantle,\" said a former senior Republican official. \"Conviction could do that.\"\n The lobbying effort has included behind-the-scenes pressure by Republican donors, calls from former top Trump White House officials, and a set of talking points circulating among Republicans arguing for Trump's impeachment.\n The 9-point memo charges that \"it is difficult to find a more anti-conservative outburst by a U.S. president than Donald Trump the last two months.\" Other points include that Trump \"urged supporters from across the nation to come to Washington, DC, to disrupt\" Congress on January 6 and egged on the crowd, which was \"widely understood to include people who were planning to fight physically, and who were prepared to die in response to his false claims of a 'stolen election.''\n The memo goes on to point out Trump \"tweeted and made other statements against the Vice President as the Secret Service was being forced to rush Mike Pence out of the Senate chamber and into a protective bunker.\" It's unclear how widely disseminated the memo is among Republicans in Washington.\n McConnell is also facing pressure from a faction of Senate Republicans to stick with Trump, with some telling CNN that support for conviction could threaten McConnell's leadership.\n \"No, no, no,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican and Trump ally, told CNN when asked if he could support McConnell if he voted to convict Trump, calling such a vote a \"dangerous precedent\" and adding: \"I don't even think we should be having a trial.\"\n \"If you're wanting to erase Donald Trump from the party, you're going to get erased,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on Fox News Wednesday. \"This idea of moving forward without Donald Trump in the Republican Party is a disaster for the Republican Party.\"\n There have also been public appeals for Republican lawmakers to take action against Trump. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly told CNN if it was up to him, he would vote to remove Trump. Former Attorney General Bill Barr accused the President of \"orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress\" and went on to call his conduct a \"betrayal of his office.\"\n Among some former Trump administration officials, the President's actions around the January 6 riot aroused feelings of disgust.\n \"I almost threw up when I saw the President tweeting against Mike Pence,\" said one former senior Trump official.\n In addition, more than 30 former Republican members of Congress signed a letter urging House members to vote to impeach. At the same time, current and former Senate aides are encouraging their bosses to seriously consider voting to convict.\n And in the days after January 6, a handful of House staffers whose bosses supported Trump resigned, including a senior GOP staffer on the House Armed Services Committee and aides to Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jim Jordan.\n \"A lot of people view this as a fight for the party,\" said one former Republican Hill aide.\n Others are hoping more Senate Republicans will step up.\n \"In the Senate, there is more institutional respect and understanding of the long-term consequences,\" said former Trump administration appointee Gabriel Noronha. \"There is also real resentment of Trump and the damage he has done, and awareness of what this means in the next four to eight years.\"\n Noronha recently made news when he was fired by the White House for a tweet condemning Trump's actions on January 6.\n The consensus among the Republicans who spoke to CNN is that McConnell's decision on conviction will sway others. On Tuesday, in his most forceful comments yet, McConnell tied Trump's actions to the attack itself during a speech on the Senate floor.\n \"The mob was fed lies,\" McConnell said. \"They were provoked by the President and other powerful people. And they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like. But we pressed on.\"\n Since he is known as restrained and deliberate, McConnell's words gave hope to Republicans who would like the party to split from Trump.\n \"I hope Mitch's institutional reverence for the Senate will overcome his natural political caution and will lead him to the conclusion that Trump is in the way of the party's future,\" said the former senior GOP official.\n Other Republican senators who have said they will vote to acquit cite a Jan. 12 op-ed in The Washington Post by former federal judge and conservative legal luminary J. Michael Luttig. Luttig writes an impeachment trial after Trump left office would be unconstitutional.\n \"I think a lot of people would like a reason not to convict,\" said a former Republican Senate staffer.\n But other Republican legal experts are pushing back with GOP senators.\n \"It feels like the weight of the energy in Washington with legal conservatives is pretty strongly in favor of impeachment,\" said Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to the Senate Republican conference who has reached out to senators himself.\n However the fear of reprisal from Trump's allies in the media -- Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham have already criticized McConnell's condemnation of Trump -- and Trump's base may prevail.\n The former senior Republican official who would like to see Trump convicted characterized it as an internal war within the party and expressed pessimism that enough senators would rise to the occasion.\n \"I have learned through sad experience that no one has lost money betting on the seemingly bottomless capacity of congressional R's for self-abasement and cowardice,\" said the former official.\n CNN's Pamela Brown and Manu Raju contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "Childhood sweethearts who were inseparable during their 70 years of marriage died of Covid-19 while holding hands in an Ohio hospital, their family told CNN.\n Dick Meek, 89, and Shirley Meek, 87, passed away within minutes of each other on January 16 at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, the family said.\n \"They never had to go through 'until death do us part,'\" said their daughter Debbie Howell. \"They never had to do that because they were together and we're ever so grateful.\"\n The couple was scheduled for their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on January 19, her dad's 90th birthday. \"They were that close,\" said daughter Vicci Harper.\n The Coschcoton, Ohio, couple met in high school and were together ever since. \"You read love at first sight and you think it's not true,\" said the family. \"Well, it was love at first sight for my dad.\" They celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary on December 22.\n Parents to five children, 13 grandchildren, and 28 great-grandchildren they lived a full life of passion, the family said. Their adventures ranged from traveling the world to skydiving to making appearances at special events for their grandchildren, even in old age. Most importantly, they always made time to be together, having a standing date scheduled for 3 p.m. on each day to toast to each other, according to their obituary.\n \"They weren't your typical 88- and 90-year-old,\" Debbie Howell told CNN. \"They were both very, very healthy, very vibrant people with of all their faculties. They just went down so fast.\"\n The couple tested positive for Covid-19 on December 26 after experiencing symptoms they believed to be a cold. After several days of up-and-down symptoms, they went to an urgent care facility for a Covid test and their health went downhill from there, the family told CNN.\n Dick was admitted to Coshocton Regional Medical Center on January 2 and Shirley followed two days later, said the family. Both experienced difficulty breathing.\n As their condition declined, they needed to be transferred to a second hospital. At the time, there was a chance the two would be transferred to separate hospitals, but the staff helped to advocate that they would both be transferred to Riverside Methodist Hospital.\n \"From January 8 to the end it just kind of went up and down,\" Howell said. \"There were days that we were really optimistic that they were going to get through, but their lungs kept failing more and more each day.\"\n When the care team told the family their parents only had a few more days to live, they asked for their parents to be placed in the same room. \"We didn't want them separated because that was their biggest thing in life that they would be together,\" said Howell.\n \"We wanted them to be holding hands. We wanted them to be together. We wanted their favorite music to be playing softly in the background,\" she told CNN.  And the hospital staff made it happen.\n A nurse made a two-hour playlist of the couple's favorite songs and played them as they held hands for the last time. Shirley was the first to pass, and then Dick.\n \"The nurse put my mom's head on my dad's shoulder. And she walked over and she rubbed my dad's shoulder and said 'Dick, you can go now. Shirley's waiting for you,'\" Howell said. \"And within minutes, he was gone.\"\n The family said they feel lucky that their parents were able to pass hand in hand and thanked the hospital staff for helping them to honor their love story.\n According to Dick and Shirley's obituary, a celebration of their lives will take place this summer. \"Covid took their lives from us, so we beg you all to be safe,\" said the family.",

        "title": "3 reasons Americans need more federal aid",
        "body_text": "Congress has approved trillions in relief funds for Americans suffering because of the pandemic recession, but President Joe Biden thinks the country needs even more.\n Last week, he unveiled a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus plan that he wants to push through Congress, and on Wednesday -- his first day in office -- he signed executive orders that extend eviction protections for renters and payment deferrals for student loan borrowers.\n On Friday, he's set to sign additional executive orders providing more assistance to working families.\n Democrats have made clear that another wide-ranging economic relief bill, including $1,400 stimulus payments, will be their first legislative priority.\n Economists, including Janet Yellen, Biden's pick for treasury secretary, say the additional aid is needed to stop the bleeding before the federal government can try to rebuild the economy. Here are three reasons why:\n During the first week of the year, the number of new people applying for unemployment benefits soared above 900,000 for the first time since August. Claims fell only slightly last week, and they remain at the highest level in months.\n The US economy is down 9.8 million jobs compared with its pre-pandemic level. That's more jobs than were lost in 2008, after the financial crisis.\n Even though a majority of higher-wage workers saw their jobs return by the summer, the unemployment rate for low-wage workers remains stubbornly high.\n Nearly 25% of those workers who were earning less than $27,000 a year remain out of a job, according to Opportunity Insights, a project at Harvard University tracking the recovery. For comparison, the overall unemployment rate is about 6.5%.\n The growing number of Covid cases and deaths, as well as renewed local lockdown measures, are making it harder for businesses to stay afloat.\n The number of small businesses open and operating is down nearly 30% compared with pre-pandemic levels, continuing to fall throughout the autumn.\n Winter weather is making it harder for businesses like restaurants to attract customers to outdoor patios.\n And economists warn that more jobs could be lost in the coming months, despite the vaccine rollout beginning.\n Traditional stimulus programs like one-time direct payments or tax credits aren't as effective when the recession is caused by a public health crisis, said John Friedman, an economics professor at Brown University and a co-director at Opportunity Insights.\n People still won't go out to eat or spend money on other entertainment if they don't feel safe, for example, no matter how much money is in their bank accounts -- and that also means they aren't buying as many new clothes or other items as they might otherwise.\n \"Instead, we need to help those hardest-hit by the pandemic get through the next six to nine months until this public health crisis passes. Then we can get the economy going again,\" Friedman said.\n He pointed to enhanced unemployment aid, food stamp benefits and rental assistance as programs that can provide a stopgap for people right now.\n While Biden has already renewed eviction protections, he'll need Congress to extend federal unemployment benefits and boost food stamps. He's also called on lawmakers to provide money for child care, restore emergency paid leave benefits, create new grants for struggling small businesses and subsidize health insurance premiums for those who have lost their jobs.\n CNN's Anneken Tappe contributed to this report.",

        "title": "White House wants Democrats to be patient on stimulus talks as Biden pushes for bipartisan path, officials say",
        "body_text": "The White House is keenly aware of the Republican objections that have arisen to President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal, but they are urging Democratic allies to be patient for the moment, according to two administration officials.\n Biden has spent the last several days on the phone with lawmakers in both parties, and his team has started a blitz in recent days not only to walk through the proposal with lawmakers and staff, but also listen to their concerns and potential proposed changes.\n One key meeting between National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and a group of 16 bipartisan senators will take place on Sunday. But more are planned -- and Biden himself is expected to be an active player in the days and weeks ahead.\n \"The President has made clear to his team that we should be reaching out to members of Congress from both parties to make the case for the rescue and engage with them and understand their concerns,\" Deese told reporters during a briefing on Friday.\n It all underscores the message from the top -- the preferred route is a bipartisan one, and Biden still believes there is a pathway to at least 10 GOP votes for a relief proposal. What that proposal looks like, however, \"is obviously subject to negotiation,\" one official said. In other words, the $1.9 trillion proposal is an opening bid.\n \"They know they aren't going to get everything in their proposal,\" one Democratic official who has worked on the measure told CNN. \"That's the point here -- it's supposed to be a negotiation.\"\n But growing increasingly antsy about prospects for a bipartisan deal, Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the Covid-19 relief package if Republicans stand in the way, according to multiple Democratic aides.\n While leadership has yet to give the go ahead publicly and negotiations with Republicans are still getting started, aides tell CNN that the process is complicated and arcane, which is why they are getting ready now in case they have to use it.\n \"You just can't do this overnight,\" one Democratic Senate aide said referring to why the process is already starting.\n And more directly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told donors on a Zoom call Thursday that she wanted to pass the Covid relief bill in two weeks using budget reconciliation, a source familiar told CNN.\n While the Biden administration's first goal is to pass its nearly $2 trillion plan with bipartisan support through the regular Senate process, the odds are long for winning over enough Republicans to pass another massive stimulus bill just months after a more than $900 billion package passed the Senate in December. Already, many Republicans have signaled they think the package is too expensive or even unnecessary at this point.\n \"We just passed $900 billion worth of assistance why we would have a package that big now? Maybe a couple of months from now,\" Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said. \"The needs will be evident, and we will need to do something significant. But I'm not seeing it right now.\"\n For their part, the Biden administration has started to meet with Republicans they've identified as potentially supporting the package in an effort to build support.\n \"I had a pretty good walkthrough of their Covid proposal,\" Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is up for reelection in 2022, told reporters earlier this week. \"It was an opportunity for me to ask some questions.\"\n But Biden's team has publicly made clear they aren't willing to \"take any tools off the table\" -- a direct reference to the budget procedure that would allow them to move forward with a simple majority.\n \"It's a moment that requires decisive action to beat this pandemic and support the economic recovery that Americans need,\" Deese said.\n Behind the scenes, lawmakers recognize time is of the essence and are preparing to work through reconciliation if they have to. Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committee have not been shy about talking publicly about their plans.\n \"The caucus would prefer this be done on a bipartisan basis. We haven't made a decision yet to use reconciliation, but we are prepared to move very quickly if it looks like we can't do it any other way,\" Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky and the chairman of the House's Budget Committee, said Thursday.\n Hours later, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, told NBC's Seth Meyers that the first goal was to try to reach out to Republicans, but he argued they couldn't wait for them to come along.\n \"I think we should reach out to Republicans if they choose not to come on board, which I suspect will probably be the case ... we should use that majority in a very aggressive way,\" Sanders said.  \"It is my view we should make sure that we address the needs of the American people in that reconciliation bill, and if we pass it with 51 votes, we'll pass it with 51 votes.\n The first step would be to pass a budget bill through committee to essentially unlock the process. Once that was finished, the Senate Democrats could rework Biden's bill so it fit into a very specific framework of what is allowed under the process. Reconciliation requires that anything passed has a real impact on the budget and not just an \"incidental\" one. The process also requires that proposals have no impact on social security and that the impacts on the budget do not stretch beyond a 10-year window if the changes are permanent. Because the process requires jumping through so many hoops and consultation with the Senate's parliamentarian, committee staff have been working for weeks now to make sure they understand and are ready for the process in case it has to be used.\n \"There's not much room for error,\" another Democratic aide said noting that the committees will have to go point by point through Bidens proposal to see what can fit in reconciliation.\n Republicans used the reconciliation process when they attempted to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017 in the Senate. The GOP  successfully used the process months later to overhaul the country's tax code, which passed with just Republican votes.\n The conversations about reconciliation have been reinvigorated in recent days as Democrats have grown frustrated by the stalled negotiations to organize the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has dug in and insisted that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agree to preserve the filibuster for the next two years. The filibuster protects the minority party in the Senate by requiring that legislation meet a 60-vote procedural threshold before passing. Schumer has argued that policy has never been part of an organizing resolution before, but the issue has delayed the process of setting up committees and passing Biden's nominees.\n There are still questions about what parts of Biden's Covid relief package would be allowed to advance under reconciliation. Some aides have identified that items like the $15 minimum wage could struggle to meet the criteria.\n But White House officials make clear the real negotiation hasn't even started yet -- and that Biden, with decades of legislative work and relationships in the Senate, plans to give it time and space to come to fruition before moving in another direction.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The fate of the economic recovery is riding on President Joe Biden's mission to speed up the lackluster rollout of coronavirus vaccines.\n While the development of vaccines happened faster than many had expected, distribution is lagging behind schedule, in part because of the chaotic presidential transition in the midst of the worst pandemic in a century.\n Biden signed a slew of executive orders this week aimed at accelerating the distribution of vaccines and tests. It's a race against the clock, not just to save lives, but to keep the economy afloat.\n \"We won't see a strong economic rebound until we get broad distribution of the vaccine,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global strategist at Invesco.\n After a sizzling summer, the US economy slowed sharply at the end of last year as the pandemic worsened. The United States lost jobs in December for the first time since the spring. Another 900,000 Americans filed for first-time jobless claims during the final week of the Trump presidency.\n Kevin Hassett, a former economic adviser to President Trump, told CNN Business the US economy is facing a \"negative spiral\" that could cause GDP to contract sharply in the first quarter, just like last year.\n The pandemic has killed more than 400,000 Americans and US health officials are warning the death toll could reach 508,000 by mid-February.\n Rochelle Walensky, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC on Thursday that she doesn't think vaccines will be in every pharmacy in America by February, despite such predictions by Trump officials. Biden's goal is to distribute 100 million doses in the first 100 days \u2014 and the CDC official said that is still the plan.\n The timing is critical because health restrictions and voluntary steps by Americans are crushing virus-sensitive parts of the economy, especially the service sector.\n As shown by the CNN Business Recovery Dashboard, box office sales, domestic air travel and hotel occupancy all remain well below pre-crisis levels.\n Millions of people whose jobs relied on restaurants, bars, hair salons, dry cleaners, movie theaters, cruise lines, hotels and countless other industries are out of work. The Back-to-Normal Index, designed by CNN Business and Moody's Analytics, shows the US economy is operating at just 81% of where it was in early March.\n \"The next leg of the recovery has to be driven by the service sector. Without it, we are going to stall out,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \"You can't have a reopening of the service sector without putting the pandemic behind us.\"\n George Harman, a Winchester, Virginia, father of two, has sharply cut back on spending since going on unpaid leave from his job at a car dealership in early December. Harman stopped working because he feared getting his elderly parents who live with him sick.\n \"I could physically go to work, but is it worth dying or infecting someone in my house?\" said Harman, who has a history of heart disease.\n Like countless other Americans, Harman is not eligible for unemployment and is running low on cash.\n \"The vaccine has got to get here,\" he said. \"If I can get my parents vaccinated, I can risk it at that point. But I can't go into a place that I know has rampant spread of the virus and then take it home.\"\n Biden plans to sign a series of executive orders Friday aimed at helping those in need, including a step that could help people in a similar situation as Harman. The White House said Biden will ask the Department of Labor to consider clarifying that workers who refuse unsafe working conditions can still receive unemployment insurance.\n While executive orders will help, Biden needs Congress to pass legislation that would have a much bigger impact. Biden is asking lawmakers to pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Package, which calls for $1,400 stimulus checks to most everyone who makes less than $75,000, enhanced unemployment benefits, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments and $400 billion to defeat the pandemic.\n Harman is hoping Congress acts \u2014 before he runs out of cash.\n \"We don't like to go trillions and trillions in debt, but you're facing a once-in-a-hundred-years situation. You've got to do what is necessary,\" he said.\n Although some economists and Republicans are worried about the size of Biden's proposal, Hassett, the former Trump economist, told CNN Business he broadly supports the $1.9 trillion package.\n Markowska, the Jefferies economist, said the rescue effort will help but it won't solve the underlying problem.\n \"We've pushed the recovery as far as we can without the service sector. Without it, we just can't make progress \u2014 regardless of how much fiscal stimulus we put out there,\" she said.\n At least so far, Wall Street is unfazed by the surging pandemic and sluggish vaccine rollout. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished at record highs Thursday, building on what was the best Election Day to Inauguration Day performance in the post-World War II era.\n That's because markets are being juiced by emergency policies from the Federal Reserve that are forcing investors to bet on stocks. And investors are optimistic that the economy and corporate profits will fully recover, eventually.\n \"I don't think it matters to markets,\" said Invesco's Hooper, \"but it definitely matters to the economy.\"",

        "title": "Experts say Biden administration's vaccine strategy could benefit from good timing",
        "body_text": "As President Joe Biden takes steps to try to ramp up vaccine production, experts say the biggest boon to his administration's vaccine strategy could simply be good timing.\n The President on Thursday directed federal agencies to use \"all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act\" to boost vaccine supply, but experts tell CNN that Biden's team may be positioned for success even if it does relatively little, as the administration absorbs a flawed vaccine-distribution effort but at the same moment manufacturers hit a stride and states work out the kinks in their own distribution plans.\n \"They're going to take advantage of the learning curve,\" said Vijay Samant, a former Merck executive who oversaw the production of three successful vaccines during his tenure. Samant said vaccine manufacturers have had months to work out supply bottlenecks and that manufacturing was always projected to speed up in the coming months -- a boon for the Biden administration.\n \"They may get a lot of credit because all of a sudden vaccine doses are going to become available and it's, 'Oh, well, we did it,' \" Samant said. \"Let me tell you, that's how it works. They're on the right end of the curve.\"\n Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, sounded similarly optimistic Thursday, predicting that vaccine supply will rapidly increase in February and March. The governor was fresh off a call with Pfizer, during which the company \"reiterated their plan to significantly ramp up production in February,\" said the governor's spokesman Max Reiss. Much of that ramp-up is taking place even before the Biden administration makes any moves under the Defense Production Act.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to agree with the assessment Thursday.\n In an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Biden's chief medical adviser expressed confidence in the President's once seemingly far-reaching goal to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days.\n \"I feel fairly confident that that's going to be not only that but maybe even better,\" Fauci said, adding that he had looked at the contractual agreements that had been made. \"The amount that will be coming in, we will be able to meet that goal.\"\n Still, questions remain about where US vaccine supply currently stands. The new administration has touted robust federal plans to launch huge vaccination sites and deploy mobile units to hard-hit communities, at the same time some states are canceling appointments at existing vaccination sites, citing a lack of vaccine supply.\n Biden's team has said it's flying somewhat blind when it comes to the supply of vaccine and how it has been allocated across the country. A source close to the transition told CNN that the Biden team had been denied access to critical resources it needed to accurately gauge the supply and prepare to take over the rollout before Biden took office.\n \"The cooperation or lack of cooperation funds from the Trump administration has been an impediment,\" White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters. \"So we don't have the visibility that we would hope to have into supply and allocations.\"\n To be sure, there's still not nearly enough vaccine available -- in the US or worldwide -- and the US has stumbled at getting shots into arms quickly. But the Biden administration also appears to be trying to manage expectations, playing up the shambles the Trump administration left behind while figuring out what concrete steps it can take to improve vaccine manufacturing and distribution.\n The Biden administration has not clearly articulated what it's doing to immediately improve vaccine supply, except to task agencies with looking for opportunities to use the Defense Production Act.\n Biden \"absolutely remains committed to invoking the Defense Production Act in order to get the supply and the materials needed to get the vaccine out to Americans across the country and remains committed to his goal of getting 100 million shots in the arms of Americans in the first 100 days,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.\n The White House did not address how they would be communicating or working with states, but in a statement to CNN spokesman Kevin Munoz reiterated that they would be \"listening to the unique needs of states and tailoring the federal government's resources and guidance accordingly to ensure we are getting vaccines in the arms of Americans as quickly and safely as possible.\"\n White House officials said they have asked the Department of Health and Human Services to look for all potential sources of a type of syringe that can help extract more doses of the Pfizer vaccine from each vial. On Thursday, Biden said he would sign an executive order to use the Defense Production Act to direct federal agencies and private industries to \"accelerate the making of everything that's needed to protect, test, and vaccinate and the care of our people.\"\n A former administration official told CNN that the Trump administration had already implemented the Defense Production Act to assist each of the six vaccine manufacturers, as well as on needle and syringe contracts.\n \"We'll be working paying close and careful attention to all of the components of the supply chain to ensure manufacturing keeps up with what we need,\" Tim Manning, the White House Covid supply coordinator, told reporters. \"The Defense Production Act is a powerful tool -- powerful set of tools -- and there are many ways we can use it to help ensure that there are adequate and growing supplies of vaccine.\"\n Samant, the vaccine expert, said the administration would be better off focusing on the availability of raw materials like lipids rather than specialized syringes.\n \"It's like the most ridiculous thing to chase after,\" Samant said of ramping up syringe production, adding that such a move might, at best, improve vaccine supply by 5%.\n For the Biden team, it's critical to understand how much supply is on hand and how much could realistically be available in the coming months. States have said they need clear and consistent guidance on vaccine supply so they can continue to streamline their vaccination programs.\n \"We will work to provide projections on supply. We hear over and over from governors and local leaders that they just don't know what supply is coming and can't plan. We will absolutely across the next few days to get our arms around what's going on, make sure that we are communicating with states and localities, so they can prepare, effectively,\" Zients added.\n According to one health official involved in the vaccine distribution process, hospitals receiving the Moderna vaccine complained of being completely in the dark on when they were receiving it and how much they were getting and, in some cases, were sent scrambling when they received surprise shipments. Moderna declined to comment.\n All these problems are now landing squarely in the lap of the new administration.\n Some state officials said they're already concerned about what the administration's plan will be to allocate vaccines and communicate with states.\n Under the previous administration, then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Covid task force held regular calls with the nation's governors during most of the pandemic. While some governors found the calls largely useless, they could at least rely on the briefings as an opportunity to hear from high-ranking medical experts and ask questions of the administration.\n A day after Biden took office, state officials told CNN there is still a lot of confusion as to how states will be working and communicating with the Biden administration as the pandemic continues to surge and vaccine distribution is woefully behind.\n According to one Republican state official, the National Governors Association has reached out to some of its governors about working with the Biden administration on Covid. However, not all governors are members of the organization and it remains unclear how the administration plans to work with those outside the association.\n A Democratic state official said they, too, had not had any regular communication with the new administration.\n Dr. Bechara Choucair, the White House vaccinations coordinator, has been in touch with some governors but had not laid out how the administration would tackle vaccine allocations.\n Biden said Thursday that each state would be assigned a liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n But in a news briefing Thursday, Psaki couldn't offer any more specifics on how the Biden administration will improve communications with states.\n The new Covid team, she said, \"will be engaging with governors, Democrats and Republicans, mayors, local elected officials, to gain a better understanding of what's happening on the ground.\"",

        "title": "Trump may be gone, but the instruments of information warfare that empowered him remain",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump might no longer be in office, but the information infrastructure he exploited to ascend to the Oval Office and then exert a firm grip over the Republican Party is still largely in place. During Trump's 2016 run for office and throughout his presidency, the focus was mostly on spotlighting the lies he told and the conspiracy theories he promoted. And to be clear, that was important work.\n But the conversation should \u2014 and, frankly, needs \u2014 to go deeper than that. Trump was only one person who took advantage of the existing instruments in place to wage information warfare on his political opponents and critics in the media. Yes, he's now out of office. But those instruments he used to amass power still remain out on the battlefield ready for another aspiring candidate to come along, pick up, and use for their own benefit.\n These tools include right-wing cable channels, talk-radio, hyper-partisan news websites, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In the wake of the domestic terrorism that took place on Capitol Hill earlier this month, some of these platforms have made some tweaks that have helped curb the spread of disinformation. But if you speak to experts, most aren't convinced that these tweaks are enough. And elsewhere in the information economy, such as on Fox News, nothing has fundamentally changed.\n The country saw earlier this month what can happen when these tools are wielded by a political leader with no shame and only ambition. And it saw over the last few years how these instruments can be used to launch an unrelenting assault on the truth. Focusing on individual politicians who use these instruments to lie and mislead is important, but it misses the larger issue. And until that issue is addressed, and a serious national conversation is had, we should fully expect to see what happened earlier this month and over the last few years repeat itself in the future.\n Over at Vanity Fair, Joe Pompeo's latest story was all about the news media's shift toward covering domestic extremism. Pompeo pointed out, \"The radicalization that was laid bare at the Capitol two weeks ago isn't going to just disappear. There will be more demonstrations, more violence, more conspiracy theories coursing through the dark corners of the web. Homegrown extremism, catalyzed by the hypernationalistic and reality-resistant fervor of the Donald Trump presidency, has effectively gone mainstream, and the media is confronting that reality head-on.\"\n \"It's a big story, and it will be a bigger story,\" WaPo managing editor Cameron Barr told Pompeo. \"We've seen rising momentum. We've seen that these issues, and in some cases these actions, have gained urgency and much greater prominence.\" Pompeo also spoke with CNN's Elle Reeve. \"I can't predict the future, I can only tell you when I feel like things are significantly escalating,\" she said, adding that she does believe extremism has gone mainstream.\n \"Only hours after gaining full control of Congress, House Democrats are going after Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for the platforms' perceived roles in inciting violence at the Capitol earlier this month,\" The Verge's Makena Kelly reported Thursday. \"In letters addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, Reps. Anna Eshoo and Tom Malinowski, along with dozens of other members, called for the companies to make sweeping changes to their platforms to curb violent and extremist activity on their networks.\"\n While Big Tech certainly deserves to face questions for helping to radicalize untold numbers of Americans, other platforms that disseminate disinformation and conspiracy theories for profit really shouldn't be left without scrutiny. That includes channels like Fox News, Newsmax, and OAN. But it also includes TV providers that willfully deliver such channels into the living rooms of millions and companies such as Premiere Networks that distributes shows from dishonest talk-radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh.",

Follow him on his website at Tmooresports.com. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nI'll miss the wisdom.\n Goodness knows, Hank was deeper than baseball. No sports journalist ever spoke to Henry Louis Aaron more than me, and if I were guessing, we chatted significantly more times during the last 40 years than 755, the number of balls he ripped over Major League Baseball fences to become the game's legitimate home run king. Now he is gone, just two weeks shy of his 87th birthday.\n There were the old-school lessons from Herbert and Estella Aaron, his parents in Mobile, Alabama.\n Then there was this: Hank idolized everything about Jackie Robinson, the civil rights activist disguised for most of us as a Baseball Hall of Famer. He later huddled with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an occasional visitor to his locker after the Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta in 1966.\n I'll miss the humor.\n That's because Hank smiled easily. Nothing covered dark days with sunshine faster than his contagious laugh, often coming out of nowhere.\n I'll miss the humanity.\n Whether it was the work Hank did with his wife, Billye, through their Chasing The Dream Foundation to help gifted youth with scholarships, or just the way he never turned down a request for an autograph or a handshake, he was the most humble sports legend I ever saw.\n Hank also could play a little. He did so for 23 Major League seasons through 1976, all the way to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He mostly wore Braves uniforms before he finished his last couple of years as peerless in the game's history after he returned to Milwaukee, but only with the Brewers.\n He became a Braves executive after that. As their farm director during the mid-to-late 1980s, he acquired much of the talent for the franchise's record run in the 1990s and beyond to 14 consecutive division titles, five National League pennants and a World Series title.\n Sometimes, Hank wondered why folks didn't mention his role during that stretch, but then came that smile.\n Then the laugh.\n I'll miss our conversations.\n Just a month or so ago, we discussed writing a book.\n There were plenty of things this great slugger and even greater person never mentioned about the death threats, the hate mail and the unprecedented racism hurled his way during the early 1970s. Back then, he was racing as a Black man toward shattering the career record 714 homers of Babe Ruth, the Great White Hope for an entire generation.\n \"I thought I was doomed, you know, but when I got in the batter's box, I never thought about anything but baseball,\" Hank told me during that December conversation, when he added for the first time that in some of the letters writers said they were kidnappers planning to snatch his children.\n \"The good Lord took care of me in that regard,\" Hank continued. \"If it hadn't been for Him, I don't know what I would have done. Outside of myself, when it comes to going after a record, nobody else had to go through those kinds of things.\"\n Nobody. Not anybody else who did immortal things with their bat, glove, legs or arms.\n Not Pete Rose, when he passed Ty Cobb for baseball's all-time hits record during the 1980s. Not Cal Ripken, when he bested Lou Gehrig during the 1990s as the game's iron man of baseball in consecutive games played.\n Hank paused during our chat last month, adding, \"When I think back to those years, yes. I'm disgusted by the things that happened to me.\"\n He rarely showed it.\n Even though Hank kept most of his bitterness toward baseball from his playing days to himself, he wasn't afraid to blast the game as a Braves executive.\n I know, as a sports journalist who has spent his last 36 years in Atlanta, where Hank talked, and I listened.\n Then I wrote.\n Then I wrote some more.\n I wrote about Hank ripping baseball for not having any Black general managers or managers for the longest time before teams hired only a few here, and I wrote about the number of African American players dwindling in the game through the decades to less than 8% these days.\n Hank once told me the catalyst for his outspokenness regarding baseball came on October 24, 1972.\n That's the day Jackie Robinson died.\n Afterward, Hank said he called other iconic Black baseball players of that time and he told them, \"Now that Jackie isn't around anymore, it's up to us to pick up the torch and follow in his footsteps for social justice in baseball and everywhere else.\"\n Hank said he told them that if they didn't step up, \"I'll just do it myself.\"\n And did Hank ever.\n I'll miss Hank, period.",

Most Americans don't know when or where they can get a vaccine, including older Americans who are already eligible to get a vaccine in a growing number of states,\" KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said.\n The report, based on surveys conducted from January 11-18 with 1,563 adults, suggests Americans are experiencing a range of emotions from the vaccine rollout. Half of the people surveyed said they are \"frustrated,\" a third said they felt \"confused,\" and nearly a quarter are \"angry.\"\n Of the essential workers interviewed that have yet to be inoculated, the survey found that 55% said they have enough information about where to get a vaccine. But 55% do not have enough information regarding the timing of their eligibility.\n Additionally, 21% of health care workers interviewed who have not been vaccinated said they don't have enough information about when to obtain vaccines.\n The report finds Black, Hispanic and lower-income adults are among the groups least informed. At least 6 in 10 say they don't have enough information about vaccination locations, and at least two-thirds say that they do not have enough information about when they can get vaccinated.\n About half (48%) of the public surveyed expects vaccine distribution to \"get better\" under Biden's administration, while most others expect the situation to \"stay about the same\" (36%). Relatively few (12%) expect distribution to \"get worse,\" the survey stated.\n Overall, in spite of the issues with distribution so far, two-thirds of those surveyed remain \"optimistic\" about vaccinations in the US.\n Respondents were less pleased with the efforts of local officials. Regardless of personal politics, most of the survey participants \u2014 60% \u2014 rated their state government's performance on vaccines as fair or poor.",

        "body_text": "The State Department has initiated a review of the Trump administration's decision to designate Yemen's Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), a spokesperson told CNN Friday.\n It is a swift move by the newly installed Biden administration to examine one of the most consequential 11th hour actions taken by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who announced the decision less than two weeks before leaving, with the designation going into effect just a day before the inauguration on Wednesday.\n \"As noted by Secretary-Designate (Antony) Blinken, the State Department has initiated a review of Ansarallah's terrorist designations,\" the spokesperson said.\n Blinken, President Joe Biden's pick for secretary of state, said at his nomination hearing Tuesday that his \"deep concern about the designation that was made is that at least on its surface it seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Houthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table, while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it.\"\n He told lawmakers that he would propose to review it \"immediately.\"\n The foreign terrorist organization designation was swiftly condemned by humanitarian organizations, diplomats, and bipartisan members of Congress who fear it could further inflame the situation on the ground, upend UN peace talks, and exacerbate the country's humanitarian crisis.\n The State Department spokesperson told CNN that they \"will not publicly discuss or comment on internal deliberations regarding that review.\n \"However, with the humanitarian crisis in Yemen we are working as fast as we can to conduct the review and make a determination,\" they said.\n Yemen has been embroiled in a years-long civil war that has pitted a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, a Shia political and military organization from the north of Yemen. The conflict has cost thousands of civilian lives and plunged the country into a humanitarian crisis.\n The State Department spokesperson said that they \"strongly believe that Ansarallah\" -- another name for the Houthis -- \"needs to change its behavior,\" adding that it \"bears significant responsibility for the humanitarian catastrophe and insecurity in Yemen.\"\n \"At the same time, we must also ensure that we are not impeding the provision of humanitarian assistance,\" they said.\n Pompeo said in his statement announcing the designation that the United States was \"planning to put in place measures to reduce their impact on certain humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen.\"\n \"We have expressed our readiness to work with relevant officials at the United Nations, with international and non-governmental organizations, and other international donors to address these implications,\" he said.\n However, humanitarian organizations and lawmakers expressed serious concerns that the measures would not be sufficient.\n Mercy Corps CEO Tjada D'Oyen said the Trump administration's designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization would \"undermine the overstretched humanitarian response in Yemen, threatening the lives of millions of Yemenis who rely on humanitarian assistance.\"\n The head of the International Rescue Committee called the decision \"pure diplomatic vandalism.\"\n \"This policy, in the name of tying up the Houthis, will actually tie up the aid community and international diplomacy. The opposite is needed -- effective pressure on all parties to the conflict to cease using civilians as hostages in their war games,\" David Miliband said.\n The spokesperson said the US \"will continue to support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in bringing the parties to a political consensus.\"\n \"Our focus is on supporting a comprehensive political agreement that will end the conflict and resolve the dire humanitarian situation,\" they said.\n In his nomination hearing Tuesday, Blinken told lawmakers that the Biden administration intends to end its support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen.\n \"The President-elect has made clear that we will end our support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen. And I think we will work on that in very short order once the President-elect is President for the reasons that you cited,\" Blinken said.\n Asked what ending that support looks like, the nominee for top US diplomat said, \"it looks like, first and foremost, making sure we understand exactly what support we are actually currently providing and which we need to look at, and then withdrawing that support.\"\n \"But I want make clear, I think we have to be in close contact with Saudi Arabia, with our partner there. We need to be very clear about what we are doing, why we are doing something and talk it through,\" Blinken said. \"But the main point is that for reasons that we have discussed we believe that continuing that support is not the national interest.\"",

        "body_text": "Virtual workouts have become increasingly popular due to Covid-19 restrictions. Online sessions allow you to bring your workout with you wherever you are, a convenience hitting the gym can't offer. However, without an in-person trainer or fitness instructor by your side, it can be easy to misinterpret the proper form for a new move.\n In many group classes or workouts, the instructor keeps his or her eye on you and yells out corrections or modifications. Or maybe you're used to fitness equipment, like an elliptical or an ab machine, that keeps your form somewhat honest.\n When it comes to virtual workouts, though, all you've got is you and your body without much to keep you in check. To enhance success in the world of virtual fitness, there are a few factors to take into consideration. First, make sure you are immersed in the workout. Those who exercise with a virtual coach are more motivated and present throughout their workout than those who work out on their own, studies have shown.\n Dedication to improving yourself also helps. Intrinsic motivation, which involves doing something without knowledge of a reward, improves performance and efficiency levels, according to research. If you remain motivated throughout the virtual workout, you'll be more likely to double-check each move for accuracy.\n Even so, there are some common exercises that can all too easily be done with incorrect form and lead to unnecessary pain, improper muscle build and even injury. So what are some key mistakes to look out for? Read on to find out.\n The new year is a perfect time to start prioritizing your health, and virtual workouts are a great way to start. With the challenge of not having an in-person trainer, however, be mindful to adhere to proper form and vigilant about tackling mistakes as they arise. Next time you're performing your virtual workout, keep these tips in mind. If you remain motivated to improve, you'll find yourself becoming more aware of your own mistakes.\n Stephanie Mansour, host of \"Step It Up With Steph\" on PBS, is a health and wellness journalist and a consultant and weight loss coach for women.",

        "body_text": "Construction on an enormous trench across Libya, dug by Russian-backed mercenaries Wagner, is raising fears that foreign fighters will not withdraw from the country by Saturday, as a UN-brokered peace deal insists.\n US officials are also concerned over the long-term goals of the Kremlin ally in the war-torn state. One intelligence official notes that the trench is a sign that Wagner, which, the official said, has its largest global presence in Libya, is \"settling in for the long haul.\"\n The trench, which extends dozens of kilometers south from the populated coastal areas around Sirte towards the Wagner-controlled stronghold of al-Jufra, can be seen on satellite imagery and is bolstered by a series of elaborate fortifications.\n CNN has contacted the Russian government for comment and received no response.\n A simmering conflict has split Libya for months, with the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital Tripoli, backed by Turkey, in an enduring stalemate against the Libya National Army (LNA) in the East, led by General Khalifa Haftar and backed by Russia and the United Arab Emirates.\n The trench and fortifications appear designed to impede or stop a land attack on LNA controlled areas in the east, running through the populated coastal areas of Libya that have seen the most clashes since the 2011 fall of the regime of Moammar Gadhafi.\n The GNA have posted images of excavators and trucks creating the ditch and berm that runs alongside it and said that work appeared ongoing as recently as this month.\n The trench, the US intelligence official said, is another reason \"we see no intent or movement by either Turkish or Russian forces to abide by the UN-brokered agreement. This has the potential to derail an already fragile peace process and ceasefire. It will be a really difficult year ahead.\"\n Open-source monitoring says it has mapped a series of more than 30 defensive positions dug into the desert and hillsides that stretch for about 70 kilometres.\n Satellite imagery from Maxar, seems to show both the trench stretching along a main road, and the fortifications dug, also by Wagner mercenaries and their contractors.\n Images show a build-up of defenses around the Jufra airbase, and also the Brak airfield further south, where apparent radar defenses have been installed and fortified.\n Salaheddin Al-Namroush GNA Defense Minister, said to CNN: \"I don't think anyone digging a trench today and making these reinforcements is leaving anytime soon.\"\n Claudia Gazzini, from the International Crisis Group, told CNN the trench was \"indeed worrying,\" and that talk of it \"has been circulating between diplomats for the past few weeks. It is ongoing and would suggest Moscow is keen to cement its presence in Libya.\"\n Analysts have said the Kremlin is keen to boost its military presence and influence in the Mediterranean, along NATO's southern underbelly, with the added bonus of involvement in and profit from Libya's oil industry.\n Gazzini added there were repeated reports that both sides continued to maintain and build a presence of foreign mercenaries, with the GNA also accused of boosting its supplies of military equipment, under a public deal with Turkey to support its armed forces.\n The US intelligence official said the number of mercenaries on both the GNA and LNA sides was relatively consistent: An estimated 10,000 were in currently Libya, according to a September  AFRICOM report on the issue.\n The Libyan deployment of about 2,000 Wagner foreign mercenaries -- thought to be mostly Russian or former Soviet Union nationals -- is the private military company's largest worldwide, the US official said.\n A spokesman for the LNA, Major General Khaled al-Mahjoub, confirmed the existence of the trenches to CNN, but described them as \"temporary\" sand barriers and trenches, in \"an open area... for defense and fighting.\" He denied the presence of 2,000 Wagner mercenaries, and said there were consultants \"announced a long time ago.\"\n But, a confidential UN report in June, obtained by CNN described the Wagner fighters as \"an effective force multiplier.\"\n Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that there were no Russians in Libya, but if there are they are not representing Russia.  Russia has always denied it uses mercenaries to fight for it.\n Despite an arms embargo, UN inspectors recorded dozens of Russian flights into Libya throughout 2020.\n The US Africa Command publicly called Russia out for the expansion, saying it was similar to actions in Syria.\n In June, the head of the defense committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament, Viktor Bondarev, said the US claim was \"stupidity\" and suggested they were old Soviet planes from somewhere else in Africa.\n A western diplomat with knowledge of arms movements into Libya said Russian flights into the country had dropped from their peak of 93 in August down to just over a dozen monthly at the end of 2020.\"  They're just sustaining on the ground,\" he said, adding that Turkey was flying in similar numbers.\n Turkey's military is open about its desire for a permanent presence, posting images of its military giving the GNA \"Base Defence Training\" in the past week.\n \"It's a comprehensive effort,\" said the US official. \"They're constructing facilities, bringing in personnel and equipment. They've got the HAWK air defense missile batteries, 3D [KALAKAN] radar.\"\n Satellite imagery of the al-Khoms port shows minor modifications that suggest it may be being readied for a longer-term Turkish naval presence, which the GNA's al-Namroush has denied.\n A senior Turkish security official told CNN they \"continue to offer military training, cooperation and advice...according to the GNA's needs and demands.\"\n The thousands of Syrian mercenaries that Turkey has flown into and supported in Libya have been used elsewhere too, the US intelligence official revealed. During Turkey's support for the Azerbaijani government during their recent conflict with Armenia, planes carried hundreds of Syrian mercenaries to Azerbaijan, to assist Turkey's ally in their war with Armenia, the US official said.\n \"It did appear that there was some movement of some of the Syrian mercenary forces in the direction of the conflict in [Nagorno Karabakh]. Smaller numbers, in the lower hundreds,\" the official added.\n The Russian-backed Wagner forces are intended to provide Moscow with influence but not liability, analysts said. Jalel Harchaoui, a senior fellow at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said Wagner mercenary forces were \"by definition disposable\" -- and a \"force that does not exist, according to the official version of the Russian state. It doesn't mean it's not formidable, fearsome and fairly effective,\" but that it provides the greatest flexibility for the Kremlin.\n Gazzini added: \"Russian policy in Libya is opaque -- what Russia wants to do. From evidence on the ground, it sounds like they want to consolidate their influence, or want to find a way out.\"\n Yet the US official added the Russian build-up amounted now to significant personnel and advanced equipment, but one that presented ethical concerns. \"Fourth generation fighter jets and Pantsir missile systems are being operated by a less capable, poorly-trained Wagner mercenaries,\" the official said.\n \"There are complex challenges in Libya, including al Qaeda and ISIS, and mercenaries with their poor level of training, experience, and lack of respect for human rights and international law, make those weapons systems in those hands the most concerning.\"\n While the Wagner presence and trench seems to convey an advantage for the LNA's head General Haftar, the Russian presence seems more geared to Moscow's agenda, than the support of Haftar, analysts said.\n The Western diplomat said Haftar needed a continued conflict in Libya to maintain relevance. \"He becomes irrelevant overnight if the conflict finishes,\" said the diplomat. \"And it if does not finish on his terms he becomes vulnerable to war crimes allegations etcetera.\"",

        "title": "Covid-19 is causing ambulance delays and longer ER waits -- even for those without coronavirus",
        "body_text": "Imagine suffering a serious accident and calling 911 but not getting an ambulance immediately.\n Or having a severe asthma attack and fighting for every breath but having to wait an extra minute or two for help.\n The winter Covid-19 surge has been the worst surge of this pandemic in the US. And it's impacting patients who don't even have coronavirus by increasing ambulance response times and ER wait times.\n \"As resources get stretched thin, it just takes longer to respond,\" said Shawn Baird, president of the American Ambulance Association.\n While some parts of the country are experiencing more delays than others, many places are seeing delays of \"two or three minutes over target times. Those tend to be averages,\" Baird said.\n \"When you're responding to a time-sensitive emergency, like cardiac arrest or stroke or severe shortness of breath, diabetic emergencies -- a whole host of things that are not Covid-related, but you need someone timely -- a few minutes can make a real difference in the outcome,\" he said.\n \"If the current rate of surge continues, I would think we're within just days or weeks of significant time delays.\"\n It's difficult for Americans to understand that if they seek immediate care, they may or may not get it now, said Dr. Ryan Stanton, a board member of the American College of Emergency Physicians.\n \"As Americans, we assume we always have access to care. We assume that the challenges of Covid are going to hit other people -- not us,\" said Stanton, an emergency physician in Kentucky.\n \"We're now at that precipice that we warned about, that if we lose enough access, it's going to be access for everybody. And we could lose lives. We could have permanent damage.\"\n At Stanton's hospital in Lexington, \"the Covid floor has spilled over to the entire hospital,\" he said.\n That influx can mean delays for anyone with mild or moderate emergencies. On good days, those patients have little to no delay in getting the care they need. But sometimes, \"you may have to wait for three or four hours,\" Stanton said.\n \"There are areas of the country and communities where that wait is significantly if not several times longer.\"\n And when hospitals get overwhelmed, \"that totally adds to the problem that emergency ambulances face,\" said Baird, the ambulance association president.\n There are two major impacts on the ambulance system, he said.\n First, \"we often have to call around and verify which hospitals may be already at capacity or on divert,\" meaning their resources are maxed out and they can't take any more patients, Baird said. So that ties up ambulances.\n Then, once an ambulance crew finds a hospital with space and resources, \"we have to be able to transfer care to the ER team.\"\n Previously, those transfers took no more than 15 minutes. \"Now it's taking hours in some areas,\" Baird said.\n \"In fact, I talked to an ambulance service in Visalia, California, (on Monday) morning -- American Ambulance there -- and they're now deploying EMT and paramedic teams just to be stationed at the hospital to sit with ambulance patients that come in,\" he said.\n \"One paramedic might have three or four patients that are arriving by ambulance. They're monitoring outside the ER for up to hours before they can get admitted into the ER. But they have to be able to send their ambulances back out to answer other emergency calls. So they're actually deploying their EMTs to basically work in a triage tent outside the hospital doors.\"\n In the Birmingham, Alabama, area, Regional Paramedic Services has been transferring patients from local hospitals to out-of-state hospitals hundreds of miles away due to a lack of available beds and the need to increase bed availability.\n \"This takes ambulances several hours per patient to accomplish, stressing the medics and system,\" Baird said.\n In Muskogee County, Oklahoma, a medic has been assigned to work full-time at a hospital to attend to patients arriving by ambulance so the ambulance can respond to other 911 calls as the medic waits for a hospital bed to open up, Baird said.\n And in hard-hit Los Angeles County, some ambulances with patients on board have waited for hours outside hospitals because they're out of space.\n \"We are waiting two to four hours minimum to a hospital, and now we are having to drive even further ... then wait another three hours,\" EMT Jimmy Webb told CNN affiliate KCAL.\n Since the current Covid-19 surge started around Thanksgiving, the number of 911 calls has increased about 20% to 30%, said Dr. Marianne Gausche-Hill, medical director of the Los Angeles County EMS Agency.\n \"We are seeing a large increase in cardiac arrests throughout the pandemic, especially during surge activity,\" she told CNN in an email. \"It is unclear if this is due to STEMI (heart attack) patients not seeking care or a primary additional impact of COVID.\"\n This month, Gausche-Hill wrote a memo to EMS crews saying some adult cardiac arrest patients shouldn't be taken to a hospital if they can't be resuscitated after 20 minutes of CPR.\n If the patient has no signs of breathing or a pulse, EMS will try to resuscitate the patient for at least 20 minutes. If the patient is stabilized during that time, they would then be taken to a hospital.\n But if no pulse is restored, paramedics will not take the patient to the hospital.\n The guidance isn't very different from how EMS previously handled cardiac arrest patients, Gausche-Hill said. In fact, many medics across the country have followed similar practices, Stanton said.\n Still, the decision on whether to transport a patient is not easy, said Los Angeles County EMT Michael Diaz.\n \"It's gotten to the point if somebody has coronavirus specifically, we're just basically giving them 20 minutes. And if they're not viable after 20 minutes, we're making a rough decision,\" Diaz said.\n Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies are often on site and stay behind to console family members and call the coroner, he said.\n In his 11 years as an EMT, Diaz said, \"I've never seen anything like this.\"\n When ambulance systems get overwhelmed in one community, \"the system is designed to be able to borrow from the next neighboring county,\" Baird said.\n But with this Covid-19 surge, \"the emergency (is) happening everywhere. And happening simultaneously.\"\n \"There's no mutual aid to turn to. They're all facing the same emergency we are,\" Baird said.\n \"Ultimately that can lead to longer response times. It can lead to a triaging of what gets a response versus what may not get a response.\"\n For those suffering a heart attack or stroke, every minute is critical.\n \"If you're having a stroke, and you might have some left-sided disability or inability to speak or swallow, if we get you to a stroke center that can undertake the right intervention, within the exact number of prescribed minutes, that can be alleviated,\" Baird said.\n \"Or if we can't, that can be a permanent disability.\"\n The greatest impact on young people can be delayed responses to car crashes and other unexpected trauma.\n \"Typically people in their teens and 20s, trauma is the No. 1 reason we see them. And that could be in a car accident. It could be that you're partying with friends and the deck falls in. There are alcohol-related incidents,\" Baird said.\n \"If we're stressed and can't respond to calls, it's every kind of call that we're going to be delayed on,\" he said.\n \"I think young people tend to think they're invincible. But I suspect most of them can think of a situation where they either directly or know of a friend who had a serious accident, or something happened. ... And imagine, 'Well what if I had to wait twice as long to get an ambulance? And I was bleeding on the side of the road?' And that is a reality people need to be thinking about.\"\n Another reality check: \"We've definitely transported many, many people in their 30s and 40s who have to be ventilator-supported. Which is really something that I think young folks just can't imagine happening to someone their age,\" Baird said.\n Some lower priority calls might not get an ambulance transport at all, he said.\n For example, someone who had a simple fall may get \"referred to a call center with a medical expert online -- a paramedic or nurse who can talk to a patient on a lower acuity call and see if they really need an ambulance to respond, or if there might be some other way to handle their request.\"\n And while big cities have gotten lots of attention in this pandemic, rural areas often suffer from fewer resources.\n \"For emergency ambulance service, often rural communities have only one or two ambulances in them,\" Baird said.\n \"If they're tied up and busy, that means that the next response is coming from a community or maybe several communities over.\"\n Despite the recent small dips in Covid-19 numbers, health experts predict the pandemic will get worse before most Americans can get vaccinated.\n One possible reason: A variant strain of coronavirus first detected in the UK is now spreading in the US.\n Evidence shows that strain is more contagious than others. And it might become the dominant strain in the US by March if people don't double down on safety precautions, said researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \"I worry desperately in the next six to 12 weeks, we're going to see a situation with this pandemic unlike anything we've seen yet to date,\" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n \"That is really a challenge that I don't think most people realize yet.\"\n Stanton, the ER doctor in Kentucky, has noticed disturbing trends that are fueling this Covid-19 surge.\n \"We're seeing a lot of (coronavirus) go through entire households. And I've admitted almost whole families,\" Stanton said.\n \"I think everybody assumes that: 1) If they get a negative test before they travel, that they were fine, and there was no way they could spread it; or 2) Not realizing how mild the symptoms can be, especially in younger people, they can potentially spread it,\" he said.\n \"So they're like, 'Oh, yeah, we had somebody who had a cough and some congestion and headache. But we didn't think anything about it because they didn't have a fever.' And that's another fallacy, is to assume you have to have all the classic symptoms of Covid. You don't.\"\n He said it's important to remember \"a negative test does not mean you don't have it. In fact, we're seeing a lot of false negatives. And we can't brush off 'allergies' when we're going out and seeing people.\"\n Stanton said he most fears the possibility of rationing care down the road.\n \"When we run out of resources, we run out of resources for everybody. We run out of access for everybody,\" he said.\n \"It doesn't matter who you are, how much money you have, how much you contributed to a hospital, how injured or sick or whatever it may be that you have. When we run out, we run out. And that includes young people with car accidents and things they would never predict. That includes people who have a history of heart disease, people with chronic medical conditions.\"\n Baird said he's most worried about people getting lax about Covid-19 precautions, leading to even more strain on the ambulance system.\n \"One of my big fears is that as the public and maybe in particular younger people who feel less vulnerable just get fatigued by this whole thing and sort of give up on the public health measures,\" he said.\n \"The combination of that, plus this strain that's way more contagious running around, (I fear) we'll have more cases.\"\n But don't wait until you or a loved one needs emergency care before taking Covid-19 precautions seriously.\n \"Covid is impacting all of us,\" he said. \"And while you may not have personally experienced a loved one or family member or someone you even just know closely who's had Covid and had serious effects from it, or even death ... millions of Americans have experienced knowing someone,\" Baird said.\n \"The sooner we can all get on board together to end this thing with interventions that we know work -- wearing a mask, social distancing, washing our hands -- the sooner we can get on with our lives.\"",

        "title": "Google threatens to shut down search in Australia",
        "body_text": "Google says it will shut down its search engine in Australia if a controversial bill designed to benefit the news media becomes law.\n At a Senate hearing in Canberra on Friday, Google (GOOGL) Australia Managing Director Mel Silva said the draft legislation \"remains unworkable,\" and would be \"breaking\" the way millions of users searched for content online.\n \"If this version of the Code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,\" she told lawmakers. \"That would be a bad outcome not just for us, but for the Australian people, media diversity and small businesses who use Google Search.\"\n The company's main concern with the proposal is that it \"would require payments simply for links and snippets just to news results in Search,\" according to Silva.\n \"The free service we offer Australian users, and our business model, has been built on the ability to link freely between websites,\" she said.\n Google and Facebook have tussled with publishers for years over how they display their content, with media companies arguing the tech giants should pay them for the privilege. Critics of the two tech firms point out that since they dominate the online advertising business, it puts news publishers in a bind and leaves them scrambling for leftovers.\n The new legislation would allow certain media outlets to bargain either individually or collectively with Facebook and Google \u2014 and to enter arbitration if the parties can't reach an agreement within three months, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which put out the proposed legislation.\n Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison hit back at Google later on Friday.\n \"Let me be clear. Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament. It's done by our government and that's how things work here in Australia and people who want to work with that in Australia, you're very welcome,\" he said at a press conference. \"But we don't respond to threats.\"\n Asked about Morrison's remarks, Google declined to comment.\n Both American tech companies have been vehemently opposed to the code since its introduction last summer. Last August, Google used its homepage to warn Australians that the bill would harm their ability to search and lead to \"consequences\" for YouTube users.\n The US giant is now proposing three changes to the code, including how it would compensate news publishers.\n One suggestion is for News Showcase \u2014 a program launched by Google last year that aims to pay publishers more than $1 billion over the next three years \u2014 to be formalized and expanded in Australia. The company already pays seven publishers in the country for content.\n The company also wants to amend a requirement that would force Google to notify publishers about changes in its algorithm, saying it should do so only \"to make sure publishers are able to respond to changes that affect them.\"\n \"There is a clear pathway to a fair and workable Code,\" said Silva. \"Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that I or Google want to have happen \u2014 especially when there is another way forward.\"\n Facebook (FB) is also pushing back.\n In the same Senate hearing on Friday, Simon Milner, Facebook's vice president of public policy for Asia Pacific, said the company could ultimately block news content in Australia, though he emphasized a commitment \"to make the law workable.\"\n Milner told lawmakers there was already a \"deterrent effect of this law on investment in the Australian news industry,\" citing a recent decision by Facebook to launch a news product in the United Kingdom instead of Australia.\n \"Sir Tim Berners-Lee said, this precedent set by this law could 'make the web unworkable around the world,'\" he added, citing the inventor of the web.\n Regulators say the legislation is needed to level the playing field for the news media in Australia, as newsrooms across the country have reduced service, closed temporarily or permanently shut down.\n But skeptics of the legislation point to a couple of causes for worry. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch owns a massive share of the media market in the country, leading to questions about how much a law forcing payments to his properties would benefit his empire.\n Others warn that such laws threaten internet freedom.\n Such concerns don't hold a lot of weight, argued Belinda Barnet, a media and communications lecturer at Swinburne University in Melbourne, in a Twitter thread Friday.\n \"The code will benefit Murdoch. It will also benefit Guardian, ABC & SBS [the Australian broadcasters], your local paper\" and other media outlets,\" she tweeted.\n Barnet also said the internet is no longer an open space, rendering such concerns moot.\n \"The internet is not open anymore. It is controlled by a couple of global monopolies who make their money from your data,\" she wrote. \"The internet was once more open, it was once a more equal and democratic space, but that era is over.\"\n Similar cases have emerged in other countries. On Thursday, Google announced it would pay news publications in France for the use of their content online in a landmark agreement that could soon be replicated elsewhere in Europe under new copyright laws.\n \u2014 Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Scientists think they have discovered the undersea lair of a giant predatory worm that lived on the ocean floor some 20 million years ago and would pounce on unsuspecting marine creatures.\n Paleontologists from National Taiwan University believe the 6.5-foot-long burrow was once home to a worm-like predator that would surface from the seabed to ambush sea creatures and drag them, alive, into its lair.\n Experts working in northeastern Taiwan reconstructed large, L-shaped burrows dating back to up to 23 million years ago from layers of seafloor using trace fossils --  geological features, like track marks, burrows and plant root cavities found preserved in rocks, which experts use to draw conclusions on the behavior of ancient creatures.\n The bobbit worm, or sand striker (Eunice aphroditois), is an aquatic predatory bristle worm that ranges from 4 inches to 10 feet in length and lives in burrows it creates in the ocean floor. The bobbit worm takes its name from the Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt case, in which Lorena cut off her husband John Wayne's penis with a kitchen knife.\n Living mainly in the Pacific Ocean, bobbit worms hide in long, narrow burrows in the seafloor and propel upward to grab unsuspecting fish, large molluscs and other worms, before dragging them, still alive, back to their dens.\n In the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, the report authors note that the retreat of an ancient worm and prey into the sediment could have caused the \"feather-like\" structures preserved in Pennichnus formosae.\n They identified a high concentration of iron at the top section of the burrow, and believe the worm could have secreted mucus to reinforce the burrow wall.\n \"We hypothesize that about 20 million years ago, at the southeastern border of the Eurasian continent, ancient Bobbit worms colonized the seafloor waiting in ambush for a passing meal,\" the report authors wrote.\n \"When prey came close to a worm, it exploded out from its burrow, grabbing and dragging the prey down into the sediment. Beneath the seafloor, the desperate prey floundered to escape, leading to further disturbance of the sediment around the burrow opening,\" they described.",

        "body_text": "Three former grand jurors are among the \"concerned Kentucky citizens\" petitioning the Kentucky Legislature to impeach state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, according to Kevin Glogower, one of the attorneys representing the petitioners.\n The citizens filed a petition Friday seeking the impeachment of Cameron on charges of \"breach of public trust and failure to comply with duties for misrepresenting to the nation the findings of the Grand Jury\" and \"abuse of office and breach of duties of professional responsibility and ethics,\" both of which are connected to the lack of charges filed against the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department officers implicated in the death of Breonna Taylor in September.\n \"These are randomly selected citizens who were compelled to sit on a grand jury and were terribly misused by the most powerful law enforcement official in Kentucky,\" Glogower said in a news release.\n Cameron took over the investigation into the shooting death of Taylor during a Louisville police raid last year. A grand jury did not indict any of the Louisville Metro Police officers involved in the raid on charges connected with Taylor's death. Former detective Brett Hankison was indicted, however, on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree for allegedly firing blindly into an apartment next to Taylor's. He has pleaded not guilty.\n Some of the grand jurors said they weren't given the opportunity to consider homicide charges and at least one of the grand jurors said that Cameron's public statements about the grand jury involved in the case have been misleading.\n CNN has reached out to Cameron's office for comment.\n The petition also calls for charging Cameron with incitement of insurrection for the US Capitol riots that took place on January 6,  the same charge on which the US House of Representatives impeached former President Donald Trump.\n The petition cites Cameron's involvement with the National Association of Republican Attorneys General (RAGA) as the rationale for the incitement charge. The Rule of Law Defense Fund, a non-profit associated with RAGA, released robocalls urging supporters to march on the Capitol.\n Cameron is a member of RAGA's nine-member executive committee. Cameron told the Louisville Courier-Journal that he was unaware of the robocalls. RAGA's chairman, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, told the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper that he had not authorized the robocalls and the group is \"engaging in a vigorous review\" of the incident.\n The petition also claim that Cameron misused taxpayer dollars by joining an effort by Republican attorneys general supporting a lawsuit that argued that absentee ballots received after polls closed in Pennsylvania on November 3 should not count in the election. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.\n The petition looks to \"seek immediate review by the Impeachment Committee\" already established by the Kentucky House of Representatives, the release says, and it aims to prevent Cameron from holding statewide office in the future.\n Ben Crump, the attorney representing Taylor's family, praised the petitioners.\n \"We encourage the House committee to seriously review this petition and hold AG Cameron accountable for his role in misleading the public and the grand jurors, and denying justice for Breonna Taylor and her family,\" Crump said in a statement on Friday.",

They were signed by Ken Cuccinelli, then the senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary.\n A Republican, Paxton led an attempt to void Biden's Electoral College victory last month and will be a constant presence in federal court attempting to block the Biden administration's policies on immigration.\n During the Trump administration, Paxton also led a lawsuit challenging the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. The case is ongoing. Paxton is also at the head of the latest lawsuit at the Supreme Court challenging the Affordable Care Act.\n Friday's lawsuit targets the Biden administration's 100-day pause on deportations. The decision to temporarily halt deportations was made \"to ensure we have a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety,\" according to a DHS news release this week.\n The deportation moratorium takes effect Friday.",

        "body_text": "When President Joe Biden sat down after his inauguration to sign a slew of executive orders, alongside the stack of navy folders was a wooden box, situated within easy reach.\n Inside that box, ready for use, lay a neat row of gold-trimmed navy Cross Century II pens.\n But why so many pens? As Biden continues to sign more executive orders -- 17 on Wednesday alone, and 13 more in the days following -- it raises a question: Is one not enough?\n Well, like everything to do with the White House, it's mainly because of tradition.\n It's not clear which president started using multiple pens to sign single pieces of legislation. But historians do know the tradition stretches across decades. After the pens are used, they are typically handed out to those involved as a sort of historical artifact.\n It's a way to share the spotlight and acknowledge the contributions of others, explained Mark Lawrence, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library.\n \"I think that presidents want to share credit with others who've contributed to the issues in play,\" he said.\n One of the most famous examples of this is when Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964. He reportedly used at least 75 pens to sign the landmark legislation, handing them out to those involved.\n But the pens weren't just given out of benevolence. The first pen used to sign the CRA was given to Everett Dirksen, a Republican Senator from Illinois who helped write the act. The move was a politically shrewd one, Lawrence explained. Because Dirksen was on the other side of the aisle, the gesture might create a sense of loyalty to Johnson, and maybe Dirksen would speak favorably of him to his Republican peers.\n \"It's a small gesture, no doubt,\" Lawrence said. \"But a very characteristic one for a skillful politician like (Johnson) to lose no chance to cultivate loyalty and support.\"\n The second pen, he said, went to Hubert Humphrey, his vice president. Martin Luther King Jr. was also among the recipients.\n And if you're wondering how it's possible to use that many pens, you can watch the video footage -- Johnson seemingly uses a new pen for each letter. The signatures may have gotten a little elaborate at times, in an effort to use all the pens, Lawrence predicted.\n \"I mean, it must be a mess,\" he said.\n But the pens weren't just given out at signing ceremonies. After Johnson signed the Tax Bill in 1964, he brought four of the pens used in the signing to Jacqueline Kennedy, according to a diary entry from Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson. One pen was for Kennedy, one for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and one each for her children, Caroline and \"John-John,\" she wrote.\n A more modern example is when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, using 22 pens in the process.\n And Obama had practice. In 2009, when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- the very first bill he signed into law -- he used seven pens.\n \"I've been practicing,\" he quipped at the time. \"Very slowly.\"\n As he signed, he gave the pens out as gifts, including to Ledbetter herself.\n Of course, it's not just the number of pens that matters, but the type.\n Biden, for example, reinvoked tradition by using a Cross pen, specifically the Cross Century II, according to manufacturer A.T. Cross.\n Former president Donald Trump initially used the Century II felt tip pen, but then -- like so many facets of his presidency -- broke with tradition, instead preferring a Sharpie.\n Presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all used the Cross Townsend pen, although Obama later switched to the Century II.\n Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were also known to use Cross pens, but the official Cross-White House program didn't begin until Clinton.\n As for Johnson, Lawrence said he began his presidency using an old fashioned fountain pen, but he transitioned in 1965 to using a felt pen instead -- probably a less messy choice.\n And having a good pen is important. In a diary entry dated Feb. 20, 1952, President Harry Truman wrote that he had to sign his name on letters and official documents about 600 times a day, said Randy Sowell, an archivist at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Across four years, well, that's a lot of signatures.\n CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A former Olympic speed skating coach has been jailed for 10 years by a South Korean court for sexual abuse.\n Cho Jae-beom, who coached some of South Korea's top skaters, was first accused of physical and verbal assault by several skaters, including former gold medalist Shim Suk-hee, in early 2018, and later sentenced to 10 months in prison.\n In December that year, Shim revealed that the abuse went far beyond what had initially been revealed, accusing Cho of rape and sexual assault. Her claims caused a storm within the South Korean sporting world, with several other athletes coming forward, both anonymously and in public, to disclose instances of abuse by coaches.\n \"The recent series of testimonies about violence and sexual assault in the sports industry represent our shame that has been hidden beneath the glorious appearance of Korea as a sports powerhouse,\" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said at the time.\n While Cho denied the sexual assault allegations, on Thursday a court in Suwon found him guilty on multiple counts, sentencing him to 10 years and six months in prison, as well as 200 hours of rehabilitation.\n In a statement, the court said that Cho \"sexually assaulted and molested the victim for years\" and took advantage of her \"inability to resist\" due to his position of authority and previous physical abuse of her.\n \"The accused was in the process of building his career as a coach of the nation's national short track speed skating team, but behind it, he routinely raped and molested his underage students over the years,\" the court said, adding that Shim had \"suffered serious mental damage due to continuous sexual violence from the time of childhood and adolescence.\"\n The judge said that after Shim had \"mustered the courage to reveal the crimes of the accused, she had to endure an additional two years of psychological trauma\" over the course of the investigation and trial.\n Shim's attorney welcomed the verdict in a statement, saying it held Cho to account for his \"habitual sex crimes against young players.\"\n \"The ruling confirms that the defendant's actions are serious crimes that should not be tolerated in our society, and shows how the darkest parts of our society should be dealt with in the future,\" the statement said.\n It added that Shim \"sincerely hopes that today's ruling will help the victims somewhere in our society speak out and incidents like this will never happen again.\"\n Park Seong-min, a lawmaker with the ruling Democratic Party, derided the sentence as too lenient, however, noting that prosecutors had originally asked for a 20 year prison term.\n \"The dull (gender) sensitivity of the judiciary is deplorable,\" Park said, adding that the sentence given was a \"slap on the wrist\" considering Cho's crimes.\n South Korea's human rights commission is currently carrying out an investigation, launched following Shim's revelations, into instances of sexual and physical abuse in 50 sports and including both child and adult athletes across a range of levels.\n \"The seriousness of assaults including sexual assaults in the industry has reached a situation that can no longer be overlooked,\" commission chairwoman Choi Young-ae told reporters in 2018. \"It's a crucial time to establish a fundamental and comprehensive improvement plan, rather than a temporary one.\"\n Also this week, a court in Daegu sentenced a former team doctor for the Gyeongju City Hall triathlon squad to eight years in prison for sexual assault. The court said Ahn Joo-hyeon abused multiple athletes, including Choi Suk-hyeon, who later died by suicide.\n Whistle blowers have long pointed to the culture of South Korean sports -- particularly elite Olympic sports -- as cultivating abuse. Yeo Jun-hyung, a former skater and coach, set up a support group for young skaters because he said accusations were repeatedly swept under the rug by officials and sports associations.\n \"Inside the sports world, people think violence and verbal abuse are natural, athletes too,\" one 18-year-old skater told CNN in 2018. \"Even if they get hurt and find it hard, people don't speak up about it.\"\n CNN's Gawon Bae and Choi Ji-yun contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Pompeo's Xinjiang 'genocide' declaration presents Biden with an early China challenge",
        "body_text": "As Joe Biden prepared to be sworn in as United States President on Wednesday, both the outgoing Trump administration and Beijing made a last-minute play to shape his future China policy -- and provide the first major foreign policy challenge of his term.\n About 24 hours before Biden took office, the US State Department officially accused the Chinese government of committing \"genocide\" against Uyghurs and other minority groups in Xinjiang, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying there was a \"systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state.\"\n Rights groups say up to 2 million people, mostly Muslims, have been detained in sprawling fortified camps set up across Xinjiang since 2017, where they have allegedly been subject to political indoctrination and abuse. China has consistently denied such claims, and argues the camp system in Xinjiang is necessary for tackling religious extremism and terrorism.\n While Washington has previously sanctioned officials over Xinjiang and blocked some imports linked to forced labor, Tuesday's declaration is the first time it has officially used the term genocide.\n Genocide is, according to the United Nations, \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" The declaration, while carrying no automatic penalties, marks a rare step for the US government, which historically has shown some hesitancy in attaching the genocide designation to an ongoing crisis.\n And it will fall to the new Biden administration, which has been supportive of calling the situation in Xinjiang a genocide, to take action on this issue, or wilt in the face of an aggressive Beijing attempting to force a \"reset\" on its terms.\n Pompeo's choice to make the Xinjiang declaration at the last possible minute, in an action that was largely lost in the drama of the presidential transition, has frustrated many researchers and human rights activists who have long argued for such a designation.\n \"Don't credit rump Trump architects of chaotic China policy for eleventh hour gestures they first opposed for years,\" James Millward, a historian of Xinjiang, wrote in a Twitter thread denouncing what he said was Pompeo's \"hypocrisy\" on this matter.\n Millward pointed out that the Trump administration blocked multiple attempts by Congress to take action on Xinjiang, in both 2018 and 2019, as the President pursued a trade deal with China, while Pompeo sought to take credit for exposing atrocities that were brought to light by journalists and researchers \"years before Trump flipped on his 'good friend' Xi.\"\n More than anything else, Pompeo's final shot across Beijing's bow seems to have been an attempt to bind the hands of the incoming administration.\n \"The flurry of restrictions and penalties enacted (against China) in the waning months of the Trump administration (are) meant to make it politically impossible or technically difficult for the incoming administration to roll back,\" Scott Kennedy, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote this week. \"Figuring out how to manage this inheritance will be the chief foreign policy challenge of the new administration.\"\n But while the new designation could potentially complicate Biden's relationship with Beijing, it may also provide him with a source of leverage. Already, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has said he agrees with the \"genocide\" designation.\n Beijing is looking to influence Biden's policy, with talk of a reset while signaling potential repercussions should he continue with his predecessor's hawkish stance towards China.\n Chinese state-run media has been celebrating the end of the Trump administration in recent days.\n Hours before Trump was due to leave the White House for the last time, state-run news agency Xinhua tweeted in English an image of the US Congress with the words, \"Good riddance, Donald Trump!\"\n Also on Wednesday, China enacted new sanctions against Pompeo and several other former Trump officials who Beijing said had \"planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined China's interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations.\"\n The measures bar the former officials \"and their immediate family members\" from entering China, Hong Kong and Macao, and forbids them \"and companies and institutions associated with them\" from doing business with China. That could prevent those sanctioned taking up lucrative post-administration roles with think tanks or consulting businesses focused on China, a consideration that Beijing may hope will influence incoming Biden officials against taking strident positions on these issues.\n Speaking Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying blamed \"Pompeo and other anti-China, anti-communist forces\" for fostering \"various misunderstandings on Xinjiang-related matters.\"\n As the chief China hawk in the Trump administration, who has led criticism of Beijing over Hong Kong as well as Xinjiang, Pompeo is a figure of loathing for Chinese diplomats and the country's tightly controlled state media, which in the final week of the Trump administration ran multiple stories hailing his imminent exit.\n In a piece ahead of Biden's inauguration, Xinhua said that \"one of the world's most important bilateral relations is at a critical crossroads.\"\n \"Whether China-US relations could return on track depends on the new US administration,\" Xinhua said, adding that Washington should \"seize fresh opportunities to cooperate\" on issues such as climate change, while avoiding \"red lines,\" like increasing engagement with the democratic and de facto independent island of Taiwan.\n \"President Biden has repeatedly emphasized the word unity in his inauguration speech,\" Hua, the spokeswoman, said Thursday. \"I think this is exactly what the current China-US relations need. Because in the past four years, some anti-China politicians in the US have told too many lies and incited too much hatred and divisions out of personal gains.\"\n Just how the Biden administration handles the issue of Xinjiang could be a major test of this relationship. If Blinken is serious about maintaining his predecessor's designation, then presumably this must be followed by additional sanctions, or some kind of international action, otherwise Washington risks acknowledging an ongoing genocide and standing by as it happens.\n But international action could be undermined by the manner in which Pompeo made the declaration.\n \"A statement that a genocide is occurring in a foreign country is a political act, not a legal finding, and its impact therefore depends entirely on the reputation and credibility of the speaker,\" Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London, wrote this week. \"Pompeo announced the determination at perhaps the worst moment imaginable (with the US) at the absolute nadir of its standing in the international community.\"\n Nor has the wider international community shown any great hurry to act on this issue.\n Last month, the European Union moved towards signing an investment deal with China, despite concerns raised over human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and the active lobbying against it of some incoming Biden officials.\n \"The stories coming out of Xinjiang are pure horror. The story in Brussels is we're ready to sign an investment treaty with China,\" European lawmaker Guy Verhofstadt said at the time, rubbishing supposed promises regarding forced labor contained in the deal. \"Under these circumstances any Chinese signature on human rights is not worth the paper it is written on.\"\n British lawmakers who tried to restrain their government from pursuing greater trade with China have also been frustrated. This week, the country's parliament narrowly defeated an attempt to restrict agreements with countries found to have genocide, a measure directly aimed at China. While campaigners have vowed to continue the fight in the House of Lords, Pompeo's statement -- which came in the middle of the debate -- did not ultimately sway a majority of MPs.\n Biden may have more influence in both Brussels and London than Trump ever did, and certainly he has spoken of the need to rebuild America's international standing after four years of Trump. But whether he uses his position to lobby for action on Xinjiang, or a tougher line on China in general, remains to be seen.",

        "body_text": "Three Wednesdays that changed America.\n A deadly insurrection, a historic impeachment and the inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the 46th President of the United States.\n The chaotic first 20 days of the year started with mobs supporting President Donald Trump storming the US Capitol on January 6 after he urged them to fight against the ceremonial counting of electoral votes ratifying Biden's victory.\n A week later, on January 13, the House of Representatives made Trump the first President to be impeached twice after his desperate bid to cling to power.\n On Wednesday, Trump flew to Florida hours before Biden took the oath of office --  along with Kamala Harris as the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president -- in the same area outside the Capitol that had been overrun weeks earlier by the pro-Trump mobs.\n Here is a brief timeline of three historic Wednesdays:\n Trump repeated weeks of false claims that the presidential election was rigged and fraudulent. He looked out on throngs of flag-waving, MAGA-hat wearing supporters he had invited to descend on Washington for the congressional certification of the election. Trump worked up the crowd with claims that \"the states got defrauded\" and railed against \"pathetic Republicans\" who failed to challenge Biden's win.\n \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\" Trump said. \"You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\"\n Shortly after 1 p.m., hundreds of protesters pushed through barriers erected along the perimeter of the Capitol. They tussled with officers in riot gear.\n By 2:30 p.m., the rioters had broken into the Capitol building, with some chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\" The vice president was whisked to safety with his wife and daughter though some reports said the insurrectionists came within minutes of reaching Pence. After the doors were secured, some Trump supporters smashed windows and let themselves in.\n The insurrectionists kicked and beat police with their own batons. They sprayed them with chemical irritants and threatened to kill them. One police officer and four other people -- including a female protester who was shot by police -- died in the aftermath of the riot.\n Lawmakers and staff were on lockdown. Capitol Police drew their guns to protect the House chamber.\n One rioter was photographed carrying a pole flying the Confederate flag. The man trotted across the tiled floors of the Capitol, past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and slaveholder John Calhoun.\n After police cleared the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that Congress intended to reconvene that night to finish affirming Biden's election.\n Shortly before 4 a.m. on January 7, Congress finalized Biden's Electoral College victory.\n \"We deplore the desecration of the United States Capitol Building, the shedding of innocent blood, the loss of life, and the quagmire of dysfunction that threaten our democracy,\" Senate Chaplain Barry Black said in a prayer moments after the congressional ratification.\n \"These tragedies have reminded us that words matter and that the power of life and death is in the tongue,\" he said. \"We have been warned that eternal vigilance continues to be freedom's price.\"\n On January 13, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for a second time in the same chamber that lawmakers had fled a week earlier in fear of their lives from the invading mob seeking to stop the transfer of power to Biden.\n The House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump in the fourth presidential impeachment in US history. It was the first time a President had been impeached twice.\n Ten Republicans, including the House's No. 3 Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, joined all Democrats to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n \"Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law,\" the impeachment article read.\n Thousands of National Guard troops surrounded and guarded the Capitol complex as the vote took place.\n After the vote, Trump released a video statement calling for calm as the threat of new riots cast a pall over Washington. He did not mention the impeachment.\n The timing of Trump's Senate impeachment trial is still unsettled, with some Republicans urging Democrats to abandon the effort.\n On the third Wednesday of the new year, the Trump presidential era came to end.\n An unprecedented number of National Guard members, federal law enforcement officers, police officers and protective infrastructure were moved to the heart of the capital for an inauguration like no other. Security on Biden's ultimately quiet and calm Inauguration Day included more than 20,000 National Guard members.\n Trump left the White House as President for the last time shortly after 8 a.m. ET. He did not attend Biden's swearing-in ceremony -- the first President in 150 years to boycott his successor's inauguration.\n With the soon-to-be former first lady at his side, Trump told reporters outside the White House that it was a \"great honor\" to serve as 45th President of the United States. He said goodbye before boarding Marine One.\n Trump's family and some supporters later gathered for a brief farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews before the Trumps boarded the presidential plane for a flight to Florida just before 9 a.m.\n \"We will be back in some form,\" Trump told a modest crowd of supporters. \"So have a good life. We will see you soon.\"\n Trump thanked his family and chief of staff. He promised to \"always fight\" and said he wished the incoming administration \"great luck\" -- without mentioning Biden by name.\n Biden's first public appearance Wednesday morning was at a church service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in DC with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Pelosi.\n Biden arrived at the US Capitol shortly after 11 a.m. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, accompanied Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, up the steps of the building.\n The nation's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president took the oath of office first -- at 11:42 a.m. Harris used two Bibles during the oath, which was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n Biden completed his oath at 11:48 a.m., his hand over a treasured family Bible that dates to the 19th century and was held by Jill Biden. His oath was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n In his inaugural speech, Biden spoke of the rise of White nationalism, racism and deep political division across the country.\n \"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,\" the newly minted President said, calling on Americans to come together. \"We have to be different than this. America has to be better than this.\"\n Addressing those who did not support him in the election, Biden added, \"I will be a President for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as those who did.\"\n He said the swearing-in of his vice president was a remarkable achievement for a country still struggling to live up to an ideal of equality for all.\n \"Here we stand looking out on the great Mall, where Dr. (Martin Luther) King (Jr.) spoke of his dream. Here we stand where 108 years ago, at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris,\" Biden said.\n After his speech, Amanda Gorman, the nation's first-ever youth poet laureate, challenged Americans to come together and \"leave behind a country better than the one we were left.\"\n She recited a poem about bridging differences that she said she was halfway through writing and completed the day she saw Trump supporters storm the Capitol.\n \"Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished,\" Gorman said in the poem. \"We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.\"\n Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their spouses attended the inauguration. They later issued a joint message emphasizing  the new President's call for national unity.\n Shortly before 4 p.m., Biden entered the White House for the first time as the 46th President. \"Hail to the Chief\" played as he and the first lady paused for a moment on the North Portico.\n The President and the first lady embraced. They then waved to the cameras and walked with their extended family into the Grand Foyer.\n CNN's Maeve Reston, Devan Cole, Paul LeBlanc, Peter Nickeas, Eliott C.

        "body_text": "Severe allergic reactions to Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine are rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n A CDC report published Friday revealed just 10 people had severe allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, out of more than 4 million people vaccinated with a first dose of the Moderna shot as of January 10. That's a rate of 2.5 cases per million doses administered.\n The CDC previously reported that, with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine,11.1 people out of every million vaccinated suffered the severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. To compare, the rate of severe allergic reaction for the flu vaccine is 1.3 per 1 million doses.\n All 10 of the severe allergic reactions to Moderna's vaccine were in women. Symptoms began quickly -- at a median of 7 1/2 minutes after people got the shot. All the patients the CDC was able to follow up with have recovered.\n Nine of the patients had a documented history of allergies and more than half of those people had a previous history of anaphylaxis. Only one had a prior allergic reaction to a vaccine. The others had allergic reactions to a mix of things -- drugs, contrast agents used in some medical imaging and one person had a food allergy.\n Anaphylaxis can be life threatening but people usually recover completely if promptly treated. The US Food and Drug Administration requires all sites giving Covid-19 vaccines to have trained responders and anaphylaxis treatments at hand.\n The CDC has been monitoring for adverse reactions and collected 1,266 adverse event reports related to the Moderna vaccine. Among those reports, 108 involving allergic reactions were flagged for further review. Most reports of adverse events end up being unrelated to vaccination.\n The CDC determined 47 of the reports were nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions and 47 were considered nonallergic reactions. Four case reports didn't have enough information to make a determination.\n The CDC and FDA are carefully monitoring the rollout of vaccines for any adverse events.\n California health officials told medical providers to pause the administration of one lot of Moderna vaccines on Sunday, after several people at a clinic in San Diego required medical attention over 24 hours after receiving doses from the lot.\n Moderna said the lot contained more than 1.2 million doses shipped to 37 different states.\n California's health department recommended the pause out of an \"abundance of caution.\" After an investigation, it gave the state the all-clear to immediately resume vaccinations on Wednesday.\n The CDC says that people who have an immediate allergic reaction to a first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine shouldn't get the second.\n Though severe reactions are relatively rare, the CDC has asked that vaccine providers be prepared. Vaccination sites must monitor people for at least 15 minutes after they receive a shot and have trained staff and supplies on hand to manage adverse reactions.\n Those with a history of allergic reactions to other types of vaccines are advised to ask their doctor before getting vaccinated against Covid-19.\n Doctors say the benefits of getting vaccinated against Covid-19 outweigh the risks.\n Most people with allergies or a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injectables should get be able to safely get vaccinated, the CDC says.\n Those who get vaccinated can expect some side effects, like pain or swelling at the injection site, and fever, fatigue or headaches. Doctors say these are normal signs that the body is building protection against the virus.\n CNN Health's John Bonifield contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Amazon is pushing for a milestone union vote to take place in person despite the pandemic",
        "body_text": "Amazon is once again asking the National Labor Relations Board to direct thousands of the company's warehouse workers at an Alabama facility to cast votes in-person on whether to form a union, rather than by mail, despite the ongoing pandemic.\n The e-commerce giant filed a motion Thursday to delay the union election, which is set to begin February 8, so that the NLRB may revisit its decision to hold the election by mail over the course of nearly two months instead of through an in-person event.\n The NLRB declined to comment on Amazon's request.\n The union vote is a milestone moment for the Alabama facility and for Amazon (AMZN). While some Amazon workers are unionized in Europe, the company has so far fended off unions in the United States. A union election was held in 2014 at a Delaware warehouse, but resulted in workers largely rejecting the effort.\n The NLRB said last week that the approximately 6,000 employees at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, facility would cast a vote by mail, noting the health risks from the pandemic.\n \"A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests,\" the NLRB decision stated. \"In addition, a mail ballot election will protect the health and safety of voters, Agency personnel, the parties' representatives, and the public during the current health crisis.\"\n In filings this week, however, Amazon said the NLRB decision regarding its election doesn't specify what is considered an \"outbreak.\" Amazon said the NLRB's Acting Regional Director, Lisa Henderson, \"reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an 'outbreak.'\"\n Amazon said that at its Bessemer facility, 2.88% of Amazon's 7,575 employees and third-party workers at the facility -- or 218 people -- tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7. Amazon rejected the idea that this would be considered an outbreak.\n \"If true, facilities will be in a constant state of 'outbreak' unless and until the virus all but disappears, with no manual elections occurring until that unknown time,\" the filing read, also citing that a mail election could \"disenfranchise dozens or hundreds of voters\" because it is imperfect.\n In the NLRB's decision last week, Henderson noted that Jefferson County, where the facility is located, had a positivity rate of over 17% as of January 11, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NLRB said in November that a mail-in election would \"normally be appropriate\" if the number of confirmed cases in the county is increasing, or if it is 5% or higher. In its filing, Amazon said this decision \"reflected assumptions developed comparatively earlier in the pandemic.\"\n In a statement to CNN Business, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said the company believes \"the best approach to a valid, fair and successful election is one that is conducted manually, in-person, making it easy for associates to verify and cast their vote in close proximity to their workplace.\"\n \"Amazon provided the NLRB with a safe, confidential and convenient proposal for associates to vote onsite which is in the best interest of all parties -- associate convenience, vote fidelity, and timeliness of vote count,\" Knox said in the statement. \"\u202fWe will continue to insist on measures for a fair election, and we want everyone to vote, so our focus is ensuring that's possible.\n The union push comes as Amazon's warehouse working conditions have come under heightened scrutiny during the pandemic. The company has hired hundreds of thousands workers globally to support a surge in demand. A number of warehouse workers have spoken out about safety concerns since the start of the pandemic.\n Workers at the facility first filed a notice in November with the NLRB about holding an election to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).\n \"Having a union at Amazon would give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better,\" reads a website in support of unionizing Amazon's Bessemer workers.",

        "title": "Capitol Police investigating after congressman discovered carrying a gun when attempting to go on the House floor",
        "body_text": "US Capitol Police are investigating an incident in which a Republican lawmaker was stopped from bringing a concealed gun onto the House floor on Thursday, sources told CNN, the first time a member of Congress has been discovered with a firearm by the metal detectors now set up outside the legislative chamber.\n Rep. Andy Harris, of Maryland, set off a metal detector outside the House floor on Thursday and an officer soon discovered it was because he was carrying a concealed gun on his side, a Capitol official told CNN. The officer sent Harris away, prompting him to ask fellow Republican Rep. John Katko, of New York, to hold his weapon.\n According to a press pool report, Katko refused to hold the gun for Harris, saying that he did not have a license. Harris then left the area and returned moments later, walking onto the House floor without setting off the magnetometer.\n The Capitol official confirmed to CNN that Harris did not enter the House floor with a weapon. Harris' office did not immediately return a request for comment. The incident was first reported by HuffPost.\n The Capitol Police officer who saw the gun informed his superiors and the department is investigating the matter, a Capitol Police source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n Firearms are banned from Congress except for members, who are granted certain exemptions under a 1967 regulation from the Capitol Police Board, a source confirmed to CNN. Members of Congress are able to carry firearms in the halls of Congress and on Capitol grounds as long as they have Washington licenses and they carry ammunition separately, the source added. Under no circumstances are lawmakers allowed to bring firearms onto the House floor.\n Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday night that \"I think a very considerable amount, a lot of members\" of the House \"still don't yet feel safe around other members of Congress,\" slamming Harris for the incident.\n \"The moment you bring a gun onto the House floor in violation of rules, you put everyone around you in danger. It is irresponsible, it is reckless, but beyond that it is the violation of rules,\" she said.\n \"You are openly disobeying the rules that we have established as a community, which means that you cannot be trusted to be held accountable to what we've decided as a community. And so I don't really care what they say their intentions are, I care what the impact of their actions are, and the impact is to put all 435 members of Congress in danger.\"\n Ocasio-Cortez asserted that Harris \"tried to hand off his gun to another member who didn't have a license, and any responsible gun owner knows that you don't just hand off your gun to another individual, you have to clear it, et cetera.\"\n \"That just goes to show, it doesn't matter what your intention is if you are irresponsible, if you are trying to break rules, if you're trying to sneak a firearm onto the floor of the House,\" she added. \"I don't care if you accidentally set it off, I don't care if you intentionally set it off, I don't care if you don't set it off at all, you are endangering the lives of members of Congress. And it is absolutely outrageous that we even have to have this conversation.\"\n The metal detectors were installed last week in the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, which left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer. While lawmakers from both parties have been annoyed by the long lines the detectors have created during votes, Republicans in particular have complained vociferously and, in some cases, ignored them.\n The metal detectors were installed after multiple House Democrats told CNN they were worried about some of their Republican colleagues and after multiple conversations about the need for every member of Congress and their guests to start going through metal detectors, CNN previously reported.\n Since the detectors were installed, there have been very few votes on the House floor, so members are still getting used to the new measures.\n Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who filmed a campaign advertisement vowing to carry her handgun around Capitol Hill prior to arriving in Washington, was also involved in a standoff with Capitol Police at the newly installed metal detectors when trying to get on the floor January 12.\n On that same night, GOP Reps. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Steve Womack of Arkansas yelled at Capitol Police when they were forced to go through the detectors. Womack shouted, \"I was physically restrained,\" and Mullin said, \"It's my constitutional right\" to walk through and \"they cannot stop me.\"\n Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, told reporters on January 12, as he passed through the metal detectors to get to the House floor, \"This is crap right here. You can put that down. This is the stupidest thing.\"\n Even some Democrats have been unhappy with the extra security because it has led to longer lines and members being forced to be within 6 feet of one another.\n \"I'm more likely to die of Covid because I got it from a colleague than I am to die because a colleague shoots me,\" Rep. Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, told CNN last week.\n After the initial criticism from lawmakers, and reports that some refused to stop for Capitol Police after setting off the magnetometers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed a new rule on January 13, imposing stiff fines on members who refused to follow the new security measures: $5,000 for the first offense and $10,000 for the second offense. The new rule has not been passed yet and will be considered when floor votes resume in the House in February.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.\n CNN's Caroline Kelly contributed to this report.",

And to make everything we do be based on science and evidence,\" he told reporters Thursday during a White House briefing.\n Fauci, who is also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had disagreed with Trump on how to approach the pandemic, with the former president consistently downplaying the threat of Covid-19. Trump attacked Fauci publicly and had suggested at one point he was considering firing him, and by the end of the Trump administration, Fauci was largely sidelined.\n Fauci admitted Thursday that it was \"uncomfortable\" when things like hydroxychloroquine were promoted as treatments for Covid-19 when they weren't based on fact, and that he takes \"no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the President.\"\n He called it a \"liberating feeling\" to now be able to \"talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is,\" without fear of repercussions.\n CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

Lloyd Austin, who will be the first African American to run the department.\n Austin, who retired in 2016 and had to be granted a waiver from a law requiring a defense secretary to wait seven years after active-duty service before taking the job. The House approved the waiver Thursday afternoon, followed by Senate approval of the measure.\n Thursday's votes cleared the way for final confirmation in the Senate. Friday's vote was 93-2. Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Josh Hawley of Missouri were the only two no votes.\n Confirmation of the defense secretary gives Biden another key department chief in place as congressional Democratic leaders attempt to move swiftly to confirm Cabinet members and other key officials following Biden's inauguration on Wednesday. The Senate confirmed Biden's first Cabinet nominee Wednesday evening, voting to approve his pick for director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, on his first day in office.\n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday that the Senate should \"pause and reflect\" on the fact that Congress has granted waivers to both the Trump and Biden administrations to confirm defense secretaries.\n \"The law that we keep waiving actually exists for a good reason,\" McConnell said. \"Civilian control of the military is a fundamental principle of our republic. We emphatically do not want high-ranking military service to become a tacit prerequisite for civilian leadership posts over the Department of Defense.\"\n In the run-up to his confirmation vote, Austin has worked to overcome objections from some lawmakers to allowing a recently retired general to assume the top civilian post at the Pentagon.\n He addressed those concerns directly at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, saying, \"If confirmed, I will carry out the mission of the Department of Defense, always with the goal to deter war and ensure our nation's security, and I will uphold the principle of civilian control of the military, as intended.\"\n \"I understand and respect the reservations some of you have expressed about having another recently retired general at the head of the Department of Defense,\" he said at the hearing. \"The safety and security of our democracy demands competent civilian control of our armed forces, the subordination of military power to the civil.\"\n This story and headline have been updated to reflect additional developments Friday.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN, covered the television industry for The New York Times for 25 years, and has written four books on TV, including The Late Shift and The War for Late Night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n The Trump administration is officially over.\n But nobody thinks Donald Trump is going away; he has too many acolytes and too much obsession with self-promotion and self-aggrandizement for that to ever happen.\n Still, a significant portion of the country, exhausted and debilitated from four years of assault on political and social norms perpetrated by Trump and his associates, would clearly much prefer if this \"long national nightmare\" really did come to an end, just as it did when that phrase was minted in the wake of Richard Nixon flying off into disgrace.\n In other words: If only the discordant din sent up by the Trump era simply went silent.\n That is certainly the view among many media critics who have long blamed various national news organizations for amplifying Trump's already bumptious \u2014 and deafening \u2014 voice. \"He should be ignored forever,\" goes the scolding message. \"No more showering him with attention, which he then gleefully bathes in \u2014 and contaminates.\"\n The only problem with this is that Trump will surely be pounding home his fraudulent account of events for years to come, offering up a torrent of new lies directed at his successor and harmonized by a cacophonous choir of unrepentant backup singers.\n The media should not be expected to watch passively as Trump inflicts some new blight on the nation \u2014 even if that's the prescription from every media doctor with a Twitter account. And a continued focus on Trump will not be because the media wants to keep the ratings gold flowing in (or at least that won't be the only reason).\n New outrages will demand more legitimate coverage. But also Trump leaves behind a body of work that no responsible journalist could consider a closed book. The litany of still under-covered or unresolved news stories that merit fuller journalistic examination is long \u2014 and compelling.\n Here are five that certainly qualify to be on some media outlet's still-active case list:\n How much did Trump's relentless adventures in golf wind up costing the taxpayers, and how much of that cash went directly into Trump's own pockets via his resorts? There have been plenty of running estimates, but a thorough examination could provide a comprehensive, and likely startling, accounting. And Trump's six-month Secret Service extension for his children will surely only add to taxpayers' tab.What ever happened to the health care plan that was due in two weeks? When Lesley Stahl of CBS News interviewed Trump last October, he made a point that he was ready to present a comprehensive health care plan. But when his press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later presented Stahl with a fat binder, the contents did not include a plan at all \u2014 only a series of executive orders. Were there ever charts, graphs, estimates or proposals beyond the executive orders that Trump signed? What exactly was Trump's source for many of his most batty pronouncements? Where did he come up with his confident assertion that wind turbines cause cancer? Or that ingesting disinfectant could treat Covid? Or that America was so afflicted with inadequate water pressure that toilets had to be flushed 10 times? Did Trump ever read the President's Daily Brief? The daily brief, which is a roundup of the most sensitive intelligence about national security issues gathered by US intelligence services, is prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. What might have been missed by his complete disinclination to spend any time reading this valuable information?  Can there ever be a reasonably accurate accounting of lives lost or forever damaged because of Trump's negligence, incompetence or deliberate cruelty? The pandemic count is disastrous worldwide, but shockingly worse in the United States on his watch, in large part due to his refusal to acknowledge the threat and his lethal disregard for mask-wearing. Children were separated from parents at the border; they will now likely be scarred for life. Death row inmates were hastened toward their executioners. Trump idolaters took lives and lost lives while advancing causes devoted to him.\n There is plenty more, of course. Much air time and ink will be expended in coming months in evaluating the political impact of Trump's ongoing influence in his party and over his fandom. That's a guarantee, because political reporters love that kind of thing.\n But the toxic legacy of his tenure is not a story \u2014 a long list of stories in fact \u2014 to walk away from, not even for the sake of a little peace and quiet. It has never been more accurate: no justice, no peace (or quiet).",

He was ordered to remain under electronic monitoring before returning to court on March 8 for sentencing.\n Almena's previous trial in 2019 ended in a hung jury. His co-defendant was acquitted.\n Almena's guilty pleas Friday were part of an agreement under which he's expected to serve between 9 and 12 years in prison. A previous plea agreement that was expected to result in a 6-to-9-year prison sentence was thrown out in 2018 by a different judge.\n Dubbed the \"Ghost Ship,\" the dilapidated Oakland warehouse was a place Almena would rent out to artists. Prosecutors initially announced charges in 2017, saying Almena and his co-defendant allowed more than two dozen people to live in the warehouse, deceiving officials and the building's owners of that fact. They also stacked large quantities of flammable materials from floor to ceiling.\n According to the probable cause document, Almena \"allowed and encouraged tenants to use nonconventional building materials that he collected to create their living spaces.\" Those materials included \"recycled dry wood, such as fence boards, shingles, window frames, wooden sculptures, tapestries, pianos, organs, wooden furniture, RV trailers, rugs, and other ramshackle pieces.\"\n They also held music events there, and on the night of December 2, 2016, an electronic dance party was underway when the inferno broke out.\n Ultimately, 36 people died when they were unable to escape. One of the warehouse's exits had been blocked, and the building was missing important safety features, like fire alarms, marked exits and sprinklers, according to authorities.\n It was one of the deadliest nightclub fires in US history.\n CNN's Eliott C.

        "title": "The huge stakes of Biden's new Covid-19 plan",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden is so far as good as his word to \"manage the hell\" out of the pandemic, driven by urgency to revive a sickened, struggling nation and the certainty that his entire presidency rests on eradicating Covid-19.\n Until now, it's been easy for the new President to criticize the Trump administration's obviously negligent and incompetent response to the worst public health crisis in 100 years. But words are no longer enough now that he's behind the Oval Office desk with Americans dreaming of a vaccine and a return to work, family life and travel.\n Reflecting this pressure, Biden appeared on camera on Thursday, signing a slew of executive orders that showed him in the act of wielding his new power to combat the virus. Seizing the power of the presidency to galvanize action, he issued a detailed new anti-pandemic strategy, pledged a genuine \"wartime\" effort to expand vaccine distribution, supplies and testing. He mandated masks on federal lands and in inter-state train, bus and air travel. Biden plans new vaccination sites across the country and to activate pharmacies in every neighborhood.\n There is a strong impression that after four years of chaos and incompetence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, serious people are now in charge. This administration appears better stocked in expertise, respect for science, organizational skills and experience than the previous one. And there is a President who is now empowering his team rather than trashing its message.\n In a break with the lies, spin and boastful nonsense of the previous White House's briefings, Biden sent Dr. Anthony Fauci out to share science and truth with no fear of presidential reprisals.\n \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is \u2014 let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling,\" said the government's top infectious diseases expert, who often clashed with former President Donald Trump's fantastical alternative realities.\n Fauci -- who was sidelined by Trump, who spouted uniformed, politicized misinformation in coronavirus task force briefings -- said things were already far more professional.\n \"You know, one of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess,\" he said.\n What is so striking is that Biden's approach, while welcome, is in many cases implementing measures that a comprehensive pandemic response from the previous administration would have taken at the start.\n It is rooted in a bet that throwing federal government expertise, money and scale at a crisis can turn the situation around and finally provide the leadership and coordination that has been lacking in the year since the coronavirus struck the US.\n Ending the threat from the virus would in turn be the best path to easing the economic disaster after another 900,000 people filed first-time unemployment claims last week, building new pressure on Congress to quickly approve Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan despite Republican concern over its cost.\n The President will turn from the epidemiological challenge of the virus on Friday to the economic consequences of the pandemic as he signs another set of executive orders to bring relief after an intense start to his term.\n There are two concurrent tracks in the ramped up coronavirus response: the rush to intensify the battle against the virus and the political effort to manage the fallout from the crisis and its impact on the early months of the new presidency.\n Thus, the President is adopting a two-pronged message \u2014 warning that the season of death and sickness will intensify, while offering an optimistic prediction that the horror will not last forever.\n \"Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better ... The death toll will likely top 500,000 next month and the cases will continue to mount,\" Biden said as he unveiled his new strategy at the White House.\n \"We didn't get into this mess overnight. It's going to take months for us to turn things around. And let me be equally clear, we will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic.\"\n But it is one thing to come up with a strategy. It's another thing for Biden, and his incoming team of high-ranking scientists, medical experts and logistics experts, to quickly turn around often sluggish federal government machinery. The White House will need states, some of which have failed badly in all aspects of the pandemic, to respond to the new federal effort. And while Biden can change policy with his pen, he needs massive, swift investment from a tightly balanced Congress to make his plan work.\n Then there are the medical factors beyond his control.\n While hospitalizations are declining in a sign of hope, many experts fear that it could be a temporary relief and new, more transmissible versions of the virus will quash hopes of a significant easing of the situation in the spring.\n And even in countries where the pandemic has been better handled, there have been a string of busted timelines over when normal life might resume, as coronavirus defies attempts to eradicate it from societies.\n So there is a question of how much more patience the American people have, with no clear answers yet from the government on when individuals not in the highest risk age and medical categories can get vaccinated.\n While the Biden administration is just getting started, the country has been locked in the purgatory of lockdowns, working and schooling from home, amid separation from family members for 10 months. Trump's attacks on the legitimacy of Biden's election win, meanwhile, may challenge the authority of his new measures and the willingness of millions of Americans to listen.\n Sources told CNN earlier that the Trump administration, which disrupted the transition to the new White House, left no national vaccine plan and that the new administration was effectively starting from scratch.\n While that rings true given the previous administration's failure to meet its goal of 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020, Fauci on Thursday was less equivocal on this score, saying, \"We're certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution.\"\n In any case, announcing that they were starting from square one also appeared to be an effort to manage expectations for Biden and to give his team some time to crank up the new anti-Covid offensive with the virus still spreading out of control.\n While the new President's promise to administer 100 million doses of the vaccine in his first 100 days would represent a significant improvement, it pales against the magnitude of the problem. Since two vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the US require two doses, the plan means that less than a sixth of all Americans would be vaccinated by the end of April. Unless vaccine supply can be significantly ramped up \u2014 through Biden's more aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, for example \u2014 it could be many months before all Americans are inoculated.\n The new President betrayed the high stakes of the pandemic response operation at the end of his event at the White House Thursday when asked whether he was setting the bar high enough.\n \"When I announced it, you all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break, man,\" the President said, betraying a tetchiness with second guessing from the press likely to become more pronounced as his honeymoon period fades.\n Still, many experts are confident that with a concentrated effort, the new administration will be successful in cranking up both the supply and the distribution of the vaccine.\n It was notable, for instance, that Fauci, in common with other experts, appeared to indicate that the bigger concern in the long term was whether sufficient Americans would take the vaccine to assure herd immunity \u2014 the point at which enough people have been infected with Covid-19 or immunized against it to stop transmission of the virus.\n \"If we get 70% to 85% of the country vaccinated, let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer, I believe by the time we get to the fall, we will be approaching a degree of normality,\" Fauci said.\n If he's right, the American people will get their lives back and Biden can expect a serious payoff of public trust, political capital and a reputation for competence that would be invaluable in building support for his ambitious legislative agenda, and ultimately his place in history.",

        "body_text": "Hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and, when soap and water isn't available, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is the next best way to do this.\n The hospital cases were all in children under the age of 4, and the French researchers said the reason for this was likely because gel dispensers are usually at 1 meter (3 feet) in height. While this is waist level for most adults, it's eye level for young children.\n \"With the current widespread use of hand sanitizer in public places, it is not unexpected that young children would be drawn to these dispensers, many of which appear to be inadvertently designed to facilitate contact between the hand sanitizer and young eyes,\" said Dr. Kathryn Colby from the Grossman School of Medicine's department of ophthalmology at New York University in a commentary that accompanied the research. The study was published in the journal JAMA Opthamology on Thursday.\n Hand sanitizer accounted for just 1.3% of all chemical eye exposure incidents in children in 2019, according to the French database. That number was 9.9% in 2020, and it said that most cases were mild.\n The biggest risk to kids, the research also suggested, could come from dispensers installed in public places. In 2020, 63 cases of exposure occurred in a public place, while none was reported in 2019.\n Many hand sanitizers have a high concentration of ethanol, which can kill cells in the cornea.\n In a related study published in the same journal, physicians in India detailed the cases of two children that accidentally squirted hand sanitizer in the eye, with serious consequences. The 4-year-old complained that she couldn't stand to look at light, while the 5-year-old had damage to his eyelid. Both children made full recoveries after treatment with saline washes and eye drops, but their doctors said it's necessary to consider the potential hazards of hand sanitizers in public places and schools.\n The doctors recommended the following steps:\n Promoting hand washing with soap and water over hand sanitizerTeaching and training children how to use hand sanitizersHaving separate dispensers at shops and malls for children, preferably at lower height (i.e. below face level)Placing caution signs next to sanitizer dispensers\n Colby said that parents also need to make sure their child's eyes are quickly examined by a medical professionals if they are exposed to alcohol sanitizer, with early diagnosis and treatment likely to reduce the long-term consequences of chemical injuries to the eyes.\n \"In an emergency, any clean liquid can be used to irrigate the eye following chemical exposure, and wording to this effect can be considered as part of a warning sign,\" she said.",

When the lakes completely freeze over, barges can no longer move through the lake, which has a big economic impact.\n However, Dr. Jia Wang, a physical oceanographer for NOAA-GLERL, said it's not necessarily a good thing ecologically if the lakes remain unfrozen.\n \"For some species, no ice cover is not good for them because they need a safe place to lay eggs,\" Wang said.\n Since January 1, much of the Midwest and Northeast -- including Minneapolis, Chicago, Cleveland and Buffalo -- have had air temperatures at least 5 to 10 degrees above average.\n With no real robust areas of cold air in the future, the long-term forecast for Great Lakes ice coverage also looks meek.\n \"The Great Lakes region is experiencing warmer-than-usual weather, and the max ice cover is projected to be 30%, way below the average of 53%,\" Wang said.\n That means by the end of winter, less than one-third of the Great Lakes will be covered by ice.\n In order to build significant ice over the lakes, a blast of cold air needs to settle in -- but the long-term forecast does not reflect that.\n The one-month outlook from NOAA shows warmer than average temperatures to settle in across much of the country.\n Lake-effect snow is prevalent at the end of fall and early winter, but usually by January, it starts to ease up, thanks to the lakes themselves freezing over.\n \"Like a hurricane in the ocean, the water in the Great Lakes is the \"fuel\" for lake effect snow,\" said CNN Meteorologist Dave Hennen.\n \"When the lakes are completely ice covered, that moisture isn't available and it effectively shuts down the development of snow.\"\n In order for lake-effect snow to form you need very cold air to pass over the much warmer water of the lake. This causes some of that lake water to evaporate and warm the air above the lake. Winds push that moist air away from the lake and onto land. As that air moves, it cools and sinks back to the ground, dumping that moisture which is now in the form of snow.\n Lake-effect is really generated by the temperature difference between the water and the air. If it's been significantly warmer in the Northeast than usual, that could also be reducing the amount of lake-effect snow.\n \"Temperature departures from normal in the eastern Great Lakes have been running 5 to 7 degrees above normal since the first of the year,\" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. \"This significantly reduces the opportunities for lake-effect snow.\"\n In addition to the milder temperatures across much of the northern US, there hasn't been a big amplified jet stream this year -- and both of those are limiting snow systems from moving through the region.\n That doesn't mean there isn't snow, there just isn't as much as usual.\n Marquette, Michigan, has had nearly 70 inches of snow so far this season, which is 30 inches below normal. Buffalo, New York, has had nearly 40 inches of snow so far, but that is over a foot below normal.\n Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Rochester, New York, have both experienced snow levels over 30 inches below normal for the season, despite both already picking up at least 16 inches so far this season.\n Current temperature above the lakes only tell a portion of the story.\n Last summer, the Great Lakes were exceptionally warm, and bodies of water retain heat much longer than land. Lakes Michigan, Erie, Huron and Ontario were each about 5-10 degrees above average.\n Even Lake Superior was at least 5 degrees above average, although no one probably thinks of 55 degrees (their July temperature) as being particularly warm for water.\n \"In fact, water temperatures on Lake Eerie had even neared 80 degrees in July, besting current sea surface temperatures off the coast of Hilo, Hawaii at the time,\" said CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.\n More importantly, it was well ahead of the typical peak of Great Lakes warmth, which usually occurs in mid August.\n \"In mid-July, the water temperature in Lake Erie climbed to over 79 degrees,  significantly warmer than its 72 degrees average for that time of year,\" Javaheri said.\n \"While Lake Ontario sat at an average water temperature of around 77 degrees, well above its normal of 67 for mid July.  These current lake temperatures of 77 to 79 degrees have only occurred one other time across lakes Erie and Ontario since records began. It was during the infamous deadly summer heatwaves of 1995 when in August of that year the two lakes soared to such values.\"\n Record-setting warmth settled in early across the northern reaches of the Northern Hemisphere and that heat settled into the Great Lakes, which is still influencing the weather today.",

        "title": "Tom Brokaw retiring from NBC News after 55 years with the network",
        "body_text": "Tom Brokaw is formally retiring from NBC News after an extraordinary 55 years with the network.\n Brokaw, 80, is best known for anchoring the \"NBC Nightly News\" from 1982 through 2004. He has been the network's senior correspondent in recent years, enjoying a form of semi-retirement while contributing essays to NBC and MSNBC programs.\n In his most recent essay, published in late December, he called the coronavirus pandemic \"America's greatest test since the Civil War.\"\n Brokaw was absent from NBC's election and inauguration coverage, a fact that was partially attributed to his age and health.\n NBC announced his retirement in a press release on Friday that credited him with \"more than half a century of award-winning reporting.\"\n The network said that \"Brokaw will continue to be active in print journalism, authoring books and articles, and spend time with his wife, Meredith, three daughters and grandchildren.\"\n He also remains active on Twitter, where he posted a tribute to Hank Aaron after the baseball legend died on Friday.\n Brokaw is a television news icon who, in the words of NBC producer Andy Franklin, \"presided over -- and led us through -- more stories than anyone can count.\"\n On the occasion of a 2017 special about Brokaw's career, Franklin and other staffers described Brokaw's leadership qualities and journalistic backbone.\n Robert Windrem spoke of Brokaw's calm, measured coverage on the day that Richard Nixon resigned the presidency.\n \"I was deeply impressed not just by his professionalism, but by something else: his patriotism,\" Windrem said. \"He understood his role in the nation, his responsibility as an American.\"\n Brokaw helmed most of NBC's news coverage of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. For the 2017 retrospective, producer Maralyn Gelefsky said \"there is no day that I had greater respect or needed his strength and wisdom more than 9/11, when he led NBC and his TV audience with calm assurances.\"\n Brokaw joined NBC in 1966, as a reporter in the Los Angeles bureau, \"covering Ronald Reagan's first run for the presidency,\" according to the network's biography for him. \"He went on to become NBC News' White House correspondent, co-hosted 'Today,' and eventually became the anchor and managing editor of 'NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.'\"\n At first he shared the \"Nightly News\" with Roger Mudd; one year later, he became the solo anchor, competing with Peter Jennings on ABC and Dan Rather on CBS. The \"NBC Nightly News\" regularly ranked in first place in the ratings with Brokaw at the helm.\n Later in his career, Brokaw stepped in to moderate \"Meet the Press\" when Tim Russert died in 2008. NBC said Brokaw is the only journalist in network history to host \"Today,\" \"Nightly News\" and \"Meet the Press.\"\n In 2018 news outlets published allegations by Linda Vester, a former NBC reporter, that Brokaw sexually harassed her in the early 1990s. Vester told Variety that Brokaw \"groped and assaulted\" her. Brokaw called Vester a \"character assassin\" with a \"grudge against NBC News\" and said he \"did not verbally and physically attack her\" as described in the interviews.\n A number of women at NBC, including hosts like Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell, signed an open letter supporting Brokaw and calling him \"a man of tremendous decency and integrity.\"\n By 2018, Brokaw's live segments on NBC and MSNBC were already receding. In recent months, he taped his essays rather than appearing live.\n His end-of-2020 commentary on \"Morning Joe\" looked ahead to Joe Biden's presidency and criticized then-President Trump for \"whining while Covid patients struggle to survive.\"\n \"Before too long, Donald Trump's principal audiences will be his caddies,\" he quipped.\n Then he turned inward: \"For me, it's been an amazing journey. 57 years, as a reporter. As a young reporter in Omaha, I broke into local programming with a bulletin. President Kennedy had been assassinated. And for the next 57 years, I covered the seismic events that roiled our world, but none were as catastrophic as this pandemic. This is America's greatest test since the Civil War. We still have miles to go, and no assurances of just how it will all turn out.\"\n In a statement provided by NBC on Friday afternoon, Brokaw tipped his cap to his colleagues: \"During one of the most complex and consequential eras in American history, a new generation of NBC News journalists, producers and technicians is providing America with timely, insightful and critically important information, 24/7. I could not be more proud of them.\"",

        "title": "The eviction ban should remain in effect long after the pandemic is over",
        "body_text": "Juliet Brodie is a professor of law at Stanford Law School and director of its Community Law Clinic, where she represents low-income tenants in eviction cases. Larisa Bowman is a visiting associate professor at the University of Iowa's College of Law and previously practiced eviction defense at a legal services organization in New York City. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion at CNN.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has exposed a basic fact of American life: When people unexpectedly lose work or face unforeseen expenses, they can't pay their rent. What's worse, they often get evicted as a result. As lawyers who represent low-income tenants, we are used to explaining to our clients the legal insignificance of their economic circumstances, however compelling. Your boss cut your hours? Not relevant. Your car needed a $600 repair? No defense. Your child support check didn't arrive? Not the landlord's problem. We tell our clients, \"The law doesn't care about that.\" We usually follow up with, \"It doesn't seem fair, does it?\"\n The pandemic, terrible as it is, has given some tenants a reprieve from the usual injustice of eviction. It took the greatest public health emergency in a century, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, followed by Congress, has temporarily prohibited evicting tenants who can't pay rent because of a loss of income or unexpected medical expense. The principle that made this eviction ban possible\u2014that people shouldn't be rendered homeless and their health jeopardized when they've done nothing wrong\u2014should be extended past the Covid-19 crisis.\n Long before Covid-19, millions of American families were at risk of eviction each year. Rent hikes have outpaced wage growth for decades, with predictable results. According to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, more than 20 million American households were \"rent-burdened\" in 2019, defined as paying more than 30% of their income toward rent. Lower-income households are even more rent-burdened; the majority of tenants living below the poverty line, who are disproportionately people of color, spent more than half their income on housing costs in 2018. With rents too high and incomes too low, nearly 4 in 10 Americans don't have enough cash on hand to cover an unexpected $400 expense. They have no safety net to catch them when something goes wrong.\n And when that something does go wrong, tenants can be quickly evicted. In California, for example, a tenant who fails to pay within three days of being notified by the landlord can be put out on the street a mere four to six weeks later, depending on how court days line up. There are some defenses (such as bad housing conditions), but neither a disruption to income nor an unavoidable but necessary expense cuts it. The result? Swift, court-ordered eviction.\n But the pandemic has changed that. In September, the CDC issued an unprecedented and sweeping order that effectively halted nonpayment evictions nationwide. Congress extended the order through January 31, 2021, and President Joe Biden ihas taken executive action calling for an extension through March. The order applies only to low-income tenants who undertake best efforts to pay at least partial rent, seek available rental assistance, and have no other housing option. It does not relieve tenants of the obligation to pay; landlords can still sue them for the money in civil court. What it does do is take eviction off the table.\n The rationale for the CDC order is public health in the face of the pandemic. People who are evicted are likely to end up in shelters or doubled-up with family and friends where social distancing is virtually impossible, or living on the street, which correlates with a higher incidence of severe Covid-19. But, pandemic or not, eviction is always a public health crisis. According to a study published in Pediatrics in 2018, simply being behind on rent is associated with poor health outcomes for children and their caregivers. Eviction itself is associated with many costly and negative social effects like food insecurity, job loss, and academic decline.\n The CDC order could easily be extended beyond the pandemic. The order itself practically invites it. To claim its protections, tenants do not have to connect the dots between their inability to pay rent and Covid-19. Any tenant who has experienced either a \"substantial loss of household income\" or \"extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses,\" and meets the other requirements, is eligible. Why can't tenants always be protected from eviction in these kinds of situations? Why should eviction ever be the response when tenants can't pay rent due to circumstances beyond their control? State and local jurisdictions, which normally regulate when eviction is permissible, could and should prevent these forced displacements\u2014as a matter of basic fairness.\n Like the present order, an enduring \"not-my-fault\" defense should apply only to tenants who did nothing wrong and who have no other housing option. It should be paired with relief on the landlord side of the ledger. After all, the landlord isn't to blame for a tenant's sudden hardship. And landlords \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 rely on rents to meet their own bills and may not be able to hold off their creditors while they pursue tenants for rent debt in civil court.\n This isn't rocket science. First, robust public and philanthropic financial assistance should be available to strapped tenants and distressed landlords alike. We should prioritize landlords who truly need their rental income over those reaping exorbitant profits from supply-and-demand dysfunction. Landlords under financial strain should be protected against foreclosure (New York's recent anti-eviction bill includes this measure). These policies would incentivize landlords to work with their existing tenants instead of using eviction as the easiest way to generate income from a rental unit. In the longer term, we need the kind of moonshot investment in building rental housing that would bend the price curve to a place where tenants are less strapped in the first place. Raising the federal minimum wage would help, too.\n Our collective willingness to acknowledge that morally blameless families should not be evicted during a public health crisis is a good first step. But if we can devise a system to forego evictions while balancing the needs of landlords in an unprecedented year when economic catastrophe has befallen millions of Americans simultaneously, surely we can devise one for \"normal\" conditions.\n Tenants who do everything right but still fall behind on rent should never be put out on the street. Let this lesson survive the pandemic. Let us tell our clients that the law does care.",

        "body_text": "Chinese officials say it could day 15 days to drill through 70 tons of debris to reach miners trapped underground for nearly two weeks after an explosion at a gold mine in eastern China.\n Twenty-two miners were left trapped at least 600 meters (2,000 feet) underground following the blast on January 10 in the city of Qixia in Shandong Province. Eleven miners were confirmed to be alive on Sunday after rescue workers were able to drill a channel into a section the mine and install a telephone line, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.\n One miner is believed to be dead after sustaining a head injury in the explosion, state media said. Ten people are stuck in a chamber of the gold mine 600 meters (2,000 feet) from the entrance and are in contact with rescue teams. One miner is believed to be trapped in another section, while the fate and whereabouts of 10 others is unknown.\n Efforts have been underway to reach the workers since the blast occurred about 240 meters (800 feet) from the mine's entrance. Food, medical supplies, blankets, and batches of nutrient solution have been passed down a shaft to the 10 workers, who have shown a \"gradual improvement\" in their physical condition, according to rescue workers cited by Xinhua.\n According to state media, rescue teams are hoping to pull the miners out through a 711-millimeter (28-inch) diameter passage. By noon Thursday, rescuers had drilled 18 meters into the mineshaft but heavy debris could slow efforts.\n Gong Haitao, deputy head of Yantai's publicity department, said at a press conference Thursday the mineshaft is blocked 350 to 446 meters (1,100 to 1,400 feet) below the surface by 70 tons of debris.\n \"Although the efficiency (of the rescue work) has improved since the 20th, it will take at least 15 days to clear the rescue channel in the main shaft due to the voluminous size of the obstacles,\" Gong said.\n The miners have already been trapped underground for 12 days.\n Gong added that rescuers are trying various different ways to clear the obstacles, including the use of high powered machinery and deploying more rescue workers.\n Concern is growing for the uncontacted miners. Some of the workers in the chamber are trying to help rescuers locate their missing colleagues by using laser pointers and loudspeakers, but they have received no response, Xinhua reported.\n Rescuers have also drilled smaller channels into other sections of the mine and are lowering nutrient solutions and other means to detect breathing or movement, but no signs of life have been encountered.\n Rescue workers are reported to have first heard knocking sounds from those trapped on January 17, followed by pulling on iron ropes. On Monday miners were able to get a note to rescuers. Xinhua quoted the note as saying: \"We are heavily exhausted and in urgent need of stomach medicine, painkillers, medical tape, external anti-inflammatory drugs, and three people have high blood pressure.\"\n Explosions and deaths are not uncommon in Chinese mines. In September, at least 16 workers in southwestern China died after they became trapped underground in a coal mine and exposed to unsafe levels of carbon monoxide, state media reported.\n And in 2016, dozens of workers were confirmed dead after a gas explosion at a coal mine in the city of Chongqing.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nUS President Joe Biden spent his first full day in office yesterday signing at least 10 executive orders, memorandums and directives focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, likening the measures to \"a full-scale wartime effort\" during remarks at the White House.\n Biden and his advisers have inherited a nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan from the Trump administration, CNN reported yesterday, with sources saying that they'll have to essentially \"build everything from scratch.\" The problems he faces are vast and his solution is rooted in a bet that throwing federal government expertise, money and scale at a crisis can turn the situation around, Stephen Collinson writes.\n His strategy includes:\n A national vaccination campaign to administer 100 million shots -- enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses -- in his first 100 days in office.Ramping up vaccination, testing and personal protective equipment supplies, and boosting the development of therapeutics to treat the virus.The creation of a National Pandemic Testing Board to improve testing capacity and a Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force to ensure an \"equitable\" pandemic response and recovery.Enhancing the nation's collection, production, sharing and analysis of data.Instructing federal education and health departments to provide guidance on the safe reopening and operating of schools, childcare providers, and higher education institutions.An executive order calling on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to release clear guidance on Covid-19, decide whether to establish emergency temporary standards, and direct it to enforce worker health and safety requirements.Require face masks in airports and on certain modes of transportation, including many trains, planes, maritime vessels and intercity buses.A presidential directive to restore US leadership, support the international pandemic response effort, promote resilience for future threats, and advance global health security.\n If vaccination picks up, to 1 million shots per day, in line with Biden's promise, that timeline could bump up to spring 2022. To fully vaccinate all adults in the US by the end of this year, the pace would have to increase to about 1.3 million doses administered per day.\n Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19? Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415.\n The US's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, returned to the White House briefing room on Thursday, expressing relief about being able to share science and truth without fear of presidential reprisals. \"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is -- let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling,\" Fauci, who often clashed with former President Donald Trump's assessments of the pandemic, said.\n \"I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president. So it was really something that you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions about it,\" he said.\n Fauci also said the US can look forward to getting back to some semblance of normality by fall if enough of the population gets vaccinated by the summer. \"If we get 70% to 85% of the country vaccinated, let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer, I believe by the time we get to the fall we will be approaching a degree of normality,\" Fauci added.\n Both the European Union and Britain are considering tougher travel restrictions within their borders in a bid to stem rising infections. The UK government is mulling full border closures in order to contain the new Covid-19 variants, Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News today. Meanwhile the European Commission proposed tougher restrictions on travel both within and to the EU to limit non-essential travel, as the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that the variants could cause more hospitalizations and deaths across the continent.\n A fire broke out at a facility of the world's biggest vaccine maker -- the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the city of Pune -- on Thursday, killing five people. But the company said the blaze would not affect vaccine production.\n This comes as it emerged that South Africa will pay $5.25 per dose for 1.5 million shots of AstraZeneca's vaccine from SII -- more than some wealthier countries have been paying, according to Reuters. SII's price was based on South Africa's status as an upper-middle-income country under a World Bank classification, the country's health department Deputy Director-General Anban Pillay said.\n South Africa is among the worst-hit African countries, and it was announced Thursday that government minister Jackson Mthembu had died from Covid-19.\n Some Peruvian medics are going on hunger strike to demand more funding as cases of Covid-19 spiral in the country.\"No Time to Die,\" the latest film in the James Bond series and one of the most anticipated movies of 2021, has been delayed again.Glastonbury, Britain's famous music festival, will be canceled for a second consecutive year amid the pandemic -- an ominous sign for promoters and artists.\u00a0With summer season in full swing, South Africans have been cautiously letting the sunshine in as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19.Rising tennis star Paula Badosa announced yesterday that she has tested positive for Covid-19 -- the first known Australian Open player to contract the virus.\n The island nation of Sri Lanka is now open to tourists from all countries. As part of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, it has created a \"bio bubble,\" which will give visitors some freedom to travel within the country while still observing safety protocols.\n For instance, some attractions require visitors to be part of an organized tour group or with an approved Sri Lankan guide. They must travel in a private vehicle and not make any unauthorized side stops. Some sites will only allow tourists during designated time slots or on certain days of the week.

Wall Street is clearly a fan of President Joe Biden's new administration -- and it's largely because of growing hope that moderates in both parties will continue to call the shots.\n Yes, Democrats now have control of the Senate thanks to the tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris, but that's a razor-thin majority. And they lost House seats in the election, narrowing their own majority there.\n Investors are hoping that could lead to a compromise on a Covid-19 stimulus bill, albeit perhaps smaller than the $1.9 trillion package Biden has pushed. And for those who worried a more decisive blue wave would lead Biden to embrace more progressive policies, they can breathe a little easier now.\n Stimulus is likely to take precedence over tax hikes, changes to health care policy and more regulation on banks and big tech companies. In other words, the Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders wing of the party will have to wait their turn.\n \"A $1.9 trillion stimulus package may not be easy to pass, but something will get done,\" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.\n \"As for taxes, they could eventually go up on the corporate side but that's going to be down the road,\"That is not the first order of business and investors are reacting positively to that.\"\n Investors had been bracing for a much bigger victory for Democrats, which could have given Biden leeway to launch a far more progressive agenda. That seems unlikely now, and not just because of Covid-19: Experts say Democrats need to tread carefully so they keep control of Congress in the 2022 mid-term elections.\n \"The market is now pricing in less of a blue wave when it comes to policy than prior to the election,\" said Kent Insley, chief investment officer of Tiedemann Advisors.\n \"There are concerns that if Democrats push for too aggressive changes they could suffer, and that would increase the risk of them not getting reelected. Moderate Democrats may look to limit tax hikes,\" he added.\n Democrats may also have to pause any efforts to impose tougher regulations on big banks. That could be good news for shares of top financial firms.\n \"I don't foresee any powerful regulatory changes coming from the Democrats,\" said Steven Leslie, lead analyst of financial services The Economist Intelligence Unit. \"The Biden administration is not going to want to restrict the banks further other than policing abuses, They have other priorities.\"\n That view is shared by a former top Wall Street banker who briefly served in the Trump administration.\n Gary Cohn, a former Trump economic adviser, ex-Goldman Sachs (GS) chief operating officer and currently vice chairman of IBM (IBM), made the case for moderates in Washington to exert more influence.\n \"Executive action will only take the country so far. Our ability to get big things done will be decided by moderates in the Senate. The path forward is down the middle,\" Cohn wrote in a tweet Friday.\n The fact that Biden will need to compromise with Republicans might be a problem for the economy, even though investors are cheering his willingness to reach across the aisle.\n \"The markets are, subconsciously or not, making a bet that the US fiscal package will be watered-down by moderates,\" Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a report, \"who remain powerful thanks to the wafer-thinness of the Democrat hold over Congress.\"",

Streaming shows, where Black actors were on screen 18.9% of the time, weren't far behind. Black Americans make up about 13% of the US population.\n The inclusion report revealed that the widest assortment of shows starring people of color was found on streaming platforms. Streaming shows offered either the highest or the second highest rate of representation for recurring characters who are Black, Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern or Native American.\n Representation for Latinx, who make up 18% of the US population, was the lowest among racial and ethnic groups. But the highest share of recurring Latinx cast members was found on streaming platforms, where Latinx actors were on screen 10.1% of the time. Streaming platforms also had the highest rate of representation for recurring women characters (48.9%) and LGBTQ characters (8.3%).\n \"[Streaming] programming represents several identity groups well, helping us understand why more diverse audiences are subscribing to streaming services than the general population,\" the study's authors wrote.\n Cable ranked lowest for representation of Black, Latinx, Asian, Middle Eastern and Native American actors.\n \"Nearly one-third of the content on cable doesn't have parity representation of people of color, women or LGBTQ talent,\" the study's authors wrote. \"The cable industry has the greatest opportunity to increase parity in on-screen portrayals of many diverse populations.\"\n Corley said older Black and Latinx viewers are still more likely to watch cable or broadcast TV, but younger audiences of all races are turning to streaming platforms at higher rates for a variety of reasons, including content diversity.\n Shows such as \"Bridgerton\" on Netflix, \"The Mandalorian\" on Disney+ and Amazon Prime's \"The Boys,\" which all prominently feature actors of color and women in starring roles, have received rave reviews from critics and audiences.\n \"There's a longstanding habit of viewing traditional television,\" Corley said. \"What streaming is offering is some additional complement to the choice that [viewers] have, especially if they want to be seen.\"",

        "title": "'The White Tiger' presents a searing look at India's caste system",
        "body_text": "\"The White Tiger\" is one of those movies that would likely struggle to claw out much attention without Netflix's muscle behind it, underscoring the streaming service's ability to lead people to worthwhile films they might not see -- in this case, a sobering adaptation of Aravind Adiga's award-winning book that dissects India's caste system.\n The action unfolds through the eyes of Balram (Adarsh Gourav), who narrates his story -- beginning in 2007 -- from the vantagepoint of a newly minted tycoon, writing a letter to the visiting Chinese premier requesting the opportunity to meet with him. The narrative then flashes back, revealing Balram as the \"low-born\" servant to an imperious and corrupt family, obediently operating as their driver.\n How did he get from there to here in just three years, escaping the endemic poverty that writer-director Ramin Bahrani portrays in illuminating detail? Therein lies the mystery, filling the movie with a sense of foreboding that's enhanced by the narration, which at one point includes a warning that things are about to get \"much darker.\"\n Strangers to the particulars of India's class system might be shocked by the depiction of how the lives of the poor are viewed. Balram exhibits real academic promise as a child, before an unfortunate turn of events forces him to begin working in order to provide for his family.\n \"I never saw the inside of a school again,\" he recalls, with the same matter-of-fact tone he brings to even the most harrowing parts of his life.\n The central relationship for Balram turns out to be his involvement with Ashok (Rajkummar Rao), the family's American-educated son who has returned home, and Ashok's US-raised wife, Pinky (Priyanka Chopra Jonas, also a producer of the film). While they come to rely on Balram, they frequently treat him horribly -- almost like a non-person -- a reminder of structural inequities and the way they foster abusive behavior.\n It's a remarkable central performance by Gourav, whose character shrewdly schemes in order to get hired as Ashok's driver. Yet his efforts to convey an outward image of happy servitude are regularly challenged, while his boss (or \"master,\" as Balram calls him) can turn on the cruelty at a moment's notice.\n The book and film derive the title from the rarest of animals, hinting at the qualities that will be necessary to allow Balram to make the leap from prey to predator, graduating from low-born person to his current persona's high-class problems.\n The final act isn't quite equal to the build-up, but by then, \"The White Tiger\" has already pretty well sunk its teeth into you, making the investment in understanding Balram's fate feel like two hours well spent.\n \"The White Tiger\" premieres Jan. 22 on Netflix.",

        "body_text": "Students who survived the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and families of the victims are calling for Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation, after comments surfaced that showed her agreeing with people who said the 2018 shooting was a \"false flag\" operation.\n Seventeen people, including 14 students, were killed in the shooting, which ignited a nationwide movement for stricter gun control laws spearheaded by March For Our Lives, a group started by survivors of the shooting.\n \"(T)he shooting at our school was real. Real kids died and our community is still grieving today,\" the Parkland chapter of the organization wrote in a tweet directed at Greene. \"You should be ashamed of yourself and resign from congress. Conspiracy theorists don't deserve a seat in the people's house.\"\n CNN has reached out to Greene's office for comment.\n Greene's comments came to light in a report by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. The article points to a Facebook post Greene made in 2018, sharing an article about the $8,700 monthly pension given to the school resource deputy who failed to enter the school as the shooting was ongoing.\n According to screenshots captured by MMFA, Greene agreed with commenters who said the shooting was a \"false flag\" operation, a conspiracy theory that the shooting was set up or designed to look like it was carried out by another individual or group. (Similar lies have been perpetuated about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, prompting the harassment of the victims' families.)\n One comment on Greene's post read, \"It's called a pay off to keep his mouth shut since it was a false flag planned shooting.\"\n \"Exactly,\" Greene wrote in response, per MMFA's screenshots.\n Another commenter referred to the pension as a \"(k)ick back for going along with the evil plan,\" to which Greene responded, \"My thoughts exactly!! Paid to do what he did and keep his mouth shut.\"\n Facebook removed the comments for violating its policies after the MMFA report was published, according to a Facebook spokesperson.\n Survivors of the shooting and their family members have since condemned Greene and called for her to step down.\n David Hogg, a former Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student and activist, wrote on Twitter that he had \"one message\" for Greene.\n \"Apologize Now or continue to spread these conspiracies and we will be sure to make the next 2 years of your life not only your last in Congress but a living hell as well.\"\n Hogg added that advocates would \"also accept your resignation in place of an apology.\"\n Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was killed in the shooting, tweeted at Greene after her comments came to light, writing, \"Will you be resigning? For the good of this country, you should. Parkland was not a made up false flag event. My daughter and 16 others were murdered that day.\"\n Greene did not address her past comments in a statement posted on Twitter after the MMFA story came to light. She instead argued against \"'gun-free' school zones\" saying she was once \"locked in a classroom in 11th grade\" due to a student who brought guns to her high school and \"personally\" understood students' fears.\n She also criticized the deputy, writing he \"allowed children to be left defenseless against an active shooter. When he was supposed to protect them, he was a coward and refused to go in. He allowed 17 people to die.\"\n In a separate tweet Thursday, Greene called MMFA \"communist bloggers\" who \"run the same playbook of lies and smears on people they feel threatened by.\"\n Cameron Kasky, another former student, wrote of her statement, \"This, beyond being a stupid and meaningless message, does not in any way address her calling it a false flag. Now she's playing full-on gaslight. Don't let her.\"\n Guttenberg said in response, \"You are a fraud who must resign. Be prepared to meet me directly in person to explain your conspiracy theory, and soon.\"\n Other groups calling for gun control, like Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, also called for Greene's resignation.\n \"Dangerous conspiracy theorists who peddle disinformation like Rep. Greene ever further damage the credibility of Congress,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement. \"Taylor Greene's lies traumatize the survivors of shooting tragedies and put their safety in danger. She must resign immediately.\"\n Greene, a newly elected congresswoman representing Georgia's 14th District, has displayed an affinity for conspiracy theories in the past, including QAnon, whose adherents believed former President Donald Trump was fighting a secret war against a cabal of Satan-worshiping child abusers who were running the government.\n Greene backed away from the conspiracy theory during her campaign, telling Fox News last August that QAnon \"wasn't part of my campaign\" and that she \"chose another path\" when she \"started finding misinformation.\"\n MMFA also reported on another Facebook post by Greene, in which she said she was \"told that Nancy Pelosi tells Hillary Clinton several times a month that 'we need another school shooting' in order to persuade the public to want strict gun control.\"\n CNN's KFILE has previously reported on Greene's history of peddling baseless conspiracy theories like 'Pizzagate,' a precursor to Qanon. KFILE also reported Greene once worked for a conservative blog that once questioned if the shooting in Parkland was a \"massive false flag.\"\n At the time, Greene told CNN she wore \"attacks\" from the media as a \"badge of honor,\" but did not address the past blog posts.\n CNN's Tina Burnside, Annie Grayer, Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck contributed to this report.",

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news.\n That programming shift to USA Network, another NBCUniversal-owned cable channel, includes the National Hockey League and NASCAR races.\n NBCUniversal's new streaming service Peacock will also carry some of the programming that was on NBC Sports Network starting in 2022.\n \"We're all aware of how quickly the media landscape is evolving, and our company is taking thoughtful steps to stay ahead of these trends wherever possible and, in many instances, help set them,\" said the memo from NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast (CMCSA).\n NBCU added that the move to shut down NBC Sports Network will make USA Network \"an extraordinarily powerful platform in the media marketplace.\"\n Patrick Crakes, a former Fox Sports executive turned media consultant, echoed this point to CNN Business on Friday.\n \"It makes the remaining channels and brands stronger, from NBC to Peacock,\" he said. \"Call it reverse segmentation.\"\n USA Network is arguably one of the most popular channels in NBCUniversal's lineup, and adding live sports -- some of the most vital and highly rated programming left on traditional TV -- is likely to make USA even stronger.\n Cable companies have been under strain as consumers \"cut the cord,\" choosing instead to pay for streaming services like Netflix (NFLX) rather than paying a cable bill.\n Enter Peacock. The new streaming service is the focal point of NBCUniversal's future business strategy, so having more live sports on the service provides consumers more incentives to sign up.

        "title": "Glad-handing Biden begins foreign diplomacy with the telephone",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden had been inside the White House for only two hours on Wednesday before finding an opportunity to recall one of his many intimate meals with a foreign leader who, now they are both presidents, can officially be called a counterpart.\n \"When I was with Xi Jinping -- and I was on the Tibetan plateau with him -- and he asked me in a private dinner, he and I, and we each had an interpreter, he said, 'Can you define America for me?' \" Biden recounted during a swearing-in ceremony for new staffers. He said he responded simply: \"Possibilities.\"\n The anecdote, harkening to his 2011 supper inside a Chengdu hotel restaurant, was designed to offer Biden's view of the American dream as he assumed the presidency. But it also acted as an intentional reminder that he enters the job with a long history of cultivating international actors who he will now face as an equal -- and, in some cases, an adversary.\n He launches his global efforts Friday afternoon with a call to Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a reliably traditional first diplomatic outing that nonetheless comes laden with some tension: Biden has revoked a permit for the $9 billion Keystone XL pipeline, which would funnel oil from Alberta across the border to the United States.\n Trudeau, who in the Donald Trump era staked out a world position as a champion of combating climate change, nevertheless said he was \"disappointed\" in the decision.\n It was highly unlikely the matter would cause his relationship with Biden to sour too much; the same issue came between Trudeau and President Barack Obama and they seemed to get on marvelously. Trudeau will find in Biden a more like-minded partner on any manner of topics, including the environment. And he'll find Biden a more stable presence in Washington than his predecessor, who stalked away early from a G7 summit Trudeau hosted in the northern woods of Quebec declaring him \"very dishonest and weak.\"\n Biden will also speak Friday to Mexico's President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, another traditional first conversation for a new US leader.\n Long a proponent of developing personal relationships with his interlocutors -- be it Republicans, business leaders or foreign heads of state -- Biden enters office already knowing many of the figures he will be dealing with at global summits, in bilateral meetings and over the telephone. His stated goal is to reestablish the United States as a global arbiter of the international order and, as he said during his inaugural speech Wednesday, \"repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.\"\n That is starkly different from how Trump began his career in foreign diplomacy. As President-elect in 2016, he answered whichever leader happened to have found his cell phone number rather than arranging calls through the State Department. That led to embarrassing moments for leaders such as then-British Prime Minister Theresa May, whose ambassador in Washington scrambled to reach someone close enough to Trump who could get him on the phone with America's top ally.\n Once in office, the foreign leader calls at first seemed more organized. There were lists drawn up, times arranged and briefing cards prepared. But Trump, who mostly ignored the talking points offered by national security aides, often veered off-script and talked about what he wanted.\n In one early call, he grew irate about a refugee agreement and essentially hung up on Australia's Prime Minister. In another, he pleaded with Mexico's President to drop his opposition to a border wall. Speaking with strongmen such as Russian's Vladimir Putin or Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he often appeared to aides outplayed, leading some US officials to privately worry the calls amounted to a national security threat.\n And those were the phone calls that other officials knew about. Trump readily handed his cell phone number to his counterparts at summits. And after his phone call with Ukraine's President triggered his first impeachment, the circle of people who could listen in was dramatically reduced.\n Biden is unlikely to adopt a similar approach, though one commonality may be his devotion to personal relationships over stacks of briefing books and talking points.\n \"I've met every major world leader in the last 35 years -- not because I'm important, but because of the nature of my job,\" he said on the campaign trail last year.\n \"I always would kid (Obama) -- I'd say all politics is personal, particularly international relations,\" Biden added. \"You've got to know the other man or woman's soul, and who they are, and make sure they know you.\"\n Many of them already do. Biden has met Putin on multiple occasions, including when the Russian leader was showing off his office in Moscow and Biden told him, inches from his face, that he didn't believe he had a soul.\n He will be the fourth US president to forge a relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who he knows from his regular attendance at the Munich Security Conference. He will eventually need to form a relationship with whoever replaces Merkel after she steps down this year.\n Biden did not deal closely with French President Emmanuel Macron, who was first elected in 2017, during his time as vice president.\n But his relationship with Xi has became the stuff of near-legend. The two traveled more than 10,000 miles together and sat for hours of private dinners in China and the United States when they were each other's counterparts and Biden was dispatched to take the temperature of China's heir apparent.\n More complicated may be the leaders who cultivated Trump for their own political ends, such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n Already, Johnson has chosen not to make an issue of Biden's decision to move a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office -- a distant cry from his reaction when Obama did the same thing and he blamed the \"part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire.\"\n \"Obviously it's the job of all UK Prime Ministers to have a very close relationship with the President, a close working relationship with the President, and a good working relationship with the President of the United States,\" Johnson said this week. \"And actually, when you look at the issues that unite me and Joe Biden, the UK and the United States right now, there is a fantastic joint common agenda.\"\n Administration officials said they do not expect foreign leaders to start visiting the White House in the near term. Under Trump, foreign leader visits also fell off during the pandemic, though some -- including Poland's hard-right leader and Israel's Netanyahu -- did make the trek.\n Even the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit by the Irish leader in March seems in question; Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said on CNN this week there hasn't been a decision on whether to proceed amid the pandemic.\n \"I did invite President Biden to Ireland,\" Martin told Christiane Amanpour. \"He jokingly said to me: 'Try and keep me out.' \"\n In reality, Biden officials do not expect the President to travel abroad while the pandemic continues to rage, even though he would like to begin flying overseas.\n \"Despite his desire -- my desire, if that matters -- to do a foreign trip, I think it will be a bit of time,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. \"I don't have an update when that will take place at this point.\"\n This year's roster of summits could take Biden first to the United Kingdom, where Johnson is hosting the G7 at a seaside resort in Cornwall in June. In the fall, the G20 is scheduled for Rome. And Johnson is again hosting leaders in Glasgow for a climate conference in November.\n Biden himself has pledged to convene a Summit for Democracy during his first year in office, though details -- including its guest list, location and whether it will be assembled in person -- haven't been revealed.\n That leaves, for now, the telephone as Biden's principal tool for diplomacy, starting at 5 p.m. ET on Friday with Trudeau and later with L\u00f3pez Obrador. Psaki said Biden would speak with leaders from Europe next week.\n Though phone calls are devoid of the chemistry found in the one-on-one dinners Biden has cherished, he is not starting from scratch.\n One of his final trips as vice president was to a state dinner Trudeau held in his honor during the concluding days of the Obama administration. Speaking on that snowy Ottawa evening in a hall that included former prime ministers and Canadian politicians, Biden hewed toward his personal connections to the country and its leaders.\n He mentioned that his first wife, Neilia, had family connections to Toronto. He recounted how his two sons had wanted to be \"Mounties\" when they grew up. And he cited a phone call he had received from Trudeau's father, Pierre, who was then serving as Prime Minister himself, in 1972 after his wife and daughter died in a Christmastime car accident.\n \"I lost my part of my family,\" Biden said. \"And your dad not only was decent and honorable, but he reached out. He reached out and commiserated with me about the loss of my wife and daughter.\"\n As he concluded, he made this appeal to Trudeau, who at that point seemed to be replacing Obama as the world's preeminent liberal: \"Vive le Canada. Because we need you very, very badly.\"",

        "body_text": "Welcome to the Biden administration. It's devoid of controversial tweets (so far) -- but still involves some fireworks.\n Two weeks after the nation witnessed an attack on the US Capitol, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in to office in a ceremony full of pomp and circumstance. It felt worlds away from the militarized zone established around the Capitol, in the face of threats against the peaceful transfer of power.\n As expected, former President Donald Trump skipped his successor's inauguration. Air Force One, with Trump on board, lifted skyward to the final notes of Frank Sinatra's \"My Way.\" A fitting final note to a presidency conducted outside of so many norms.\n Now Biden faces the challenges of actually running the country. On his first day in office, he issued a flurry executive orders, ranging from a federal mask mandate to reentering the United States in the Paris climate accord. And it's only the beginning. Soon his relationships with legislators will be put to the test as he attempts to pass his $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan.\n On Capitol Hill, members are still grappling with responding to the January 6 violent insurrection -- and new signs of unity are hard to find. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy walked back his comments a week earlier laying blame at the feet of Trump for the insurrection. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised an investigation into what happened. Some Democrats say they still don't feel safe among colleagues.\n House Democrats at last indicated they will send the article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday. Leaders hammered out a deal Friday evening that will delay the start of arguments in the trial until February 9. The new (and very narrow) Democratic majority will now have two weeks before they must juggle work between the new President's policies and the former president's impeachment trial.",

Fourth quarter deliveries \"continued to recover strongly\" and outpaced the previous three months.\n Volkswagen made nearly twice as much money in 2019, posting a profit of \u20ac19.3 billion ($23.5 billion) on sales of \u20ac252 billion ($306.6 billion). But shares in the company jumped as much as 6% in Frankfurt on Friday, suggesting that investors were expecting an even more precipitous drop in earnings.\n Carmakers suffered a collapse in sales and disruption in supply chains during the early months of the pandemic. They are now facing a critical shortage of semiconductors that threatens to hamstring production just as the industry tries to stage a comeback.\n Volkswagen has had to adapt production at plants in China, North America and Europe this quarter and could lose out on 100,000 units, or roughly 4% of global quarterly output, as a result of the components shortages, according to UBS analysts.\n The German carmaker, which also owns the Audi and Porsche brands, said last week that it \"slightly expanded\" its share of the worldwide passenger car market in 2020. It delivered 9.3 million vehicles, a drop of 15.2% from 2019. Deliveries held up better in China, its single largest market, declining 9% compared with a 20% slump in Europe.\n Deliveries of battery electric vehicles hit 231,600, more than three times the volume in 2019. Plug-in hybrid deliveries surged 175% to 190,500 units.\n It appears that traditional carmakers \"can manage the transition to electric mobility much better than feared,\" Bernstein senior analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note to clients on Friday. \"Investors need to wake up to the excessively low valuation of traditional car makers, especially in the context of valuation for everything 'new mobility,'\" he added.\n Despite making just 500,000 vehicles in 2020, electric car leader Tesla (TSLA) is worth $800 billion, eight times Volkswagen's market capitalization.\n In his very first tweet this week, and perhaps as a sign of growing confidence at the German industrial giant, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess mentioned the company's push into electric vehicles, tagging Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",

        "title": "Burial ground reveals Stone Age people wore clothing covered in elk teeth",
        "body_text": "Elk teeth pendants may have been the jewelry of choice for at least one Stone Age group that lived 8,200 years ago.\n A Stone Age burial ground on a small Russian island revealed more than 4,300 Eurasian elk teeth pendants found in 84 separate burials. The placement of the pendants in these graves suggests they were attached to coats, dresses, cloaks, belts and headdresses -- although the clothing itself has not survived the passage of time.\n The island, only about 1.5 miles across, is called Yuzhniy Oleniy Ostrov, and it's located in Lake Onega, found in Russia's Republic of Karelia.\n In addition to the elk teeth, there was also a significant dusting of red ocher in the graves, a natural clay pigment used for ornamentation and other purposes.\n Ornaments and other goods recovered from ancient graves paint a picture of what different cultures were like, as well as what was important or sacred to them.\n University of Helsinki archaeologist Kristiina Mannermaa and her colleagues studied the elk teeth, now housed at the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St. Petersburg, in an attempt to understand their significance and learn more about the people buried with the pendants.\n The study published last month in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.\n While some of the pendants in the graves came from beaver or bear teeth, many were made from elk incisors.\n \"The share of elk teeth in them is overwhelming,\" Mannermaa said.\n Elks have eight incisors each. The largest ornamentation the researchers analyzed required teeth from eight to 18 elks. These large animals were sparse in the forest zone where these people lived and were not killed often.\n The elk was the most important animal for Eurasian prehistoric hunter-gatherers, both in ideology and beliefs, according to the researchers.\n The highest number of elk teeth were found in the graves of young women and men, which has suggested they could be associated with a person's peak years reproductively. The lowest amount were found in the graves of children and the elderly.\n The researchers analyzed how the pendants were made and found the process was identical: Small grooves were made at the tip of the tooth's root so the pendants could be attached to items.\n The groove patterns were usually the exact same in individual graves or clusters of graves, which means they were created quickly using a process easier than perforating the teeth with holes for attachment. The researchers also believe that the patterns reflect a tradition of grooving within this culture.\n \"Interestingly, the grooves were not always made on the broadest side of the tooth, which would be the easiest option. In many graves, the grooves are on the thin side of the tooth where the unstable position of the tooth makes them harder to do. The artisan may have resorted to this method in order to tie them in a specific position,\" said Riitta Rainio, study coauthor and researcher at the University of Helsinki, in a statement.\n While these groove patterns likely would not have been visible, they may have affected the positioning of the pendants or caused them to rattle in a way associated with cultural communications, the researchers said.\n Eurasian indigenous cultures, including the current S\u00e1mi communities across Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia's Kola Peninsula, have used decorations as symbols of someone's origins and identity. These ornaments also strengthen communication and uniformity within their communities.\n Pendants like these could also be used to identify a neighboring community, much like Mannermaa refers to this group as the people of grooved elk tooth pendants.\n \"Hunter-gatherers were very mobile, and the intensive network of waterways connecting Lake Onega across a huge geographical area in all directions offered easy routes for people to move, build contacts and mix genes with each other,\" the authors wrote in the study.\n \"Based on our observations, we suggest that elk teeth were associated with the lived life of the buried people and that pendants were personal belongings of the deceased. Their importance was something more profound and meaningful than a mere symbol of wealth.\"",

        "body_text": "Lindsey Graham is a lawyer -- in addition to being the senior senator from South Carolina. Which means he should know way better than what he is doing in advance of former President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial.\n According to The Wall Street Journal, Graham personally recommended South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers to Trump as the ex-President was searching for lawyers willing and able to represent him in the coming trial. Talking to reporters on Thursday, Graham called Bowers the \"anchor\" of Trump's now-forming legal team, adding: \"I've known Butch for a long time, solid guy. And I think, you know, over time, they'll put the team together.\"\n So, let's just hit the \"pause\" button for a minute and go through what we now know.\n Graham will be one of the 100 jurors in the impeachment trial argued in front of the Senate in the coming days. As such, he will play a critical role in deciding whether Trump should be convicted of incitement of the crowd gathered at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Washington, DC on January 6 -- a crowd that went on to violently storm the US Capitol.\n And yet, despite that role, Graham is also doing double duty as an adviser to the ex-President about who should be on the legal team tasked with making the case to Graham and his colleagues.\n Uh, what? This feels wrong?\n Look, I know that a Senate impeachment trial isn't the same thing as a trial in the court of law where what Graham is doing simply can't be done. But wouldn't you think that Graham would be interested in maintaining a semblance of neutrality or impartiality given the fact that we are talking about whether to convict a former president?\n Yes, yes you would.\n Unless, of course, you are talking about Graham, who, after serving as one of Trump's most vocal critics during the 2016 primary fight, has, er, evolved into one of his staunchest allies. And who, despite occasionally saying Trump has gone too far, always seems to come back to his side.\n Remember that it was Graham who, in the hours following the January 6 riot, took to the Senate floor to declare that his long bromance with Trump was over.\n \"Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey,\" Graham said. \"I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it. From my point of view he's ... been a consequential president. But today, first thing you'll see. All I can say, is count me out, enough is enough.\"\n He hated for the relationship to end so much, in fact, that he didn't end it at all. Less than a week after his \"count me out\" comments, Graham was flying on  Air Force One with Trump to inspect the southern border wall. And as the House prepared to impeach Trump for a second time, Graham released a statement warning that \"supporting the impeachment of President Trump under these circumstances will do great damage to the institutions of government and could invite further violence at a time the President is calling for calm.\"\n And, yes, he was serious.\n On one hand, Graham's willingness to advise a former president who he is also constitutionally tasked with sitting in judgment of is just more of the same for Graham. On the other, it's incredibly disappointing that he seems to prioritize his friendship with Trump over his duties and responsibilities as a senator.",

        "body_text": "For Caroline Brant, attempting to get a vaccine appointment for her in-laws in Pennsylvania felt like trying to \"win a seat at the big show.\"\n \"Except in Pennsylvania, there's no show yet,\" she told CNN. \"Just spinning sites.\"\n The 48-year-old, who lives in Collegeville, is referring to the confusion over websites where those eligible for the vaccine can sign up for a coveted slot to receive one.\n At the moment, in most states, those eligible include health care workers and seniors. But many of the nation's 50 million seniors, including Brant's in-laws, have been struggling to figure out how to navigate the various websites that provide information about the vaccine or allow people to sign up.\n \"My in-laws did not ask for my help but I could tell right away that it was a logistical nightmare,\" Brant said. \"None of them even knew where to start.\"\n That's why Brant, who owns a toy store, offered her assistance. She said she's also helping some of her employees who are seniors, and her own parents, who are based in Arizona.\n And she's not the only one -- as the vaccine rollout continues in states nationwide, confusion increases around how to sign up for one. Vaccine distribution plans can differ from state to state, and in some cases, county to county.\n As a result, many are stepping up to try and help their loved ones who are eligible for the vaccine, but confused about how to go about it, get their appointments.\n Communication to the public on which phase a state is in, how to find a vaccine and where to go to get the shot is left up to the state, typically the state health department, which may then leave it up to the counties to organize and administer.\n However, regardless of location, people nationwide have experienced the same frustration when trying to get an appointment for a loved one: The booking process has proved harder than it should be.\n \"I'm in the waiting room. My 81-year-old dad would have never been able to figure this out on his own,\" one person in Minnesota wrote in a tweet. \"Our seniors need family to do this for them, and many seniors don't have family to help them.\"\n \"Sitting in front of a computer clicking refresh constantly in the hope of being the first to have access to Eventbrite when an event goes live,\" another person tweeted. \"That event? A possible COVID vaccination for my parents. That's right. Florida is running it's vaccine program through Eventbrite.\"\n In the absence of a national or statewide distribution plan, several counties in Florida used Eventbrite, an event scheduling and ticketing site, to distribute their limited number of vaccine doses on a first come, first served basis to eligible groups of people. This includes residents who are 65 and older.\n At least three of the counties using Eventbrite for vaccine distribution -- Pasco, Collier and Sarasota -- have recently acknowledged scams on the platform.\n Nancy Morrow-Howell, director of the Harvey A. Friedman Center for Aging at Washington University in St. Louis, told CNN Business earlier this month that platforms such as Eventbrite are inaccessible to \"the most disadvantaged people.\"\n Will Howell, who is based in Oakland, California, said he's been helping his 75-year-old mother -- who has diabetes -- sign up for a vaccine in Evanston, Illinois. There, he said, the city is using a different internet site to help coordinate vaccine appointments.\n \"The city is making people fill out SurveyMonkey forms in order to gauge their priority level,\" Howell told CNN.\n The City of Evanston said in a Facebook post January 7 that the SurveyMonkey form is \"not a vaccine registration form,\" but a \"vaccination interest form.\"\n Howell, 41, said he filled out the form for his mother after spending hours searching through multiple websites -- including the Chicago Tribune, Twitter and the city of Evanston's website -- to try to find instructions.\n \"Hopefully it's not going just into the ether,\" he said of the form, which he submitted Wednesday.\n Even before the pandemic, 50-year-old Amanda Rykoff said she was \"tech support\" for her parents, assisting them with their computers, cable box and internet connection.\n So when her parents, ages 84 and 78, became eligible for the vaccine in Los Angeles -- where they are based -- Rykoff said she volunteered to help them sign up.\n \"Honestly I didn't know much about the process,\" she told CNN. \"I had heard through friends on social media that the website was confusing. ... I knew that the website would be hard to follow.\"\n When she first tried to book an appointment for her father, a cancer survivor, the LA County Department of Health website said he wasn't eligible for the vaccine yet and would likely have to wait until May.\n Tuesday, however, news came that all LA County residents over the age of 65 were eligible for the vaccine even if they weren't health care workers -- so Rykoff quickly called her parents and went on the county's vaccination website.\n \"I must have accessed the site before it crashed later in the afternoon,\" she said. She clicked through a few screens before reaching the one designated for making appointments. She successfully booked one for Thursday at noon, at the Forum's drive-thru site.\n \"I was fortunate to have no technical issues with the booking website,\" she said. \"I am technologically competent and can work my way around websites, even if they aren't intuitive.\"\n For James Weitz, who is also from Los Angeles, it took weeks of hunting to find and schedule vaccine appointments for his parents, 82-year-old Dolores and 88-year-old Allen. He described the process as \"frustrating, chaotic and depressing.\"\n \"This is America. We're supposed to do everything well. We win in the Olympics,\" Weitz said of the ordeal.\n Weitz said he and his parents initially tried to schedule appointments at a grocery store, at hospitals and through the Los Angeles County Health department -- but brief openings on websites vanished before they could schedule shots. Other times the websites froze.\n \"I think there's just not that many vaccines available,\"  Weitz said. \"When you see an appointment, it goes just like that.\"\n Others were also successful -- or as they describe it, lucky -- but only after several tries.\n \"It took multiple attempts because the slot would be gone before we complete the process,\" said Phoenix resident Ryan Newell, who booked appointments for his parents in Arizona. \"It took about four attempts, and I had to register my parents separately.\"\n \"We were also not able to edit appointments, so if we had entered something wrong in the registration process we had to start over,\" he added.\n He said his parents, ages 68 and 70, needed some convincing before they let him book the appointments for them. He and his sister, Jennifer Newell Davies, who is in San Diego, eventually succeeded.\n \"They seemed to have little faith that it would be a viable process and that the state could even execute it, so they seemed to give up before they started,\" Newell told CNN. \"However, I convinced them to sign up to at least give it a try. I did most of the sign up process for them online during my lunch break.\"\n The problems are down to local health departments stretched thin after 10 months of the pandemic, plus decades of underinvestment in infrastructure to deal with a mass vaccination effort.\n Public officials have raised concerns over the technology and communication issues that many cities face with their vaccine distribution plans.\n \"I am concerned this signals twin failures of outreach and technology by the City,\" New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer wrote in a tweet on a Sunday, noting that there were 200 vaccine appointments unfilled for the following week.\n Matt Haney, a San Francisco Board of Supervisors member, asked his Twitter followers to voice their complaints about the sign-up process so he could help address them.\n \"SF DPH has started to schedule people for the vaccine who are 65+ who are in the SF Health Network,\" he wrote in a January 18 tweet. \"Kaiser & and other networks also scheduling appts. Still not enough clarity and answers. Please share w me your experiences and questions, it will help me advocate & improve things.\"\n Unsurprisingly, he received a slew of responses -- with some suggesting the city create a vaccine dashboard that aggregates vaccine distribution, and others just sharing their grievances.\n \"Seriously the comments I'm getting are raising my blood pressure -- everyone is fighting to get their loved ones an appointment, and most are failing,\" wrote Dr. Arghavan Salles, a Palo Alto-based Covid-19 disaster relief physician.\n In Pennsylvania, Brant echoed similar frustration. She said she's felt the \"knowledge flow has been a complete disaster because everyone is wasting tons of time trying to find information, and there's no clear direction on how to make sure you're signed up.\"\n \"It's causing a lot of unnecessary stress,\" she said. \"And if we knew we could just sign up, get on a list and be notified when it's our turn, that would be great.\"\n CNN's Paul Vercammen, Sandee LaMotte and Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Amanda Gorman reminded America what poetry can do",
        "body_text": "Ashley M. Jones is a native of Birmingham, Alabama. She is the author of the poetry collections REPARATIONS NOW!, dark // thing, and Magic City Gospel. She directs the Magic City Poetry Festival and teaches at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nIt is no secret what poetry can do. What Black poetry can do.\n Audre Lorde told us this in 1977. Although she spoke specifically to women, I hope she won't mind me saying that her words can apply to other folks, too. She wrote: \"poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our existence. It forms the quality of the light within which we predicate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action.\"\n And it's true -- as I watched 22-year-old National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman read her piece, \"The Hill We Climb,\" at President Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday, I felt affirmed in my belief that art is the thing that has and will keep saving us. Poetry, by which I mean the words on a page and the life-force Lorde spoke of, is part of what will help us understand, as Gorman told us, that we must reckon with \"the past we step into,\" that the work is in \"how we repair it.\"\n What is so important to me, a Black Southern woman who writes her authentic truth in verse, is the incredible door Gorman is opening and will keep opening for us in poetry. As I watched her, gorgeous as she is, walking up to that inaugural podium wearing her red Prada headband like a crown, in her striking yellow coat -- a sun only mirrored by the light emanating from her -- I was so proud of Amanda Gorman.\n I was proud to know that she would stand there, not as a mouthpiece for an administration but with her own voice against White patriarchy and oppression. I was proud that she offered celebration for the end of the last four horrific years. I was proud because she accepted the challenge of writing for this very dizzying occasion, because she spoke to the pain of living in a country which has not always been kind to us, and because she was there, visible and glowing, a young Black woman letting us know that her words matter.\n Gorman affirmed my seven-year-old self, just discovering what it meant to have a voice through poetry, standing before her second grade classmates reciting \"Harriet Tubman\" by Eloise Greenfield. She affirmed my desire to make ways for all of us to write and participate in making art without gatekeeping or exclusion. She affirmed me today, 30 years old and writing my thoughts into language and action -- action that can impact my city of Birmingham or the whole nation. She affirmed the hope I have for my young students at the Alabama School of Fine Arts -- that they will see themselves, already, as writers and as vital parts of our American story.\n I have been, like many Americans, incensed by these last four years which were, we know, just a natural extension of the underbelly of White supremacist thought that has haunted our nation since its founding. I have been at times frustrated and afraid for my life. One change of president doesn't erase that fear, but in her command of the inaugural stage and international attention, Gorman allowed me to take a breath and celebrate that at least this one, president-shaped roadblock to equality was gone. She brought poetry into the conversation. To hold a poet up as a vital part of this transition of power makes me hopeful.\n And I cannot lie -- it's always a good day to be a Black woman, and Wednesday was no exception. I was so happy to see the many examples of Black women doing what we do so well -- shining. Michelle Obama stunning in her oxblood suit and her undimmable sparkle, Vice President Harris's eyes lit up with joy as she swore the oath administered by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and of course, the spectacular Gorman speaking through that winter DC air with her words.\n Maybe a poem won't literally pass legislation or deflect a bullet from exploding in my Black body, but a poem is what makes our hearts move. It does make people think, reflect, and it can even lead to empathy. We need that. That quality of light where hopes and dreams can live is what this country needs, and you can count on the artists to keep fueling all of our movements for liberation. Thank you, Amanda Gorman, for being a brilliant example.\n This op-ed has been updated to correct the year of initial publication of Audre Lorde's essay \"Poetry Is Not a Luxury.\"",

        "body_text": "The Vermont school teacher behind the cozy mittens worn by Senator Bernie Sanders during President Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday said she's been flooded with requests from people wanting to buy a pair. But they're no longer for sale.\n \"Thanks for all the interest in Bernie's mittens!\" Jen Ellis wrote on Twitter. \"I'm so flattered that Bernie wore them to the inauguration. Sadly, I have no more mittens for sale. There are a lot of great crafters on ETSY who make them.\"\n A few years ago, Ellis, who teaches second grade, gave the Vermont senator the patterned, hand-knit \"smittens\" \u2014 part mittens, part sweater \u2014 on the campaign trail. But she didn't expect he'd start wearing them at high-profile events like the inauguration. The mittens are made from repurposed wool sweaters and lined with fleece made from recycled plastic bottles, she said in a tweet last year.\n They're now an iconic accessory in the \"grumpy chic\" meme of Sanders sitting with his arms crossed in a puffy jacket and blue mask. Across social media this week, Sanders has been Photoshopped onto the Game of Thrones throne, transported into historical photographs, shrunken down to fit onto former First Lady Melania Trump's dress and seen outside your doorstep via a new app that uses Google Maps.\n The image is also being sold on T-shirts, mugs and as a $25 bobble head. Some sellers on Etsy are already touting \"Bernie inspired\" mittens. Last year, online merchants cashed in on the fly that buzzed on former Vice President Mike Pence during the debate against Kamala Harris. The Biden campaign sold more than 35,000 fly swatters with the slogan, \"truth over flies,\" a play on the campaign's slogan \"truth over lies.\"\n \"I hate to disappoint people, but the mittens, they're one of a kind and they're unique and, sometimes in this world, you just can't get everything you want,\" she told the news site.\n The virality and levity of the Bernie meme is reminiscent of more carefree days of the internet. As one Twitter user captured it, \"The Bernie Sanders memes and photoshops are what the world needs right now.\"\n This isn't the first time the mittens have been in the spotlight either. Last year, Sanders wore them to the Women's March in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; some called them \"oven mitts\" and a dedicated Twitter account, @BerniesMittens, was born. At the time, Ellis said she was \"humbled by the support\" and \"what started out as a simple act of kindness more than 2 years ago has grown into something beyond my imagination.\"\n She added: \"This mitten frenzy is really distracting me from getting my mid-year report cards done.\"\n In a statement to CNN on Thursday, Sanders said the meme this week \"makes people aware that we make good mittens in Vermont. ... We have some good coats as well.\"",

        "body_text": "States may be scrambling for vaccines now, but the United States could see additional Covid-19 vaccines by the end of March, if not sooner.\n Millions of vaccine doses could be added to the pipeline in the coming months, perhaps easing the squeeze that Americans have felt as vaccines slowly start rolling out.\n Janssen, the vaccine arm of Johnson & Johnson, plans to have results from its late-stage clinical trials ready for the US Food and Drug Administration to consider within weeks.\n \"Johnson & Johnson is right around the corner ... right around the corner means that they're probably a couple of weeks away from getting the data looked at, to have the FDA evaluate whether or not we're in a situation where we could move ahead and start thinking about getting it out into the public,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday.\n Dozens of vaccines are being tested in labs around the world. At least 11 are in late stage clinical trials, according to Bio, a global trade association representing biotech companies.\n In the US, there are three frontrunners.\n Johnson & Johnson is the most likely to nest seek emergency use authorization from the FDA.\n \"This advantage goes up in neon,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an internist and infectious disease specialist with Vanderbilt University's Department of Health Policy. \"This would be the first one to be given in a single dose.\"\n A single does would mean more people could be vaccinated, as none would need to be set aside to give someone a second shot. That would be a huge advantage at a time when vaccines are hard to come by.\n J&J's other advantage is that it can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which needs special deep freezers.\n \"If they're successful, these vaccines would especially be popular in the developing world, because they would be easy to store and administer,\" said Dr. Rafi Ahmed, the director of the Vaccine Center at Emory University.\n Schaffner said adding a vaccine like this would \"really accelerate\" vaccination efforts in the US too.\n \"In other words, we could bring the vaccine to the people,\" Schaffner said, \"rather than bringing the people to the vaccine.\"\n Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine was made through a collaboration of J&J's Belgium-based vaccine division, Janssen Pharmaceutical and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It is what is known as a non-replicating viral vector vaccine, using a common cold virus called adenovirus 26.\n \"So you're not being infected with the virus that can give you Covid-19 when you get this vaccine. It just has some of the harmless Covid virus proteins on its surface,\" explained Schaffner. \"So essentially it's a sheep in wolf's clothing, and when your immune system sees it, it responds to it and creates protection against it and in the future, against the real virus that causes Covid-19.\"\n Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the Moderna, Pfizer and J&J Covid-19 vaccines all take a similar approach, but there is a small difference with the J&J approach.\n \"In the case of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine you're just giving the gene in a lipid nanoparticle or a fat droplet,\" Offit said. \"In the case of J&J you're giving the gene in a virus that can't reproduce itself.\"\n The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccine has worked with Janssen's Ebola vaccine.\n The AstraZeneca vaccine is already being used in a few countries. It was authorized in the UK in December, and in Brazil in January, but the FDA will likely want to use US data for any emergency use authorization in the US, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, said last Tuesday.\n The AstraZeneca vaccine is also a vector vaccine. Like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, it employs an adenovirus to carry the genetic instructions for making spike protein from the coronavirus into cells to generate antibodies. AstraZeneca's vaccine, developed with Oxford University, uses a virus that infects chimpanzees but doesn't make people sick.\n As with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, this Covid-19 vaccine would require two shots.\n The trials so far have had some confusing results, but show it could provide up to about 70% protection. The FDA paused US trials last year after questions about adverse reactions in volunteers, but it cleared up the questions and resumed.\n The Novavax Phase 3 trial started in the US in December. The trial is enrolling up to 30,000 volunteers at 115 sites in the US and Mexico.\n The Novavax candidate is a protein-based vaccine created out of the genetic sequence for the novel coronavirus.\n The company uses virus-like nanoparticles as a base and scientists cover the base with the genetically engineered pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.\n This vaccine is given in two doses, 21 days apart.\n This kind of vaccine has been successfully used with other diseases like the shot for HPV and Sanofi's flu vaccine.\n Novavax said it expects to have results with its Covid-19 vaccine by early first quarter of this year. The first quarter ends March 31.\n CNN's Jacqueline Howard, Maggie Fox and Andrea Diaz contributed to this report",

        "title": "Ford will recall 3 million vehicles for airbag problems, after losing fight with safety regulator",
        "body_text": "Ford is recalling 3 million US and Canadian vehicles with airbags manufactured by the same company whose devices have been linked to at least 18 deaths in the United States.\n The recall centers on a defect in airbags made by Takata, a now-bankrupt Japanese manufacturer. Another version of the Takata airbag had a defect in the inflator that caused a number of the bags to explode, spraying shrapnel through the vehicle. In addition to the 18 deaths, more than 400 drivers or passengers have been injured, including being blinded or maimed.\n Recalls linked to the Takata airbags began in 2014, and, in aggregate, ultimately became the largest auto recall in history. Prior to this week's announcement, the US portion of the recall had already reached 67 million airbags in more than 40 million vehicles.\n Although the Takata airbags used by Ford are a different but similar version from those involved in the previous recalls, safety regulators said they still pose a risk.\n The NHTSA in November rejected a similar appeal by General Motors (GM), forcing the automaker to recall 7 million pickups and SUVs. The agency has also rejected an appeal from Mazda, but that covered only 5,800 US pickups that were built for the automaker.\n The models covered by the recall include the 2007 to 2011 Ford Ranger, the 2006 to 2012 Ford Fusion, the 2006 to 2012 Lincoln Zephyr, the 2007 to 2010 Ford Edge and the 2007 to 2010 Lincoln MKX. The Mazda vehicles being recalled are the 2007 to 2009 B-Series pickup trucks.\n Owners will be notified if their vehicle is included in the recall, or they can enter the VIN number on this site. Ford will repair the airbags, and vehicle owners will not be charged.\n It will cost Ford $610 million to replace the airbags as a result of NHTSA's decision. Because of Takata's bankruptcy, Ford is shouldering all costs itself.\n \"Safety is always a top priority,\" said Ford spokesperson Monique Brentley. \"Unlike other Takata passenger-side airbag parts previously under recall, these driver-side airbags contain a moisture-absorbing [material] and perform differently. We believe our extensive data demonstrated that a safety recall was not warranted for the driver-side airbag. However, we respect NHTSA's decision and will issue a recall.\"\n NHTSA officials, however, said the airbags become more subject to malfunction over time, and that the \"severity of the consequences\" to passengers and drivers when the inflators rupture was too serious. \"What Ford presents here, while valuable and informative in certain respects, suffers from far too many shortcomings,\" the agency wrote in its decision.",

        "body_text": "The 18-month old niece of Bobi Wine's wife has been safely evacuated from their residence, where she had been under house arrest with the Ugandan politician and his wife, Wine told CNN's Becky Anderson Friday.\n The baby, who has not been named, was at Wine's residence where he has been holed up since the military surrounded his home on January 15.\n \"I'm glad to inform the world that the baby was evacuated yesterday when my lawyers were very briefly allowed to come in,\" he said.\n The popstar-turned-politician, who was the main opposition frontrunner in the presidential elections on the 14th, had earlier this week tweeted he was stuck at the house with no food.\n \"Day Six under house arrest and we're still stuck with an 18 months old baby who had paid a visit to her auntie (my wife ) be4 we were raided  & besieged. The Dad has been denied access to her. We have run out of food and milk. No one is allowed to leave or come into our compound,\" he wrote.\n The US ambassador to Uganda, Natalie. E Brown, was blocked by security forces from visiting Wine on Monday.\n Wine and his wife Barbara remain under house arrest and says High Court judges will visit them on Monday.\n \"The High Court of Uganda say that they are going to be coming to our place on Monday... but in the meantime, our house is surrounded by hundreds of soldiers, and they even jumped over the fence and have taken control of our compound,\" Wine told CNN.\n \"This detention in my house is illegal, and my lawyers are ... saying if there is a case for me and my wife to answer then we should be presented before a competent court,\" he added.\n Uganda's longtime leader President Yoweri Museveni was on Saturday declared the winner for a record sixth term by the country's electoral commission.\n Wine rejects the election results, saying he has evidence of fraud and intimidation.\n \"But because Gen. Museveni is aware that he lost this election, flat -- that's why I am being kept under illegal detention, and I am not allowed to meet with my family, I'm not allowed to meet my doctor, and all my lawyers have been [stopped] from meeting me,\" he said.\n Wine says he has a declaration showing that the final results announced by the electoral commission are false. Videos also exist showing the military taking ballots and stuffing them in boxes and forcing Ugandans to vote for Museveni at gunpoint, he said.\n Wine has not shown these videos publicly and CNN was not able to independently verify this information.\n \"Even if the internet was blacked out and General Museveni ensured that the election was carried out in the dark, and even if the United States and the European [were] blocked from this election, we were able to obtain outstanding and very, very strong evidence,\" Wine said.\n The President's spokesman earlier this week referred CNN to the Uganda police when contacted for comment and implied the President knew nothing about Wine's detention.\n A Ugandan police spokesman told CNN, \"This matter is before the High Court in Kampala. Kindly wait for the outcome. Thanks.\"\n Museveni is now working with his seventh US President after Joe Biden's inauguration.\n Since he seized power following a guerrilla struggle against the government, Uganda has worked closely with successive US administrations.\n However the relationship now threatens to turn sour after repeated warnings from senior US politicians about human rights abuses.\n \"General Museveni does not want any international scrutiny,\" Wine told Anderson. \"He does not want any human rights claims. When the United States is sponsoring the military, that is an okay thing, but when they call into account Uganda's human rights, he does not want to hear that.\"\n Human rights groups and opposition candidates often accuse the security forces of abuse and blurring the line between military and police enforcement.\n \" All the state institutions are being taken overtaken by General Museveni. The police, the military, the media, every state institution including the courts of law,\" said Wine. \"No institution is independent... Everything begins and ends with General Museveni. Because it is his orders that work in Uganda, and not the law.\"",

        "title": "Biden signs orders to get checks and food aid to low-income Americans -- plus a federal pay raise",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden signed two more executive orders on Friday -- one focused on expanding food assistance and delivering stimulus checks to very low-income Americans, and the other on raising the minimum wage to $15 for the federal workforce -- as he continues his swift efforts to overturn his predecessor's policies.\n The measures build on the President's drive to aid struggling families with a $1.9 trillion relief plan that he outlined last week. The plan would send another $1,400 in additional stimulus checks, extend unemployment benefits and nutrition assistance and provide more help to renters and homeowners in need.\n That more ambitious proposal would have to go through Congress, while the steps outlined in Friday's orders don't require legislation and can be put in place faster.\n In remarks before he signed, the President listed many of the financial troubles facing Americans, including that 1 in 7 households -- more than 1 in 5 Black and Latino families -- say they don't have enough food to eat, 14 million Americans have fallen behind on their rent and 900,000 people filed for unemployment for the first time last week.\n \"This cannot be who we are as a country,\" he said. \"These are not the values of our nation. We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted because of nothing they did themselves. We cannot watch people lose their jobs. We have to act.\"\n National Economic Council Director Brian Deese argued at a White House briefing earlier in the day that the right policy move is to continue expanding aid now, rather than waiting to see whether the $900 billion aid package that Congress passed last month is sufficient. Deese pointed to a Moody's Analytics analysis that found that Biden's relief plan would create 7.5 million jobs this year and return the country to full employment a year ahead of what is otherwise projected.\n \"The single most important thing economically right now is to take decisive action,\" Deese said during the briefing. He added that he is set to speak with senators on Sunday concerning Biden's broader $1.9 trillion relief proposal.\n Tens of millions Americans continue to suffer financial hardship because of the havoc the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on the economy, which has shown signs of intensifying in recent months. The number of people filing for initial unemployment claims has increased recently, and the economy lost jobs in December for the first time since April.\n Biden has pushed for quickly adding more relief on top of the much-delayed $900 billion congressional aid package, which included $600 stimulus checks and a $300 weekly boost to unemployment benefits, as well as an 11-week extension of two key pandemic jobless programs. The measure also increased food assistance and extended eviction protections.\n Biden's latest executive order aims to boost food aid to low-income families and children and get the already-approved stimulus checks to Americans who don't routinely file taxes and aren't easily reached by the Treasury.\n Still, while Biden's efforts will provide \"a critical lifeline\" to millions of Americans, Congress still needs to act on comprehensive relief, Deese said.\n Biden has signed a raft of executive orders, actions and memorandums since being sworn in Wednesday, including immediate moves to help student loan borrowers and people facing eviction. On Thursday, he formalized steps to get the coronavirus pandemic under control.\n He is expected to sign additional orders over the coming days, according to a calendar document sent to administration allies and viewed by CNN. His agenda next week includes steps to beef up requirements for the government to purchase goods and services from US companies, a push to eliminate private prisons, reestablishing the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, rescinding the so-called Mexico City policy blocking federal funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion services, and changing border processing and refugee policies as well as establishing a family reunification task force.\n The first of Friday's executive orders calls for the Department of Agriculture to consider enhancing Pandemic-EBT benefits by 15%, which would give a family with three children more than $100 in additional support every two months. The program, part of the relief packages Congress passed last March, provides funds to low-income families whose children's schools have closed to replace the free or reduced-price meals they would have received.\n Also, the order directs the department to consider allowing states to boost food stamp benefits for about 12 million Americans who did not benefit from an earlier increase in emergency allotments included in the congressional relief packages. The order would bump up benefits for a family of four by 15% to 20% per month.\n Food insecurity has ballooned during the pandemic amid massive job losses. The relief bill lawmakers passed in December increases the maximum benefit of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as food stamps are formally known, by 15% through June. Biden's relief measure would extend it through September.\n Consumer advocates applauded Biden's measures.\n \"The most effective way to ensure families with children have enough to eat is by providing them with the resources to purchase the food they need,\" said Lisa Davis, senior vice president at Share Our Strength, which seeks to end hunger and poverty. \"And, since these benefits are spent quickly at local grocery stores and markets, they also stimulate local economies.\"\n And the President is asking the agency to look into revising its Thrifty Food Plan, which is the basis for determining food stamp benefits, to better reflect the current cost of a healthy basic diet. The calculation was established in the 1970s, and advocates say it makes unrealistic assumptions about food affordability and availability, as well as about the time families have to shop and prepare meals.\n In addition, Biden is directing the Treasury Department to consider taking a series of actions to reach the estimated 8 million people who may miss out on their stimulus payments because they don't normally file taxes.\n Most eligible adults received the money automatically. But very low-income people who don't normally file tax returns have to register with the Internal Revenue Service so it knows how to reach them. The agency created an online tool to make this process easier and has made efforts to partner with local groups that work with homeless populations. Still, experts have said the government could be more aggressive in these efforts.\n And the executive order directs the Department of Labor to consider clarifying that unemployed Americans can refuse to take jobs they fear will jeopardize their health and still qualify for unemployment benefits.\n This has become an issue during the pandemic because some out-of-work people have been afraid to accept jobs that they think will expose them to the virus. States have varied in how they have handled these situations, with Republican-led states voicing concerns that enhanced unemployment benefits are enticing people to avoid returning to work.\n Biden's second executive order is geared toward improving the jobs of federal workers and contractors, which was among the President's campaign commitments. It sets the stage for requiring contractors to pay a $15 hourly minimum wage and to provide emergency paid leave by the end of Biden's first 100 days. It also directs agencies to determine which federal workers are earning less than that minimum and develop recommendations to promote bringing them up to $15 an hour.\n The order also revokes three executive orders signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2018 that made it easier to terminate federal employees and weaken their labor unions. The measures have been the subject of litigation and arbitration.\n Biden's action directs agencies to bargain over permissible, non-mandatory subjects in contract negotiations.\n The order also eliminates the new Schedule F classification for certain federal civil service employees, which Trump created in October by executive order. Critics said Trump's move politicizes civil service and could lead to career officials being pushed out for political reasons.\n Separately, Deese said Friday that the administration will be strengthening the government's outreach efforts so that every eligible small business owner has access to federal aid.\n Too many of the smallest mom-and-pop shops, typically run by people don't have existing connections to a banking institution, missed out on getting a loan from the federal Paycheck Protection Program last year, he said.\n CNN's Katie Lobosco, Nikki Carvajal and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Why Republicans are still in charge of some key Senate proceedings as Schumer and McConnell work on power-sharing",
        "body_text": "A Senate stalled.\n That's how we start the day and end the week. The talks of bipartisanship are quickly getting ensnared by must-move Senate business, not the least of which is getting an agreement on how the Senate will be run over the next two years. It seems simple, but it's a big deal and it's proving far harder to secure than anyone had anticipated.\n The Senate is operating on the organizing resolution from the last Congress, when the GOP was in the majority. Because of that, for instance, confirmation hearings for President Joe Biden's Cabinet picks this week are being chaired by Republicans.\n Bottom line: The fight over the organizing resolution, which appeared to be a temporary disagreement on Wednesday, has reared its head as a full-out legislative crisis that could threaten to stall committee business, cast a shadow over talks about when to start the impeachment trial and constrain the first days of Chuck Schumer's role as majority leader.\n Put simply, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is making a play to exert as much power over the Senate in his new role as possible and Schumer is going to have to make some impossible choices about how to go forward.\n Schumer's announcement Friday that the impeachment article will be delivered to the Senate on Monday puts a new deadline for the Senate leaders to reach an agreement -- the impeachment logistics are part of a broader negotiation over the Senate's power-sharing agreement that remains stalled over a fight about the filibuster.\n Democrats don't want to put anything in writing. As we've underscored many times, there aren't the votes to get rid of the filibuster right now. Democratic moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have made it clear they aren't for axing the protection for the minority party anytime soon.\n But Democratic aides point out that putting that down in writing when you are at the very beginning of your new reign in power in the Senate would be unprecedented. It threatens to weaken Schumer with an invigorated base that would see the move as a massive concession in moving ahead with anything resembling a progressive agenda. It would also take a potential and powerful tool off the table if Republicans put up obstacle after obstacle to pass Biden's agenda over the next two years. As one Democratic Senate aide put it to me: right now Manchin doesn't support getting rid of the filibuster, but after eight months of obstruction, would that change his mind?\n The next several hours are going to be a critical milestone in learning how Schumer and McConnell operate now that their roles have been reversed. In the past, the interactions between the two leaders have been minimal, largely reserved to talks between their staff and passionate, dueling speeches on the Senate floor. As Majority Leader, McConnell operated swiftly and decisively with consultation from his conference, but rarely from the minority.\n This is a unique moment where Schumer has to reach an agreement with McConnell to fully unlock the powers of his new role, and that's testing a new dynamic we haven't seen between them. While the negotiations over the organizing resolution remain stuck, discussions over the timing of an impeachment trial are more of an open question right now. As CNN's Manu Raju reported Thursday night, these two items are inextricably linked, and CNN reports there was far more openness to entertaining McConnell's plan for delaying the start of the impeachment trial than there was for McConnell's suggestion that Democrats preserve the filibuster in the organizing resolution.\n Schumer said that the House's article of impeachment will be delivered to the Senate on Monday, triggering the start of the Senate's impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and rejecting McConnell's proposal to start in mid-February.\n \"I have spoken to Speaker Pelosi who informed me that the articles will be delivered to the Senate on Monday,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n McConnell's last-minute ask on Thursday night had thrown a wrench in Democratic thinking on how to run this trial, because even as of Thursday morning, House impeachment managers were prepared to send the articles as soon as Friday. And by pushing forward with the trial against GOP wishes also threatens to stall the confirmation of Biden's Cabinet nominees.\n \"We won't be doing any confirmations, we won't be doing any Covid-19 relief, we won't be doing anything else other than impeaching a person who's not even president,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of Senate GOP leadership.\n Short of an agreement to push the trial back, Democratic sources say that the articles would be read and senators and the presiding officer -- it's still unclear whether Chief Justice John Roberts will preside -- would be sworn in on Tuesday afternoon. Then arguments would start on Wednesday. The length of the trial is still an open question, which will depend both on whether the House impeachment managers seek to call witness and the length of senators' questions for the legal teams. But sources say most believe the trial will be shorter than the three-week 2020 impeachment trial for Trump.\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.\n CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Dakota Johnson's latest role in the poignant film \"Our Friend\" taught her life lessons she plans to carry with her.\n Johnson plays Nicole Teague in the film, based on a true story about a woman's arduous battle with cancer and the emotional toll it took on her family and friends. Based off of an essay her husband, Matthew Teague [Casey Affleck] wrote in 2015 for Esquire Magazine, \"Our Friend\" is about how the couple's best friend, Dane [Jason Segel] dropped everything in his own life to care for them during their struggle.\n \"The thing that I pulled most from this film was how you show up for other people,\" Johnson told CNN in a recent interview. \"I think about how I can be more compassionate and more available, even for myself, more compassionate. The thing that I've learned so much from this movie and from even talking about it now is how brave you have to be in order to be truly compassionate towards yourself or other people, because it's scary and you might fail. In Nicole's case, you do everything that you can and then it's not going to save her life but it did save everyone else's life.\"\n Although Johnson took on the difficult task of playing a real person, she says she didn't want to try to \"emulate her precisely.\"\n \"I never could have done it,\" she said. \"I cared more about the performance being authentic than being exactly like Nicole ... The part about playing someone who's dying, part of Nicole's journey is she becomes very aware of everything going on around her and really focuses on absorbing life, her husband and her children ... Most of my performance was just a reaction to the performers around me, who I love so much. We were in a small town, we spent so much time together that you know it was easy to feel things, because we all really cared.\"\n Johnson says she realizes that the film's subject matter is \"heavy\" but says its message is one she hopes encourages viewers to step up for each other in times of challenge.\n \"It's a heavy subject but there's a lot of levity and that's life. Life is painful and ridiculous and funny and horrible and beautiful. I guess you can expect to feel heartbroken but there's also some really funny moments in it.\"\n \"Our Friend\" opens in select theaters and on demand Friday.",

        "body_text": "Houston police officer Taylor Roccaforte was shocked when then-presidential candidate Joe Biden came to see him in the hospital after he was shot in the line of duty.\n Roccaforte was even more surprised that the future president wanted to keep the 2019 visit a secret.\n Roccaforte, 30, told CNN that Biden came to see him just days after he was shot three times during a struggle with a suspect in two carjackings and the robbery of a priest.\n \"It was a very small meeting for just me and my very close, immediate family,\" Roccaforte said. \"He visited with me for for a little bit and it was just nice. It was very, very private, but very intimate.\"\n The former vice president had been in Houston for the third Democratic primary debate, which took place on the night of the shooting.\n The visit was kept under wraps until Inauguration Day, when Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo shared the story and photos of the meeting on Twitter.\n Acevedo said Biden called him to check on Roccaforte and said he'd like to meet him if that \"would be helpful to his spirit and recovery.\"\n \"The visit took place during a campaign, yet not a peep of the visit went public. The officer, his family, & hospital staff were all lifted by the visit.\n \"I share this today to illustrate the decency of the man who we now call Mr. President, although he prefers to be called Joe,\" Acevedo wrote.\n Samuel Roccaforte, Taylor's father and a 43-year veteran in the Houston Police Department, told CNN affiliate KPRC that the meeting was very calming to his son.\n \"He didn't want anybody to know about it,\" he told KPRC. \"He just wanted to lift his spirits. It wasn't political.\"\n Roccaforte said Biden came into the room with a single Secret Service agent and gave him a vice presidential challenge coin and signed his pillow with the message \"we owe you.\"\n \"I was not used as a political stunt,\" Taylor Roccaforte said. \"That's what made it such a special thing for me. It was something for me and my family and it was very, just very genuine.\"\n Roccaforte said Biden tried to comfort his entire family and repeatedly said he was grateful that he would be OK.\n The visit lasted about 10 or 15 minutes, Roccaforte said.\n Roccaforte was able to walk out of the hospital after a week and spent six months recovering at home.\n He's back on the job as a K-9 officer.\n Roccaforte got another surprise about a year after the shooting when he answered a phone call from an unfamiliar number.\n \"He said 'This is Joe Biden,' and then, as if he had to clarify, said 'this is former Vice President Joe Biden,'\" Roccaforte said. \"And I said, 'Wow, I was not expecting that, sir.'\"\n He said Biden told him he'd been thinking about him and wanted to see how he was doing.\n \"He was deep in the middle of his campaign at that point, so for him to --out of all the people he's met  -- for him to remember meeting me, and then remember enough to even call me, of all people, and check up on me, that was huge.\"\n Roccaforte said he's not a political person, but he decided to share his story now, so people on all sides of the aisle can see what sort of person President Joe Biden is.\n \"We're in a very turbulent time right now and there's a lot of division,\" Roccaforte said. \"I think it's neat to have a story like this to where you can appreciate it, regardless of your political affiliation, to where it's just somebody who did something out of the kindness of their heart for someone else.\"",
