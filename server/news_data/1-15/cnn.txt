        "title": "It's chaos as older people struggle to get a Covid-19 vaccine. Here is what you can do",
        "body_text": "Nancy Wilkinson knows her way around the internet. Retired from a career in IT support, the 66-year-old was unfazed by the hurdles her Decatur, Georgia, neighbors and friends faced as they struggled to schedule appointments for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n \"More than that, I have so many friends who are trying to make appointments for their elderly parents in other states and the information out there is just completely, totally confusing,\" Wilkinson said. \"It's hard to find the freaking information if you don't live online like I do.\"\n In Florida, where 4.2 million people over 65 reside, Rebecca Smith recently huddled over three computers trying to schedule a vaccine appointment for her parents, Murray and Toby Simon, who are in their late 70s.\n \"The county said everybody go online at 2 p.m. on a Monday get a slot for an appointment to get your vaccines and before 2 p.m. even hit, the website crashed and you couldn't get on,\" Smith said. \"This happened for two weeks, and it was like paralysis.\"\n Finally, Smith said, the county decided to implement a lottery system that would release 1,400 shots every Monday to those who had registered.\n \"My parents got number 25,367. That was their lottery number,\" Smith said. \"I did some math, and it would take like 71 weeks or something just to vaccinate the 100,000 people over 65 in our county.\"\n As hospitalization and deaths from Covid-19 skyrocket, many of the nation's 50 million seniors over 65 are struggling to navigate a confusing landscape of vaccine distribution plans that can differ from state to state and in some cases, county to county.\n Here was the original plan. In December, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended a phased process for states to follow.\n Phase 1a was to vaccinate the most at risk -- health care workers and elderly in long-term care facilities.\n In Phase 1b, vaccines would be given to people ages 75 and older and non-health care frontline/essential workers, according to the committee.\n Phase 1c would include people over age 65 and anyone between 16 and 64 years old with high-risk medical conditions, as well as any essential workers not already vaccinated.\n Phase 1a has been underway for the last month in all 50 states and Washington, DC, according to an analysis published this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). In many cases, hospitals and clinics took on the task of vaccinating workers, while CVS and Walgreens tackled the long-term care facilities.\n Immediately, however, some states went their own way. In Florida for example, where the Simons live, Gov. Ron DeSantis included all people over 65 into the 1a group. Other states added police and firefighters, while others included the incarcerated and homeless. Thirty states have tweaked the guidance and added in additional groups, KFF found.\n While most states are still in some version of phase 1a, 10 states and Washington, DC have moved into Phase 1b, and Michigan has begun to implement 1c, according to KFF.\n In Georgia, for example, there are different phone numbers, websites, vaccine distribution centers and appointment links for each county. Yet people can book an appointment across counties, creating a confusing patchwork of detective work for the individual.\n Then there is the issue of supply.\n \"What is challenging for our local health departments is the complete unpredictability of supply at this moment in time,\" said Lori Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n \"Even when you have vaccination efforts going on, what we're seeing across the country is they're coming and going because this supply is not predictable,\" Freeman said. \"They're being canceled at the last minute, and that sort of thing, so the predictability of the vaccine supply is at issue here.\"\n To add to the confusion, a senior Trump administration official told CNN Friday that some reserve doses of vaccine had already been released into the system starting last year.\n That could mean the vaccine could be scarce for some weeks, said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n \"We are hearing there is not a stockpile of vaccine for second dose but that it was more of a 'paper exercise,'\" Plescia said. \"Until there is a more robust supply we need to be clear with the public that opportunity to get the vaccine is limited.\"\n Combine that with a decades-long lack of investment in computer and back-end infrastructure, and you have a network with every reason to fail.\n \"Call systems are crashing, websites are crashing due to the sheer volume and desire to get vaccinated,\" Freeman said.\n \"We see that as both a pro and a con. OK, great! People do want to get this vaccine -- we need people to get this vaccine,\" Freeman said. \"But we're working against the incompatibility of the systems to talk to each other and the lack of a standard system to be used across the country.\"\n \"I am concerned this signals twin failures of outreach and technology by the City,\" he wrote.\n Shoring up back-end technological infrastructure is \"clearly where the federal government can step in ... so we don't see this piecemeal approach where every state is duplicating effort,\" said Jason Schwartz, an assistant professor at the department of health policy and management at the Yale School of Public Health, who has written extensively on vaccination policy.\n Freeman's opinion: It's much too late for that.\n \"Months and months ago when the vaccine was being developed is when we should have been looking at these systems,\" she said. \"Not right now, not when the vaccine hits the street. This is not the right time.\"\n Congress just allocated some funds to local health departments in the newest relief package, but even this supplemental \"funny money is just a Band-Aid for our country's decades long lack of investment in our public health system,\" Freeman added. \"You can't put a bandage over that when you're dealing with a pandemic.\"\n \"And by Sunday, we had 20,000 registrations. Now assuming you got through, a registration is not an appointment, it just means you filled out the paperwork,\" said Dr. Sandra Ford, chief executive officer for the DeKalb County Board of Health, who oversees the vaccine rollout.\n \"Our first allocation of vaccine was 2,500 doses,\" Ford said. \"It was like trying to get concert tickets -- you just kept calling, calling, calling.\n \"Our system was overwhelmed, and we had to close it down,\" she added. \"It made no sense to continue to take registrations until we got those people appointments.\"\n Wilkinson heard chatter about the launch on the radio and social media. She sat down at her computer Friday and was able to successfully fill out the lengthy, complicated questionnaire, only to receive a reply that no appointments were available.\n Like many of her friends on social media, she was frustrated with the thought of having to redo the time-consuming application. Unlike many, she had the idea to message the county health department on its Facebook page to ask if that was necessary.\n \"I messaged the page and got a very quick answer from somebody that no we didn't, which was just amazingly helpful,\" Wilkinson said. \"And I've had questions at several points along the way and went back to the Facebook page because they were responding to me.\"\n In the wee hours of Sunday morning an email popped into her inbox -- an appointment was available. The message, however, said vaccines were only being given to health care workers. She paused, not wanting to take an appointment away from the dedicated women and men who are on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.\n Many would have stopped right there, believing it was not yet their turn. But her IT background led Wilkinson to believe it was more likely that health department programmers had not been available over the weekend to update the email's language to reflect the new phase 1b process.\n \"It made total sense to me that they were behind on updating the form,\" Wilkinson said.\n \"When people see that stuff online they say 'Oh, look, why isn't it working right?' It's because the 'hamsters in the cage' haven't been fed over the weekend so they won't get on the wheel to make it run,\" she said with a chuckle.\n Click after click went by until, suddenly, success. An open appointment for Tuesday!\n \"You have to quickly fill in the name and address fields and submit it as they fill up quickly,\" Wilkinson posted on Facebook and her local neighborhood app, NextDoor. \"Hope this is helpful for some of you who are trying (to) navigate this.\"\n Another Facebook question: Could she and Susan go together even though their appointments were at different times and stations? Yes, she was assured, they could.\n For Wilkinson, any lingering frustration with the process melted away at the vaccination site. Hundreds of Georgians were quickly vaccinated in their cars in a calm, professional process that rivaled a well-oiled assembly line.\n \"Oh my god they were so organized,\" Wilkinson said. \"We got in line and there were like four or five cars ahead of us. The tent was big enough they lined the cars up, side by side so there were two lines going through at once. It actually took us longer to sit and wait afterwards to see if we might have a reaction than it did for the whole rest of the process.\"\n As for the frustrating sign-up process? Those are kinks to be worked out as more and more groups enter the vaccine distribution line, Ford said.\n \"The expectation that this vaccine effort is going to be handled exclusively by public health, that's a fantasy. There's just too much to do,\" Ford said.\n \"Hospitals are supposed to be stepping in, pharmacies, even large chain grocery stores,\" she added. \"Right now, I don't really have a clear picture of who else is helping us and where to send folks. So I certainly feel like we're out here swimming by ourselves.\"\n First, start with a call to your primary care doctor. They can confirm which phase you should be in -- definitions can change from state to state -- and give you an idea of when vaccinations are expected to begin in your local community health and hospital systems.\n Next, check the Covid-19 vaccination page on your state health department's website. Most have links to county-level appointment sites where you can sign up, and emails where you can direct questions.\n For those who are less internet savvy, each state also provides a phone number. Be patient, experts suggest, as the lines are often busy.\n To assist, CNN has created a list of vaccination information pages for all 50 states and territories found below. The phone number, email and website for each state is included (see chart below).\n It also never hurts to do your own detective work. Stay tuned to local radio and television stations for updates on openings of vaccination appointments, experts say. Often tips are posted on social media sites or sent via text between friends and family.\n DeKalb County, Georgia, for example, released hundreds of new slots for upcoming vaccinations one evening midweek. Texts between friends flew -- and the slots were gone in mere hours.\n And when you are lucky enough to book an appointment, please don't double- or triple-book. Such behavior has been leading to no-shows at vaccination sites, officials say, endangering the rollout of vaccines, which have a very short shelf life once thawed.\n Once a vial of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine has been opened, it must be used within six hours or discarded, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's been happening in some distribution sites throughout the US, CNN has found.\n Above all, be patient, experts suggest. Vaccine supply lines will be ironed out, and soon pharmacies, grocery stores, doctor's offices and clinics will be able to administer the vaccine.\n \"This will be a multi-month process, and there will understandably be frustration,\" said Yale's Schwartz, \"not just because of technology, but because of the waiting time to get an available appointment.\n \"And one of the really important challenges will be both to manage expectations and try to plead for patience from the public,\" he said.\n CNN's Megan Marples, Kristen Holmes and Sara Murray contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "It's as if 10 of the world's largest commercial jets fell out of the sky, every day for an entire year.\n The official global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpassed 2 million on Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The tragic milestone came just over a year after the first Covid-19 death was reported in Wuhan, China.\n While the 2 million figure is horrifying, experts say the real death toll is likely much higher. Only confirmed Covid-19 deaths are included in the tally, which means that people who die without a firm diagnosis may not be included.\n With testing still inadequate in many countries across the world, there might be hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.\n Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle, said that an analysis of excess mortality suggests that as many as one fifth of coronavirus deaths might not be recorded.\n \"We have found that on average, total deaths are 20% higher than reported deaths,\" he told CNN in an email, adding that the ratio varies substantially across different countries.\n \"There are extreme cases such as Ecuador, Peru or Russia where total deaths are 300-500% higher than reported deaths... but where we have data, the average relationship is 20% higher.\"\n As vaccination programs start rolling out across the world, there is a glimmer of hope -- even though it's likely going to take years for everyone to be offered the shot.\n In the meantime, the pandemic is getting worse. The death toll is rising faster than ever. While it took eight months for the world to record 1 million Covid-19 deaths, the second million came in less than four months.\n A number of countries, including the United States, Germany, Sweden, Indonesia, Israel and Japan recorded their deadliest days of the pandemic in the past week. The number of cases globally is fast approaching 100 million.\n The US has recorded by far the highest total death toll in the world, followed by Brazil, India and Mexico. But the pandemic has reached every corner of the globe, and only a few tiny, isolated nations have reported no deaths.\n The virus has hit the elderly the hardest, but that doesn't mean young people aren't dying. Poorer people and member of ethnic minorities, immigrants and frontline workers are dying at much higher rates. But death has not spared celebrities and royalty either.\n There are now 2 million deaths. 2 million stories. 2 million chairs that are left empty at the dinner table.

        "title": "The world's top environmental organizations are still predominantly White, a new report finds",
        "body_text": "The movement for a cleaner, greener world has grown increasingly popular as the climate crisis has worsened, and organizations such as Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund, now household names, have raised millions to save species, cut down on pollution and slow the effects of climate change.\n But many environmental organizations are still predominantly staffed and led by White employees, a new report finds. And with few people of color on staff, racial disparities in who's impacted most by harmful environmental policies will continue, a leading environmental justice expert says.\n A report from Green 2.0, a group that advocates for improved diversity among environmental groups, found that 40 of the top environmental justice organizations in the United States and worldwide are mostly White. Though many of the organizations evaluated have made an effort in the past four years to increase the number of staffers and board members who are Black and people of color, the report shows the green movement has a long way to go in terms of racial parity in leadership.\n NBC News first reported on the findings.\n Green 2.0 evaluated employment data submitted by 40 environmental non-profits, non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups and compared that to data submitted since 2017. Between 2017 and 2020, most of the organizations added on average six people of color to their staffs, Green 2.0 reported.\n According to the report, the international environmental group Greenpeace has made notable strides since 2017, when 31.4% of its full-time staff were people of color. In 2020, more than 40% of its staffers were people of color, though just over a quarter of them were senior staff, with most of those positions still held by White staffers.\n World Wildlife Fund, an international organization with a focus on animal conservation, made little progress in racial equity. People of color have made up between 25% to just over 26% of its full-time staff from 2017 to 2020, the report found, and most of its board members are White, too.\n The National Audubon Society, a non-profit that focuses on bird conservation, added 6% more people of color to its full-time staff for a total of 24% -- still less than a quarter. Senior staff at the Rainforest Action Network, a San Francisco-based non-profit for rainforest conservation, are more than 77% White.\n Andr\u00e9s Jimenez, executive director of Green 2.0, said it's not enough to hire more people of color. Structural change within an organization requires buy-in from leaders.\n \"If you don't create a workplace environment where your employees of color feel welcomed and valued, they are not going to stay long,\" Jimenez said in a statement to CNN. \"As we say in the report, diversity is only the first step.\"\n The disparity is especially notable given that many environmental problems and harmful environmental policies disproportionately impact Black Americans and people of color -- known as \"environmental racism,\" a term coined by Robert Bullard, a leader in the environmental justice movement. Examples include the yearslong dearth of potable water in Flint, Michigan, a predominantly Black, low-income community, and deadly air pollution in \"Cancer Alley,\" predominantly Black parishes of Louisiana where chemical plants and oil refineries poison the air.\n Bullard, also a professor at Texas Southern University and co-chair of the National Black Environmental Justice Network, told CNN the staff additions the organizations have made are \"baby steps\" -- not enough to create lasting impact within communities that suffer most from detrimental policies.\n \"Nearly every aspect of American society is segregated,\" he said. \"Environmental and conservation organizations are no exception. ... America is segregated, and so is pollution.\"\n While putting people of color in leadership positions can make a difference, Bullard said, he recommends that people of color create and lead their own organizations that have a foundation in racial justice, which can inform their environmental work, rather than focusing on environmental issues alone.\n His group, the National Black Environmental Justice Network, relaunched over the summer because of the confluence of issues facing Black Americans, including the Covid-19 pandemic and recent rollback of environmental regulations. Bullard helped create a grass-roots initiative with Black volunteers from Texas and the Gulf Coast up to Pennsylvania who work within their communities to address racial inequities in pollution and environmental degradation.\n Existing organizations should collaborate with groups like his that are led by people of color so both can thrive and address their goals, Bullard said.\n \"We need more advocacy on the part of the leading environmental conservation groups aligned with people-of-color groups who are fighting for a fair share of green dollars,\" Bullard said. \"This collaborative advocacy needs to start now.\"\n CNN reached out to Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, the National Audubon Society and the Rainforest Action Network for comment. Two of the organizations that responded, Greenpeace and the Rainforest Action Network, acknowledged that while both had made progress in hiring more people of color, the environmental movement still has a ways to go toward racial equity.\n \"The level of progress the report shows for Greenpeace itself is a testament to our staff and leadership's commitment to embedding justice within our organization and through our work in the world, but we know we still have a long way to go to get to where we need to be,\" said Greenpeace USA's Ebony Martin, the group's chief operating officer, who leads its equity and inclusion work.\n Greenpeace has acknowledged it needs to renew its focus on environmental justice, and staffers wrote blog posts urging supporters to speak out against legislation that would further environmental racism.\n Pallavi Phartiyal, Rainforest Action Network deputy executive director, agreed with Bullard that racial disparities lie at the foundation of environmental injustice and disproportionate climate impacts. She said the organization is working on centering the experiences of Black and indigenous staffers and people of color who work there and in the rainforests they work to protect.\n A World Wildlife Fund spokesperson told CNN that though the group's overall staff diversity has remained largely unchanged, people of color now make up a quarter of all senior staff, up from 13% in 2017. The organization's senior director for diversity, equity, and inclusion, Renee Johnson, said in a recent video that the organization had launched an internship program aimed at students of color and offers a diversity education series for US employees.",

        "title": "It's 53% alcohol and tastes like fire. Here's how this liquor brand took over China",
        "body_text": "When Costco opened its first store in China in 2019, it wasn't just the hot rotisserie chickens and discounted Birkin bags that lured frenzied crowds. A fiery, throat-tingling liquor called Kweichow Moutai also flew off shelves.\n Even amid a global pandemic, Kweichow Moutai, the company that makes the eponymous liquor, had a banner year: its stock surged around 70% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2020. The company, which is part state-owned and part publicly-traded, is China's most valuable firm outside of technology \u2014 worth more than the country's four biggest banks. Globally, its market cap has not only surpassed all other alcohol distillers like Diageo and Constellation Brands, but also Coca-Cola, which had long held the crown as the world's largest beverage maker by market cap. Valued at 2.7 trillion yuan, or $421 billion, Kweichow Moutai is worth more than Toyota, Nike and Disney, too.\n \"Anytime they have any stock [of the product] available, it's going to be gone almost instantly,\" said Ben Cavender, the Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. \"You'll see people clamoring [for it].\"\n Apart from the Chinese diaspora, however, Moutai is still virtually unknown overseas. Almost all \u2014 about 97% \u2014 of its sales come from China alone, according to its financial reports.\n So how is a company that sells its products primarily in just one country now worth more than some longstanding global behemoths? And can Kweichow Moutai, which is described by some Westerners as \"drinking liquid razor blades,\" succeed in appealing to non-Chinese consumers?\n Moutai has one unmistakable advantage: the drink is China's national spirit.\n Moutai baijiu \u2014 the type of liquor the company makes \u2014 is a clear, potent spirit that's been dubbed \"firewater,\" thanks to the fact that it's 53% alcohol. The red-and-white bottles of its flagship product, \"Feitian,\" or \"Flying Fairy,\" are a staple at Chinese state banquets and business events.\n Known as the favorite tipple of Mao Zedong, founder of Communist China, and as the \"drink of diplomacy,\" it was famously used to welcome former US President Richard Nixon on his historic trip to China in 1972, and again in 2013 when Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his US counterpart, Barack Obama, in California.\n Once, at a state dinner in 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Deng Xiaoping, the future Chinese leader: \"I think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.\"\n \"Then, when I go back to China, we must take steps to increase our production of it,\" Deng responded, according to an archived US government transcript.\n Being part of so many major public events in China \"really set the brand in the national consciousness,\" said Cavender, who likened it to another giant beverage maker, Coca-Cola, in that regard.\n \"That's the same reason why Coke has actually done so well from a marketing perspective. If you look at the way they've done their advertising over the past 50 years, they're at pretty much every big event. You see Coke at when the Berlin Wall comes down. You see Coke commercials at Christmas. I think Moutai is that brand for China, and so I think that part explains why it's so popular.\"\n A Moutai representative declined requests to be interviewed for this story.\n Some say the story goes back even further in Communist Party lore. During the Red Army's \"Long March\" in China in the 1930s, soldiers used to pour Moutai on their feet to help disinfect wounds, Chinese state media has reported, citing a former army lieutenant general.\n Legend has it that members of the Red Army even used to turn to the drink to knock themselves out before surgery, said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, the securities arm of China's Bank of Communications.\n \"It's a story [that goes around],\" he said. \"They didn't have anesthesia. So they had to use Moutai as a drug to numb [people] from surgery.\"\n Today, the brand is seen more as a luxury status symbol than for its \"Red\" roots. Some customers buy it not to drink, but to keep as investments. Limited-edition cases are collected and showcased by international auction houses, like Christie's, which says that some bottles can fetch more than $40,000 each.\n Moutai has found a way to be \"approachable for a lot of regular consumers, at least for special occasions,\" while at the same time also offering collectors' items that reach the ultra-rich, said Cavender.\n \"That's something that makes Moutai, I think, different, from a lot of the international beverage brands,\" he said.\n It's also been a tremendous advantage during an economically tough year: wealthy consumers who are spending less on travel may splurge more on liquor, Cavender added.\n Moutai has long been seen as one of China's blue-chip stocks. In 2017, it became the world's biggest liquor maker by market value, surpassing Diageo (DEO), the British owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Tanqueray.\n In 2019, Moutai also became the first Chinese company since 2005 to see its share price hit 1,000 yuan (about $145), notching another market record. And last year, it became the most valuable non-tech company in China. (Alibaba and Tencent, the country's top two tech giants, are valued higher, with their shares listed in New York and Hong Kong respectively.)\n In 2020, Moutai's shares soared 69% to record highs.\n Hong said that he believed there was no major impetus for the rally last year; just that \"most people are gradually realizing the ability of this company to be able to generate strong cash flow and no debt.\"\n \"It's like a badge of honor for value investing,\" he added. \"People love the stock \u2014 because year after year, it just continues to deliver.\"\n Xian Li, a 66-year-old retiree in Shanghai, is one of those people. He's invested in Moutai since 2004, just three years after it went public.\n Li said he was excited to buy in because it was clear from the beginning that the company was \"financially healthy,\" and able to reward shareholders with a generous dividend.\n \"The dividend [alone] each year could cover my daily expenses,\" said Li, who plans to hold onto the stock indefinitely. \"It's also going to help me to afford medical bills and nursing home expenses.\"\n Not everyone is so bullish. Allen Cheng, an equity analyst at Morningstar, made headlines in 2019 when he downgraded his rating on Moutai's stock to sell.\n Cheng, who has since maintained that position, argues that the company's prospects are overblown, and that \"the market has already reflected all the positives of the past 10 years.\"\n \"Being the only hater is really difficult for me,\" he said with a laugh. \"I think it's a bubble here.\"\n Authorities, too, have warned investors of a potential stock bubble. In 2017, Moutai suffered a huge selloff \u2014 wiping $7.8 billion off its market cap in one day \u2014 after state-run news agency Xinhua, which often conveys the Communist leadership's sentiment, urged investors to take a more \"rational view\" of the company.\n \"It's important for Kweichow Moutai ... to stick to its slow pace,\" Xinhua said in an editorial. \"Pulling up a plant to make it grow inevitably leads to unbearable pain. Short-sighted speculation will cause tremendous damage to the value of investment.\"\n The move was not uncommon. Beijing frequently tries to sway investors through state media, such as last summer, when a government-run publication encouraged people to buy into stocks.\n One of Moutai's biggest advantages is its ability to keep the price of its product high. It claims to have limited capacity since it can only produce its drinks in one place.\n Similar to champagne \u2014 which comes from the eponymous region in France \u2014 Kweichow Moutai is named after Maotai, a picturesque small town in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou. (The company's name is based on an old romanization of the town's Chinese name.) Like champagne, the drink can only be called Moutai if it's produced in that specific location.\n This is where the company says its baijiu \u2014 distilled from fermented sorghum and rice \u2014 gets the magic touch.\n Environmental factors, such as the town's climate and seasonal changes in the water of the local river, help give the liquor its unique taste and is \"beneficial to the production process,\" according to the Moutai Museum.\n Inside the town, Moutai's impact on the economy is deeply felt.\n As of 2019, Maotai was the richest town in western China, according to disposable income statistics from the municipal government of Renhuai, in Guizhou province. (Guizhou is among the country's poorest regions.)\n That would never have happened if it weren't for the beverage giant, said Qi Wang, a local resident.\n \"Kweichow Moutai is the leader of Maotai,\" he said, adding that the company's boom helped encourage him to open his own liquor factory. \"It influences all aspects of the town's development.\"\n Its close ties with the government don't always guarantee protection, though.\n In 2013, sales slumped when President Xi embarked on an anti-corruption drive, leading the government to stamp out any sign of \"extravagance\" among officials, including of expensive liquor.\n The campaign led to \"unprecedented pressure\" on the alcohol industry, Moutai noted in an earnings report.\n Sales still grew that year, but only around 17%, compared to 44% the previous year. In 2014, that number plunged to about 2%.\n The firm has since bounced back \u2014 though it now faces other problems. In recent years, it's been dogged by numerous corruption scandals, which has led to the ouster of several top executives, according to state media.\n Other major firms have faced similar pressure. China regularly investigates powerful executives for corruption \u2014 while using the findings to send a warning to others. This month, a Chinese court sentenced Lai Xiaomin, the former chief of a top, state-owned financial firm, to death for bribery.\n Moutai has an outsize reliance on the Chinese market.\n To be sure, the company has tried to push overseas, notably by starting a \"fan club\" in the United States, traveling to Africa to woo new business partners and teaming up with foreign players, such as Italy's Inter Milan soccer club.\n But for the most part, it's had little to show for it. In 2019, almost 97% of sales still came from China.\n Last March, the company launched a social media campaign called \"stay at home with Moutai,\" which encouraged users around the world to try new recipes during lockdown. One Instagram and Twitter post, for instance, suggested mixing the drink into a \"sunset cocktail,\" while another offered instructions for a noodle dish that could pair with the liquor.\n The campaign demonstrated an effort to stay connected with international consumers, even during the pandemic. But analysts have pointed to other challenges ahead.\n Moutai needs to do more to diversify, according to Spiros Malandrakis, industry manager of alcoholic drinks at Euromonitor International. \"It needs to have started yesterday,\" he said. \"International spirits always start local, like baijiu, but they become international. That's the key. That's how you take over the world. That's how you become sustainably big.\"\n Malandrakis pointed to Mexican tequila, Russian vodka and American bourbon as examples. None of those \"would have survived\" if they didn't go global, he added.\n The process, of course, doesn't happen overnight.\n William Dong, managing director of Evershine Australia, which distributes Moutai in Australia, New Zealand and Italy, said that many people still need to be educated about what baijiu even is.\n \"We have distributed the product into basically everywhere that we could,\" he said in an interview from Sydney.\n At the end of the day, most customers are still Chinese, he added. \"I would say probably 80%.\"\n It doesn't help that the drink is an acquired taste. Some people eschew Moutai's strong kick, while others label it \"firewater.\"\n \"[Some] Westerners find it, and I quote, 'kind of like drinking liquid razor blades,'\" said Malandrakis.\n An even bigger threat, however, may be generational and gender gaps within China. Currently, the core demographic for baijiu is 40 to 60-year-old men, according to Malandrakis.\n \"The next generation of drinkers does not particularly want to do exactly what their father's generation did,\" he explained. \"It's not great for the future, if you don't start having new people coming in.\"\n Malandrakis compared it to sherry, which was loved for centuries but later fell out of popularity as it \"became synonymous with consumption of older populations.\"\n Not everyone is so worried. Even with its weak international position, Moutai's baijiu was the world's best-selling liquor in 2019, according to Euromonitor.\n \"The Chinese market is so big, and it's continuing to become more wealthy,\" said Cavender. He also noted a recent swell in local pride, which could draw more domestic consumers in.\n For all its challenges, even critics admit the company's dominance is nowhere near diminishing.\n \"The brand \u2014 and the heritage that the brand has \u2014 it's really impossible to replicate that,\" Cavender said. \"Somebody can't set up a new venture tomorrow and do what they can do. It's not sort of possible to go back in time and get Mao Zedong to be interested in your drink. It's not possible to sort of be located in the town where they make their products. So I think they have a strong built-in story that allows them to flourish.\"\n CNN's Beijing bureau and Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.",

        "title": "A stream of nearly 500 stars in the Milky Way is actually a family",
        "body_text": "Our Milky Way galaxy is filled with streams of stars, but one of them appears to be a family that includes nearly 500 relatives, according to a new study.\n Astronomers have discovered 8,292 stellar streams in our galaxy. Rather than clusters of stars, streams form linear patterns.\n Each stream is named Theia for the Greek titan goddess of sight and heavenly light.\n The discovery was presented Friday at the 237th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, which is occurring virtually due to the pandemic.\n Stars are often formed in spherical groups, which are known as clusters. More recent data, however, has revealed other patterns, like these long streams, which astronomers think occurred when clusters of stars were ripped apart or stretched out.\n \"As we've started to become more advanced in our instrumentation, our technology and our ability to mine data, we've found that stars exist in more structures than clumps,\" Andrews said. \"They often form these streams across the sky. Although we've known about these for decades, we're starting to find hidden ones.\"\n Theia 456 stretches for 570 light-years across the Milky Way.\n This stellar stream remained hidden from astronomers for a long time because it lives in the galactic plane, where the stream can easily be cloaked by the Milky Way's 400 billion stars. The galactic plane is where most of a galaxy's mass exists.\n Typically, stellar streams have been found outside of our galaxy by telescopes that point away from the Milky Way.\n \"We tend to focus our telescopes in other directions because it's easier to find things,\" Andrews said. \"Now we're starting to find these streams in the galaxy itself. It's like finding a needle in a haystack. Or, in this case, finding a ripple in an ocean.\"\n The stars within Theia 456 have a similar composition in that they all contain about the same amount of iron. This suggests that the stars all likely formed together about 100 million years ago.\n Astronomers also looked at how the brightness of these stars has changed over time and determined that the stars spin at similar rates. This is further proof that they are the same age.\n \"If you know how the stars are moving, then you can backtrack to find where the stars came from,\" Andrews said. \"As we rolled the clock backwards, the stars became closer and closer together. So, we think all these stars were born together and have a common origin.\"\n Uncovering more about star formation in galaxies could lead to a greater understanding of the universe and how it came to be filled with galaxies and stars.",

        "body_text": "Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday that \"all means\" are being made available to help the country's largest state, Amazonas, where hospitals are running out of beds and oxygen tanks amid soaring coronavirus infections.\n His claim came a day after Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello described the healthcare system in the Amazonas state capital, Manaus, as being in \"collapse.\"\n \"I would say yes, there is a collapse in healthcare in Manaus. The line to get a hospital bed has grown a lot, today we have about 480 people waiting in line. And the reality is that there is a lower supply of oxygen -- not an interruption, but a lower supply of oxygen,\" he said during a Facebook live with Bolsonaro on Thursday.\n Doctors and nurses have been quoted in local news reports as saying patients are dying of asphyxiation in the city's hospitals because of a lack of oxygen.\n Bolsonaro posted on his official Facebook page Friday that \"all means have been made available to the population of Manaus.\"\n Pazuello has been in Manaus for three days, the President said, and the federal government has provided \"oxygen, supplies and patient transfers to federal hospitals.\"\n The Brazilian air force delivered six cylinders of liquid oxygen, totaling 9,300 kilograms, to Manaus early Friday. It also flew out nine patients and five doctors from Manaus to the city of Teresina, in the northeastern state of Piau\u00ed.\n Speaking in Brasilia, Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o said there was no way to foresee the collapse in the public health system and blamed a new variant of coronavirus that is circulating in the city.\n \"You cannot predict what would happen with this strain that is occurring in Manaus. Totally different from what had happened in the first half,\" said Mour\u00e3o.\n Last September, research led by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) recommended a lockdown after confirming that Manaus was experiencing a second wave of the disease. The government of Amazonas denied the second wave of Covid cases at that time.\n Brazil's Covid-19 death toll is the second highest in the world, behind only that of the United States. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 207,000 deaths from Covid-19 in Brazil and more than 8.3 million reported cases of coronavirus.\n A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published Wednesday accused Bolsonaro of having \"tried to sabotage public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19\" earlier in the pandemic.\n The Amazonas state government announced emergency measures Thursday -- including a nighttime curfew, ban on mass transit and the airlifting of patients to other Brazilian states -- as it grapples with the latest crisis.\n \"Today we are in the most critical moment of the pandemic, one that has no precedent in the state of Amazonas. We are facing a lot of difficulty in getting medical supplies. And as everyone is following, our main difficulty now has been getting oxygen,\" Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima told a news conference Thursday.\n Demand for oxygen is up fivefold over the past 15 days, according to the state government.\n Some 235 patients will be airlifted to five other Brazilian states, the state government tweeted Thursday. It said the transfers were necessary due to the state's oxygen shortages.\n Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Thursday he had spoken with Lima and had offered immediately to send oxygen tanks. \"Latin American solidarity above all!\" he tweeted. Lima responded: \"The people of Amazonas thank you!\"\n Covid-19 vaccinations have yet to get underway in Brazil, despite its strong track record on national vaccination programs.\n Speaking Thursday, Pazuello said Brazil would begin to inoculate people in January but did not specify a date.\n \"In January we will start vaccinating. In the beginning with 2, 6, or 8 million doses,\" the health minister said. \"And in February, we will have mass production, and our National Vaccination Program, which we've been doing for 45 years, will get ahead of everyone in the whole world, including the United States.\"\n The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) will meet on Sunday to decide whether to give emergency approvals to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines, according to the official news agency, Agencia Brasil.\n Bolsonaro has publicly second-guessed the urgency of immunization, disparaging \"the rush for a vaccine\" in comments made last month.\n \"The pandemic is really reaching its end, the numbers have showed this, we are dealing with small rises now,\" he said, according to CNN Brasil. \"But the rush for the vaccine is not justified because you are playing with people's lives.\"\n In its World Report 2021, Human Rights Watch recalled how the right-wing President repeatedly downplayed the danger posed by the coronavirus, by calling it \"a little flu\" and by spreading misleading information about the pandemic.\n Bolsonaro \"refused to take measures to protect himself and the people around him; disseminated misleading information; and tried to block states from imposing social distancing rules,\" said the report.\n \"His administration attempted to withhold Covid-19 data from the public. He fired his health minister for defending World Health Organization recommendations, and the replacement health minister quit in opposition to the president's advocacy of an unproven drug to treat Covid-19.\"\n Anna Livia Arida, Brazil's associate director at Human Rights Watch, also recognized the role of other government institutions such as the Supreme Court and Congress in helping to \"block many, although not all, of Bolsonaro's anti-rights policies.\"\n According to CNN Brasil, the country's Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights issued a statement Wednesday arguing that the HRW report \"ignores measures taken by the government to protect human rights during the pandemic.\"\n Numerous projects aimed to help children, adolescents, women and the elderly were mentioned in the statement, saying those were \"a form of government aid to the socioeconomic developments that occurred in the pandemic,\" according to CNN Brasil.\n CNN has reached out to Bolsonaro's office for comment.\n Meanwhile, a study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, published Friday, found that \"the spread of Covid-19 in Brazil overwhelmed the health systems in all the country's regions, particularly in areas where they were already fragile.\"\n The findings, based on analysis of the first 250,000 patients admitted to hospital in the country, \"reveal that a large percentage of Covid-19 patients that were hospitalised in Brazil required intensive care and respiratory support, and many did not survive.\"\n The researchers also found regional differences in mortality, with patients in the north and northeast of the country faring worse than those in the south.\n The United Kingdom imposed a ban Friday on arrivals from Brazil, a dozen Latin American countries, Cape Verde and Portugal, which has strong travel links with Brazil, amid concerns that the new Brazilian coronavirus variant could spread to the UK.\n British authorities are already battling to contain a more contagious variant first detected in the UK late last year.\n UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said that scientists who had examined the mutation discovered in Brazil were concerned \"not so much that the vaccine won't work, in fact scientists think that it will work, but just the fact that it's more spreadable.\"\n CNN's Tatiana Arias contributed to this report.",

        "title": "South Korea is cracking down on digital sex crimes. Has it done enough?",
        "body_text": "Between the ages of 11 and 14, South Korean teenager Ji-o was threatened, stalked and pressured into taking sexually explicit photos of herself by men on the internet.\n She joined Twitter in 2015 as a lonely 11-year-old elementary student, hoping to make friends, according to Choi Yunu, from non-governmental organization Mental Health Korea. As she interacted with people on the platform, she read about a way to make pocket money. People online would send her vouchers for snacks, and all she had to do was share pictures of her breasts.\n But the exchange was a trick -- ultimately, those uploads were used to blackmail her into accepting an exploitative pattern of abuse. One man claiming to be a 36-year-old father threatened to tell Ji-o's parents what she was doing if she didn't take explicit pictures for him. Another man set up a rule that she needed to respond to his messages within two minutes or he would send men to beat her up, although it's unclear whether he knew where she lived and if so, how he had that information. Terrified of missing a notification, she slept with earphones in so that she would be woken by the buzz of an incoming message.\n As a young girl, she lacked the maturity to rationalize what was happening to her. South Korea's culture of victim blaming -- even for people as young and vulnerable as Ji-o -- prevented her from seeking help.\n Now 16, Ji-o -- not her real name -- is still dealing with the aftermath of the three-plus years she spent subjected to online abuse and threats. She says she switched her phone number eight times and moved away from her parents' home in rural South Korea to the capital Seoul, where she lives with her sister. She wants to change her name.\n While digital sex crimes are a problem all over the world, they are a particular issue in South Korea, which has one of the world's highest rates of smartphone ownership. Inadequate laws, weak sentencing, and poor policing mean that such crimes are rarely treated seriously by the justice system -- and as a result, activists say victims feel discouraged from coming forward.\n Last year, however, a digital sex crime case that bore some chilling similarities to Ji-o's situation appears to have sparked change. After an outpouring of disgust over the case, some laws have been tightened and, in November, the ringleader was handed an unusually long sentence.\n But advocates say much more needs to be done to take the issue of digital sex crime seriously -- and keep young girls and women safe from dangers on the other side of the screen.\n The case that prompted the recent changes in South Korea's laws involved a university graduate on bed rest.\n As he recovered from an operation to make his limbs longer, then-23-year-old Cho Joo-bin began trying to make money on the internet. He styled himself as a businessman in his 40s who had served prison time and had an amputated foot, and gave himself a nickname: Guru.\n In September 2019, he founded a group chat called Guru's Room on the encrypted platform Telegram, where messages can be set to disappear after they have been read. That room would become the setting for the most notorious digital sex crime case in South Korea, where men spent thousands of dollars to witness -- and demand -- the abuse of young girls and women.\n Cho and his collaborators had a simple playbook for recruiting victims online. They offered them jobs as part-time models, then solicited compromising photographs from them, before coercing them into making degrading material by threatening to release their personal information and images to other internet users. Cho told them to raise their pinky finger in pictures which he later admitted was a way of branding the content. Authorities say there were more than 100 victims, including 26 girls in their teens.\n \"Foolishly, I was confident I wouldn't be caught and I intended to make my own brand with my sexual content,\" Cho said in September at one of his collaborator's trials.\n At the same time, he and his collaborators recruited members, offering teaser videos of sexually explicit content to try to lure them into paying for entry into one of the exclusive rooms where they had access to women and girls -- referred to by Cho as \"slaves\" -- who they could instruct to create sexually explicit material. These rooms were illegal -- South Korean law forbids producing any sexually explicit material.\n He attracted thousands of members, some of them paid. One group member -- who is known only as Lee -- sent his personal information and 3.6 million won ($3,300) to Cho as an entrance fee to get into the chat rooms, he testified in court, according to South Korean non-governmental organization Tacteen Naeil. That seems to have been on the higher end for entry -- police said last year that buyers normally spent about $1,200 to enter a room paying with bitcoin.\n Lee also paid into a \"slave funding account,\" which he believed was going to the victims as payment, but which he later found out went to Cho.\n Another member, who paid Cho more than 1 million won (about $920) and verified himself by taking a selfie holding his social security ID card, said that Cho often deleted and created new rooms. Entry fees to the different rooms were higher for those with victims considered to be better looking.\n As paid users became involved in the criminal rooms, the information they had given at the start became incriminating. When Cho contacted Lee saying he was low on cash, Lee gave him 650,000 won ($600) as he was afraid Cho might contact his wife. The other member -- who cannot be named for legal reasons -- said he remained a member as he was afraid of being threatened by Cho.\n In 2019, two university journalism students alerted authorities to his illegal enterprise after joining the groups undercover using nicknames. In March 2020, authorities busted the network of chatrooms.\n Dozens were arrested over their involvement in the Telegram ring. One alleged collaborator was only 16 years old. \"He has been good with computers since he was in elementary school,\" his lawyer said in court. \"Because of the lack of parents' protection or supervision, he consequently reached a trash island named 'Guru's Room' in the vast sea of the internet.\"\n Cho had been inspired by other Telegram groups, including one named Nth room, run by someone who called himself GodGod. The journalism students, who asked to use the pseudonyms Kwon and Ahn to protect their safety, said there were many operators running similar chats on Telegram -- and links to the groups could be found from a simple keyword search on Google.\n A Telegram spokesperson told CNN that publicly available content which violates their terms of conditions is taken down. Already this month, more than 7,000 groups and channels related to child abuse have been banned, according to Telegram's Stop Child Abuse channel.\n \"Sexual violence and the abuse of minors are not welcome on our platform,\" Telegram's spokesperson said in a statement.\n According to police, more than 2,500 people were detained last year for digital sex crimes in South Korea. Of those, 220 were arrested for alleged sex crimes on Telegram, Discord and so-called darknet sites which cannot be accessed by a regular browser.\n The Telegram rooms were among the most egregious examples of South Korea's sex crimes, and were difficult to track given the app's encryption. But Ji-o's case shows young girls are also vulnerable on widely used social media platforms.\n Years before Guru's Room or Nth Room were even set up, Ji-o found herself trapped by her own personal information. When she refused to take degrading pictures for the man claiming to be a 36-year-old father, he spread her private details around the internet which others formatted into a graphic, a process known online as \"taxidermy\" because the victim's information is preserved forever. She still doesn't know how he got her personal details.\n After that, huge numbers of people contacted her. Some told her to take off all her clothes, others told her to take photos of herself in school uniform.\n \"Did you do everything I told you to do?\" one man wrote to Ji-o, in direct messages on Twitter seen by CNN.\n \"Remember: You're not a human, but my toy.\"\n Even as the demands from strangers grew online, Ji-o was afraid to tell anyone. She was scared that telling the police would land her in a juvenile protection facility -- under South Korean law at the time, minors seen as voluntary participants to digital sex crimes faced the prospect of mandatory attendance at such a center. And she was scared to tell her parents, worrying that they wouldn't understand.\n In 2018, police asked to speak to her. They had begun investigating a man she had been talking to online, and found her conversation with him while inspecting his phone. They told her that what she had been doing was not good, and that she could end up in a juvenile facility for posting videos and pictures of herself as they violated child and youth protection laws.\n Then, because she was underage, they called her parents. Her dad asked why she posted pictures of herself online when she already had everything she needed and hit her, she alleges. Her mother cried and fell silent. They have never talked with Ji-o about the digital sex crimes again.\n \"It was hell, I blamed myself a lot and I still do,\" she said, according to Mental Health Korea's Choi. \"Most of all, I am disappointed in my parents.\"\n The Telegram victims didn't alert police to what was happening. Nor did Ji-o.\n In countries all over the world, stigma and the difficulty of going through the justice system prevent victims of digital sex crimes from talking to police. But in South Korea, the barriers are particularly pronounced.\n Activist groups said the threat of these education centers seemed like punishment and deterred victims from telling police. The rules also meant that rapists didn't necessarily get punished. In a well-known case in 2014, a 13-year-old girl with a mental disability who left home after breaking her mother's mobile phone screen -- as she was worried her mom would be upset -- was raped by six adults who took her into their care and gave her food. A court decided she had voluntarily prostituted herself to receive food and accommodation.\n Even if victims told police, crimes were often not investigated. In the past, police found it \"almost impossible\" to investigate digital sex crimes as they don't have powers to adopt undercover investigation methods online, said Korean National Police Agency's commissioner general Kim Chang-yong. He wants to see police given new powers to investigate online and more importantly, to be able to stop crimes before abuse begins.\n And even when cases were investigated, few resulted in a lengthy sentence. Between 2011 and 2015, only 5% of people indicted in South Korea for filming, distributing and selling porn were sent to prison, according to a 2018 paper by Korean Women's Development Institute, a government think tank.\n Although producers of child exploitation images can receive a possible life sentence, the average sentence for people convicted of producing and distributing sexually exploitative material of minors was 2.6 years in 2018, according to the Korea Institute of Criminology. The United States also has high penalties for similar crimes, but unlike South Korea, these punishments are actually enforced -- the average sentence for distributing child exploitation images was 11 years and 8 months, according to a 2019 report into US federal sex offenses.\n The various problems with South Korea's system all fed into one another, reinforcing the idea that digital sex crimes were not that serious and were not worth reporting, activists argued. Kim admitted police might not have seemed aggressive enough, but said few digital sex offenders were indicted -- and even fewer received jail terms. \"That discouraged police from investigating,\" he said.\n Despite that, research suggests such crimes may be widespread. According to a survey by Tacteen Naeil, 12% of middle school students and 4% of elementary school students have experienced a sexual approach online.\n When the Guru's Room case was revealed, to many it felt like the last straw. It followed other high-profile crimes that had received weak penalties, including the South Korean mastermind behind the darknet's largest-known site of child exploitation videos, who was sentenced to 18 months in jail in 2019 for producing and distributing child pornography -- a charge that carries a possible 10-year jail term. South Korean authorities refused to extradite him to the US where he faced several charges, including advertising child pornography, which carries a possible 30-year sentence.\n An online petition demanding a heavy punishment for Cho attracted more than than 2 million signatures, well over the 200,000 needed to prompt an official response. The justice system needed to take action.\n On a cold day in November last year, after a monthslong trial, Cho Joo-bin was sentenced to 40 years in prison for producing and distributing illegal sexual visual material, forced sexual abuse, rape, sexual harassment, blackmail, recording sexually abusive behaviors, coercion, violation of private information protection, and fraud.\n It was a stark contrast from the weak penalties digital sex offenders typically receive. After the sentencing, a dozen women gathered outside Seoul's Central District Court, holding a deep red banner that read: \"This is just the beginning.\"\n In the months leading up to the sentence, parliament overturned the law making minors subject to education after being the victim of a sex crime, meaning all children are now considered victims. South Korea raised the age of consent from 13 to 16, meaning any adults who have sex with anyone under 16 could be liable for charges of child sexual abuse or rape. In December, shortly after Cho's sentencing, Korea's top court finalized new sentencing guidelines, aimed at making the penalties for sexual crimes stronger.\n Lawyer Cho Eun-ho, no relation of Cho Joo-bin, said the stronger punishments made people more aware of digital sex crimes and their seriousness -- and had only been implemented thanks to the victims who survived violence and reported crimes.\n But many worry that even with those new measures, South Korea's handling of digital sex crimes still falls short.\n Even with the new sentencing guidelines, penalties are below other international jurisdictions. The new base penalty for producing child sexual exploitation images is five years, still lower than in the US where there is a minimum of 15 years in prison under federal law. There are also legal gaps. Some countries -- including the United Kingdom -- have laws punishing online sexual grooming. South Korea does not have such a law.\n And some are concerned that, when cases are not as high profile as the Telegram case, penalties may not be as severe. There also remains a lack of understanding about digital sex crimes within the justice and policing system.\n Attorney Baek So-yoon analyzed more than 200 rulings from November 2018 to July 2020, where people had been found guilty of distributing sexual exploitation videos of children and juveniles. She found that judges tended to have little understanding of digital sex crimes and often did not comprehend the scale and impact of the crimes on victims. That meant perpetrators were given a lighter sentence.\n And Choi Yunu, from Mental Health Korea, said victims remain afraid that, if they report crimes to police, their parents will find out. Police also need to be careful to avoid adding to the victim's trauma, he said.\n \"Please think of them as their own children, and understand how they're fighting on the battlefield, being chased by an invisible enemy,\" Choi said.\n But even once the court processes are done, victims fear the crimes are never truly over.\n In the trial of another of Cho's collaborators, who cannot be named for legal reasons, the prosecutor said victims are struggling to recover from the trauma. Videos showing the abuse perpetrated against them have been spread throughout the internet.\n \"I'm so busy deleting videos distributed by Cho Joo-bin that my daily scars seem to be endless,\" said one victim through her lawyer Oh Sun-hee.\n Shin Jin-hee, a lawyer representing 30 victims in the Telegram case, said they could not continue with their normal lives.\n \"As a lawyer, after the sentencing the case is over -- but the case isn't over for the victims,\" she said. \"(They) continue to live their lives worrying if other people who saw or downloaded their materials would spread the videos or pictures.\n \"Some victims want to change their social security number or their names but many underaged victims have to get their parents involved in. Of course it's not easy for adults either. How do you explain to your friends or colleagues when you change your name?\"\n For Ji-o, the crimes ended in 2018, but in a lot of ways, her story isn't over. She has never made an official complaint to police about what happened to her. She remains afraid of the repercussions she could face if she tells them. That means no one has ever been held to account for what happened -- and her images and private information are still on the internet.\n \"(My information) is still out there, somewhere. Somebody might be watching. It could be in a year's time that it reappears again -- there is no end to it,\" she said.\n Julia Hollingsworth wrote from Hong Kong, Yoonjung Seo reported from Seoul.

        "title": "Giuliani uses unfounded 'Antifa' argument to defend Trump",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has been working to bolster conspiratorial claims that left-wing agitators played a dominant role in the last week's Capitol riot.\n Giuliani claimed in a tweet on Friday that has since been removed by Twitter that the Capitol siege was carried out \"by groups like ANTIFA trained to riot.\"\n Giuliani has zeroed in on self-described leftist activist John Earle Sullivan of Utah, who was charged in federal court Thursday on three counts related to the Capitol riot, and has argued that the presence and statements of Sullivan and other unidentified rioters indicate that the storming was driven by forces opposed to Trump.\n \"We have people who invaded like Mr. Sullivan and his apparently Black Lives Matter directed group of rioters and looters and whatever else they are,\" Giuliani said in a Thursday episode of his podcast titled \"Another FRAME UP.\"\n He also claimed that the riot was something \"that the President had nothing to do with.\"\n The \"Antifa\" argument is just one of a number conspiracy theories Giuliani has pushed on behalf of Trump since the November election. Giuliani, who is still expected to play a role in Trump's impeachment defense even though the President has told staff not to pay him, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n Giuliani's tweet was first reported by the Emptywheel blog, a site specializing in national security and civil liberties issues.\n In the now-removed Tweet, Giuliani included a screenshot of a text purportedly from Sullivan's brother James in which the sender claimed to be working with the FBI \"to expose and place total blame on John\" and more than 200 members of Antifa.\n Neither Giuliani nor James Sullivan have produced evidence to support the claim that Antifa was involved in the January 6 riot. Federal law enforcement officials have said they have found no evidence suggesting Antifa played a significant role in the insurrection.\n John Sullivan and his brother James appear to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum.\n James Sullivan is an ardent Trump supporter, according to his Facebook page. He is also the co-founder of Civilized Awakenings, a civil rights organization that seeks to help Black conservatives \"find real solutions to the problems the Black Americans are facing.\"\n In a brief interview with CNN, a spokesperson for Civilized Awakenings confirmed Sullivan had spoken at a Proud Boys rally in Portland but stressed neither he nor Civilized Awakenings are part of that group. The spokesperson also confirmed Sullivan has been in contact with Rudy Giuliani, but declined to discuss the details.\n James Sullivan declined comment.\n Neither John Sullivan nor the attorney representing him on the charges stemming from the Capitol siege could be reached for comment Friday evening. Attorney Peter Kern, who represents Sullivan in a separate criminal case filed this summer in Utah declined to characterize any political affiliations Sullivan may have.\n During the siege, John Sullivan recorded the mayhem and provided commentary on what was going on. He was charged with disorderly conduct, interfering with law enforcement, and knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, according to a criminal complaint. He was taken into custody in Utah, where he lives.\n According to the complaint, Sullivan told the FBI he was an activist and journalist who filmed protests and riots, \"but admitted that he did not have any press credentials.\" He told agents he was wearing a ballistic vest and gas mask and entered the building through a broken window, the affidavit states. While standing outside the Capitol building before entering, he proclaimed, \"Let's burn this sh*t down.\"\n Once inside, he can be heard on audio arguing with police and telling them to stand down or that they might get hurt, according to the affidavit.\n \"You are putting yourself in harm's way,\" he allegedly told officers. \"The people have spoken.\" The arrest affidavit also says that as a crowd attempted to open doors to one part of the Capitol, Sullivan can be heard on the video saying, \"Hey guys, I have a knife. I have a knife. Let me up.\"\n Federal authorities have not identified John Sullivan as a member of Antifa, and he denied supporting Antifa in an interview with a Utah newspaper last week. Sullivan said in the same interview that he didn't encourage violence or vandalism.\n When asked about some of the things he said during a 40-minute video he recorded of the incident, he said, \"When you're in a massive crowd like that, you have to blend in.\"\n The paper, The Deseret News, also reported in July that Sullivan is part of a group called \"Insurgence USA\" and took part in a protest in June in which he and others demonstrated in opposition to a scheduled pro-law enforcement demonstration. The paper reported he was arrested after the protest and booked into jail for investigation of \"rioting, making a threat of violence and criminal mischief.\"\n That case is pending, online court records show. Kern said Sullivan's arraignment had been postponed and he had yet to enter a plea.\n In August, Sullivan was in Washington, DC, speaking to a gathering at Black Lives Matter Plaza, according to a video on YouTube.\n \"We [expletive] about to burn this [expletive] down,\" he told the crowd. \"We got to rip Trump right out of that office over there.\"\n He then led the crowd in a chant of, \"It's time for a revolution.\"\n In the aftermath of last week's siege on the capitol, Sullivan appeared on CNN's AC360 and ABC's Good Morning America, commenting on dramatic footage he shot inside the Capitol.\n \"By no means am I there on the Trump side or the Biden side,\" he told Anderson Cooper.",

        "title": "States adding Covid-19 vaccination sites, but governors complain the feds need to give them more doses",
        "body_text": "States are ramping up their Covid-19 vaccination programs so more people can be protected against the virus, but some governors are confused and angry because they don't know how much vaccine the federal government will send them.\n Though the Trump administration announced this week that it would release all available Covid-19 vaccine doses instead of holding second doses in reserve, a senior administration official told CNN Friday that many of those reserves were already released last year.\n Also on Friday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told NBC News  there is no \"reserve stockpile\" of Covid-19 vaccine doses left to release.\n \"We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people, so we're not sitting on a reserve anymore,\" Azar said. \"We've made that available to the states to order.\"\n Meanwhile, there are more places to get vaccinated.\n For example, Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles has been turned into a massive drive-thru vaccination site. More than 2,000 people were registered to receive shots there Friday, and the site eventually is expected to serve more than 12,000 per day, officials have said.\n Other states are letting pharmacies and large businesses give vaccinations.\n But not everybody has enough vaccine.\n \"I have 2.1 million of you in line, and they gave us 60,000 [vaccine doses],\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Friday. \"I can't go and buy [vaccine doses] somewhere, I can't beg them from somewhere, I can't even have them shipped directly to me.\"\n With New Jersey's inoculation infrastructure growing, Gov. Phil Murphy called on the federal government to provide more vaccine.\n \"It's increasingly apparent that we are ready, but the feds are not,\" Murphy said.\n Illinois will be adding \"hundreds\" of Covid-19 vaccination sites across the state, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. But, he noted, vaccine supplies are still \"extremely\" limited.\n Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, called the federal government's release of vaccine more of a \"paper exercise.\"\n \"The stockpile appears to be all on paper; they were tracking anticipated need but not actually holding back product,\" Plescia said.\n That means the vaccine will remain scarce for at least a few more weeks, he said.\n Calling the lack of vaccine a \"catastrophe\" that endangers lives, Walz said he and other governors were lied to by the federal government.\n \"I have been frustrated at times beyond belief but this one is so far beyond the pale to be almost unimaginable,\" he said. \"Where did they go? Who's going to be prosecuted for this?\"\n Pfizer on Friday said it has second doses ready to ship as needed, though.\n \"Operation Warp Speed (OWS) has asked us to start shipping second doses only recently. As a result, we have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US. We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,\" Pfizer said in a statement sent to CNN.\n President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday announced a plan -- as part of a wider $1.9 trillion economic rescue proposal -- to send $350 billion to state, local and territorial governments.\n The money will be used in part to help distribute the vaccine, as well as to increase testing, keep frontline workers employed, reopen schools and maintain vital services.\n Biden on Friday pledged to communicate better with states about distribution and to make sure as many vaccine doses are made available as soon as possible.\n \"Our administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they're available,\" Biden said Friday.\n Biden aims to vaccinate 100 million people in 100 days, and that's a feasible goal, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday on NBC's \"Today\" show.\n \"Even now, we've gone from half a million a day to 750,000 (doses) a day. I believe strongly that it (1 million per day) is doable -- and if we do it, stay on target to get the overwhelming majority of the country vaccinated,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n Nearly 10.6 million people have received at least their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with more than 1.6 million of those having also received their second dose, according to data published by the CDC.\n It's far from the target of 20 million vaccinated by the end of 2020 set by officials with the federal Operation Warp Speed effort. While the operation's chief adviser, Moncef Slaoui, told CNN the figure was a \"hope\" and not a promise, Biden on Thursday called the vaccine distribution rollout so far \"a dismal failure.\"\n At least one state, however, says its distribution is ahead of the game.\n West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice told CNN that as of Monday, every vaccine dose received by the state had been administered or assigned to be given within a day or so. The state leads the nation in terms of first doses administered per capita, according to the CDC data, nearly doubling the national rate.\n \"We've absolutely not gone with the federal model,\" Justice told CNN on Thursday. Instead of using chain drugstores to administer the vaccine, the state has relied on partnerships with local pharmacies, the state health department and National Guard to distribute the vaccines effectively, he said.\n \"It's as simple as mud. If you can get shots in arms, you're going to save lives,\" Justice said. \"We don't need to sit around trying to develop systems or meeting with committees or whatever. We needed to act. We needed to move.\"\n Other states are not having the same success as West Virginia.\n Texas -- the second-most populous state -- has administered the most doses of any state so far, with more than 1 million total doses put into arms, according to CDC data. Yet about 10% of the rural hospitals in Texas have yet to receive a single Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to a group representing rural hospitals in the state.\n The state was tied for 18th in total doses administered per capita as of Thursday, according to CDC data.\n One CEO of a rural hospital group in Texas reported that some employees had to get vaccines from a local supermarket, which had extra doses to spare.\n In some metropolitan areas, including Houston, Phoenix and Los Angeles, stadiums and theme parks or their parking lots are being used as mass-vaccination sites.\n The US has counted more Covid-19 deaths these last two weeks than any other 14-day stretch of the pandemic.\n And at this rate, the nation's overall coronavirus death toll may hit 400,000 before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Wednesday.\n The country reported more than 42,800 Covid-19 deaths during the first 14 days of January, averaging more than 3,050 per day -- the highest for any two-week stretch of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n Another 14,400 Americans are projected to die from the virus over the next six days, according to an ensemble forecast published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n And by May 1, according to a projection by an influential University of Washington model, the US could have 192,000 more Covid-19 deaths, bringing the total to 566,720 coronavirus deaths in the US.\n More rapid vaccination efforts can bring the number down to 553,000, and mask use by everyone would reduce it further, to 535,000, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation projected.\n This comes as the nation's health care system scrambles to keep up with influxes of patients, with more than 128,900 Covid-19 patients Thursday in hospitals across the country. That's not far from the pandemic's peak of more than 132,400 reached eight days earlier -- according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n The city of Laredo, Texas, tweeted an \"emergency message\" Thursday saying its health care workers are getting crushed by the swell in cases.\n \"Our medical professionals are overwhelmed with the surge in COVID-19 cases. Lives are at stake, and we are asking you to stay home unless it's absolutely necessary ... save a life,\" the tweet said.\n Case levels across the country are near the highest they've been. On Thursday, the US recorded its 10th straight day of more than 200,000 newly reported infections.\n And the country's average of new daily cases across a week was about 238,830 on Thursday, short of a peak average of about 249,800 reached just three days prior.\n Since the pandemic began, more than 388,000 people in the US have died from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins data.\n As frontline workers struggle to keep patients alive and hospital ICU wings operational, the success of the vaccine rollout remains inconsistent.\n While the vaccine rollout generally provides long-term hope for the country to overcome the pandemic, the situation nationwide still requires preventive measures.\n In Missouri, lawmakers canceled next week's legislative session due to the rise in Covid-19 infections.\n \"Due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the building, we are exercising an abundance of caution to protect members, staff, and visitors by canceling session next week. Our goal is to return to work the following week,\" read the statement from Missouri House leadership.\n Experts are hoping precautions can help turn the tide of debilitating case numbers, like those faced in California.\n Available ICU beds have reached their lowest level, according to the California Department of Public Health. Fewer than 1,100 ICU beds remain throughout the state, a shrinking number from the beginning of the surge in November.\n Los Angeles County has been particularly hard struck. The seven-day average of deaths in the county from Covid-19 is 1,644 people, according to Johns Hopkins data. This averages to about one death every six minutes.\n CNN's Amanda Watts, Christina Maxouris, Lauren Mascarenhas, Raja Razek, Maggie Fox, Deidre McPhillips, Cheri Mossburg, Paul Vercammen, Jacqueline Howard, Jessica Firger and Nick Watt contributed to this report.",

        "title": "275 cases open in Capitol riot investigation, US prosecutors say",
        "body_text": "US investigators have opened 275 criminal cases and charged roughly 98 individuals in connection to last week's pro-President Donald Trump riot at the US Capitol, federal officials said Friday, emphasizing they are focused on rounding up the most violent offenders.\n That number will easily grow to over 300 by the end of the day, Michael Sherwin, acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia, told reporters during Friday's news conference.\n The update comes as federal investigators are chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in last week's attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington, DC, and around the country.\n The challenge, FBI and Department of Justice officials say, is \"unprecedented,\" particularly given the growing concerns about possible protests around the country this weekend and planning around what will be the most heavily fortified presidential inauguration in modern US history.\n \"If this investigation was a football game, we'd still be in the first quarter,\" Steven D'Antuono of the FBI's Washington Field Office said Friday, making clear the arrests and charges levied so far are only the beginning.\n At the same time, a more complete picture of what occurred inside the Capitol last week is coming into view after a week of arrests and charges.\n Shocking new details show the riot was extraordinarily violent and posed mortal danger to the top members of the US government -- revelations that have only fueled anxiety about the days ahead.\n Investigators are looking at the possibility that some members of Congress unwittingly provided tours in the days before the rally to people who later were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol, a US law enforcement official told CNN.\n No evidence so far has emerged to show complicity by members of Congress, but prosecutors are examining whether some people may have used tours to familiarize themselves with the Capitol building layout, the official added.\n Several Democratic House members have expressed concern that some GOP lawmakers were somehow aiding rioters. The idea of an insurrection is unheard of in modern US history, and the possibility that lawmakers or allies inside the Capitol were helping only contributes to the uncertainty and worry about the event and what's to come.\n During Friday's news conference, law enforcement officials did not deny they are investigating the allegations that some lawmakers were involved in the riot.\n When pressed on the matter, D'Antuono would only say the FBI will \"leave no stone unturned\" and is \"looking at every piece of the puzzle.\"\n He and other officials did not elaborate on those investigations, however.\n So far, Sherwin said, officials have not found \"direct\" evidence of a kill-capture plot -- as federal prosecutors had initially alleged in a court filing that said Capitol rioters sought to \"capture and assassinate elected officials.\" But they are pursuing that possibility as part of the investigation based on the evidence they have, CNN had learned, and Sherwin added that counterterrorism prosecutors are still looking at coordination between groups.\n Later on Friday, however, the Justice Department prosecutors formally walked back their assertion that Capitol rioters wanted to assassinate officials.\n Sherwin didn't say specifically any lawmakers or members of law enforcement were under investigation. \"We're looking at significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy,\" he told reporters.\n But Sherwin added, \"Our office organized a strike force of very senior national security prosecutors and public corruption prosecutors. Their only marching orders from me are to build seditious and conspiracy charges related to the most heinous acts that occurred in the Capitol.\"\n As such, prosecutors are working toward a sedition case and if they establish direct evidence of plans to capture and or kill members of Congress, they will bring those charges.\n Authorities are investigating a growing number of current law enforcement officers who allegedly participated in the riots.\n \"Unfortunately as this case goes on we're seeing indications that law enforcement officers, both former and current, maybe who have been off duty, participating in this riot activity,\" Sherwin said Friday.\n Two police officers from Rocky Mount, Virginia, were arrested Thursday on federal charges relating to the riot, Sherwin said.\n \"We don't care what your profession is, who you are, who you are affiliated with, if you are conducting or engaged in criminal activity, we will charge you and you will be arrested,\" Sherwin said.\n Additionally, D'Antuono said Friday that the most \"egregious\" of the pro-Trump extremists from last week's Capitol attack are the ones who are charged with assaulting law enforcement.\n Charges have already been filed against individuals like Robert Sanford and Peter Francis Stager and others who may be charged are \"a priority for the FBI and our partners.\"\n \"You attack one of us, you attack all of us,\" D'Antuono said.\n Sanford, a retired firefighter, was arrested on Thursday in Pennsylvania and accused of throwing a fire extinguisher that hit three police officers in the head while they were in part of the crowd on a Capitol terrace. Sanford now faces four federal criminal charges related to the riot, including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers on duty.\n Stager, of Arkansas, faces a criminal charge related to allegedly beating a uniformed officer. He allegedly used a flagpole that had an American flag on it to hit the officer as he lay on the ground surrounded by the mob, according to court records in DC District Court.\n There are no known arrests related to the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick but the FBI is investigating \"several\" people, two law enforcement officials told CNN.\n Earlier Friday, D'Antuono said his investigators are \"making progress\" on the investigation into the death of the officer.\n The incident with Sanford is unrelated, he added.\n D'Antuono said investigators are looking at \"anyone and everyone\" who may be involved, but did not give specifics on the scope of the investigation.\n The New York Times was first to report multiple people were being looked at in the probe.\n Even though some federal defendants related to the riots are self-surrendering, they will not be able to cut deals where their defense attorneys negotiate with prosecutors at this time.\n \"We're not cutting deals with anyone. Even if people are self-reporting, they will be held accountable,\" Sherwin said.\n Sometimes in large investigations, prosecutors allow defendants to negotiate down their charges if they offer law enforcement assistance.\n Prosecutors have noted in court filings how several charged defendants have already spoken to investigators about the riot and how many have posted about their experience or footage they took of the riots on social media.\n Meanwhile, new revelations have emerged about what took place inside the Capitol on January 6.\n Vice President Mike Pence came closer than initially known to the mob, according to new reporting from The Washington Post that stresses the level of danger he and other government leaders faced.\n Some of the pro-Trump rioters who rampaged the Capitol were heard screaming \"where's Mike Pence\" and seen on video shouting \"hang Mike Pence\" -- upset that Pence was doing his constitutional duty to certify the November election results.\n Pence, per the Post, remained in the Senate chamber for about 14 minutes after Capitol Police reported the initial attempted breach of the building.\n The vice president, along with second lady Karen Pence and their daughter Charlotte Pence Bond, were then rushed into a room near the Senate floor.\n About one minute after Pence was moved, the Post said, a handful of the rioters made it up the stairs to reach the second floor landing outside the Senate entrance. Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman heroically led the group of rioters in the opposite direction, away from the Senate chambers' entrance.\n Pence and his family were in a hideaway \"less than 100 feet from that landing,\" the Post reported, citing three people familiar with his whereabouts.\n If the rioters had arrived seconds earlier, they would have been in eyesight of the vice president as he was rushed across a reception hall into the office, the Post suggested, adding that Pence later was moved to a more secure location.\n The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security failed to issue threat assessments about the potential for violence at the Capitol ahead of January 6, according to a source familiar with the matter and a senior DHS official.\n The FBI did not formally distribute a report on potential threats ahead of the attack despite warning signs and online chatter suggesting there could be violence, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n Additionally, the DHS intelligence division did not issue a specific warning about the possibility of violence on January 6, according to two DHS officials, but did author and disseminate several assessments highlighting potential threats surrounding election season.\n Typically, the FBI and DHS will produce a joint threat assessment for high-profile events and send it to law enforcement officials and relevant stakeholders. But no such report was compiled by either agency for the January 6 attack.\n The FBI referred CNN to comments made earlier this week by D'Antuono.\n \"In the weeks leading up to the January 6 rally, the FBI worked internally with every FBI field office to ensure they were looking for any intelligence they may have developed about potential violence during the rally on January 6. We developed some intelligence that a number of individuals were planning to travel to the D.C. area with intentions to cause violence,\" D'Antuono said on Tuesday.\n \"We immediately shared that information and action was taken, as demonstrated by the arrest of Enrique Tarrio by the Metropolitan Police Department the night before the rally,\" he added, referring to the leader of the Proud Boys.\n But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns that an intelligence failure occurred and, as a result, members and police in Washington were in the dark about what proved to be a serious threat. As a result, the Senate and House Intelligence committees have pushed the intelligence community and DHS to share information about their preparations for Biden's inauguration, citing the January 6 events as evidence for increased communication.\n A senior DHS official told CNN the agency had not anticipated the factors that contributed to the deadly situation at the Capitol.\n \"I think we could not anticipate how the day unfolded, or the extent to which people perceived, again, whether or not the President was telling them to go do something,\" the official said. The DHS official also pointed to the issues with Capitol security but said that is not under their purview for review.\n When asked if the President's rhetoric last week inspired the incursion on the Capitol, the official deferred to the FBI and its investigation, adding that \"whenever a high-profile individual attends a protest, particularly when there's opposing sides, it could be a mobilization factor for any violent extremists.\"\n The official added: \"Despite the large amount of chatter, it really was unclear to us at least how big the protests would be,\" adding that \"it's extremely difficult to determine what's aspirational and rhetoric and what's the actual true threat.\"\n A spokesperson for the DHS Intelligence & Analysis Office told CNN: \"DHS I&A has produced numerous intelligence reports highlighting the heightened threat environment during the 2020-2021 election season, including the extent to which the political transition and political polarization are contributing to the mobilization of individuals to commit violence. To the extent press reports suggest that I&A did not believe events such as the certification of the electoral college in effect presented a heightened threat environment, they are incorrect.\"\n The most recent assessment of those reports (prior to the Capitol attack) was sent to state and local officials on December 30, another DHS official said.\n This story has been updated with additional information.\n CNN's Evan Perez, Katelyn Polantz, David Shortell and Geneva Sands contributed to this report.",

        "title": "How some states are administering Covid-19 vaccines at twice the speed of others",
        "body_text": "One month after the first dose was administered in the United States, Covid-19 vaccinations lag far behind early promises from the federal government.\n Yet, despite reports of technology hiccups, changes to allocated supply and other logistical hurdles, some states have risen as clear leaders in efficient Covid-19 vaccination efforts.\n More than 31 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been distributed to states and other jurisdictions in the United States, but only 12.2 million -- 39% -- have actually been administered, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n However, nine states have managed to administer more than half of the doses they've received: North Dakota, West Virginia, South Dakota, Connecticut, Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Colorado and Montana, as well as Washington, DC.\n North Dakota and West Virginia lead the nation, having administered more than 65% of distributed doses.\n In comparison, Alabama and Georgia have administered only 23% of their doses and five other states have administered 30% or less.\n When it comes to efficient Covid-19 vaccination, \"there's no magic bullet,\" Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN.\n In the states moving faster, strategic planning and communication, reliance on strong local partnerships and states taking ownership of the process have each played a role.\n In South Dakota, conversations about vaccine planning started as early as August and have continued on a daily basis, Daniel Bucheli, director of communications for the state health department, told CNN.\n \"Preparation not panic has been the key,\" he said. \"There's daily communication, with the opportunity for partners to share feedback on what's working and what's not. Open lines of communication are ongoing.\"\n Efforts to build a unified system also started over the summer in Colorado, bringing hospital systems, emergency management, technology leaders and more together for a \"whole state approach,\" Scott Bookman, Covid-19 incident commander for the state's health department, told CNN.\n According to Bookman, all vaccine providers in the state must administer doses they've received within 72 hours. If they don't, the state will step in and move the unused doses somewhere else.\n \"You'll hear 72 hours in Colorado all the time,\" he said. \"We have moved vaccine from one place to another. And we are at a point now where providers understand our expectation and how seriously we take it.\"\n Setting expectations early and often among all involved has been key, he said.\n \"We have made this a top priority. We have set expectations that we are going to get this done, that we are going to save lives and return Colorado to normalcy.\"\n In Colorado, nearly all long-term care facilities -- including nursing homes and assisted living -- opted into a federal program that partnered with CVS and Walgreens to administer vaccine doses to the top-priority group.\n But nationwide, the federal program has had mixed feedback, with some nursing home directors and other health care providers blaming poor logistics and bureaucracy for the slow rollout.\n While Bookman says the program has not moved as quickly as expected or hoped for in long-term care facilities in Colorado, Walgreens and CVS have been great partners and the state has stepped in where needed to provide additional support staffing and technology support.\n West Virginia, meanwhile, has taken full ownership of vaccine administration. Hannan of the Association of Immunization Managers credits some of West Virginia's success to its decision to opt out of the federal long-term care facility program.\n \"The biggest thing that we've done is backed away from the (federal) standardized program,\" West Virginia Governor Jim Justice told CNN.\n More than 40% of pharmacies in West Virginia are not chain-affiliated, and the state wanted to prioritize existing relationships, the governor said in a press briefing on December 16.\n \"We have instead partnered with all the pharmacies in West Virginia. We felt like that, from a state perspective, would be limiting our ability to rapidly distribute and administer the vaccine to the population in need if we had gone with the federal program,\" he said.\n By acting independently, West Virginia started vaccinating in long-term care facilities about a week before other states started.\n The state also broke from federal guidance on groups prioritized to receive the vaccine first, emphasizing speed over specifics.\n \"There's a real sleeping giant that is a problem, and that is one thing alone: we, as other states, are going to mound an inventory beyond belief because everybody is trying to devise a program on how to administer vaccines,\" Justice told CNN.\n On Tuesday federal leaders asked states to move people 65 and older and those with high-risk health conditions to the front of the line. West Virginia, however, had already announced a program to vaccinate older residents -- Operation S.O.W.: Save Our Wisdom -- about a week earlier.\n Notably, many of the states administering their vaccine distributions most efficiently are among the most rural states in the country.\n Fewer health systems responsible for larger shares of the population may play a role in success, some say.\n Hannan notes that in North Dakota, the state works closely with providers to distribute the supply that's needed and redistribute if necessary. The same is true in South Dakota, where a few large health systems cover much of the population.\n \"They have strong relationships with providers that cannot be replicated in larger states,\" she said.\n In anticipation of Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorization, Monument Health in South Dakota started to build databases of individuals under their care that would be eligible to receive the vaccine and proactively reach out to them, Dr. Shankar Kurra, vice president of medical affairs, told CNN.\n As one of three major health care providers in the state, Monument Health covers nearly half of the state's population and their spreadsheets and outreach reflected such.\n \"There are several reasons for success,\" Kurra said. \"The department of health and how well they've communicated when vaccine will be available, three health systems in the state makes it a lot simpler logistically, and the third factor is key: Even with just three systems, we took it upon ourselves to make it a mission to administer doses within a week of when we get them.\"\n CNN's Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Jeff Kelly Lowenstein is the Padnos/Sarosik Endowed Professor of Civil Discourse at Grand Valley State University and the founder and executive director of the Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism (CCIJ). The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\nAnnual observances of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday almost invariably include his stirring \"I have a dream\" speech delivered at the Lincoln Memorial on a sweltering day in August 1963.\n But a little-known incident in 1956 -- which sparked a crisis of faith and forced King to confront his worst fears -- sheds valuable light on the ways he drew on his spiritual beliefs to persist in the face of steep obstacles and his increasing certainty that he would be killed.\n King's struggle to keep fighting for racial justice not only provides a more grounded vision of the late civil rights leader, but also shows how we can learn from his experiences to continue the long and arduous push for our country to fulfill its lofty promises of equality at a precarious moment in our democracy.\n His spiritual quandary occurred in his Montgomery, Alabama, kitchen late one evening in January 1956. King was still a relative newcomer to the city when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus to a White rider.\n But just four days after Parks' arrest, King became the president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, an organization founded by Black ministers and community leaders that would go on to play a pivotal role in guiding the boycott, negotiating with city leaders and soliciting nationwide support.\n King's new role put him in the spotlight, and he began receiving threatening phone calls. One, in particular, unnerved him more than the others.\n \"On the other end was an ugly voice,\" he recounted in a speech he gave in Chicago more than a decade later. \"That voice said to me, in substance, 'N\u2014er, we are tired of you and your mess now. And if you aren't out of this town in three days, we're going to blow your brains out and blow up your house.'\"\n King went to his kitchen to try to calm himself, reflecting on the theology he had learned as a student. He meditated on his beautiful little girl and lovely wife and how they could be taken from him at any moment.\n Nothing worked.\n Like George Floyd, whose anguished cries would ring out more than a half century later on a Minneapolis street, King thought of his mother.\n \"Something said to me, you can't call on Daddy now, he's up in Atlanta a hundred and seventy-five miles away,\" he said. \"You can't even call on Mama now. You've got to call on that something in that person that your Daddy used to tell you about. That power that can make a way out of no way. And I discovered then that religion had to become real to me and I had to know God for myself.\"\n King bowed his head over a cup of coffee and asked for help from God. \"And it seemed at that moment that I could hear an inner voice saying to me, 'Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness, stand up for justice, stand up for truth. And lo I will be with you, even until the end of the world.\"\n He went on to say that Jesus \"promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone.\"\n Newly fortified, King kept going. Just three days after the phone call, King's house was bombed while his wife and daughter were at home. Although no one was injured, an angry crowd hungry for vengeance gathered at the home. Still, he maintained his call for nonviolence. The boycott ultimately went on for 381 days, ending after the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional, striking another blow against the legalized apartheid that had ruled the South for more than a half-century.\n King went on to found and lead the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, win the Nobel Peace Prize and become arguably the most prominent figure in a movement that played a singular role in passing landmark federal civil rights and voting legislation.\n But he grappled with doubts throughout the rest of his life. He closed the Chicago speech by recounting the challenges he faced and how they led him to question if his life had made a difference in the world:\n \"And I don't mind telling you this morning that sometimes I feel discouraged. I felt discouraged in Chicago. As I move through Mississippi and Georgia and Alabama, I feel discouraged. Living every day under the threat of death, I feel discouraged sometimes. Living every day under extensive criticisms, even from Negroes, I feel discouraged sometimes. Yes, sometimes I feel discouraged and feel my work's in vain. But then the holy spirit revives my soul again. 'There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole. There is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul.'\"\n This raw passage gives insight into the many sources of strain King endured toward the end of his life. He struggled to gain traction during the 1966 campaign in Chicago against slum housing conditions. He was struck by a rock during a march in Marquette Park, and the brutal racism he and others experienced led King to later say that the people of Mississippi \"ought to come to Chicago to learn how to hate.\" The campaign ended with a controversial agreement that led some observers to label the movement largely ineffective.\n That same year, a split emerged between King, who had long been a proponent of nonviolence, and the activist Stokely Carmichael and Black Power advocates who derided his commitment to nonviolent change. Harlem congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. sided with the Black Power adherents and mocked King by calling him, \"Martin Loser King.\"\n The FBI's years-long surveillance campaign, which included sending King a letter suggesting that he commit suicide, had drained him. So, too, had the death threats that were a continual part of his life ever since Montgomery. \"This is what is going to happen to me also,\" he told his wife after President John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. \"I keep telling you, this is a sick society,\" he said.\n Far from the towering, unruffled figure depicted in the 30-foot statue erected on the Washington Mall in 2011, and in classrooms across the country, the King that emerges in the speech he delivered in Chicago just a year before his death is a vulnerable man wrestling with despondency, yet drawing on his bedrock faith to carry on.\n Beset by a devastating pandemic, the failed insurrection at the US Capitol, the uncertain fate of our democracy, and our nation's searing economic inequality and racial injustice, it's far too easy to become discouraged. But whether we are religiously oriented or not, looking at King's struggle for courage can shift our understanding of the civil rights leader and point a way forward during this dark period in our nation's history. Rather than seeing him as a near-mythical icon, learning about King's fears can provide us the necessary inspiration to push through our own doubts and find our own sources of strength. And, buttressed by his example, we can continue to press our nation to be fair, open and just with the same tenacity he exhibited until his assassination at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968.",

        "body_text": "The National Rifle Association of America, the nation's foremost gun lobby, has filed for bankruptcy, according to court documents filed Friday in the Northern District of Texas.\n The group said it plans to leave New York State, where it was founded in 1871, and reincorporate as a Texas nonprofit in a move it is calling \"Project Freedom,\" according to a statement published Friday.\n The Chapter 11 announcement follows leadership shakeups and allegations of financial mismanagement at the NRA in recent years.\n New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit in August accusing the NRA's senior leadership of violating laws governing nonprofit groups and using millions of dollars from the organization's reserves for personal use and tax fraud.\n James alleged that current and former NRA leadership \"instituted a culture of self-dealing mismanagement\" that benefitted themselves, family, friends and favored vendors, leading the organization to lose more than $63 million in three years.\n In response, the NRA filed a countersuit alleging the attorney general was hampering the group's First Amendment rights.\n James responded to the group's bankruptcy announcement Friday in a terse statement: \"The NRA's claimed financial status has finally met its moral status: bankrupt.\"\n She added, \"while we review this filing, we will not allow the NRA to use this or any other tactic to evade accountability and my office's oversight.\"\n \"This strategic plan represents a pathway to opportunity, growth and progress,\" Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's CEO and executive vice president, said in a statement Friday. \"The NRA is pursuing reincorporating in a state that values the contributions of the NRA, celebrates our law-abiding members, and will join us as a partner in upholding constitutional freedom.\"\n The NRA said Friday it is in its \"strongest financial condition in years,\" but the restructuring will help to \"streamline costs and expenses.\" In a Q&A published on its website, the group said it is not admitting to mismanaging donor funds, and that it does not expect any impact  to NRA programming. Its headquarters currently remain in Fairfax, Virginia.\n In 2019, the NRA operated at a $12.2 million deficit, according to the NRA's 2019 990 tax return, which was obtained by CNN in November. The filing also stated that the NRA became aware of a \"significant diversion\" of its assets in 2019 and previous years, and that LaPierre paid back nearly $300,000 plus interest in funds for the expense.\n According to OpenSecrets.org, a site run by the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA has spent a total of $139 million on campaigns and lobbying since 2000. But its real political power comes from its five million members, many of whom base their vote on candidates' support or opposition to gun control measures.\n The largest creditor listed on the NRA's bankruptcy filing is its former advertising firm, Ackerman McQueen, with which the NRA has been in a contentious legal battle after nearly 30 years in business together. Ackerman McQueen is owed a disputed $1.2 million, according to the filing. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.\n \"The NRA, a get rich quick scheme for its executives that pushed positions wildly out of step with gun owners, is collapsing, just as Congress readies to vote on a comprehensive background checks proposal with 90% public support,\" Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, said on Twitter Friday. \"It's happening.\"",

        "body_text": "Federal guidelines recommend that smokers under the age of 65, considered high-risk for severe Covid-19 symptoms, be eligible for the vaccine in early phases of distribution, frustrating essential workers lower in the priority line.\n New Jersey and Mississippi are currently offering the vaccine to smokers under the age of 65, and several other states have included smokers among those next in line, but haven't opened the phase yet, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.\n The move to prioritize smokers over essential workers like teachers has received some criticism, though the phased rollout is in line with federal guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control that place smoking on a list of conditions \"that cause increased risk\u00a0of severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19.\"\n The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices advises smokers to be vaccinated in phase 1c but ultimately states can use their discretion in how they open eligibility for the vaccine to constituents.\n \"While ACIP makes recommendations, we understand that there will be a level of local adaptation. The\u00a0phased vaccine recommendations\u00a0are meant to be fluid\u00a0and not restrictive\u00a0for jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0It is not necessary to vaccinate all individuals in one phase before initiating the next phase; phases may overlap,\" CDC spokeswoman\u00a0Kristen Nordlund said in a statement to CNN.\n Phase 1c includes persons 65-74 years of age, persons 16-64 years of age with high-risk medical conditions, and other essential workers. Phase 1a includes health care workers and long-term care facility residents and phase 1b includes persons 75 years of age or older and non-health care frontline/essential workers.\n \"This means\u00a0ideally hitting a sweet spot that maximizes\u00a0getting vaccine into arms while also being mindful of the priority groups -- especially because these are people who are higher risk for\u00a0complications from COVID-19 or are more likely to be exposed to the virus because of their jobs,\" Nordlund said.\n Educators in New Jersey are disappointed and frustrated that they've been pushed back in line, Bergen County Education Association President Sue McBride told CNN.\n \"From what I'm hearing, it's just another round of frustration and another round of difficulty, you know, our educators and our education support professionals have working contact with the students and with their colleagues in their school buildings,\" McBride said.\n \"The idea of having a vaccine that enables to, hopefully, give some peace of mind. And some hope, and some movement in a positive direction is valued. You know, and a much anticipated thing to happen.\"\u2028The New Jersey Educators Association continues to maintain the necessity of vaccine access for educators to get schools closer to a sense of normal.\n \"We've said from the beginning the educators should receive priority access to the vaccine. It's an important step toward a safer return to in-person learning. We have been in constant communication with state officials regarding educators' access to vaccination. We have reiterated to them the need to do whatever is necessary to expedite that access even in light of revised federal guidelines from the Trump administration and a slow federal rollout of the actual vaccine,\" NJEA communications director Steve Baker told CNN.\n Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced this week an expansion of the rollout to those with underlying medical conditions, including smokers, but said essential workers like teachers are next.\n \"And just be very clear to our emergency first responders, to our police officers, to our firefighters, and to our teachers, you're on deck. The next time we have an update, I expect it will be to announce that the vaccine will become available to you,\" Tate said at a press conference Tuesday.\n CNN did not immediately hear back for comment from the Mississippi Department of Health.\n New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has defended the decision, saying it wouldn't be a matter for conversation if the federal government\u00a0provided states with more vaccine doses.\n \"I get it, I understand the optics here, and that attacking folks who took up the habit of smoking and are now addicted may be politically expedient,\" Murphy said at a news conference Friday. \"But at this time we are stuck in a position where we have to prioritize a limited federally distributed vaccine doses based on medical fact and not on political want. We need to save lives. And we need to protect our hospitals, by the way, from a patient surge.\"\n Murphy added that \"teachers are in the on-deck circle\" and any teachers younger than 65 with chronic health conditions are currently eligible for the vaccine.\n Teachers are also included in the next eligible sub-phase, New Jersey Department of Health spokeswoman Donna Leusner told CNN, but smoking is understood by health officials to be a health risk for state residents.\n \"Yes, the issue has been raised. Nicotine is one of the most powerful addictions. Smoking put individuals at higher risk for more severe disease. If an individual who smokes gets COVID, they get sicker much quicker.\u00a0 Our goal is to save as many lives as possible and to promote vaccination among the highest risk groups. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US as well as in NJ (except for Covid 19). We encourage anyone who smokes to quit,\" Leusner said in a statement to CNN.\n An estimated 2 million smokers in New Jersey make up the largest population qualifying for the vaccine under the list of underlying medical conditions, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said at a news conference Wednesday.\n Prioritizing smokers is a matter of public health, not a judgment of personal choices, said Dr. Albert Rizzo, the chief medical officer of the American Lung Association.\n \"It's a population that we know is at risk, whether it was a good choice, or a bad choice to become a smoker. They are smokers, they're at risk of getting sick, and needing medical services, so if we can keep them healthy that helps society in general,\" Rizzo told CNN.\n Rizzo, a pulmonologist in the Christiana Care Health System in Delaware, says it's difficult to rule out all smokers in favor of smokers who have additional diagnosed respiratory diseases.\n \"We can make arguments on either side, but we do know that smoking by itself, whether you have chronic bronchitis, but no COPD, or really just have a cough but no shortness of breath, put you still at risk,\" Rizzo said. \"And I think most people from a scientific standpoint says if you inhale, tobacco vapors and nicotine and tar, all those things inflame your airway and put you at risk whether or not you've reached the point of developing COPD or not.\"\n The World Health Organization launched a \"Commit to Quit\" campaign in December, cautioning smokers around the world of the risks related to the pandemic and offering resources to encourage people to quit.",

By fall, she was excited about returning to the classroom, but on just her second day back she became so concerned at the conditions in her Houston school that she took part in a sick-out with other teachers.\n Now, she wants the vaccine against Covid-19 to be prioritized for her and all other teachers to keep them safe at their schools.\n \"I'm all for teachers being put on a higher list because we are around so many,\" she told CNN.\n President-elect Joe Biden has put out a plan to spend $160 billion to execute a national vaccination program, expand testing and mobilize a public health jobs program, among other measures. He's also asked for $50 billion to expand Covid-19 testing, some of it earmarked to meet his goal of getting schools back open safely.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said getting children back into school and staying there would be one of his key goals when he becomes chief medical adviser to the incoming administration.\n \"The idea of vaccinating teachers is very high up in the priority, as well as doing surveillance in the schools so that you can get a good feel for the penetration of infection,\" he said last month.\n Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put teachers in the second tier of vaccine recipients, recommending they should be vaccinated along with other frontline essential workers like grocery store staff and police officers, once healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities are protected.\n But it's up to individual states to make their own priorities, so while some like California are following CDC guidance, it is not mandatory.\n In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis decided to open up vaccines to anyone over 65, sparking overwhelming demand.\n In Texas, where Gill is teaching, Gov. Greg Abbott said in December he wanted teachers \"near the front of the line.\" But CNN affiliate KTRK reported last week that while Houston fire and police officers were getting their shots, teachers were still waiting.\n Evidence suggests that schools, especially elementary schools, are not the superspreaders many feared. Cities that have seen increased positivity rates from coronavirus testing like Miami have managed to keep schools open without a spike in cases among students and faculty.\n But teachers have been infected and some have died.\n Zelene Blancas, a healthy 35-year-old first-grade teacher in El Paso, Texas, spent months in the hospital before she died of Covid-19 complications.\n Philamena Belone, 44, taught third graders in an oxygen mask after first being hospitalized for coronavirus treatment but had to go back when she couldn't breathe by herself. Also previously healthy, she died in December in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n Stories like these have shocked and alarmed teachers. Gill told CNN last year she felt like she was being asked to choose between her students and her health.\n \"I'm walking into a room where I actually don't really know what I'm breathing in,\" she said. \"A lot of our schools have really, they're very old and ... their AC units are very, very old.\"\n Gill says she knows people who are leaving the profession. She is stressed but she's doing her best to let that go and come to terms with the situation until she can be vaccinated and feel safer.\n For now though, she's using some of the same protective techniques used by frontline medical staff.\n \"Before I go to my boyfriend's house, I'll change my clothes and make sure that I'll take a shower and stuff because I feel like I might be bringing something to the people that I care about,\" she said.",

Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, who was arrested in Los Angeles last October on drug trafficking charges that were later dropped when he was returned to Mexico with a promise by local authorities to investigate him.\n President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said he supports the attorney general's decision not to press charges against Cienfuegos and that dropping the case doesn't mean his government isn't committed to cracking down on cartels and corruption.\n \"Yesterday the attorney general's office decided that the accusations that were fabricated against Gen. Cienfuegos by the US anti-drug agency, the D.E.A., are unfounded,\" Lopez Obrador said. \"The government endorses that and backs them, because we have said that there should be an end to impunity and with it corruption, but there also should not be reprisals,\" he said.\n Cienfuegos, Mexico's defense minister from 2012 to 2018, was accused of taking bribes in exchange for permitting a cartel to operate in Mexico, US federal prosecutors said when he was arrested in October. He was charged in Brooklyn, New York City, with money laundering and narcotics conspiracy.\n His arrest on Oct. 15 while on vacation in Los Angeles was the culmination of a years-long effort by Drug Enforcement Administration investigators and US prosecutors to uncover senior-level government officials who helped protect violent drug trafficking groups in Mexico.\n The office of Mexico's attorney general on Thursday said in a statement that it \"determined the non-exercise of criminal action, in favor of General Salvador Cienfuegos.\"\n According to the statement, the investigation did not lead to any confirmation that Cienfuegos \"had any encounter with the members of the criminal organization investigated by the North American authorities; nor did he carry out acts tending to protect said individuals.\"\n The statement added there was no \"evidence that he had used electronic equipment or means, or that he had issued any order to favor the criminal groups mentioned in this case.\"\n But Cienfuegos' legal woes -- and diplomatic tensions over his case with Mexico's northern neighbor -- may not be over.\n Following news of his exoneration, a spokesperson for the US Department of Justice, Nicole Navas Oxman, told CNN that \"the United States reserves the right to recommence its prosecution of Cienfuegos if the Government of Mexico fails to do so.\"",

        "title": "Oil giant splits from powerful lobbying group over climate change",
        "body_text": "The American Petroleum Institute, the nation's largest and most powerful oil lobby, is losing one of its biggest members over a disagreement about addressing the climate crisis.\n France's Total announced Friday it is quitting the API because of the lobby's stances on regulation and carbon pricing as well as its support for politicians who oppose the Paris climate agreement. The move makes Total the first major oil company to leave the API because of the climate crisis.\n The exit underscores the divide in the oil industry over how to respond to climate change. Top European oil companies including Total and BP have made more aggressive promises to slash carbon emissions and invest in clean energy than ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and other US firms.\n The move also comes amid a broader reckoning in Corporate America over political contributions following the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \"This is a serious blow for API, whose influence largely stems from its claim to be the voice of the entire oil and gas industry,\" Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said in a statement. He added the split is \"likely to mark the beginning of an exodus from the trade group.\"\n Founded in 1919, the API now has more than 600 members, including ExxonMobil, Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP and Shell.\n Total has helped lead the industry response to the climate crisis. Last year, Total announced a goal to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. Importantly, that goal included the so-called scope 3 emissions from the products it sells, namely gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. For major oil-and-gas companies, scope 3 can comprise as much as 85% of total emissions, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n \"We are committed to ensuring, in a transparent manner, that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the group in the fight against climate change,\" Patrick Pouyanne, Total's CEO, said in a statement.\n Total said a \"detailed analysis\" of API's climate positions revealed the lobby is only \"partially aligned\" with the company. Total cited several \"divergences,\" including API's support for rolling back US regulation on methane emissions, which the company opposed in November 2019. Total also noted that API is part of the Transportation Fairness Alliance, which is opposed to providing subsidies for electric vehicles.\n Additionally, Total said that during the recent elections, API supported candidates who opposed the United States' participation in the Paris climate agreement. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to swiftly return the nation to the accord.\n Indeed, InfluenceMap, a London-based think tank focused on energy and climate change, said the API \"appears to be broadly hostile to progressive climate policy.\" The group gives the API an \"F\" in terms of how aligned its climate policy is to the Paris agreement.\n In a statement, the API defended its climate record and thanked Total for its membership.\n \"We believe that the world's energy and environmental challenges are large enough that many different approaches are necessary to solve them, and we benefit from a diversity of views,\" an API spokesperson said.\n The API said it supports the \"ambitions of the Paris Agreement, including global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate poverty around the globe.\"\n Mike Sommers, API's CEO, said during a call with reporters this week that the group wants to work with President-elect Biden and the EPA on reducing methane emissions. \"We're open to the possibility of further regulation in this space,\" Sommers said, adding that the Biden administration should collaborate with the industry to come up with regulation that can \"actually survive judicial scrutiny.\"\n Edward Collins, director of corporate climate lobbying at InfluenceMap, said Total's departure will \"place pressure on BP and Shell to seriously examine their own memberships.\"\n Both European oil companies have promised to overhaul their businesses as they transition to low-carbon energy. And they both plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n In a statement, BP (BP) said it \"actively\" monitors its membership in trade associations, \"especially those we view as only 'partially aligned' with us on climate-related issues.\"\n \"We remain committed to trying to influence those associations from within,\" BP said, adding that it plans to publish a trade association update in the second quarter.\n Shell (RDSA) said that it regularly reviews its membership in industry associations, but it signaled no imminent exit from the API.\n \"Specific to climate, API is moving closer to Shell's own stated views,\" a Shell spokesman told CNN Business. \"As a result, we feel it's beneficial to remain a member so that we can continue to advocate for change from within.\"",

        "body_text": "After already losing seven family members to Covid-19, the Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns has tested positive for the coronavirus.\n Towns made the announcement on his social media, saying he received the test prior to Friday evening's scheduled game against the Memphis Grizzlies, which has now been postponed.\n \"I pray every day that this nightmare of a virus will subside and I beg everyone to continue to take it seriously by taking all of the necessary precautions,\" Towns wrote. \"We cannot stop the spread of this virus alone, it must be a group effort by all of us.\"\n Towns says he will immediately isolate and follow protocols. Last year, the NBA star lost his mother to complications from Covid-19, as well as his uncle. His father contracted the virus, too, but recovered.\n \"It breaks my heart that my family, and particularly my father and sister continue to suffer from the anxiety that comes along with this diagnosis as we know all too well what the end result could be,\" Towns said. \"To my niece and nephew, Jolani and Max, I promise you I will not end up in a box next to grandma and I will beat this.\"\n In accordance with the NBA's health and safety protocols, the game scheduled to take place at the Target Center in Minneapolis was postponed. Because of ongoing contact tracing within the Timberwolves, the team does not have the league-required eight available players to proceed with tonight's game against the Grizzlies.\n The game is just the latest in a slew of match-ups that have been postponed this season, which started on December 22. Twelve games have been postponed since Sunday, and 13 total have been postponed so far this season.",

        "body_text": "An 11-year-old boy was removed from his home and his parents are in jail after police say an Orlando waitress noticed something was wrong and used a note to ask him if he needed help.\n Flavaine Carvalho was not scheduled to work a shift at the Mrs. Potato restaurant on New Year's Day but someone called in sick, so she filled in, her boss Rafaela Cabede said during a press conference Thursday afternoon.\n It had been busy the rest of the day since it was a holiday, but things had slowed down finally and that family was the last table of the night, she said.\n \"We truly believe that this was a holy provision, and we were very blessed that we were able to help this child,\" Cabede explained.\n \"Because of her, two children... were saved,\" Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rolon said at the press conference. \"We probably would have been talking about a potential homicide investigation if she had not intervened when she did.\"\n Carvalho said the boy was wearing a mask and hoodie as he sat at the table along with two adults and a young girl.\n Although she couldn't see much, Carvalho said she noticed that he had a scratch in between in his eyebrows and that he did not order anything and wasn't eating, even though food had been brought to the table.\n Carvalho said she thought it was strange that the child wasn't eating and that he was quiet while the others were talking and playing.\n She asked the table if their food and drinks were OK. When the one of the adults replied that the boy would eat his dinner at home, Carvalho said she began to think something else was going on.\n \"You don't deny food for a kid, especially in a restaurant,\" Carvalho said.\n She then saw bruising on the side of the boy's face and arm and decided to see what she could do to help him.\n \"I just thought I need to do something,\" Carvalho explained. \"I could not see him go away without any help.\"\n Caravalho wrote a note asking the boy if he was OK and stood behind the parents where they couldn't see.\n The boy nodded no. \"I knew it -- that he is afraid or he is not comfortable saying that he needs help,\" Carvalho said.\n So she decided to write another note.\n This one said, \"Do you need help?\" Carvalho said the boy nodded yes and \"made a movement with his hands showing he didn't know what to do.\"\n Carvalho called her boss and then called 911.\n In a 911 call, Carvalho tells dispatchers she's worried about the boy.\n \"One of the kids is with a lot of bruises on his arms and on his face and the parent is not giving food for him but is giving to the other kids that are with them,\" she said in the recording sent to CNN by the Orlando Police Department. \"I'm super concerned and I don't know what to do. Can you give me some advice?\"\n Police arrived and questioned the child, who told detectives he had suffered abuse at the hands of his stepfather, identified by police as Timothy Lee Wilson II, Detective Erin Lawler with the Orlando Police special victims unit said during the press conference.\n The boy told detectives he had been hit with a wooden broom, hung upside down from a door, and was regularly denied food as punishment, according to an Orlando Police Department news release.\n Wilson was arrested at the restaurant, and the boy's mother, Kristen Swann, was taken into custody on January 6 after the boy made additional disclosures of alleged abuse, Lawler said.\n The stepfather is charged with multiple counts of aggravated child abuse and neglect, court records show.\n An Orlando Police Department press release said Swann admitted to detectives she knew about the abuse and failed to seek medical care for her son. She is charged with two counts of child neglect, court records show.\n A 4-year-old child was removed from the home following the arrests of the parents and was found to not have suffered any abuse, according to Lawler.\n Lawler said the boy is Swann's child and the 4-year-old is Swann's and Wilson's child.\n After Carvalho called 911, the boy was taken to a hospital for his injuries, where he was found to be 20 pounds underweight for his age, according to Lawler.\n Bruises across the boy's entire body in various stages of healing were also noted, Lawler said.\n \"What this child had gone through it was torture,\" Lawler said with tears in her eyes. \"I'm a mother and seeing what that 11-year-old had to go through... It shocks your soul.\"\n \"If Ms. Carvalho would not have said something when she saw it that little boy would probably not be with us much longer,\" she added.\n Lawler said the boy told investigators he had been abused on Christmas Day when the parents said Santa had suggested he be punished. The punishment included him being handcuffed to a furniture dolly, Lawler said, with his hands behind his back with rachet straps on his ankles and was made to set himself free. He was also hung upside down from his ankles in a doorway with ratchet straps, Lawler said.\n The detective said the parents said they would punish him by making him do planks for 30 minutes and beat him when he couldn't do it.\n Wilson and Swann were both booked in the Orange County Jail.\n CNN has reached out to an attorney for Wilson but has not yet heard back. CNN has not been able to determine if Swann has legal representation.\n Court records show Wilson attended a first appearance January 6 for four charges which include three counts of felony aggravated child abuse and one count of child neglect.\n They both remain at the Orange County Jail, Heidi Rodriguez, spokeswoman at the Orlando Police Department, told CNN in an email Thursday.",

        "body_text": "An internal Capitol Police intelligence report produced three days before rioters breached the US Capitol cautioned that violent supporters of President Donald Trump could zero in on \"Congress itself,\" the Washington Post reported Friday, citing obtained portions of the 12-page memo.\n \"Supporters of the current president see January 6, 2021, as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election,\" the memo reads, according to the Post. \"This sense of desperation and disappointment may lead to more of an incentive to become violent. Unlike previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counter-protesters as they were previously, but rather Congress itself is the target on the 6th.\"\n CNN has not independently confirmed the veracity of the report. CNN has reached out to the Capitol Police, whose spokeswoman declined to comment to the Post on the contents of the report or its influence on planning for January 6.\n The January 3 report warns of thousands of belligerent rioters, incited by the President and joined by members of White supremacists and extremist groups, descending on the nation's capital with members of Congress the target of their anger, the paper reported.\n It included striking characterizations of Trump supporters seeming to prepare for intense combat on platforms frequented by White supremacists and members of the alt-right, calling for participants to bring firearms, gas masks, bulletproofs vests and other specialized equipment, the paper reported.\n The intelligence report determined that the anticipated crowds, the calls for armament, proximity to the Capitol and promotion \"by President Trump himself\" could make it a dangerous situation, per the Post.\n \"The Stop the Steal protest in particular does not have a permit, but several high profile speakers, including Members of Congress are expected to speak at the event,\" the memo read, according to the paper. \"This combined with Stop the Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence, may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.\"\n Two people familiar with the intelligence memo told the Post that the intelligence division's director, Jack Donohue, shared the report with all Capitol Police command staff. The intelligence report spurred the Capitol Police chief to pursue emergency activation of the National Guard and prompted the department to widen its perimeter barricades, a law enforcement official told the Post.\n Former Capitol Police chief Steven Sund, who resigned in the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, told the Post on Friday that the intelligence units reports informed preparation of security, but he declined to discuss an internal memo.\n One law enforcement official told the Post that the internal perception of the memo wasn't that it was warning of some new threat with thousands of rioters attacking the Capitol, but rather of events similar to those the department had previously handled at smaller Trump rallies late last year.\n The Post reports that the intelligence memo is not known to have been widely circulated with other branches of law enforcement, such as the FBI, or outside the Capitol Police force.",

        "body_text": "Vice President Mike Pence came closer than initially known to the mob of pro-Trump rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, according to new reporting from the Washington Post.\n CNN previously reported and video footage showed that a lone US Capitol Police officer had lured rioters away from the entrance of the Senate chambers at 2:14 p.m. ET on January 6, where Pence and lawmakers had been conducting the ceremonial counting of the 2020 electoral votes.\n Senators were alerted that protesters had breached the Capitol building just one minute earlier, according to CNN's timeline of events from last Wednesday's riot. Pence wouldn't be evacuated from the Senate until 2:30 p.m.\n The Post's report of how close the rioters were to Pence stresses the level of danger he and other government leaders faced during the January 6 insurrection. Some of the pro-Trump rioters who rampaged the US Capitol were heard screaming \"where's Mike Pence\" and seen on video shouting \"hang Mike Pence\" \u2014 upset that Pence was doing his constitutional duty to certify the November election results.\n Pence, per the Post, remained in the Senate chamber for about 14 minutes after Capitol Police reported the initial attempted breach of the building.\n The vice president, along with second lady Karen Pence and their daughter Charlotte Pence Bond, were then rushed into a room near the Senate floor.\n About one minute after Pence was moved, the Post said, a handful of the rioters made it up the stairs to reach the second floor landing outside the Senate entrance. Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman heroically led the group of rioters in the opposite direction, away from the Senate chambers' entrance.\n Pence and his family were in a hideaway \"less than 100 feet from that landing,\" the Post reported, citing three people familiar with his whereabouts.\n If the rioters had arrived seconds earlier, they would have been in eyesight of the vice president as he was rushed across a reception hall into the office, the Post suggested, adding that Pence later was moved to a more secure location.\n CNN has reached out to the Vice President's office for comment.\n US Secret Service told CNN in a statement Friday that Pence was \"secure at all times.\"\n \"While the Secret Service does not speak specifically about the means and methods of our protective operations, Vice President Pence was secure at all times on Jan. 6,\" a USSS spokesperson said.\n The report, former Secret Service agent and CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow said, \"speaks to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of executive protection, where any delay in action by agents can have dire consequences.\"\n Wackrow continued, \"The agents in this situation rely on their training, tactics and experience to ensure the safety of the Vice President. It may be easy for those who do not understand protective operations to question the actions on this day; however, as an expert, I can attest that the actions by the VP's Detail and the Counter Assault Team agents guaranteed the safety of those involved.\"\n CNN previously reported that the Secret Service wanted Pence to leave the Capitol complex, and everything was in place, but Pence wanted to remain on site, according to a source familiar. The source told CNN that Pence's Secret Service detail remained with him through the entire ordeal.\n A rioter was later photographed sitting in Pence's chair after some protesters breached the Senate chamber.\n Many lawmakers have since shared their experiences during those hours that they sheltered in place, fearing for their lives, and subsequent arrests and criminal charges have added to a growing understanding of how much a threat the mob posed to lawmakers.\n CNN's Pamela Brown contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's \"actions and rhetoric\" have tarnished the administration's legacy, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a resignation letter submitted this week.\n Azar submitted the standard resignation letter for a Cabinet secretary to offer an outgoing president, dated January 12 and obtained by CNN Friday.\n In the letter, addressed to Trump, Azar laid out what he considered to be the best accomplishments of HHS over the past four years.\n \"Unfortunately, the actions and rhetoric following the election, especially during this past week, threaten to tarnish these and other historic legacies of this Administration,\" Azar wrote in the letter.\n \"The attacks on the Capitol were an assault on our democracy and on the tradition of peaceful transitions of power that the United States of America first brought to the world,\" Azar wrote in the letter, first reported by The New York Times.\n \"I implore you to continue to condemn unequivocally any form of violence, to demand that no one attempt to disrupt the inaugural activities in Washington or elsewhere, and to continue to support unreservedly the peaceful and orderly transition of power on January 20, 2021.\"\n Azar said he plans to stay in his role until January 20, when President-elect Joe Biden's team takes over.\n Azar mentions the coronavirus pandemic first and it was, by far, the biggest development of Trump's presidency. More than 390,000 Americans have died in the pandemic and more than 23 million have been diagnosed with the virus.\n But in his letter, Azar doesn't mention those numbers, the federal government's failure to warn of a pandemic for weeks or the greatly delayed rollout of tests that public health experts say slowed the US response during crucial weeks that could have curbed the spread of the virus.\n Azar does not mention disagreements over the danger of the virus -- Trump repeatedly claimed it would \"disappear\" -- and doesn't reference arguments over mandating or even recommending the use of masks to slow the spread.\n Instead, Azar characterizes his department's actions as quick and aggressive.\n \"While we mourn every lost life, our early, aggressive and comprehensive efforts saved hundreds of thousands or even millions of American lives,\" Azar writes in the letter.\n \"Operation Warp Speed achieved in nine months what many doubted would be possible in a year and a half or more,\" Azar said.\n \"As of this date we have two safe and effective vaccines being administered to millions of Americans, with more vaccines likely to be authorized shortly.\"\n While it's true the vaccines have been developed in record time and are remarkably effective, the rollout has been slower than promised.\n Operation Warp Speed repeatedly promised 20 million Americans would have been vaccinated by the end of December. As of Friday -- three days after Azar submitted the letter -- 10.6 million people had been vaccinated.",

        "body_text": "Washington, DC, and states across the country are heightening security and preparing reinforcements this week ahead of potential armed protests from Saturday up to at least Inauguration Day on Wednesday.\n One week after a pro-Trump mob ransacked the US Capitol, federal officials reiterated a warning in a call with law enforcement leaders across the country, saying they remain concerned about the prospect of extremists appearing at planned rallies and conducting violence.\n Security is also ramping up in battleground states that were crucial to President-elect Joe Biden's presidential victory, with governors activating the National Guard, closing capitols, erecting fences and barriers and, in at least two cases, boarding up windows.\n FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday that authorities are \"tracking calls for potential armed protests and activity leading up to the inauguration.\"\n \"We're monitoring all incoming leads -- whether calls for armed protests, potential threats that grow out of the January 6th breach of the Capitol, or other kinds of potential threats leading up to inaugural events and various other targets,\" Wray said.\n It all adds up to an inauguration unlike any other, with no crowds in DC and security to the maximum across the country.\n A week after the US Capitol riot, the area around Capitol Hill is under strict security. Members of the National Guard were present all around, including inside the Capitol, and new fencing blocked off the perimeter of the area.\n DC Police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday that more than 20,000 National Guard members could be expected in the district for Biden's inauguration, though he noted the final numbers will be provided by the US Secret Service.\n The officials added that there is no concern that there will be any shortage of Guard forces to meet requirements from states and the District of Columbia.\n Contee told reporters he remains concerned amid a \"major security threat\" ahead of the inauguration and planned demonstrations in the district this weekend.\n \"I've been concerned before today and will be through this weekend, and beyond,\" Contee said on Wednesday.\n He also praised DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's security posture, including discouraging people from coming to Washington for the inauguration.\n \"There's a major security threat, and we are working to mitigate those threats,\" he added.\n The National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day due to security concerns, the National Park Service (NPS) announced Friday.\n The temporary public closure began Friday morning and will extend through at least Thursday, January 21. The NPS says protests will be allowed in designated locations and will be limited to those with permits.\n House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced Friday that retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 will lead a review of security infrastructure, interagency processes and command and control operations on Capitol Hill.\n States across the country are enhancing security and calling up the National Guard to protect capitols ahead of the possible protests, including in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.\n Florida and Maine have also activated the National Guard to work with state law enforcement.\n A number of states are deploying heavy fencing and additional crowd control measures around their capitols, including in Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington, while Pennsylvania has built barriers and increased security.\n Although many capitols are closed due to coronavirus restrictions, the warnings are particularly fraught in states that allow people to openly carry firearms and those where Trump has falsely claimed fraud.\n Kentucky and Texas went steps further Friday, announcing that the grounds around the state Capitols will be closed temporarily.\n The Texas Capitol complex will close from Saturday through Wednesday, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n The department's director said the agency is aware of armed protests planned at the Texas State Capitol this week and \"violent extremists who may seek to exploit constitutionally protected events to conduct criminal acts.\"\n Director Steven McCraw said the agency has deployed additional personnel and resources to the Capitol.\n Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said he understands the state's move to close the Capitol grounds on Sunday will inconvenience some people.\n \"We appreciate everyone's understanding and your patriotism,\" he said.\n In Michigan, where heavily armed demonstrators jammed inside the state Capitol in Lansing in the spring, the open carry of firearms was banned inside the building. Still, Lansing's mayor has asked the governor to call up the National Guard to protect the Capitol, and the state attorney general said that the state's new open-carry firearms ban there is not enough.\n The Michigan State Police is mobilizing personnel from across the state to secure the Capitol ahead of planned protests, including one on Sunday, the agency said in a statement Friday.\n Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told CNN that the actions of law enforcement and the open-carry ban have assuaged his fears for now.\n \"Hopefully, the temperature of the country comes down a little bit after Trump is no longer in the White House and Joe Biden has been officially inaugurated,\" she said. \"But I think it's going to be a day-by-day process to see what the threat level is.\"\n The state Senate and House have canceled legislative sessions around Inauguration Day over concerns of \"credible threats.\"\n In Virginia, a state of emergency has been declared in Richmond and Capitol Square will be closed ahead of anticipated protests at the state Capitol. The state is anticipating a gathering Monday for \"Lobby Day,\" an annual protest event that last year brought thousands of gun rights advocates to the Capitol.\n Governors in Maryland, New Mexico and Utah also declared states of emergency.\n In Oregon, the FBI has set up a command post to gather and share intelligence with law enforcement on potential threats of violence to the state Capitol.\n New Jersey has told state employees to work from home on Inauguration Day.\n Several large states are on high alert. In New York, state police have taken steps \"to harden security in and around the State Capitol in Albany\" ahead of Biden's inauguration. And in California, more than 1,000 National Guard troops have been deployed and fencing has been erected around the Capitol after what the governor called an \"unconscionable assault on our Republic.\"\n CNN's Alison Main, Ryan Nobles, Rebekah Riess, Nicky Robertson, Taylor Romine, Hollie Silverman, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Barbara Starr and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Despite Trump administration promise, government has no more 'reserve' 2nd vaccine doses",
        "body_text": "Hopes of a surge in Covid-19 vaccine shipments under a new policy to release second doses held in reserve appear to be evaporating -- with the revelation that those doses have already been distributed, contrary to recent indications by the Trump administration.\n A senior administration official told CNN that when the administration announced that it would be releasing reserved doses Friday, many of those reserves had already been released into the system starting last year as production was ramping up.\n When Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was asked Friday whether there is in fact a reserve of second doses left to release, he said, \"No. There's not a reserve stockpile.\"\n \"We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people, so we're not sitting on a reserve anymore,\" he said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt. \"We've made that available to the states to order.\"\n The revelation appears to contradict what Azar announced on Tuesday at an Operation Warp Speed briefing, where he said the administration would be \"releasing the entire supply for order by states, rather than holding second doses in reserve.\"\n And it adds another level of confusion for state officials, who have scrambled to distribute the vaccines after being tasked to do so by the federal government.\n However, vaccine maker Pfizer said it had the doses ready to deliver. What was not immediately clear was how long it might take to get those doses to states.\n The official who spoke with CNN pushed back on a Washington Post report that the second-dose supply was \"exhausted,\" instead characterizing the reserve as a rolling and replenished supply with new production. The source emphasized that the supply would still benefit from those extra doses already in circulation but acknowledged that this means there will not be a sudden surge in distribution numbers, as many had been led to believe.\n Michael Pratt, a spokesman for Operation Warp Speed, also denied the notion the reserve was \"exhausted\" in a statement to CNN.\n \"This week, nearly 13 million total doses have been provided to states to order, millions more than other weeks, as the reserve of second doses is completely made available to order against,\" Pratt said. \"States have yet to fully order against their ordering caps. As stated this week, we have now moved to the phase where the full amount released to OWS is being made available to order, first to cover second doses, second to provide additional first doses.\"\n The news blindsided many of the officials who have been tasked with creating plans to administer vaccines at the state and local level.\n \"I am demanding answers from the Trump Administration. I am shocked and appalled that they have set an expectation on which they could not deliver, with such grave consequences,\" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, tweeted Friday. \"This is a deception on a national scale. Oregon's seniors, teachers, all of us, were depending on the promise of Oregon's share of the federal reserve of vaccines being released to us.\"\n Oregon Health Director Patrick Allen, in a letter to Azar in which he recounted a call with Brown and Operation Warp Speed CEO Gen. Gustave Perna on Thursday, demanded that the HHS chief reconcile his statement about \"releasing the entire supply\" with this revelation.\n \"During that call, he informed us there is no reserve of doses, and we are already receiving the full allocation of vaccines,\" Allen wrote. \"If true, this is extremely disturbing, and puts our plans to expand eligibility at grave risk. Those plans were made on the basis of reliance on your statement about 'releasing the entire supply' you have in reserve. If this information is accurate, we will be unable to begin vaccinating our vulnerable seniors on January 23, as planned.\"\n In an interview with CNN, Allen described the call as an \"awkward discussion\" in which Perna had confirmed there was no physical stockpile of vaccine but made it seem as if states had simply misunderstood the administration's plans.\n \"I do not believe I misunderstood,\" Allen said. Allen confirmed that Oregon will have to delay its plan to start vaccinating seniors January 23, since no surge in vaccine is coming.\n \"It's just so disappointing,\" he added. \"People are desperate for the vaccine, and we have worked so hard to be able to expand who's eligible, and to not be able to do it is just crushing right now.\"\n Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis accused the administration of lying to state officials.\n \"Federal announcements that 2nd dose being held in reserve was going to be released led us to expect 210,000 doses next week, other Govs made similar plans. Now we find out we'll only get 79,000 next week,\" he tweeted.\n Vaccine maker Pfizer says it has second doses of coronavirus vaccines ready to ship as needed.\n \"Operation Warp Speed (OWS) has asked us to start shipping second doses only recently. As a result, we have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US. We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,\" Pfizer said in a statement sent to CNN.\n \"We have and are continuing to work closely with OWS on our production, release and shipping schedules -- to ensure Americans receive their first and second doses of the vaccine on time. We have provided OWS with a specific schedule and we foresee no issues in delivering on the commitments we have made,\" the company added.\n CNN contacted vaccine manufacturer Moderna, as well as Moderna's distribution partner McKesson, and did not get a response.\n The revelation that second doses weren't strictly held in reserve was first reported by the Post, which also reported that the Trump administration had shifted its strategy to begin tapping into second doses late last year.\n \"We are hearing there is not a stockpile of vaccine for second dose but that it was more of a 'paper exercise,' \" said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. \"The stockpile appears to be all on paper; they were tracking anticipated need but not actually holding back product.\"\n The bottom line, Plescia said, is the vaccine will remain scarce for at least a few more weeks.\n \"I think the original message got lost in a lot of overpromising,\" Plescia said. \"Until there is a more robust supply we need to be clear with the public that opportunity to get the vaccine is limited.\"\n The realization that there's no massive tranche of vaccines coming stunned even those in regular contact with the administration's health officials.\n Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said her organization had not been informed about the lack of a vaccine reserve and read about it in the news.\n \"It was a complete surprise,\" Freeman told CNN on Friday, adding, \"To hear that this had been done for several weeks was actually shocking to us.\"\n \"I don't know if the right hand knows what the left hand is doing here,\" she said, adding that there's a risk that people will not be inoculated correctly if the federal government isn't providing reliable numbers for its vaccine supply.\n The news caps off a disappointing vaccine rollout under the Trump administration.\n While vaccines were developed in record time, the process of getting them into Americans' arms has moved far more slowly than officials promised. That's largely because the Trump administration left it up to each state to figure out the herculean task of vaccinating its population. But the administration's constantly fluctuating estimates about how much vaccine will be available have also made it difficult for states to craft vaccination plans, state officials have said.\n \"The announcement on Tuesday from Sec Azar that HHS would be releasing the entire supply for order by states, rather than holding 2nd doses in reserve led us to believe that additional doses were available and would be forthcoming,\" Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN, noting that allocations to states have not actually increased.\n \"State and local jurisdictions are eager for more doses to expand vaccination to older Americans while continuing to vaccinate health care and essential front-line workers,\" Hannan added. \"It is so critical that states get accurate estimates and allocations in advance so that they can plan for vaccine distribution and administration.\"\n This story has been updated with comments from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and a statement from Pfizer.\n CNN's Jacqueline Howard, Lauren Mascarenhas, Amanda Sealy, Nadia Kounang and John Bonifield contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The overwhelming majority of the more than 20,000 National Guard members expected in Washington for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration will not be tested for coronavirus before they are deployed from states around the country or upon their arrival in the nation's capital, a National Guard spokesperson tells CNN.\n The Pentagon has authorized up to 25,000 National Guard members to help with inauguration security.\n Testing for National Guard members sent to DC is \"case dependent\" but not widely required, the spokesperson said, noting there are some screening procedures, such as temperature checks, in place.\n \"Incoming Guard men and women are screened upon departure from their individual states and upon arrival to the DC Armory according to CDC guidelines. Temperature checks and screening questions are in place; masks and social distancing are required where the mission allows,\" the DC National Guard said in a statement to CNN Friday.\n The National Guard encourages coronavirus testing to personnel who are symptomatic or exposed to the coronavirus.\n But as CNN has consistently reported, coronavirus can be spread by people who have no symptoms and without testing, it is impossible to know whether any of the thousands of Guard members are carrying the virus. And they are being deployed with little warning.\n The troops are also arriving in large numbers as the US has had its deadliest 14 days in the pandemic. More than 3.2 million new cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2021, according to John Hopkins University data.\n Earlier this week, Ohio National Guard Maj. Gen. John Harris expressed his concern for deploying the National Guard in his state.\n \"I'll just remind you -- that these National Guard folks that we're bringing on duty were doing something else just a couple days ago and had no idea they'd be coming here,\" Harris said during a news conference.  \"Bringing these folks together collectively -- it is a real concern for us.\"\n The National Guard follows guidance issued by the Department of Defense in April that urged personnel \"to follow CDC guidelines on the use of cloth face coverings in public settings or where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\" Additional steps are being taken to ensure the safety of Guard members, including appropriate personal protective equipment and housing arrangements that allow for distancing, a National Guard Spokesman told CNN.\n But it would be difficult to maintain Covid-19 social distancing precautions if there is an event similar to the riot on at the Capitol last week, a spokesman noted.\n National Guard troops deployed at the state level by governors follow the health guidance of that particular state, including coronavirus testing protocol. As the District of Columbia is not a state, the gubernatorial role is assumed by the Secretary of the Army under the federal umbrella of the Department of Defense.",

        "body_text": "Justice Department prosecutors have formally walked back their assertion in a court filing that said Capitol rioters sought to \"capture and assassinate elected officials.\"\n A federal prosecutor in Arizona asked a magistrate judge in a hearing on Friday to strike the line in a recent court filing about defendant Jacob Anthony Chansley, a man who is alleged to have led some in the crowd in the first wave into the Capitol with a bullhorn while carrying a spear and wearing a fur headdress.\n The entire line the prosecutors want to omit from their court filing is: \"Strong evidence, including Chansley's own words and actions at the Capitol, supports that the intent of the Capitol rioters was to capture and assassinate elected officials in the United States Government.\"\n The stunning move comes a few hours after the Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, said at a press conference there was \"no direct evidence of kill and capture teams\" at this time in the siege of the Capitol building.\n In court, Todd Allison, a line prosecutor for the Justice Department in Arizona, said DOJ may want to argue that type of assertion if Chansley goes to trial, but cannot say that at the moment.\n \"We do not want to mislead the court by discussing the strength of any specific evidence\" related to his intent, Allison said.\n The line was a chilling description yet of rioters who seized the Capitol last week, writing in a court filing that the intention was \"to capture and assassinate elected officials.\"\n Justice Department lawyers have begun describing in more alarming terms what transpired.\n In a separate case, prosecutors in Texas court alleged that a retired Air Force reservist who carried plastic zip tie-like restraints on the Senate floor may have intended to restrain lawmakers.\n Chansley's attorney said he is not violent.\n \"He loved Trump, every word. He listened to him. He felt like he was answering the call of our president,\" Chansley's attorney Al Watkins, appearing on CNN Thursday night, said. \"My client wasn't violent. He didn't cross over any police lines. He didn't assault anyone.\" Watkins said Chansley also hopes for a presidential pardon.\n Prosecutors describe those who took over the Capitol as \"insurrectionists\" and offer new details about Chansley's role in the violent siege last week, including that after standing at the dais where Vice President Mike Pence had stood that morning, Chansley wrote a note saying \"it's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"\n Chansley later told the FBI he did not mean the note as a threat but said the Vice President was a \"child-trafficking traitor\" and went on a long diatribe about Pence, Biden and other politicians as traitors.\n Before he was arrested, Chansley told the FBI he wanted to return to Washington for the inauguration to protest.\n Prosecutors accuse Chansley of being a flight risk who can quickly raise money through non-traditional means as \"one of the leaders and mascots of QAnon, a group commonly referred to as a cult (which preaches debunked and fictitious anti-government conspiracy theory).\"\n They also said Chansley suffers from mental illness and is a regular drug user, according to prosecutors' detention memo.\n A body armor-clad retired Air Force reservist who carried plastic zip tie-like restraints on the Senate floor may have intended to restrain lawmakers, federal prosecutors argued in a Texas court on Thursday.\n Prosecutors say Larry Rendell Brock, a 53-year-old retired Air Force Reserve officer who was arrested in Texas, was photographed roaming the Senate chamber clutching a white flex cuff, which is used by law enforcement to restrain or detain subjects.\n In court, prosecutors \"argued that Mr. Brock intended to use the zip-ties to restrain those he viewed as enemies -- presumably, federal lawmakers, who had moments before been evacuated from the chamber,\" said Erin Dooley, a spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's Office, in the Northern District of Texas.\n Brock was arrested January 10. He was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to court records.\n Now-viral photos show the man prosecutors have identified as Brock sporting a military helmet, green tactical vest and black-and-camo jacket. His ex-wife had identified him to the FBI after seeing him in a photo from the insurrection, according to an FBI agent's affidavit supporting Brock's arrest.\n A magistrate judge on Thursday released Brock to home confinement with electronic monitoring and limits on interacting with others involved in the riot and barred him from possessing guns or accessing social media.\n According to court filings, prosecutors allege that Brock posted on Facebook about buying body armor and a helmet for a \"civil war\" and believed the US election was being certified by a \"hostile governing force.\"\n In an interview with the New Yorker, Brock denied that he holds racist views. He repeated President Donald Trump's baseless assertions of election fraud.\n Brock told the magazine that vandalism to the Capitol building \"was not my intent.\" He said he had picked the restraints off the ground and intended to give them back to a police officer.\n This story and headline have been updated with DOJ's walk-back of the \"capture and assassinate\" allegations.",

That number will more than triple in the next few days.\n The surge in service members comes as law enforcement in the nation's capital and around the country brace for more extremist violence after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol last week. The FBI has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington in the days leading up to Biden's inauguration, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN.\n \"Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the US Capitol from 17 January through 20 January,\" the bulletin states.\n The National Guard will have more than strength in numbers. The Department of Defense announced Tuesday that National Guard members will be armed as they are supporting US Capitol security in Washington, DC, ahead of Inauguration Day.\n Capt. Chelsi Johnson, spokesperson for the DC National Guard, said in a statement to CNN that the move was requested by federal authorities and authorized by Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy. The first wave of National Guard troops who arrived at the Capitol were unarmed.\n Different entities involved in the inauguration are preparing as well. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday urged Americans to avoid the city during Biden's inauguration. Speaking at a news conference Monday, Bowser, a Democrat, stressed that she was concerned about more violent actors potentially coming to the city in the run-up to the inauguration, saying, \"If I'm scared of anything, it's for our democracy, because we have very extreme factions in our country that are armed and dangerous.\"\n The Secret Service, which is leading the overall security effort working in coordination with federal law enforcement agencies and the Pentagon, on Wednesday officially took charge of security for Biden's inauguration as authorities warned of new threats across the country after last week's violence at the Capitol. The agency has been instructed to begin its preparations for the inauguration ahead of schedule.\n Law enforcement is using a huge amount of surveillance, including monitoring phones and other communications, in an all-out effort to track individuals to ensure they do not travel to Washington, according to law enforcement officials.\n Federal authorities are tracking dozens of people who pose potential concerns of violence who may be coming to Washington for events around the inauguration, according to a source briefed on intelligence shared among federal and local law enforcement.\n Some extremists are so suspicious and obsessed with anti-government conspiracies that they're telling associates they don't trust some of the planned protests, fearing they are actually FBI plots to try to frame them, according to one official.\n Security officials also have shared information citing specific concerns about vehicles that could be used to breach security, the source said. The information adds to the already heightened alert in the capital as authorities try to protect a central area of the city where the transfer of power will take place on January 20.\n Earlier Friday, Metropolitan Police Department acting Chief Robert Contee said law enforcement has been getting a \"daily download\" from the FBI of the internet \"chatter\" of possible protests around the inauguration.\n \"I can assure the residents of the District of Columbia that the Metropolitan Police Department and federal partners are in a posture to respond to the information that's out there thus far that we've heard,\" Contee said.\n MPD is coordinating with the FBI, and briefing Bowser daily on all threats, the acting police chief stated.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Chandelis Duster, Barbara Starr and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "How can a $20 bill be worth over $57,000? Because of a printing mishap.\n The \"Del Monte note,\" a rare $20 banknote with a banana sticker on it, is currently for sale through Heritage Auctions, a Dallas-based auction house. Currency collectors are paying close attention and breaking previous bidding records with their offers, according to Heritage Auctions.\n \"The note has been viewed on our website over 4,300 times,\" Dustin Johnston told CNN. He's the vice president and managing director of the currency department with Heritage Auctions.\n The banknote, from the 1996 series, is unique because of the sticker, which found its way onto it between stages of the printing process, and has part of the Treasury seal and the note's serial number printed over it.\n Current bidding for the note is at $57,500, for a total cost of $69,000 after a buyer's premium is applied.\n The auction will wrap up on January 22. On that day, the note will be offered among other items during a live event that starts at 6 p.m. Central Time and will be streamed on Heritage Auctions' website.\n This type of printing error on currency is referred to as an \"obstruction.\"\n \"Most 'obstructed error' notes result from a loose piece of paper, scotch tape, band-aid, or other detritus becoming attached to the currency stock during the printing process and later falling off. Most notes of this class thus exhibit a blank area somewhere on the note,\" said Leonard Augsburger, the project coordinator of the Newman Numismatic Portal at Washington University in St. Louis.\n He said most banknotes featuring obstructions will sell for between $100 to $1000.\n \"The Del Monte note is more spectacular,\" Augsburger added.\n According to Heritage Auctions, the note, printed at the Fort Worth Western Currency Facility, first surfaced in 2003 when a college student in Ohio listed it for sale on eBay. He'd gotten it from an ATM.\n \"A lot of errors that come through and come out of the ATM are very hard to notice,\" Johnston told CNN.\n \"This is one of those really incredible errors that is immediately obvious. It's tactile, so if you're pulling [money] out and you're just counting it, you're probably gonna feel just the increased height of the sticker. And then of course the color just jumps out at you,\" Johnston added.\n In 2003, the note sold on eBay for around $10,000. It was sold again in 2006, in an auction by Heritage Auctions, and at that time it went for over $25,000.\n Johnston told CNN that the note is so important that, for both auctions, he flew to pick it up in person and bring it back to the auction house.\n How the sticker made its way onto the note is mysterious, but it's possible the action was deliberate.\n The printing of federal currency happens in three stages: the back first, then the front, then a third stage when the serial number and federal seal are added.\n \"By examining the sticker and the overprint, it is clear that the sticker was applied after the front was printed and before the serial number and seal were applied,\" Augsburger said.\n \"The placement of the sticker is intriguing -- if it were placed in most areas of the note it would not be possible to prove that it was applied between the second and third stage. This suggests a deliberate placement,\" he added.\n Johnston told CNN the sticker could have been affixed to the note for testing purposes.\n \"Over the last 20 to 30 years, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has started using optical recognition to review the notes as they come off the printing press. Previously people did that,\" Johnston explained.\n \"It's very possible that sometimes they'd do things like this purposely, to test their procedures, and maybe this still got out.\"\n With the increased use of digital tools to weed out errors, retained obstructions on banknotes are rarely found. Johnston's says it's a one-in-a-million chance.\n \"This is maybe one of the last really great retained obstructions that we'll see,\" he said.\n Johnston also thinks it's possible the sticker was placed on the note as a joke.\n \"For a sticker to make it onto the printing floor, and get stuck to something else, and make it so cleanly on to the note... you'd almost have to suspect it was done on purpose, you know, a prank or practical joke, whatever it may be.\"\n The item has attracted the attention of so many collectors, monitoring the current auction on the site. What makes it so special?\n \"We're always attracted to things that go wrong. This is one of those things that -- not only did it go wrong, it's visually fantastic. And it's fun on top of it,\" Johnston said.",

        "body_text": "Thomas Balcerski teaches history at Eastern Connecticut State University. He is the author of \"Bosom Friends: The Intimate World of James Buchanan and William Rufus King\" (Oxford University Press). He tweets @tbalcerski. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nOn January 20, Joe Biden will be inaugurated the next President of the United States. But his Inauguration Day comes amid increased threats from extremists who falsely challenge the legitimacy of his election. As a result, the President-elect will no longer be taking Amtrak to Washington DC for his ceremony. An inauguration rehearsal scheduled for Sunday has been postponed. And the National Mall is closed through at least next Thursday.\n These security measures follow last week's violent insurrection against the Capitol. Even as the political fallout from the events of January 6 continues -- including Wednesday's historic vote by the House of Representatives to impeach Trump for a second time -- the sight of thousands of National Guard troops stationed inside the Capitol and across Washington DC points to the continued danger of violence facing the capital.\n However, America has been here before. The country has faced insurrectionary threats twice following contested presidential elections -- from 1860 to 1861, prior to the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, and from 1876 to 1877, in the lead-up to the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes. In each instance, these threats prompted increased military presence on the day of the incoming Presidents' swearing-in.\n These two inaugurations also bookend key chapters in the divisive era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Just as Lincoln had tried to avert war, Hayes hoped to avoid further conflict with the South and protect the civil rights of African Americans. Though neither administration achieved their stated goals, the newly-elected Presidents' commitments to protecting democracy were worthy aspirations for their time -- and our own. Similarly, Biden's inauguration will not only fulfill a constitutional obligation, but it will also reinforce Americans' resolve that threats of violence will not stop the democratic process from continuing.\n In what may be a foreshadowing of what's to come for Biden, both Lincoln and Hayes faced extremely challenging times as President. But regardless of the challenges that lay ahead, to kowtow to those who would undo the results of an election poses an even greater risk to America. The inauguration of a new President -- much like the American experiment in democracy itself -- must go on.\n Let's take a closer at those two historical inaugurations held despite the threat of violence.\n President Lincoln entered office after seven Southern states had seceded in the wake of the 1860 election. Violent threats of all kinds prevailed. One scheme called for abducting Lincoln to achieve more favorable terms to the South, and, failing that, to assassinate him.\n More troubling, while Lincoln was traveling from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington DC for his inauguration, detectives learned of an armed mob in Baltimore consisting of \"Plug Uglies\" -- a nativist street gang -- who planned to attack the train carrying the President-elect. Out of a concern for safety, Lincoln agreed to bypass a stop in Baltimore.\n On the day of Lincoln's inauguration, Lieutenant General Winfield Scott ordered the DC militia -- the antecedent to today's National Guard -- to guard the parade route from the Willard Hotel, where Lincoln was staying, to the Capitol. Special sapper units proceeded first to clear the route of threats, while cavalry accompanied Lincoln and Buchanan as they rode in an open-air barouche. Snipers watched from rooftops to prevent anyone from approaching too closely.\n Lincoln then delivered his inaugural address on the east side of the Capitol. Marked by reconciliation and calls for unity, Lincoln's speech aimed to keep together the remaining union and prevent civil war from developing as long as possible. He concluded: \"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.\"\n In the end, passions did break the fragile union, but they did not prevent the inauguration of a new President or a free and fair election four years later. A month after Lincoln's inauguration, soldiers arrived to defend the Capitol from the threat of armed invasion and quartered at the Capitol. The Civil War lasted until 1865, resulting in the death of more than 600,000 Americans.\n Yet the words of Lincoln's first inaugural address -- as well as his second -- echo unto this day.\n In 1876, the nation once again endured an extremely close and divisive presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio and Democrat Samuel Tilden of New York. The Republican platform called for the protection of the rights of all citizens, including African Americans in the South, while Tilden ran as a reform candidate largely silent on race relations. Both sides declared victory, but disputed results in Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina and Oregon left Tilden's count short by one electoral vote.\n Threats of violence soon surfaced. In late November 1876, rumors circulated that an ex-Confederate officer threatened to seize the capital with 1,000 men. In response, President Ulysses S. Grant deployed seven companies of troops to Washington DC. Two days later, the USS Wyoming appeared in the Potomac River to protect the Anacostia Bridge into Maryland and the Long Bridge into Virginia, while a company of Marines guarded an access point further upriver. Fortunately, the threat never materialized.\n In December, the states submitted their electoral results to Congress. With no certified winner, in January, Congress established an electoral commission to determine the results. By a strict party vote of eight to seven, the commission selected Hayes in each disputed vote (the Electoral Count Act of 1887 codified new procedures to prevent future deadlocks). At a meeting at the Wormley Hotel, Southern Democrats agreed to a compromise, accepting the results of the commission in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.\n Nevertheless, some Democrats in the House threatened to filibuster the counting of the electoral votes, dragging out the process for several more days. Finally, during the early morning hours of March 2, Democratic Speaker of the House Samuel Randall read a telegram from Tilden expressing his willingness to let the count be completed. By 4 a.m., Congress had finished counting the votes and Hayes was declared the winner, ending America's longest election. Not content to wait until Inauguration Day, Hayes was sworn in privately in the Red Room of the White House on March 3.\n Two days later, in a first, President-elect Hayes began the tradition of going to the White House to ride with the outgoing President to the Capitol, accompanied by the Washington Light Guard and a battery of light artillery. In his inaugural address, Hayes stressed themes of unity and reached out to disaffected voters in the Southern states. He asked to \"forever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the distinction between North and South.\"\n Yet a month into his presidency, Hayes abided by the terms of the compromise and withdrew the remaining federal troops from the Southern states, leaving the forces of White supremacy to reestablish local control. The result? By the time of Hayes's death in 1893, widespread disenfranchisement and a legalized system of segregation established the Jim Crow system across the South.\n Indeed, the similarities of these long-ago inaugurations to our present moment are striking. But this history also reminds us that threats of violence during times of political transition have not stopped -- and should not stop -- the inauguration of a new President with a new vision for America, regardless of what comes next.",

        "body_text": "The perceived success of last week's deadly insurrection at the US Capitol is \"like putting gasoline on a fire\" and may serve as a motivator for attacks in the run up to the inauguration, with electoral battleground states and those that have already seen protests among the most vulnerable, security experts say.\n The FBI warning that armed protests are being planned in all 50 states in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration has prompted governors and police chiefs to deploy thousands of officers and equipment at state capitols around the country to thwart potential violence.\n \"The threats are very credible. And you're coming off a Washington protest that was credible, and let's just call it 'successful' in the eyes of protesters,\" said Timothy Dimoff, a former SWAT team leader who operates a security consulting company. \"It's going to fuel their confidence that they can continue because we didn't show 'em we could control 'em.\"\n \"That's like putting gasoline on a fire,\" Dimoff continued. \"Now we sent 'em home and said you guys had a successful game plan and can do it again. That's where the problem is.\"\n US officials on Wednesday warned of future attacks, in part because of the success of the siege last week. The FBI bulletin noted that extremists could zero in on government officials and institutions, as well as racial and religious minorities, journalists, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n It also indicated that the Capitol insurrection may have served as a venue for extremists of differing ideological motivations to foster connections. After the attack, people who descended upon the Capitol went home, where a number have since been arrested and charged in their roles in the assault.\n John Miller, a deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism in the New York Police Department, called the movement that participated in the attack last week \"loosely organized\" and noted that people had come together over social media.\n \"The propensity of the violence sometimes boils down to the individual,\" he said Thursday. \"Nothing compares to any past threats; we have never had Americans fighting Americans on the streets of the nation's capital probably since the Civil War.\"\n Other motivations that could fuel future attacks include anti-government sentiment held by extremists, as well as grievances associated with the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, according to Wednesday's bulletin.\n \"What you see now is a coalescing of the movement,\" said Jason Blazakis, who retired from the State Department's Bureau of Counterterrorism in 2018. He said various extremist groups that had operated alone over the last four years moved in concert during the assault on the Capitol last week.\n \"The heave-ho of everyone getting through -- you have Oath Keepers next to Proud Boys next to white supremacists, that's what makes this a dangerous time,\" he said. \"The movement is energized and they're emboldened by surprise success on [January] 6th. I think they're surprised. They didn't plan to Nth degree, and to be able to breach the pillar of democracy, that's going to motivate them.\"\n The biggest threats to centers of government in the coming days will be in states that previously saw protests, including those against Covid-19 restrictions, and in electoral battlegrounds that were key to Biden's defeat of Trump, Dimoff said.\n Capitols in some Midwest states \"are being targeted because they're looked at as reasons for Trump not being elected,\" he said. \"Groups want to blame somebody or something and that's what they're doing right now.\"\n \"You can't take it lightly. You should always over prepare,\" Dimoff said.\n Armed militia members in Michigan, where it's legal to carry firearms in the open, are planning a protest this Sunday. The state's attorney general warned the Capitol was not safe. The capital city of Lansing's mayor has requested the National Guard and police there have put up heavy fencing around the Capitol.\n Michigan remained a flash point during 2020 as armed protesters gathered at the capitol in April to demonstrate against the state's pandemic shutdown orders. The state was also the center of an alleged plot by extremists to kidnap the governor prior to the 2020 presidential election.\n In Pennsylvania, the state's Capitol police agency is keeping special emergency response teams in place and hundreds of the state's National Guard force have been deployed in the state instead of going to Washington to bolster security at home.\n There have been demonstrations at the Harrisburg Capitol in Pennsylvania since the election concluded, including at the swearing in of new members of the House and Senate. Protests have remained peaceful, according to State Rep. Joanna McClinton, who fears that those who have protested before now feel emboldened since the events last week in DC.\n She said that state lawmakers who questioned the election results deserve some of the blame.\n \"There are state lawmakers who have been co-conspirators in these lies, in questioning the outcome of the election,\" McClinton said. \"Trump lost, and our local lawmakers in the state Capitol have not been telling that truth. And as a result, maybe they didn't send anybody to DC on a bus. Maybe only a few of them were down there that we saw on social media, but they're complicit in this terror.\"\n Far-right groups, said Blazakis, have historically been a \"fractured movement.\"\n \"The fracturing we've witnessed may be evolving to a point where, if they could find a figurehead it could be really dangerous to unite these organizations,\" he said.\n In the aftermath of the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, authorities are taking the threat seriously, Blazakis said.\n \"One could argue [January] 6th was their one shot to strike a real big blow and, in the end, five or six people were killed and it could have been a lot, a lot worse,\" he said.\n \"And people see how serious it is \u2014 it's more than just online talk \u2014 and [the attackers] may not be able to replicate it as successfully. The saving grace is they may have missed their one big opportunity.\"\n CNN's Andy Rose, Kay Jones, Shimon Prokupecz, Barbara Starr, Raja Razek, Jon Passantino, Jason Carroll, Julian Cummings, Konstantin Toropin, Rebekah Riess contributed to this report",

        "title": "MyPillow CEO hints at scrapped plan to replace CIA director with Trump loyalist",
        "body_text": "A Trump ally's notes visible as he visited the West Wing on Friday revealed a suggestion to replace the current CIA director with the current acting chief of staff at the Pentagon. But according to multiple sources, it was not the first time the idea was broached inside the White House.\n MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Republican donor who has informally advised President Donald Trump, was seen leaving the West Wing on Friday carrying pages of notes that appear to outline a series of recommendations. Among those that are visible are the words, \"Move Kash Patel to CIA acting\" a reference to the current chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.\n Patel, who has held a number of senior jobs in the administration, was named chief of staff to Miller a few days after the general election and is widely viewed as a Trump loyalist.\n Captured by a Washington Post photographer, the images sparked immediate questions about Trump's final moves as President. But according to two administration officials, Trump has actually discussed with others the idea of installing Patel as acting CIA director before.\n Trump has been on the verge of firing CIA Director Gina Haspel several times only to be pulled back from the brink, multiple sources have previously told CNN. In December, he and others concocted a plan to terminate Haspel and put Patel in charge of the CIA. Multiple options were discussed, including firing Haspel's deputy Vaughn Bishop and replacing him with Patel, which they believed would force Haspel to quit, and also firing both and making Patel acting director.\n But sources told CNN that the President had backed off from the idea after aides convinced him that firing Haspel with only weeks left in his presidency was counterproductive.\n While it wasn't immediately clear whether the President discussed the issue of CIA leadership with Lindell during his visit Friday to the White House, its mention in Lindell's notes renewed speculation that the issue isn't moot.\n Weeks ago, Trump was considering a broader Cabinet shake-up after losing reelection, the sources said.\n Miller was named to the top defense job a few days after the election. He and Patel had worked together on counterterrorism issues at the National Security Council earlier in Trump's term.\n If the idea is truly being considered still with just days to go in Trump's term, trying to put Patel in charge of the country's preeminent intelligence service would require an enormous amount of last-minute bureaucratic gymnastics. Current and former officials said that not only would Haspel need to be ousted but her deputy, Bishop, would need to be removed as well.\n Haspel has angered some people in Trump's orbit for stonewalling efforts by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to declassify documents related to the FBI's Russia investigation. But even those officials who have pushed for her ouster in recent months believe the time is long past for making a move. Trump and Ratcliffe also have the authority to declassify documents themselves, so firing Haspel at this point would carry an additional tinge of spite.\n Asked if there was any way Trump would make such a high-profile change with just a few days left, one senior administration official said, \"Frankly, he's running out of people who'd even know how to implement those changes. There's no one to do the paperwork, which is pretty complicated for unorthodox personnel moves.\"\n Lindell confirmed to CNN's Jim Acosta that he did meet with Trump for about five minutes on Friday and said he had tried to hand the President what he described as evidence of voter fraud. Acosta conducted a brief interview with Lindell, who did not substantiate any of his claims but merely repeated some of the same false conspiracy theories spouted by Trump since the election.\n Lindell said Trump had told him to turn over his material to lawyers working at the White House, who would look into it.\n Asked whether he believes Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential election, Lindell said no.\n \"No, he didn't win the election, because I've seen it,\" Lindell said.\n Patel did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The CIA, the Pentagon, the White House and the National Security Council also did not immediately respond to CNN's inquires.",

        "title": "New, contagious coronavirus variant could worsen pandemic, CDC warns",
        "body_text": "New, more contagious variants of the coronavirus will likely accelerate the spread of the virus and that means the US must double down on efforts to protect people, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.\n A variant first identified in Britain known as B.1.1.7 is being found in the US as well, and modeling indicates it could worsen the already terrible spread of the virus across the country, the CDC researchers said.\n That means people need to try harder to wear masks, avoid gatherings and stay socially distant from one another.\n \"It means that it is going to be harder and harder to control it. Any of those measures we are going to have to do to a higher degree, including vaccination,\" Dr. Gregory Armstrong, who directs the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at CDC's respiratory diseases division, told CNN.\n \"Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants,\" Armstrong and colleagues wrote in the agency's weekly report, the MMWR.\n \"Variant B.1.1.7 has the potential to increase the U.S. pandemic trajectory in the coming months.\"\n Efforts to vaccinate people -- already slower than the federal government hoped for and promised -- need to be stepped up, CDC said.\n \"Higher vaccination coverage might need to be achieved to protect the public,\" the researchers wrote.\n The virus has already infected more people in the US and killed more than in any other country. As of Friday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University, the virus had been diagnosed in 23 million people in the US and killed more than 390,000.\n The B.1.1.7 variant appears to more readily infect human cells, which would help it infect more people.\n It has been detected in about a dozen US states, but the CDC also knows that surveillance is poor and it is likely far more common than that. It is also possible that the pattern of mutations that makes the virus more transmissible is arising independently as it circulates in people,  because the more people are infected, the more chances the virus has to mutate.\n The CDC team ran an experimental model to see what might happen in the near future. It's not known how much more transmissible B.1.1.7 is, and it's also not known how much immunity there already is in the US population because of previous infections, so the team made some assumptions. In one scenario, the new variant is 50% more infectious than currently dominant variants circulating.\n \"In this model, B.1.1.7 prevalence is initially low, yet because it is more transmissible than are current variants, it exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March,\" the CDC team wrote.\n \"If this behaves like it has so far in the UK, Denmark and Ireland, yes it is going to become a progressively larger and larger proportion of all the cases out there no matter what we do,\" Armstrong said.\n \"That's not to say that cases are necessarily going to go up,\" Armstrong added. \"That's not to say we can do nothing.\"\n The new variant does not seem to result in higher rates of hospitalization or higher rates of death, he noted.\n \"While there is a high probability that this is going to become a larger and larger proportion of all cases, if we can get people to become more adherent to the recommended measures, the number of cases don't need to go up,\" Armstrong said.\n Plus, the CDC needs to do more to keep an eye out for new variants, and for the appearance of this one.\n \"CDC has also contracted with several large commercial clinical laboratories to rapidly sequence tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens each month and has funded seven academic institutions to conduct genomic surveillance in partnership with public health agencies, thereby adding substantially to the availability of timely genomic surveillance data from across the United States,\" the team wrote.\n The CDC is also keeping an eye out for a variant first spotted in South Africa and now called B.1.351, plus one spotted among four travelers from Brazil when they landed in Japan, called  B.1.1.28\n \"These variants carry a constellation of genetic mutations,\" the CDC team wrote.\n The worries are that the virus could change in ways that would help it evade the immunity induced by vaccination, or the the immunity introduced with antibody-based treatments. The new coronavirus vaccines are designed to be quick and easy to change to match new circulating strains, but a major change would mean people would need to be re-vaccinated.\n It's also possible some of the changes could make the virus harder to detect in standard tests.\n And the CDC is also worried that if the virus changes in just the right way, it could re-infect people who have recovered from coronavirus already. Influenza already does this.",

        "title": "Police respond differently when it's a left-wing protest, study finds",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump's supporters were still rampaging through the US Capitol when the question arose: If these had been Black Lives Matter demonstrators instead of overwhelmingly White, militant Trump backers, how different would the police response have been?\n The Black Lives Matter Global Network hit the question hard in a statement following the Capitol siege.\n \"When Black people protest for our lives, we are all too often met by National Guard troops or police equipped with assault rifles, shields, tear gas and battle helmets,\" the group said in a statement. \"Make no mistake, if the protesters were Black, we would have been tear gassed, battered, and perhaps shot.\"\n Black Lives Matter protesters -- Black and White, old and young --  were indeed tear gassed on June 1 -- to clear an area around the White House so President Trump could walk to a nearby church to have his picture taken.\n But police response to protests in the Trump era may depend as much on the politics of the demonstrators as on their race, experts say.\n And demonstrators on both the right and the left see police as siding with right-wing protestors, according to a policing expert.\n \"The right-leaning protesters will say police used force against Black Lives Matter and not them because they are on the 'right' side, the same side -- they 'back the blue,' they are pro-police,\" said Ed Maguire, a criminal justice professor at Arizona State University. \"The left-leaning protesters believe the same thing: that the police are on the side politically of the right.\"\n \"What we saw with the Black Lives Matter protests was a really massive over-response, and what we saw at the Capitol was a similarly massive under-response,\" he said.\n The conduct of some police officers during the Capitol siege highlights Maguire's point.\n At least two Capitol police officers were suspended for their behavior during the incident. According to Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, one of the suspended officers took a selfie with members of the mob, while another wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and directed people around the Capitol building.\n At least two off-duty police officers from Virginia have been arrested in connection with the breach of the Capitol and face federal charges, including \"violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\"\n Officers from New York, Philadelphia, Seattle and Texas are also under investigation by their departments.\n Left-leaning protesters are significantly more likely to be arrested than right-leaning ones, according to a 2020 study from Lesley Wood, an associate professor of sociology at York University in Toronto.\n Wood studied media reports of arrests at 64 demonstrations in the United States in 2017 and 2018.\n She bracketed anti-abortion demonstrations and those backing Confederate statues, White supremacy and President Trump, for example, as being right-wing, while considering demonstrations in favor of gun control, immigration and civil rights, among others, to be left-wing.\n She focused on protests that face counter-protests because they are \"more likely to be violent, and present special challenges for the police,\" she wrote in the study, \"Policing Counter-Protest,\" published in the journal Sociology Compass in 2020.\n She found that 10 times as many left-wing protesters were arrested as right-wing protesters: 279 from the left and 26 on the right. The political identity of the other 38 people arrested in the 2017-2018 US demonstrations was unknown.\n \"Police in North Carolina, Virginia and Louisiana were more likely to arrest those condemning Confederate statues than those protecting them,\" Wood wrote. \"Police in Georgia arrested anti-fascists rather than neo-Nazis; and across the country arrested anti-racists and Trump opponents rather than Islamaphobes [sic] and Trump supporters.\"\n The size of demonstrations is often contested, but the left-wing protests Wood studied tended to be larger than the right-wing ones. Even with the size of protests difficult to pin down exactly, left-leaning activists appeared to be about two-and-a-half times more likely than right-leaning ones to be arrested, she told CNN.\n \"It is really striking that you see that left-wingers are arrested at a much greater level,\" she said.\n Wood underlined a key factor: Police have different views of right-leaning and left-leaning demonstrators.\n \"The logic of policing protest has been one of threat assessment, and they tend to see left-wing protest as more threatening than right-wing,\" she said in an interview with CNN.\n \"That is tied to many things, such as race,\" Wood wrote. \"Groups that are critical of the police are seen as more threatening. That helps explain why Black Lives Matter, which was critical of the police and black-led, was seen as threatening.\"\n Wood wrote that police agencies aim to be \"professional, cost-effective and legitimate\" in protest situations, valuing \"political neutrality, permits and negotiation between police and organizers.\"\n Months of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations by the right-wing Patriot Prayer group and left-wing groups including antifa and members of religious and human rights organizations in Portland, Oregon, in 2017 and 2018 provided a case study for Wood.\n \"While the Patriot Prayer activists worked with the police, the police had no success in communicating with the anti-fascist leadership,\" she wrote. \"Police perceive protesters who refuse to negotiate, do not have a centralized leader, and hide their identity from police, as more threatening.\"\n \"Because police repress on the basis of their understanding of threat, it means that left-wing protesters, racialized protesters, protesters who are seen as ideological or irrational, are more likely to be arrested and have militarized tactics used against them, such as tear gas and pepper spray,\"  Wood told CNN.\n But Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, questioned some of Wood's conclusions.\n \"The author explains that leftist counter-protesters deliberately utilize the tactic of 'no platforming,'  which is defined thus: 'No Platforming means disrupting rallies that aim to promote racist or fascist  ideologies by organizing such large counter protests that the planned speeches cannot be heard,'\" Johnson told CNN by email.\n \"If I'm reading the study correctly, leftist counter-protesters are thus more likely to be arrested because by definition they are breaking the law by deliberately trying to shut down lawfully permitted rightist demonstrations,\" Johnson said.\n Johnson also pointed out that the left-wing protesters include, in Wood's words, \"communist, anarchist and socialist antifascists.\"\n Those ideologies, Johnson said, \"share a common thread of wishing to tear down an existing legal/political/social structure and replace it with something else. By definition, then, we would expect protesters who are adherents of those ideologies to overtly present anti-social behavior to a greater degree and extent than other groups who do not share that same wish. And thus we would expect more arrests.\"\n And he noted that Wood's paper includes little data about the reason for protester arrests or the results.\n \"There is no indication of the judicial disposition of the charges: Were they sustained? Shown to be false? That would seem to be an important bit of data,\" Johnson said.\n The United States has a history of policing Black-led events more than White-led ones.\n A landmark study of more than 15,000 US protests during the Civil Rights period and the decades after it found that, at some points in that era, police were more likely to be present and to take action at Black-led events than predominantly White ones.\n But the paper, \"Protesting While Black? The Differential Policing of American Activism, 1960 to 1990,\" published in the American Sociological Review in 2011, also found that in many years, the race of protesters appeared to make no difference to policing.\n Police arrested 61 people on January 6, the day the Capitol was overrun by Trump supporters. More people have been arrested in connection with the storming of the building since then.\n A CNN analysis found no less than nine occasions when police arrested more Washington demonstrators in a single day than they did on January 6, ranging from 133 LGBTQ activists at the Supreme Court in October 2019, to 575 protesters against Trump Administration immigration policy in June 2018.\n On June 1, 2020 -- the day of President Trump's photo op at the church near the White House -- police arrested 316 people.\n CNN's list is not comprehensive, but all nine demonstrations share a common factor: they were left-leaning demonstrations.\n CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this story",

        "title": "Tillerson slams Trump as Pompeo sings his praises",
        "body_text": "Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson painted a scathing picture of his old boss President Donald Trump as someone who made uninformed decisions that were not based in reality -- a stark contrast to Trump's top diplomat Mike Pompeo, who is heaping praise on the outgoing President in his final days in office.\n \"His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited. It's really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn't even understand the concept for why we're talking about this,\" Tillerson said in a lengthy interview with Foreign Policy conducted prior to Wednesday's assault on the Capitol that was published this week.\n Tillerson, who was ousted in March 2018, told the magazine, \"I used to go into meetings with a list of four to five things I needed to talk to him about, and I quickly learned that if I got to three, it was a home run, and I realized getting two that were meaningful was probably the best objective.\"\n He added that he \"started taking charts and pictures with (him) because I found that those seemed to hold his attention better.\"\n \"I think the other challenge that I came to realize early on is there were so many people who had access to his ear who were telling him things, most of which were untrue, and then he began to listen to those voices and form a view that had no basis in fact,\" the former secretary of state said.\n \"So then you spent an inordinate amount of time working through why that's not true, working through why that's not factual, working through why that's not the basis on which you want to understand this, you need to set that aside, let's talk about what's real. I think that was as big a challenge as anything,\" Tillerson said.\n Pompeo has devoted his Twitter feed in recent weeks to highlighting what he regards at the administration's achievements on the world stage and has not been shy about lavishing praise on Trump.\n His laudatory statements, however, have faced renewed criticism by US diplomats in the last week who believe Pompeo's celebratory sentiments are jarring considering the tumult and violence which have marked Trump's final days in office, three US diplomats have told CNN.\n On Wednesday morning, as the House was preparing to debate and vote on Trump's second impeachment, Pompeo tweeted suggesting that he should receive the Nobel Prize.\n Pompeo also remained loyal and stood by Trump -- condemning the violent mobs, but in no way suggesting that Trump incited the insurrection -- while a handful of other cabinet secretaries resigned after the violent siege on Capitol Hill.\n One primary difference that may explain the daylight between Pompeo and Tillerson: Pompeo has future political ambitions and Tillerson does not.\n \"Unfortunately for Tillerson he got a taste of politics and likely does not want anything to do with it ever again,\" said Douglas Heye, a GOP strategist. \"But Pompeo is one of the people who wants to hitch his wagon to Trump's name and wants to continue to do so. What may be politically advantageous to Pompeo is that he can tout Trump's foreign policy successes and stay away from what happened last week because he has no ownership over it, whereas some of his Republican competitors like Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz do.\"\n Tillerson, who has remained relatively quiet about his tenure as Trump's top diplomat, also made it clear that he is completely at odds with Pompeo when it comes to the Trump administration's China policy.\n \"We're nowhere with China on national security. We're in a worse place today than we were before he came in, and I didn't think that was possible,\" he said.\n Tillerson said he believes China will be the biggest problem for the incoming Biden administration.\n \"I have a fear that we will come to military conflict with China within the decade and it will be when they make their move on Taiwan. They've been putting all of their pieces in place for a long time now to do that, and that is [Chinese President Xi Jinping's] legacy, to reunite China,\" he said.\n Trump's China policy -- which turned overwhelmingly hawkish in the latter part of his presidency, particularly as he sought to cast blame on China for the coronavirus -- is viewed by Pompeo as one of the administration's greatest accomplishments.\n Tillerson said he \"could never understand\" Trump's disparagement of allies.\n \"He saw those as people who were weak. He used to say that over and over again. I don't know why he viewed them as weak, other than they were overseeing free countries,\" he said.\n Nor could Tillerson understand Trump's desire to woo adversaries, he said, noting that the President's meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \"was one of the last straws between him and I.\"\n Although Pompeo was known to be privately skeptical of just how successful Trump's approach to Kim would be, sources told CNN, he never publicly said so. Instead, he has consistently supported Trump's approach and has even heralded Trump's meetings with Kim as effective even though they produced no tangible results on denuclearization of North Korea.",

        "title": "A combat veteran thrust back into action during the Capitol attack grapples with what's next",
        "body_text": "Rep. Jason Crow didn't expect to vote to impeach a US President twice in when he came to Congress.\n The Colorado Democrat certainly didn't expect to be transported back to his days in combat as a US Army Ranger while sitting above the House floor.\n But that's where he found himself on January 6, surrounded for more than 30 minutes by a mob attacking the US Capitol, unconsciously slipping back into a mindset he thought he'd left behind when he took his military uniform off more than a decade ago.\n It's a heavy moment for members of Congress as they seek to come to terms with daily new details of just how catastrophic an already tragic event could have become. It all comes inside an institution long since ripped apart by partisan passions, often exacerbated by Trump himself. Crow was a key player in an apex of that divide: he served as a Democratic manager for Trump's first impeachment trial just a little more than one year ago.\n While Crow, who was famously pictured crouched down in aid to a colleague during the attack, has spent the last week grappling with trauma shared by so many in the Capitol that day, he's also grappling with a broader issue: what comes next.\n The first answer, carried out on the House floor exactly one week after the attack, was the impeachment of President Donald Trump -- a moment defined by a sense of unity inside the House Democratic caucus driven entirely by the events of that day, Crow says.\n \"We have converted that experience into action and channeled that into resolve in my view,\" Crow told CNN in an interview, noting that the caucus was \"more united than we've ever been.\"\n Then there's the mental aspect -- something Crow says has spilled out between colleagues in text chains, group zooms and meetings over the last several days, particularly among those trapped in the chamber that day.\n \"Trauma, any trauma, impacts everybody,\" Crow, who served combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, said. \"Nobody is immune to it and everybody responds to it differently so you just have to be aware of that and you have to seek the help that you need.\"\n But he's also wrestling with what comes next for the country, specifically through his role in Congress.\n He's pressed the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, to launch an in-depth investigation in the events leading up to the attack -- something he believes will set soon.\n Furious by the lack of public information about the attack from federal officials, he placed a call to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy for more details -- and then promptly informed him he planned to release detailed notes from the call (McCarthy signed off on the move, though Crow says he likely would've done it anyway).\n \"There had been no federal law enforcement or military briefings. None,\" Crow said explaining his decision to call McCarthy. \"And I kind of had it with that.\"\n Crow makes clear he will attend inauguration and make his presence known on the inaugural platform, even amid the increased security threats briefed to him and his colleagues over the last several days.\n The next steps for the country -- and specifically the US Congress -- are less clear.\n \"There's been a lot of talk about moving forward, which is really important,\" Crow said. \"But you can't move forward without truth and accountability.\"\n Finding that balance, particularly after all but 10 Republicans rejected the House impeachment effort on account that it would create a more divisive environment, isn't obvious.\n \"I don't have the answer to that yet,\" Crow readily acknowledged.\n But Crow is, in real time, working through his own process of how to reach that goal -- one that appears on its face far from anyone's grasp given the polarized nature of both the country and Congress.\n \"You have that group of people -- the Matt Gaetzs, the Mo Brookses, the Lauren Boeberts, the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the world -- who are so depraved and have gone down the rabbit hole so far that in my book they are irredeemable,\" Crow says, listing off GOP colleagues who have been ardent defenders of Trump even as he repeatedly lied about the outcome of 2020 presidential election.\n There are others, however, Crow wants to engage with, but not on the political party level.\n \"I suspect the key to that is going to be individual discussions and outreach,\" the second-term congressman said.\n \"This is going to happen member to member, sitting down and having very, very honest discussions about what led us to this moment, what responsibility people are going to accept and what we're able to do to move forward.\"\n He says he's been \"extremely impressed\" with Michigan GOP Rep. Peter Meijer, a freshman member who voted to impeach Trump. Rep. Liz Cheney, the highest-ranked Republican to break from Trump, has worked with Crow on Armed Services Committee issues in the past, and while the two disagree on \"all manner of things, politics and policy,\" Crow came away from the last week knowing his working relationship with the Wyoming Republican would continue in earnest.\n \"I just cannot see the political upside of doing what she did,\" Crow said in a way that came across as a mix of respect and wonder. \"Which tells me that I think she did it for matters of principle and integrity. And you absolutely have to give credit where credit is due.\"\n Crow repeatedly makes something clear: he doesn't have the answers. At least not yet. He and his family are still grappling with what transpired on January 6, as are his colleagues.\n That won't go away in the near term, particularly, in his view, because the threat is far from over.\n \"I'm still figuring out how to address this with my children,\" Crow said. \"I haven't fully figured that out yet.\"\n But while the answers may not be abundant at the moment, Crow if firm on one thing in particular.\n \"We need to be bold,\" he said. \"We need to be present. And we need to show the American people that we will be the leaders that this country needs.\"",

The actor responded with a single word to the edited video: \"Bravo.\"\n Another Twitter user proposed creating a \"petition to digitally replace trump in 'home alone 2' with 40-year-old macaulay culkin.\"\n \"Sold.\" Culkin wrote in response.\n In addition to the tweets, a petition on Change.org asks Disney to replace Trump with President-elect Joe Biden.\n \"Home Alone 2 is tarnished. It has a racist stain on it in the shape of Donald J Trump,\" the petitioner wrote. \"I petition that he be edited out of the film and replaced with Joe Biden.\"\n In 2019, CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. aired the film without Trump's cameo hours after the President expressed to  overseas service members how he was honored to be in \"one of the biggest\" Christmas hits.\n When CNN reached put to CBC for comment at the time, the Canadian broadcaster responded with a statement that the movie was \"edited for time.\"\n \"The scene with Donald Trump was one of several that were cut from the movie as none of them were integral to the plot,\" the statement read. \"These edits were done in 2014 when we first acquired the film and before Mr. Trump was elected President.\"\n \"Home Alone 2\" Director Chris Columbus told Insider last month the filmmakers had approached Trump with the idea to film in the Plaza Hotel -- which Trump owned at the time--- because they wanted to shoot in the lobby and couldn't \"rebuild The Plaza on a soundstage.\"\n \"Trump said OK. We paid the fee, but he also said, 'The only way you can use the Plaza is if I'm in the movie,'\" Columbus said. \"So we agreed to put him in the movie, and when we screened it for the first time the oddest thing happened: People cheered when Trump showed up on-screen. So I said to my editor, 'Leave him in the movie. It's a moment for the audience.' But he did bully his way into the movie.\"",

        "title": "Coronavirus will knock more than a year off average US life expectancy, study finds",
        "body_text": "The coronavirus pandemic is not only having an immediate impact in terms of the deaths of thousands of Americans, it's also taking more than a year off the average US life expectancy.\n A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences projects that Covid-19 will reduce US life expectancy in 2020 by 1.13 years, with a disproportionate number of deaths occurring among Black and Latino populations. When combined with provisional estimates of US death rates for the first half of the year, the data show a clear rise in the mortality rate as the pandemic took hold of the nation.\n \"Estimated reductions for the Black and Latino populations are three to four times that for Whites. Consequently, Covid-19 is expected to reverse over 10 years of progress made in closing the Black\u2212White gap in life expectancy and reduce the previous Latino mortality advantage by over 70%,\" according to the researchers of the study, Theresa Andrasfay of the University of Southern California and Noreen Goldman of Princeton University's Office of Population Research.\n \"Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate burden of Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to Covid-19 and mortality risk for those infected,\" the study added.\n Prior to the pandemic, the US had been making steady progress in terms of life expectancy although it had slowed down in recent years.\n Life expectancy increased by nearly 10 years over the last half century -- from 69.9 years in 1959, to 78.9 years in 2016. After 2010, life expectancy plateaued and in 2014 it began reversing, dropping for three consecutive years -- from 78.9 years in 2014, to 78.6 in 2017. Drug overdoses, suicides, alcohol-related illnesses and obesity were largely to blame for this.\n But the pandemic has set back all that progress, and also widened the gap between Black\u2212White life expectancy.\n \"The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 years, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-year reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black\u2212White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 years to over 5 years, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006,\" the study added.\n New data from the National Center for Health Statistics suggests that Covid-19 caused a significant jump in mortality in the US.\n The age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate was 769 per 100,000 in the first quarter of 2020 and rose to 840 in the second quarter of the year. Comparatively, the death rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 702 per 100,000, the NCHS said.\n While the report shows mortality rose significantly in 2020, it provides an incomplete snapshot of the pandemic since data for only the first two quarters are currently available.\n Last week, CDC statisticians said Covid-19 was likely the third leading cause of death in 2020. They estimated there were between 316,252 and 431,792 excess deaths in all of 2020.\n Heart disease is the top killer and cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US.\n These estimates are based on all death records received and processed by NCHS as of November 27, 2020.\n Andrasfay and Goldman's study used Census Bureau data and data on actual and projected deaths from the pandemic of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the National Center for Health Statistics. They also used various models and estimates for mortality rates.\n \"Our medium estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.13 years to 77.48 years, lower than any year since 2003,\" they said.\n \"This impact is about 10 times as large as the worrisome annual decreases several years ago that were attributed largely to drug overdoses, other external causes, and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,\" the study added.\n The US is already behind other wealthy countries in terms of life expectancy and the pandemic will worsen it.\n \"The US reduction in 2020 life expectancy is projected to exceed that of most other high-income countries, indicating that the United States -- which already had a life expectancy below that of all other high-income developed nations prior to the pandemic -- will see its life expectancy fall even farther behind its peers,\" the study said.\n The effects of the pandemic are expected to last well beyond 2020.\n \"Some reduction in life expectancy may persist beyond 2020 because of continued Covid-19 mortality and long-term health, social, and economic impacts of the pandemic,\" the study added.\n Maggie Fox and Jessica Firger contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The incoming Biden administration plans to retire the name for the coronavirus vaccine effort under President Donald Trump -- Operation Warp Speed -- with a transition official for the incoming president telling CNN they are \"moving to a new phase\" of the coronavirus response.\n \"Operation Warp Speed was the Trump administration's name for their response. We are structuring it differently and ours will have a new name,\" said an official, who added that many of the \"people who are working for Warp Speed who were critical to that operation will be critical to our response, too.\"\n As part of that effort, Biden has picked Dr. David Kessler, a former head of the US Food and Drug Administration, to be the chief scientific officer of Covid response, Biden's presidential transition team announced Friday.\n Kessler, who is currently the co-chair of the Biden transition's coronavirus task force, will work out of the US Department of Health and Human Services under HHS secretary-designee Xavier Becerra, the official said, and his role will focus primarily on maximizing the supply of vaccines that are authorized or approved, and getting other vaccines online. The process of getting shots in arms will be run out of the White House and the team led by Jeff Zients, the official said.\n Operation Warp Speed has been successful in rapidly manufacturing a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine but has failed to meet expectations in administering doses to Americans. Biden has laid out a timeline for 100 million shots in the first 100 days of his term.\n Gen. Gustave Perna, who is currently the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, will stay on in the Biden administration, the official said, but under its \"new structure.\"\n Kessler will take over for Moncef Slaoui, who has led the effort during the Trump administration. Slaoui, the most visible official leading the Trump administration's vaccine effort who was a notable voice of cooperation at a time when Trump refused efforts to begin a transition, announced earlier this week he was resigning at the Biden transition team's request.\n Slaoui will stay on for another month to \"ensure a smooth transition,\" a Biden transition official told CNN earlier this week.\n Kessler was first appointed by Bush to lead the FDA in 1990 and oversaw the rollout of the agency's iconic \"Nutrition Facts label\" on packaged foods for the first time. He also helped streamline the FDA's drug approval process and led the agency during the AIDS/HIV epidemic.\n Kessler was also an outspoken advocate for more regulation of nicotine and launched an FDA investigation, pitting him against the powerful tobacco industry. The FDA's investigation resulted in tobacco executives admitting nicotine's addictive qualities, and lawsuits filed by state attorneys general resulted in a landmark settlement of more than $360 billion. Nearly a decade later, a law was passed in 2009 giving the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products.\n His approach to the top FDA job led some conservatives to call for his ouster, believing Kessler was enforcing too much government regulation, the New York Times reported. His crackdown on vitamin manufacturers' unsubstantiated health claims turned then-GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was his former boss and had backed him for FDA chief, into a top critic.\n Kessler stepped down from the role of FDA commissioner in February 1997 and was named dean of Yale medical school later that year.\n Kessler is currently a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. He also served as chair of the boards of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group, and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.",

They went on their first date shortly after.\n \"It felt like we had known each other forever,\" after their first date, Emhoff, who will break a barrier himself as the first male spouse of a vice president, told CNN.\n \"I didn't want it to end.

        "title": "Alibaba is facing an 'existential crisis'",
        "body_text": "This year could be the most consequential for Alibaba since it was founded two decades ago.\n China's most famous tech company faces a host of challenges at home and abroad that risk fundamentally changing it forever. Chinese authorities are investigating the company on antitrust grounds as part of a growing crackdown on the tech industry, while also pushing its sprawling financial affiliate, Ant Group, to overhaul its business.\n Washington could still be a threat, too. While the Trump administration has backed off a proposal to ban American investment in Alibaba (BABA) and two other prominent Chinese tech firms, US-China tensions are likely not going away anytime soon.\n \"Alibaba, like all other big Chinese tech, is in [an] existential crisis,\" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore.\n Capri pointed to the growing clampdown within China as a particular concern for Alibaba and its peers.\n President Xi Jinping is urging officials to rein in the country's tech champions. Last month, he called efforts to strengthen anti-monopoly efforts against online platforms one of the most important goals for 2021, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n The antitrust investigation of Alibaba and probes into other firms have underscored that priority. On Thursday, another Chinese e-commerce company VIP Shop confirmed that it, too, was being investigated by authorities for \"alleged unfair competition practices.\" And Alibaba e-commerce competitor Pinduoduo (PDD) has been caught in a public firestorm over its work culture, suggesting that the government is willing to stoke broader criticism of the industry.\n Beijing's desire to extend its influence over private tech firms extends far beyond such investigations. And while the crackdown has accelerated in recent weeks, the government has been laying the groundwork for some time. Capri pointed out that some tech firms have been compelled to join forces with state businesses \u2014 as was the case when Ant Group's Alipay teamed up state-owned UnionPay in 2018 to develop new technology.\n \"The weeks and months ahead will see this trend accelerate,\" Capri said. \"Access to and control of data and digital platforms is key. Thus, if this means breaking up Alibaba or making it a quasi-state owned company, this could happen.\"\n While Alibaba's business is predominately in China, any major change to its operations could have global ramifications. The company has traded on Wall Street since 2014 when it held the record for the world's largest IPO. It counts Japan's SoftBank (SFTBF) as a major shareholder. Global investing powerhouses including Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock have all bought in, too.\n Beijing may want to be somewhat careful about how hard it pushes Alibaba and other companies, though. The United States has been punishing Chinese companies left and right as tensions between the two countries continue to simmer. It just hit China's second-biggest smartphone maker, Xiaomi, with a ban on accessing American investment.\n \"Washington's focus on these matters will continue under a [Joe] Biden administration,\" Capri said, referring to the president elect. \"Thus, even if there is a return to measured language and diplomacy, we could see more strategic decoupling from Chinese digital companies.\"\n Alibaba's cloud services, for example, could face the kind of global backlash that embattled Huawei's 5G business has run into.\n \"China won't want to seem [like it would be willing] to destroy one of its biggest national champions in plain sight of a new administration in DC,\" said Rana Mitter, professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University. He added that he suspects any kind of change to Alibaba's business would therefore be on a \"medium scale,\" rather than \"full breakup.\"\n \"I think Beijing will want to get a sense of what lies behind the Biden team's rhetoric before assessing the effect of any US moves,\" Mitter added.\n However Beijing allows Washington's behavior to influence its decisions, co-founder Ma's prolonged silence compounds Alibaba's troubles at home \u2014 and \"can only undermine market confidence in the company,\" said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital.\n \"Ant Group's IPO is now a distant memory, and the company looks like it may be broken up and regulated toward a vastly reduced overall valuation,\" he said. Chinese regulators shelved the much-anticipated public offering last November, and there's no sign of it being revived. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Ant Group's major global investors have been left in limbo after investing billions of dollars in anticipation of the offering.\n And while Alibaba seems more likely to remain intact, the company isn't immune from regulatory threat.\n \"Whether 2021 is more kind to Alibaba may depend on the ultimate nature and length of Jack Ma's sudden silence,\" Silvers said.",

After Lore retires on January 31, the online business will report to Walmart's US chief John Furner, the company said in a filing.\n \"With our structural changes behind us, we have concluded it's time for Marc to transition out of his everyday role at Walmart,\" McMillon said in the memo.\n Lore will remain a strategic adviser to Walmart through September.\n As for retirement plans, Lore said he would spend time writing a book, working on a reality TV show, advising startups, joining public boards, doing philanthropy work and possibly buying a sports team. But his biggest \"passion project\" in the coming decades, he said, will be trying to build a \"city of the future\" starting from scratch in the United States.\n \"It's kind of early to really start talking about it in too much detail, but I kind of had this vision for sort of a new model for society,\" he said. \"It's not going to be something crazy like out of the Jetsons. It'll be like a city that you love in America \u2014 pick any city \u2014 that's basically more evolved, utilizing technology, more efficient, more environmental, safer, more parks.\"\n He added: \"It'll just be more modernized version of the city, but it'll still have density. It'll still have the diversity [which] is really important. And so if we do it right, it should offer a higher quality of life.\"\n Walmart bought up online brands such as Bonobos, Eloquii, ModCloth, Moosejaw, Bare Necessities and Shoes.com under Lore's tenure as it sought to grow online and reach younger shoppers. However, it said it was discontinuing Jet.com in 2019, and also sold off ModCloth, Bare Necessities and Shoes.com.\n Lore said the acquisitions were not a failure because they helped speed up Walmart's online transformation and attracted new tech talent.\n \"Not everything's gonna work out exactly as you as you planned it,\" he said.\n Walmart's online business, while still much smaller than Amazon's, has grown rapidly in recent years. Walmart said in November that it offers curbside pickup from 3,700 stores and home delivery from 2,700.\n \"Lore can leave Walmart and effectively declare victory,\" said Andrew Lipsman, retail analyst at eMarketer. \"He's had a tremendously successful run, helping drive huge growth in sales and market share in Walmart's previously laggard e-commerce business.\"\n --Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the last name of Walmart executive John Furner.",

        "body_text": "The review of US Capitol security in the wake of this month's riots will be handled by retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9, the widely praised former commander of the First Army who became a household name as he coordinated relief efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n Over the course of his career, the general came to be known as a no-nonsense leader, a quality perhaps best exemplified in his slogan, \"Don't get stuck on stupid.\"\n In a statement Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Honor\u00e9 would lead the review of the Capitol's security infrastructure and interagency process, calling him a \"respected leader with experience dealing with crises.\"\n Louisiana Gov. Jon Bel Edwards praised the news on Twitter, writing that Honor\u00e9 was \"a great choice\" for the job. \"He has and will serve our nation well,\" the governor said.\n Here's quick look back at Honor\u00e9's career:\n Hailing from Lakeland, Louisiana, Honor\u00e9 was commissioned as a second lieutenant of the infantry in 1971 upon graduating with a degree in vocational agriculture from Southern University and A&M College.\n Honor\u00e9 served in a variety of infantry command positions throughout his career and took command of the First Army based at Fort Gillem outside Atlanta. He also served as the vice director for operations, J-3, The Joint Staff, Pelosi noted, focusing on military support to civil authorities.\n Before the fateful 2005 hurricane season, Honor\u00e9 had helped coordinate US response to flooding in Venezuela in 1999 and Mozambique in 2000, according to his website.\n He also oversaw the military's response to the space shuttle Columbia disaster and the sniper shootings in the Washington, DC, area in 2002, the biography says.\n But Honor\u00e9 commanded the nation's attention in 2005 when he led the Defense Department's response to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.\n Thousands of troops were deployed to New Orleans, where government relief efforts had been widely criticized. But it was Honor\u00e9, the leader of Joint Task Force Katrina, who was credited with recalibrating the military's role, transforming troops into first responders.\n He told everyone he saw to point their weapons down, reminding National Guardsmen and New Orleans police officers that they were not deployed to Iraq, according to CNN's Barbara Starr, who was embedded with Honor\u00e9.\n At the time, in an interview with a local radio station, then-Mayor Ray Nagin called Honor\u00e9 a \"John Wayne dude\" who could get things done.\n \"He came off the doggone chopper and he started cussing and people started moving,\" Nagin said.\n At one point, he helped rescue twin babies, walking with the family to a Navy ship where they were clothed and bathed after days without food.\n The mother, Alexandra Wheeler, told CNN she credited Honor\u00e9 with saving her twins' lives. Wheeler and Honor\u00e9 met again in 2017 and Wheeler told the retired general, \"We are eternally grateful to you for that.\"\n Honor\u00e9 retired in 2008 after 37 years of active service, according to his website. In the years since, he's often appeared on television to discuss officials' responses to natural disasters.\n According to his website, Honor\u00e9 has also formed the GreenARMY, a coalition of community and environmental groups that works to address environmental issues in Louisiana.\n CNN's Stephanie Elam contributed to this report.",

        "title": "House Democrat says lawmakers bringing guns to Capitol would be 'a danger to the other members'",
        "body_text": "Rep. John Garamendi said Friday that he was concerned that fellow representatives who want to be armed at the Capitol were a threat to him and other lawmakers.\n When asked by CNN's Brooke Baldwin whether, regarding members trying to bring guns into the Capitol, he thought that one of his fellow members of Congress might harm him, the California Democrat replied, \"Of course.\"\n \"Why would you bring a gun onto the floor? You want to get into a fisticuff or you want to get into a gun battle?\" he said. \"You don't need to have a gun on the floor of the House or even in any of the Capitol complex or the offices. It's a very, very secure place.\"\n When pressed on whether he was fearful that an armed House Republican could shoot him, Garamendi replied, \"I would be -- yes, I am concerned that any member that brings a gun into the Capitol, into a hearing room, into the office buildings or into or onto the floor of the House poses a danger, a danger to me, and a danger to the other members of the Congress and the staff. Do not need to have guns anywhere in this complex.\"\n Garamendi's comments come after some House Republican freshmen have emphasized bringing firearms to the Capitol, prompting concern from several Democrats in the chamber.\n One, Rep. Lauren Boebert, was filmed in a campaign advertisement vowing to carry her Glock handgun around Capitol Hill and the Colorado Republican has said she would carry her gun to Congress. The District has strict gun laws and Washington's police chief has warned the congresswoman that she is subject to the same laws as everyone else in the nation's capital.\n Rep. Madison Cawthorn, meanwhile, said in an interview with Smoky Mountain News last week that he had been armed when a mob stormed the Capitol.\n \"Fortunately, I was armed, so we would have been able to protect ourselves,\" the North Carolina Republican told the paper.\n Garamendi isn't alone in expressing concerns. Fellow Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia told NBC News in an interview published Thursday, \"There's the overall sense that maybe if some of them have guns -- and likely the ones who are more into conspiracy theories and QAnon with the pedophilic satanic rings -- are we safe from them?\"\n Metal detectors were set up on Tuesday outside the House floor and members are required to pass through them to reach the chamber.\n \"There have been increasing tensions with certain incoming freshmen for months, who have been insistent on bringing firearms in violation of law and guidelines,\" one House Democrat said in a reference to Boebert, Cawthorn and others.\n \"There are concerns about the gun-toting members, but also we don't know who they're going to bring to the inauguration who can bypass the metal detectors,\" another House Democrat said. \"Until there's an investigation and until we understand our colleagues' level of complicity in the attack, we don't know how involved they really were. Until we have answers, I don't think we should trust them -- not all of them of course, but some of them.\"\n Multiple Republicans were furious at the new measures this week and some shouted at Capitol Police officers who were at the metal detectors. Boebert set off the metal detectors and initially refused to show police what was in her bag before being eventually allowed into the chamber.\n The House will soon move forward with a rule change proposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, imposing stiff fines on members who refuse to follow the new security rules. The fine -- $5,000 for the first offense and $10,000 for the second offense -- will be deducted directly from members' salaries by the chief administrative officer.\n Garamendi suggested on Friday that in addition to fines for having a gun on the House floor, \"I would suggest it's also a potential reason to be thrown out of Congress totally.\"\n According to the US Capitol Police's website, firearms are prohibited on the Capitol grounds even if someone has a carry permit from Washington, DC, or a state. Law enforcement officers who are performing their official duties and meet \"certain established criteria\" may be allowed to carry their weapons into the Capitol. The Washington Post reported in 2018 that guns are banned in the legislative chambers, with an exception for their sergeants-at-arms.\n CNN's Jake Tapper, Daniella Diaz, Manu Raju and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

It's not clear which day Pelosi will send the article, and she didn't offer any hints when asked at her news conference on Friday, a sign that the situation is fluid.\n According to a spokesman for Pelosi, no decision on timing has been made.\n \"In terms of the timing, as I mentioned, one week ago, on January 6th, there was an active insurrection perpetrated on the capitol of the United States incentivized by the President of the United States,\" Pelosi said Friday. \"One week later, Wednesday to Wednesday, that President was impeached in a bipartisan way by the House of Representatives. So urgent was the matter they're now working on taking this to trial, and you'll be the first to know when we announce that we're going over there.\"\n The timing for the House to transmit the article is notable because the Constitution requires the Senate to begin the trial at 1 p.m. ET the following day.\n The Senate comes back into session on January 19, the day before Biden's inauguration, meaning the impeachment trial could start one hour after Biden is inaugurated on January 20, though aides expect the earliest it starts would be January 21.\n The Biden team and Senate Democrats, who will take control of the chamber when Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are sworn in, are hoping to be able to separate the Senate's day, so the Senate works to confirm nominees and consider legislation in the morning and conducts the trial in the afternoon. But that plan would require the consent of every senator.\n Pelosi did not respond to a question Friday on whether she would hold the article indefinitely. When the House impeached Trump in 2019, Pelosi held onto the articles for several weeks in a standoff with the Republican-led Senate over the logistics of the trial.\n Democrats are still trying to determine how long the trial should last as they try to convict President Donald Trump for \"incitement of insurrection.\" The House voted to impeach him Wednesday on the single article 232-197, with 10 Republicans supporting impeachment.\n Another key question for Democrats is whether to call any witnesses, like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose call with Trump where the President asked him to \"find\" votes was cited in the impeachment resolution.\n Pelosi on Tuesday named nine House impeachment managers for the trial, led by Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin. She said Friday that the managers were \"solemnly and prayerfully preparing for the trial, which they will take to the Senate.\"\n Regardless of the exact timing, the Senate trial is likely to begin when Trump is no longer President, and some of the President's allies and GOP senators have argued there are constitutional problems with trying Trump when he's a private citizen.\n Still, many Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, believe there's no question that Trump committed impeachable offenses, but they are torn on whether that means they should cast a vote to convict him.\n CNN's Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Doctor on Covid's first year: We made a lot of mistakes",
        "body_text": "Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nThe first case of Covid-19 in the United States was reported a year ago, on January 20, 2020. The patient, a 35-year-old man who had recently returned from visiting his family in Wuhan, China, sought medical care because of a cough and fever. He was hospitalized and survived the infection.\n Since that time, more than 23 million Americans (almost 7% of the population) have been diagnosed with the infection and at least 385,000 have died. In response, effective treatments, public health containment strategies and vaccines have been developed, but the pandemic continues to worsen, both in the US and in other parts of the world.\n The one-year mark provides an opportunity to prepare for year two by examining the mistakes and accomplishments of the last 12 months. I will focus only on medical decisions and dilemmas of year one and leave to others the task of evaluating the mostly disastrous political decisions that were made -- though I will note without comment that the first anniversary of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory confirmation of the initial case falls on the exact day that the Trump presidency ends and the Biden administration commences.\n Personally, the year has been extremely humbling. We infectious disease specialists have been wrong repeatedly -- a predictable problem with a once-in-a-century event, but still. We are long accustomed to dealing with talk of a devastating pandemic from SARS, MERS, influenza, Ebola and smallpox to name a few. To keep calm and carry on, we have adopted an \"oh now, not so fast, let's just wait and see\" tone better suited to the gentleman physicians who populated Victorian novels than 21st century global village realists.\n And, for many years, our Mister Rogers tone was the right one. But not this time.  During late January and early February 2020, perhaps because of misleading information from China, we soft peddled the threat. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the risk to most Americans \"miniscule\" and articulated more concern about seasonal flu than the new coronavirus. He advised people to wash their hands and stay away from crowded places but to not bother wearing a mask.\n I and countless others echoed this advice which was based on a well-articulated medical literature on influenza -- which ultimately was proven to be incorrect. It is uncertain whether an \"everyone must wear masks\" decree would have influenced many people's behavior at that early moment in the pandemic, given the paucity of US cases, but it was and remains a glaring misjudgment.\n It was not the only mistake. From mid-February on, scientists stumbled to develop and deliver a reliable and widely available diagnostic test. And then came the political dawdling and decision to let the states fight among themselves for PPE supplies and ventilators.\n Even leaving aside the hydroxychloroquine debacle, therapies to treat Covid-19 patients have fallen short: We have a mediocre, very expensive drug, remdesivir, directed at the virus itself. It must be given intravenously. Its uncertain efficacy has led to its exclusion from the World Health Organization treatment guidelines. Another category of therapy aimed at improving the immune response to infection includes the expensive antibody infusions the President and his buddies received. Full scale, definitive trials are still pending but this approach clearly has a role for patients with risk for severe disease.\n Thankfully, the cheap old standby, dexamethasone, a steroid typically used to treat inflammation and a handful of illnesses, has reduced mortality in just about every study to date. Plus medical care overall has also lowered the rate of death among those diagnosed.\n These problems are sobering reminders of how difficult it can be to make decisions when incomplete information leads to incomplete understanding of an actively evolving situation.\n On a much smaller scale, though, this is the challenge for any doctor taking care of a sick, unstable patient. The situation may change hourly as test results return and new bits of a patient's history are uncovered; yet decisions must be made immediately despite uncertainty. This means that some of the decisions will be wrong.\n This weighs heavily on any doctor. But despite the emotions around an error, doctors and public health experts have to wake up the next day and make more decisions, most of them also relying on incomplete information. And today's decisions must not be colored by yesterday's mistakes. Learning from a mistake is crucial but over-reacting to a mistake can be paralyzing. Knowing how to balance the two opposing forces is the largest challenge of all.\n This dynamic is the biggest risk to Covid-19 pandemic control as we head into year two. The \"miniscule worry\" and the \"don't wear a mask\" mistakes and the failed \"20 million vaccine doses given by December\" promise can cause further problems if they over-influence the countless complex decisions that lie ahead.\n The looming issues -- vaccine availability and safety, variant strains of the virus, waning immunity, when to loosen public measures after a critical mass of vaccinations -- are fraught with uncertainty, incomplete information and enormous consequences.\n But decisions must be made. Inevitably they will be imperfect and will draw criticism. Adjustments made as more evidence becomes available will be viewed as waffling; a change in course will be called incompetence; the need to reimpose restrictions would be labeled a colossal failure. But everyone must come to work the next day and make the best decisions they can. The buck must no longer be passed to states and counties and hospitals.\n The Biden team surely is aware of what lies ahead. We can only hope that its decisions will rely on evidence, sound judgment and, most of all, the lonely humility of a doctor caring for a critically ill patient.",

        "title": "Manhattan DA expands criminal investigation into Trump Organization finances to include family compound in Westchester County",
        "body_text": "The Manhattan district attorney's office has expanded its criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's finances to include the family's compound in Westchester County, according to lawyers and people familiar with the investigation.\n Prosecutors' interest in the 212-acre property called Seven Springs is a significant widening of an investigation that began more than a year ago. It also draws closer to President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, who was directly involved in discussions about the property now under scrutiny, according to court filings.\n Prosecutors sent grand jury subpoenas within the past two months to town officials seeking documents and communications that officials had with the Trump Organization relating to development plans it considered for the sprawling family property.\n Roland Baroni, a lawyer for the town of North Castle, New York -- one of three municipalities that the property straddles -- confirmed the town received a subpoena \"asking for the planning board files, any correspondence, any email\" exchanged between the town and the Trump Organization. He told CNN that the town complied with the request and that prosecutors have not sought to interview any officials.\n The Trump Organization has also been subpoenaed for information related to the property and tax deductions it took after donating a conservation easement to a public trust, according to people familiar with the investigation.\n The criminal investigation poses a significant threat to Trump, his business and his family as he leaves the White House next week and will no longer have the shield of the presidency to delay or postpone lawsuits and investigations.\n The President personally signed the conservation easement in his thick Sharpie marker, according to documents CNN obtained through a public records request.\n The Seven Springs property is also part of a civil investigation conducted by the New York attorney general's office, which has said it is looking into whether the Trump Organization \"improperly inflated\" the value of the Seven Springs estate.\n The Trump Organization acquired the property in 1995 for $7.5 million. It was once owned by the father of Katharine Graham, the former publisher of the Washington Post.\n Over the ensuring years, the organization made several attempts to develop on the property. Initially there were discussions to build a golf course on the grounds and then plans to build a subdivision of residential homes.\n Those efforts were dropped, and by 2015, the Trump Organization decided to donate a conservation easement to a land trust. A conservation easement is a designated portion of the property that is preserved and not developed. By making a donation, it allows the donor to take a tax deduction based on the appraised value of the property. If it were improperly inflated, the donor could take a larger tax deduction than is allowed.\n Trump granted a conservation easement of about 158 acres to the North American Land Trust, according to court filings. It was appraised at $21.1 million, according to the filings.\n Investigators are scrutinizing the valuation and whether it was inflated.\n \"Valuations of Seven Springs were used to claim an apparent $21.1 million tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on the property in tax year 2015, and in submissions to financial institutions as a component of Mr. Trump's net worth,\" according to court filings in the New York attorney general's investigation.\n Baroni, the lawyer for North Castle, said the Manhattan district attorney's subpoena sought the same records that the New York attorney general had previously requested.\n The district attorneys' office, led by Cyrus Vance, is investigating whether the Trump Organization violated any state laws, which could include tax fraud, insurance fraud or other schemes to defraud.\n Prosecutors subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, which has loaned Trump more than $300 million, and AON, an insurance broker, and interviewed some employees at those firms. They also interviewed Michael Cohen, the President's former personal attorney, who told lawmakers that Trump inflated or deflated the value of his assets when seeking loans from lenders, insurance or to obtain favorable tax treatment.\n In the fall, prosecutors subpoenaed the Trump Organization for records relating to fees it paid to consultants, including a payment made to a company controlled by the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n Mazars USA, the President's long-time accountant, was also subpoenaed for eight years of the President's personal and business records. Trump sued to block it and the subpoena has been tied up in court and is back before the Supreme Court.\n The litigation has delayed prosecutors from taking key investigative steps, multiple sources say, including contacting Trump's personal banker or seeking interviews with any employees of the Trump Organization.\n Carey Dunne, general counsel for Vance's office, told a judge in July that the subpoena delay has led to \"continuing concerns about the potential loss of critical evidence and expiration of statutes of limitations.\"",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 15 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\nThere'll be no arguments about crowd size at Joe Biden's inauguration \u2014 because there won't be a crowd.\n In an extraordinary move that reveals the extreme state in which President Donald Trump leaves the nation, the entire monument-dotted National Mall in Washington will be closed on Wednesday. There are fears that violent pro-Trump mobs that stormed the US Capitol will return \u2014 and concern for the safety of Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and other dignitaries at the open-air ceremony.\n Past presidents took the oath of office before huge, carnival-like crowds that stretched as far as the eye could see down the Mall, in a powerful national unifying moment. Whatever the party, the sight of a new first couple exiting the presidential limo and walking down Pennsylvania Avenue, yet to be beaten down by the burdens of office, crushed ideals and White House scandals, was a symbol of political renewal.*\n But this year, there are more US troops in Washington than in Iraq and Afghanistan. Massive iron and concrete barriers have been erected blocks away from the inaugural platform on the West Front of the Capitol. One official said well-wishers would be lucky to even glimpse the top of the Capitol's white dome if they show up.\n It was always going to be an unusual inauguration, with mass gatherings now lethally dangerous due to the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump ignored. And the outgoing President, still lying about his election defeat, has said he won't show up, denying Biden yet another important legitimating symbol.\n When the world watches on Wednesday, it will take away a tragic truth: Two great icons of US democracy, the Capitol and the White House, must now be sealed inside a vast cage to protect them from the people they serve.\n *True, Trump's inauguration also lacked the traditional sense of joy, as he warned the country of \"American carnage\" in an address reportedly described by ex-President George W. Bush as \"some weird sh**t.\"\n Biden has outlined a massive $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package to fund the fight against the coronavirus and provide direct financial relief to Americans. His proposed \"American Rescue Plan\" would allocate more than $400 billion toward addressing Covid-19, cut $1,400 stimulus checks and expand unemployment benefits. \"There is real pain overwhelming the real economy -- one where people rely on paychecks, not their investments, to pay for their bills and their meals and their children's needs,\" the President-elect said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware \u2014 drawing a pointed contrast to his predecessor's fixation on the gravity-defying stock market. What Biden did not address was how to get the package through Congress.\n \"The first lady is now more than halfway done with the job of shipping belongings either to Mar-a-Lago or to storage, having bit-by-bit overseen the moveout for weeks. The residence staff has had to help with the semi-clandestine operation, facilitating packing logistics without raising the ire of the President, who truly believed he would be staying put.\n \"As the weeks of her tenure come to a close, she has not, however, established an office for continuing her platform in the post-White House years, according to a source familiar with her activities. Nor has she helped with the onboarding of incoming first lady Jill Biden -- with whom she has still not made contact, a senior White House staffer said.\n \"The only thing she has done, besides pack the White House, work on photo albums of her time as first lady and oversee photo shoots of a rug and decorative items, is make a convoluted statement on Monday about last week's events, five days after they occurred.\n \"In it, she stood by the President, something she hasn't always done before in times of turmoil. Trump did not mention her husband's name, nor did she indicate he should receive an iota of responsibility for the insurrection. Instead, she appeared to lift parts of old statements and speeches into this new one, and added in a paragraph painting herself as a victim of a former staff member's continued criticism.\n Covid-19 monoclonal antibody treatments are being \"underutilized,\" according to the US Department of Health and Human Services under Trump, and agency officials are urging the public to request these therapies. \"If you test positive, we need you to ask your provider about monoclonal antibodies as a way of keeping you out of the hospital,\" US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said during a briefing on Thursday. Two such treatments -- one by Eli Lilly and one by Regeneron \u2014 have received emergency use authorization.\n Infectious diseases expert and adviser to the Biden administration Dr. Celine Gounder, however, expressed concern about the outgoing administration's focus on monoclonal antibodies. \"We've been mostly focused on monoclonal antibodies and to some degree, remdesivir and some of the other immunomodulators, but we really need to be thinking about other antivirals,\" she said during a webcast sponsored by Johns Hopkins University, adding that monoclonal antibodies might lose efficacy if the virus evolves much. \"Here I am speaking as a member of IDSA -- the Infectious Diseases Society of America. IDSA still does not recommend the use of monoclonal antibodies, despite emergency use authorization being granted by the FDA,\" she added.",

Robert E. Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson as \"defenders of causes.\" The event typically involved Civil War-themed parades, wreath layings and reenactments hosted by Confederate memorial groups.\n Last February, state lawmakers in Virginia passed a bill that would swap the holiday honoring the Confederate generals for Election Day.\n The bill was among Gov. Ralph Northam 2020 legislative proposals.\n \"We need to make Election Day a holiday,\" he said last year. \"We can do it by ending the Lee-Jackson holiday that Virginia holds ... It commemorates a lost cause. It's time to move on.\"\n Defenders of the holiday argue that it honors Virginia history.\n But Confederate symbols have become increasingly unpopular for their association with pro-slavery activists and racism.\n Both Lee and Jackson, Virginia natives, owned slaves and fought to preserve slavery in the US.\n The state of Virginia has grappled with its Confederate past in recent years.\n Last June, a crowd of protesters in Richmond, Virginia, brought down the statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.\n In July, local politicians removed a statue of Lee and several busts honoring Confederate figures, including Jackson, from the statehouse.\n \"Virginia has a story to tell that extends far beyond glorifying the Confederacy and its participants,\" Eileen Filler-Corn, speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, said at the time.\n In December, the Virginia Military Institute removed a statue of Jackson from its campus, relocating it to a Civil War museum. That same month, a statue of Lee was removed from the US Capitol by the state of Virginia, with Northam opting to replace it with one of Barbara Johns.\n Though Lee-Jackson Day won't officially be observed by the state, in Lexington, Virginia, an annual two-day celebration is still planned, according to a website for the event. Organizers wrote on the website, however, that in-person seating is limited this year due to Covid-19.\n CNN's Theresa Waldrop, Rebekah Riess and Scottie Andrew contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Bumble, the company best known for its female-centered dating app, is getting ready for its big date with Wall Street.\n The company filed paperwork on Friday for an initial public offering, potentially setting it up for a Wall Street debut at a time when dating apps have become lifelines for single people during the pandemic.\n It will list on the Nasdaq under the stock ticker \"BMBL.\"\n The company reported generating $376.6 million in revenue between Jan. 29 and Sept. 30 of last year. During that same period, the company posted a net loss of $84.1 million.\n According to its IPO paperwork, the Bumble dating empire counted 42.1 million monthly active users as of the end of September.\n \"We remain committed to the major opportunity ahead of us to make dating healthier and more equitable around the world, not only for women, but for people across the gender spectrum,\" Wolfe Herd wrote in a letter accompanying the IPO paperwork.\n Bumble is poised to go public on the heels of other successful tech IPOs. Airbnb and DoorDash each soared in their recent public market debuts, suggesting strong investor interest.\n Unlike many other technology companies, the majority of Bumble's board is made up of women. At 31, Wolfe Herd will become one of the youngest female CEOs in tech to take her company public. Katrina Lake, the founder and CEO of Stitch Fix, was the youngest female CEO in tech to do so in 2017, when she was 34.\n Investment firm Blackstone bought a majority stake in Bumble's parent company -- then called MagicLab but since renamed Bumble -- from Russian billionaire Andrey Andreev in 2019. The parent company also includes Badoo, a popular digital dating service outside the United States, founded by Andreev in 2006.\n Andreev served as a partner to Wolfe Herd since Bumble's start. As part of the deal, Andreev sold his stake and stepped down from the business; Wolfe Herd took over the helm. The Blackstone deal valued Bumble, the parent company, at $3 billion.\n The online dating space is crowded, with competing apps such as Tinder, Hinge, Match and OKCupid all owned by Match Group. But Wolfe Herd has worked to set her company apart -- from publicly slamming and blocking a misogynist user to banning gun photos and flagging lewd images sent through direct messages on its app. She's also used her profile to throw her weight around issues pertaining to women and the digital world. In 2019, she and Bumble successfully advocated for a new Texas law outlawing digital sexual harassment.\n \"Our long-term vision is to be the platform to meet new people, no matter what you might be looking for, whichever life stage or situation you're in,\" Wolfe Herd wrote in the letter to investors. \"We will do this with our innovative technology -- and by advocating for equality, both through legislation and with the power of our trusted brand.\"",

        "title": "Already shunned from polite society, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner face new cold post-insurrection reality",
        "body_text": "When Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner shared their decision to pick up and move their family to Washington from New York four years ago, multiple sources who know the couple said the idea was the White House years would allow easy entree to their ambitious next steps: Kushner would become a powerful player in global politics and Trump would become a shoo-in to a higher office of her own.\n The couple have never been shy about their combined love of power. When they got engaged, Ivanka Trump said in an interview that she knew Kushner was the one when she found his ambition matched hers.\n \"Jared and I are very similar in that we're very ambitious. That's what makes it so amazing to be in a relationship with someone who is supportive of that,\" Trump told New York Magazine in 2009.\n Yet now they find themselves staring down the end of the ignominious Trump presidency: the United States Capitol still showing signs of the deadly mob attack that breached the seat of democracy, thousands of National Guard troops cordoning off the city, President Donald Trump impeached (again) for his role in inciting the mob and the family patriarch robbed of his most powerful outlet after getting permanently banned from Twitter.\n To fulfill their goals, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner need to pull off the pivot of all pivots.\n Instead of a smile-and-wave final White House chapter, the couple are busy trying to keep the President from saying too little or too much, throwing themselves on a grenade they aren't certain will detonate but not able to take the chance either way.\n A White House official sent this statement when asked for comment: \"Ivanka came to Washington to give back to a nation that has given her so much and to fight for policies that help hardworking American families. Over four years, she spearheaded policies that created jobs, empowered American workers, fed families in need and supported small businesses throughout the pandemic. She is proud of her service and excited for the future.\"\n Ivanka Trump was among those who pushed her father to make the Twitter video that ultimately got him banned in the wake of the riot, according to a White House official.\n In it he told rioters to \"go home,\" but in an off-script moment added, \"We love you.\"\n From her office in the West Wing, Ivanka Trump was fielding calls from Capitol Hill politicians who were literally hiding from a vicious and violent mob. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a ubiquitous presence with the President during golf outings and holiday jaunts to Mar-a-Lago, could not get in touch with Trump to beseech him to publicly call for a stop to the insurrection, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. So Graham called Ivanka Trump, pleading for her to help talk to her dad.\n Kushner intervened when other officials tried restoring the President's social media presence on sites that are often havens for extremists, such as Gab, following the unprecedented ban from several major platforms.\n It was again Ivanka Trump key among the aides who pushed the President to issue a subsequent video in the wake of his impeachment, again denouncing any future violence or plots to wreak havoc across the country. There were no words of \"love\" this time.\n The latest move was motivated by fear of potential legal exposure by the President, a source familiar with the taping told CNN.\n And according to sources who have worked and socialized with Ivanka Trump and Kushner, their motivation was likely their fear over the state of their beloved moneymaker -- the Trump brand.\n \"They're trying to keep what little is left for them in terms of sellable currency as Trumps,\" said one source, who added the change from \"before insurrection\" to \"after insurrection\" has moved the needle on the state of the Trump empire from perilous to dire.\n \"The proof here about how worried (the family) is is how quiet they are,\" said another source, who notes the muzzled Twitter screeds and the dialed-back bravado, most notably of Ivanka Trump's brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.\n Ivanka Trump's planned \"farewell tour\" of sorts to shore up the policy wins is now shelved, said someone with knowledge of the discussed public relations blitz. The eldest Trump daughter has not made secret her desire to explore running for office herself, confirm several sources, two of whom wondered aloud to CNN whether those dreams are now impossible to achieve.\n \"The idea that anyone will forget that her father incited these attacks is about zero,\" said one political operative who has worked in Republican politics. \"If she wanted future voters to overlook just how devastating the end of this administration is, that's a big lift.\"\n In December, Trump and Kushner closed on the purchase of a $30 million plot of land on exclusive Indian Creek Island just north of Miami, with plans, friends say, to build a private estate. Murmurs that Trump wants to challenge Florida's GOP Sen. Marco Rubio for his seat in 2022 are growing -- or at least they were before the insurrection.\n Adam C. Smith, former Tampa Bay Times political editor and now consultant with Mercury Public Affairs, said it's still possible Ivanka Trump could get a pass in Florida, where the MAGA crowd is strong, and forgiving.\n \"Until there's real evidence that the Trump brand is diminished with the activist base and dominant MAGA wing of the party, and not merely among elected Republicans and establishment types, I think Ivanka would remain the clear front-runner against Marco Rubio,\" he said.\n Trump could also sit back to see what public sentiment dictates for her future, or she might want to wait the required seven years of Florida residency and then run for governor. One source who knows her noted that Trump has never had a problem believing in her own importance.\n \"Lack of self-confidence is not something she suffers from,\" the source said.\n Politics or no, Florida at least provides a more living-friendly environment than New York City, where several former friends have said the couple will not be welcomed back into social circles with open arms.\n The Kushner-Trumps also have a cottage at Trump Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey, which was recently renovated to add more bedrooms. It's possible they could land there for some amount of time, but politically New Jersey is not Trump country, either.\n Florida, where Ivanka Trump campaigned several times in the run-up to the presidential election, could provide a partisan haven, but the ease that she and Kushner were to have to parlay their years in Washington into new personas in the Sunshine State is now gone.\n The Trump family itself is not the same as it was in terms of relationships from the years before Washington to the present day.\n The most fractured of the bonds is likely the tenuous friendship Trump previously had with her stepmother, Melania Trump. The two women are undoubtedly the most powerful and influential in the President's life, and prior to the White House years both were aware and respectful of one another's turf, according to sources familiar with the dynamic. However, Ivanka Trump's perceived incursions into first lady Melania Trump's lane have led to tension between the women that's so bad, one source told CNN, there is little desire by either to be in the same room.\n In recent months, Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump have not, in fact, been publicly photographed together, with the exception of the presidential debate in September and the Republican National Convention in August, where Melania sat on one side of the President with their son, Barron, her parents and the Pences, with Ivanka Trump across the stage on the other side.\n At Thanksgiving, Ivanka Trump and the adult siblings went to Camp David, while Trump ate dinner at the White House with Melania Trump, Barron Trump and her parents. Over the Christmas holiday, Ivanka Trump and Kushner did not visit Mar-a-Lago as they had in years past. Though Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have separate living space at Mar-a-Lago, where the outgoing first couple intends to live post-White House, one source said Melania Trump \"hasn't exactly rolled out the welcome mat.\"\n The elder Trump siblings have simmering issues, too, most stemming from how the President has behaved over the past two weeks.\n \"There's been some finger-pointing,\" said someone with knowledge of the situation.\n But if there were ever a time for the Trump family to get on with its bunker mentality and try for an image upgrade, it would be now -- or the hotels, real estate, branded retail and any future Trump-touched business entities could be irretrievably damaged.\n \"I think this is one time the family has to acknowledge that their actions have had consequences,\" the source said.",

JPMorgan Chase reported a record profit of $12.1 billion for the fourth quarter Friday \u2014 easily topping Wall Street's forecasts.\n But JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon still sounded a bit nervous about the near-term economic outlook, citing the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n The bank said it has credit reserves of more than $30 billion to help act as a cushion in case conditions deteriorate.\n Dimon noted in the bank's earnings release that the build-up in credit reserves \"continue to reflect significant near-term economic uncertainty and will allow us to withstand an economic environment far worse than the current base forecasts by most economists.\"\n Dimon, however, did cite \"positive vaccine and stimulus developments\" as a hopeful sign for the future.\n He added during a conference call with reporters that we could have a \"very healthy economy\" by the summer \u2014 especially if unemployed Americans and small businesses \"who desperately need help\" get more stimulus payments from the incoming Joe Biden administration and Democratic-led Congress.\n Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which were already up 11% so far in 2021 before the earnings report, fell slightly Friday but are still trading at an all-time high.\n JPMorgan Chase is also doing better than banking rivals Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) which both reported mixed results Friday morning.\n JPMorgan Chase reported solid gains in its investment banking unit and a healthy jump in trading revenue. The rebound of the stock market has been good for the bank, as has a resurgence in initial public offering activity and deal making.\n The bank's consumer business is still suffering a bit though. Revenue was down 8% in the unit in the fourth quarter as the banks posted declines in net income for its core consumer banking and credit card lending divisions.\n JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jennifer Piepszak said during a conference call with reporters that the bank does not expect loan demand to pick up that much this year despite the continuation of low interest rates.\n The one bright spot in the consumer business? Mortgages. Fueled by a booming housing market thanks to low rates and rising prices as more people are moving to the suburbs, JPMorgan Chase reported a 16% jump in home lending revenue from a year ago.\n Dimon said during the call with reporters that the housing market should remain robust, because there is still a supply shortage that is boosting home prices.",

        "title": "Taxidermy and a Lincoln bust among departing White House effects ",
        "body_text": "A pheasant took flight from the White House Thursday afternoon.\n Toted by Debbie Meadows, wife of White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, the taxidermy bird was moved out of Meadows' West Wing office, among other boxes and souvenirs from his time in the administration, and placed into the trunk of a waiting SUV.\n With just days left in the Trump administration, the White House complex is abuzz with signs of the end of one presidency and the beginning of another, staffers pushing carts with empty and full boxes, aides bidding farewell to their departing colleagues, and some walking out with large framed photograph mementos -- a jolting air of normalcy in the wake of last week's deadly insurrection at the US Capitol and the anticipation of more violence around Wednesday's inauguration.\n Questions abounded Thursday after a trio of unidentified masked officials walked a bronze bust of President Abraham Lincoln outside the front door of the West Wing. To whom did it belong? And where, precisely, was it off to?\n Items such as the Lincoln sculpture were on loan from the official White House collection and part of a documented process wherein thousands of pieces of art, decorative art, sculpture, china, silver and other items are historically preserved.\n These items are available for the incoming president and first lady to select at the start of a new term, as the Trumps did in 2017.\n At move-out, there is a systematic return of the loaned items to the White House Historical Association, which, along with the chief usher and curator of the White House, collects the collection items.\n \"To all concerned about media photos of items leaving the White House: The White House Chief Usher and the Curator have responsibility for managing and accounting for the White House Collection in every presidency. They are an exemplary team of career professionals and should have our confidence in carrying out their responsibility,\" White House Historical Association president Stewart McLaurin, said in a statement.\n The curator is Lydia Tederick, according to the White House Historical Association, who \"has served in the Office of the Curator for over thirty years and is the eighth professional to hold this position.\"\n Tederick reports to chief usher Timothy Harleth, a former Trump Hotel employee who is now a career official. Harleth \"essentially serves as the general manager of the White House residence and operations and oversees the Collection,\" according to the association.\n \"Be reminded that staff have items of their own that they brought to the White House and can take those items home as they wish. Some items are on loan to staff and offices from other collections and will be returned to those collections,\" McLaurin said.\n He added in a tweet that he had \"reconfirmed\" that information Thursday with Harleth in light of questions about the Lincoln bust's departure.\n As for Meadows' majestic fowl, the pheasant is a personal effect and was previously in his Capitol Hill office, and, a source said, wasn't the only piece of taxidermy in his West Wing office.\n Some staffers are also keeping the posters that have adorned the West Wing walls with images of key moments from the last four years, with some available for purchase from the White House photo office for $25, per a former White House official. Trade adviser Peter Navarro was spotted toting such an acquisition, a picture of President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n It's not unusual for departing White House staff to snag a souvenir or two on their way out. Bill Clinton staffers famously removed \"W\" keys from keyboards ahead of the George W. Bush inauguration.\n During previous departures, the anchor-emblazoned doorknobs of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building have disappeared before Inauguration Day, former Secret Service agent and CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow said.\n But, Wackrow noted, US Secret Service Uniform Division officers are typically put on high alert over these next few days -- checking bags to prevent the departure of any essential equipment.\n CNN's Kate Bennett, Kaitlan Collins and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

        "title": "As NASA and NOAA warn of climate emergency, they weather last-minute denial by Trump appointees",
        "body_text": "The numbers are in. The hottest seven years in recorded history are: 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n Notice a trend? As 2020 smashed hurricane and wildfire records, doing $90 billion worth of damage in the United States alone, new data shows last year neck-and-neck with 2016 as the hottest year in recorded history.\n But at this point, says NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel, rankings are worthless. It's all about that horrifying trend towards a level of global overheating impossible to control.\n \"What really matters, and what I think is really significant and really concerning, is that the seven hottest years on record were the past seven years,\" Marvel told CNN.\n Her work is part of a global consensus among scientists -- from the United Kingdom's Met Office, Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service, Berkeley Earth and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- that the planet's man-made fever shows no sign of breaking and that land, sea and sky may all be getting hotter faster.\n The seven-year stretch \"almost hints at a bit of an acceleration in the rate of warming we're seeing globally,\" Russ Vose, chief of climate monitoring at NOAA, told CNN. \"Each decade has been warmer than the decade that preceded it for the past four or five decades.\"\n If the trend continues, it means this was also the coldest seven-year stretch for the rest of our lives, if not the rest of recorded human history. And the scientists who authored these latest reports all agree.\n Humanity will determine exactly how bad it gets.\n \"It's not the sun. It's not natural climate variability. It's human actions, specifically human emissions of greenhouse gases, dioxide and methane,\" Marvel said emphatically. \"I'm a scientist. I hang out with scientists all the time. We don't agree on anything. Scientists will fight about absolutely everything. So the fact that scientists agree that it is human activities causing the climate changes that we've seen, that's really, really, really significant.\"\n But even as experts were finishing their annual global climate assessments, climate skeptics appointed by President Donald Trump to top scientific positions at NOAA last September, and later temporarily assigned to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), were publishing contrarian pseudoscience online.\n \"The Office of Science and Technology Policy is pleased to bring you these briefs to further your understanding of climate change by learning from these learned scholars,\" reads the introduction written by one of those Trump appointees, David Legates, a professor at the University of Delaware who supports the climate-denying Heartland Institute.\n But the essays, now known as the \"Climate Change Flyers,\" were written by longtime contrarians and filled with theories debunked by the peer-reviewed work of scientists across US agencies, and even the public acknowledgment by major oil companies that the climate crisis is caused by burning fossil fuels.\n Without permission, Legates and fellow Trump appointee Ryan Maue posted the flyers on a website affiliated with leading climate skeptic Willie Soon and bore the seal of the Executive Office of the President.\n OSTP Director Kelvin Droegemeier \"was outraged to learn of the materials that were not shared with or approved by OSTP leadership,\" spokeswoman Kristina Baum said in an email to the Washington Post. \"He first became aware of the documents when contacted by the press. As a result, Dr. Droegemeier took swift action and the individuals responsible have been relieved of their duties at OSTP.\"\n Legates and Maue finished out their term at the White House this week and returned to NOAA, where the incident is under review, according to the Washington Post. CNN reached out to Legates and Maue for comment but received no response.\n \"I do know David Legates from back in my days in graduate school, but I haven't seen him in a long time, and I can't explain the actions that he and others took in this case,\" Vose told CNN. \"I can't speak for all of NOAA, but I can tell you that where we are, our morale is high,\" he said. \"I've been through four administrations. I've happily served them all. I look forward to serving the next administration.\"\n Despite the politicization of science under Trump, Vose likens the role of NOAA scientists to Department of Labor statisticians in charge of job reports: neutral dispensers of accurate numbers.\n \"We happily do our work independently without interference,\" he said. \"And please hold us accountable if you ever feel like that's happened.\"\n \"I'm hoping that the long-term effects will be almost nil,\" Marvel said. \"I think the fact that this stuff came out and most people said, 'Well, this is a bit silly' and then moved on gives me a lot of hope.\"\n With an incoming Joe Biden administration committed to reversing course on US climate inaction, the conversation around this most difficult topic is bound to change. The question is how soon before debate turns to policy and action.\n \"My entire goal is to become completely irrelevant to the climate conversation,\" Marvel said. \"I don't want scientists to be debating whether or not this is happening or who's responsible for it. I think we've moved beyond that. I think we should be having a much better fight. We should be debating policy. We should be debating solutions. We should be debating the morality of climate change. None of those things are my particular area of expertise. But I think we're getting there.\"",

Many reporters were also forced to leave the national election tally center, despite having accreditation.\n The hashtag \"We are removing a dictator\" has been trending since polls opened in Uganda yesterday and was used widely as news of the military presence at Wine's residence broke.\n Long-standing ruler President Yoweri Museveni, 76, is seeking a sixth term in office. He is being challenged by 10 opposition candidates, including Wine.\n Museveni said in a CNN interview aired on Tuesday that he would \"accept the results\" if he lost.\n \"Uganda is not my house... if the people of Uganda don't want me to help them with their issues, I go and deal with my personal issues very happily,\" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\n Wine reiterated his calls for the United States and European Union to hold Museveni and his government \"accountable to free and fair elections.\"\n \"It is evident that the government of Uganda and the generals blocked the election observers of the EU and also blocked the United States election observers, switched off the entire internet... so that Uganda can carry out elections in the dark,\" he told CNN.\n \"We are calling for the world to respond legally. We are calling for the US to hold General Museveni and this government accountable to free and fair elections..\" Wine added.\n Before casting his ballot on Thursday, Wine addressed the media and complained that the majority of his polling agents across the country have been prevented from observing the election by police.\n Ugandan law guarantees that every candidate is allowed representation at polling locations.\n Many polling stations were forced to use manual voting and checks after the biometric machines failed to register ballots because of the internet shutdown ordered by the government.\n There were also reports of late delivery of voting material and insufficient material at numerous polling locations.\n On Tuesday, two days ahead of the polls, internet service providers were ordered to block access to social media platforms. In an address to the nation on the same day, Museveni confirmed that Facebook and other social media were blocked, accusing them of \"arrogance.\"\n Uganda's Electoral Commission is expected to declare the winner on Saturday., 48 hours after polls closed.\n Eoin McSweeney contributed to this report",

        "title": "Fast food workers go on strike in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.",
        "body_text": "An estimated 1,000 fast food workers across the United States went on strike Friday over low wages, staging protests in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. ahead of the federal holiday next week.\n The demonstrations were set to take place in more than 15 cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Los Angeles. The strike was organized by supporters of Fight for $15 and a Union, the labor advocacy group that has been pushing to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour and grant collective bargaining rights to fast food employees, who are disproportionately Black and Brown.\n Fight for $15 organizing director Allynn Umel said her organization's cause is one King would have championed, noting that the civil rights icon marched in support of labor rights for Memphis sanitation workers the day before he was assassinated in 1968.\n \"There are workers in the South still continuing to carry on that legacy to fight for racial and economic justice because they know those fights are intertwined,\" Umel told CNN Business on Friday.\n Nearly 20% of the estimated 3.9 million fast food workers in America are Black, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though Black Americans make up just 13% of the US population. Umel said fast food companies that support King's legacy and want to continue his fight against institutional racism can start by increasing their workers' pay and letting them unionize.\n \"Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is among the most powerful tools to lift up Black and Brown workers,\" she said.\n The striking protesters work at many of the country's most popular chains, including McDonald's (MCD), Taco Bell and Burger King.\n McDonald's cook Rita Blalock, 54, of Raleigh, North Carolina, was one of dozens of fast food employees participating in a car caravan protest outside a McDonald's restaurant in the nearby city of Durham on Friday.\n Blalock said her employer cut her hours back in March when Covid-19-related lockdowns caused many fast food chains to lose business. Since then, Blalock, who says she makes $10 an hour, has been struggling to pay her bills. She said McDonald's could improve her situation by raising their minimum wage nationally and granting workers like her guaranteed benefits, including medical insurance and paid sick leave.\n \"I couldn't pay rent, couldn't eat a lot of times,\" she told CNN Business. \"If you can't go to work but so many hours, you don't have enough to cover what you need to cover in the first place.\"\n McDonald's said it unequivocally supports the need for racial equality and social justice and that Friday's strike doesn't reflect how it has protected and provided employment to more than 800,000 people during the pandemic. The company stopped lobbying against increases to the federal minimum wage in 2019, and says elected officials have a responsibility to debate, change and set the standards.\n \"We strive to ensure that everyone who works under the Arches shows up each day to a safe and inclusive workplace that provides access to continuous opportunities,\"  McDonald's spokesperson Jesse Lewin said via email.\n Wanda Lavender works as a manager at a Popeyes in Milwaukee. The 39-year-old single mother of six participated in a car caravan protest outside a McDonald's in Milwaukee Friday afternoon. She said she makes $12 an hour and works more than 50 hours a week at Popeyes. Lavender says she hasn't been getting paid for sick leave or vacation days since 2019.\n \"These are the things we were fighting for over 50 years ago and we're fighting for those same things now,\" she said.\n Popeyes didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n Umel said the Fight for $15 movement reached a milestone in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced many Americans to take a hard look at the plight of the largely Black and Brown working poor. Fast food employees make up a large chunk of the essential workers who have continued to go into work while many other Americans worked from home.\n In the beginning, many struggled to find personal protective equipment to wear on the job as their employers scrambled to provide them with masks, gloves and cleaning supplies.\n The saga played out on the news all year long, in front of a largely captive audience of remote workers and the unemployed. It resulted in 20 states agreeing to raise their minimum wage and President-elect Joe Biden advocating for raising the federal minimum to $15 an hour as part of his proposed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.\n \"This moment really comes down to a change and a realization of the value of work,\" Umel said. \"It is a recognition that it is well beyond time to make sure this happens.\"",

        "body_text": "One is dropping in on the White House phone operators, addressing troops at bases across the country, paying a visit to national guardsmen in place for the inauguration and speaking by phone with his successor.\n The other is holed up inside, silenced on social media, resisting entreaties to deliver a farewell address and refusing to speak to the man who beat him.\n The respective ways Vice President Mike Pence and his boss, President Donald Trump, are concluding their terms in the White House amount to a study in contrasts.\n One way is decidedly more presidential than the other.\n After an extended period of estrangement after Trump called Pence a \"p*ssy\" and lambasted him in front of a crowd that later stormed the US Capitol to hunt him, Trump and Pence are now speaking.\n But many in Pence's orbit remain furious at how Trump behaved the day of the insurrection attempt, which brought rioters within seconds of encountering Pence and members of his family in the hallways outside the Senate chamber. Trump did not call to check on Pence's safety during the ordeal.\n And the two men, while back on speaking terms, are now following entirely divergent paths in the twilight of their administration.\n On Thursday, Pence spoke with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for the first time, the highest-level contact to date between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Their conversation was described as cordial, with Pence offering his congratulations and assistance, according to a person familiar with the matter. The New York Times first reported the conversation.\n Trump has refused all courtesies to Biden, to whom he has not technically conceded in a formal way. He resisted inviting Biden to the White House for a traditional post-election meeting, has not phoned him and is not expected to welcome him to the White House on Inauguration Day. He maintains privately that he beat Biden, according to people who have discussed the matter with him.\n Instead of welcoming Biden to the White House and sharing a car to the swearing-in ceremony, Trump is planning to depart the White House on the morning of January 20, participate in a send-off at Joint Base Andrews and fly to Palm Beach aboard Air Force One, all before Biden is sworn in as the 46th president. Even the use of Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, on Inauguration Eve was left to the State Department to formally offer to the Bidens.\n Pence, meanwhile, plans to attend the inauguration.\n In recent days, Pence has emerged as a more visible figure than the President, who has appeared only in recorded videos filmed by White House staff. While many of Trump's advisers have encouraged him to deliver a farewell address, either live or recorded, has has seemed disinterested and non-committal. He's voiced extreme self-pity, according to people familiar with the conversations, and has become surly because more Republicans aren't defending him.\n Pence, who has been among the advisers encouraging the President to more forcefully condemn last week's riots, has adopted a more cheerful outlook.\n During an afternoon outing on Thursday, he dropped into the pool of White House phone operators working in the New Executive Office Building across the street from the White House, presenting them with challenge coins and a framed letter of appreciation.\n From there he traveled to the headquarters of Federal Emergency Management Agency for a briefing on inauguration security, which Trump was also briefed on this week at the White House but which he hasn't addressed at length.\n \"We all lived through that day of January the 6th and as the President made clear yesterday, we are committed to an orderly transition and to a safe Inauguration,\" he said, seated at the head of a table flanked by an American flag. \"The American people deserve nothing less.\"\n Before he returned to the White House, Pence stopped to greet troops posted outside the Capitol, where a week earlier he had been hunkered in a secure location while would-be insurrectionists stormed the building.\n \"God bless you,\" he told the cordon. \"It's been my great honor to serve as your vice president.\"\n Pence is using Air Force Two amply in his final days. He flew to West Virginia on Friday for a memorial service for the late test pilot Chuck Yeager, telling the gathering he extended deep sympathies \"on behalf of the President of the United States.\"\n He will travel to two military installations over the weekend: Naval Air Station Lemoore, in California, on Saturday for remarks on the Trump administration's foreign policy; and Fort Drum, in New York, on Sunday for remarks to 10th Mountain Division soldiers recently returned from Afghanistan.\n The extent of Trump's messaging on his foreign policy legacy came in the form of an emailed statement on Thursday declaring: \"United States military troops in Afghanistan are at a 19-year low. Likewise, Iraq and Syria are also at the lowest point in many years. I will always be committed to stopping the endless wars. It has been a great honor to rebuild our military and support our brave men and women in uniform. $2.5 trillion invested, including in beautiful new equipment -- all made in the U.S.A.\"\n The statement appeared to be a substitute for what would otherwise have been a tweet, if Trump had not been permanently banned from Twitter.",

General Russel Honor\u00e9 (Ret.), a respected leader with experience dealing with crises, to lead an immediate review of the Capitol's security infrastructure, interagency processes and procedures, and command and control.\"\n Pelosi said in her announcement that Honor\u00e9 \"has strong experience with the security of the National Capital Region\" and noted that members of House leadership worked with him \"during Katrina and saw firsthand his strategic and patriotic leadership.\"\n Honor\u00e9 was dispatched to lead the Defense Department's response to Hurricanes Katrina and, later, Rita.\n A biographical section of the retired lieutenant general's website says, \"Prior to his command of Joint Task Force-Katrina -- leading the Department of Defense response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana -- General Honor\u00e9 served in a variety of command and staff positions which focused on Defense Support to Civil Authorities and Homeland Defense.\"\n The attack at the Capitol has left members of Congress furious and shaken with many fearing for their lives during the riots. The Democrat-led House moved swiftly this week to impeach President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection, a vote that received bipartisan support with a handful of Republicans crossing party lines to support impeachment.\n Pelosi addressed efforts to secure the Capitol in the wake of the deadly siege at a press conference Friday, saying, \"Following the attack last week on the Capitol complex, there has been unprecedented mobilization of security in the Capitol. I want to express gratitude to our Capitol police, to the National Guard who are present here to protect our democracy.\"\n The Capitol riot took place after Trump repeatedly made false claims that the election had been stolen from him and urged his supporters to fight back.\n In the wake of the deadly siege, security has been intensely ramped up at the Capitol ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, which is set to take place in just a few days on January 20.\n Pelosi said during her news conference, \"We must subject this whole complex to scrutiny in light of what happened and the fact that the inauguration is coming.\"\n The House speaker added during her press conference, \"Members are moving forward with strong oversight from committees, of course, to have after action review. There is strong interest in the Congress in a 9/11 type commission -- an outside commission to conduct that after action review. In the meantime I'm very grateful for general Honor\u00e9 for taking on this responsibility.\"\n Pelosi described Honor\u00e9 as \"a respected leader with experience dealing with crises.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.\n CNN's Stephanie Elam contributed to this report.",

Following his response to the Covid-19 pandemic in May, militia members hanged the governor in effigy.\n Others walked past the barriers at the governor's mansion where Beshear lives with his family, \"chanting and heckling,\" for him to come out, he said.

        "title": "What Josh Hawley doesn't get about George Orwell",
        "body_text": "Laura Beers is a professor of history at  American University. She is the author of \"Your Britain: Media and the Making of the Labour Party\" and \"Red Ellen: The Life of Ellen Wilkinson, Socialist, Feminist, Internationalist.\" The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nThe English writer George Orwell, who died more than 70 years ago, is experiencing a resurgence of popularity among the political right. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. reacted to Twitter's decision to ban his father from the social media platform with a tweet of his own: \"We are living Orwell's 1984. Free-speech no longer exists in America. It died with big tech and what's left is only there for a chosen few.\"\n Minutes earlier, Josh Hawley -- the Missouri senator and outspoken proponent of Trump's false claims to have won the 2020 election, who offered a raised fist to those assembled outside the Capitol, just hours before the mob turned violent and forcibly breached the building's defenses -- had responded to the news that Simon & Schuster had decided to cancel his book contract with a tweet. \"This could not be more Orwellian\" he wrote. \"Only approved speech can now be published. This is the Left looking to cancel everyone they don't approve of. I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have.\"\n On Wednesday, Anthony Shaffer, retired military intelligence officer and adviser to the Trump campaign, accused the BBC's Evan Davis of using \"Orwellian language to change what happened\" when Davis described the president \"inspiring insurrection, sedition, violent attack on Congress.\"\n Orwell opposed censorship, not only official state censorship, which was \"obviously ... not desirable,\" but the informal censorship of the media. As he wrote in an unpublished 1943 essay on \"The Freedom of the Press\": \"If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face.\"\n Yet, while Orwell opposed censorship, he abhorred the corruption of language by political leaders intent on masking dubious or amoral actions behind either the anodyne language of bureaucracy and legalese, or the emotional language of patriotism.  One of Orwell's deepest laments was that, during his lifetime, \"political speech and writing\" had become \"largely the defense of the indefensible.\" Most likely Orwell would not have supported either the de-platforming of Trump, or the cancelation of Hawley's book contract. But he likely would also have despised both men for their cynical abuse of the English language.\n More straightforward would have been his reaction to Shaffer's disingenuous effort to invoke his name to delegitimize the BBC's characterization of the events of January 6. In his classic 1946 essay \"Politics and the English language,\" Orwell wrote that \"Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\"\n The term Orwellian, used correctly, is a shorthand for the perversion of language to mask truth and defend the indefensible, the most concise example of which is the government's mantra in Orwell's \"1984\": \"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\" \"1984,\" in addition to being an indictment of totalitarianism, is also an indictment of the displacement of plain truth with political doublespeak. It's a warning of the societal danger of rewriting insurrection, sedition and violence as patriotism and protest.\n Trump Jr. and Hawley's tweets rolled into my feed as I was finishing the syllabus for an undergraduate history seminar, \"George Orwell and the Making of the Modern World,\" which will explore the early 20th century taught through Orwell's writing. Not for the first time, I was reminded of Orwell's continued relevance, and more broadly, what his work reveals about the importance of truth and language in political discourse in America and beyond.\n I teach in the US now, but I taught my first class on Orwell in 2016 in the United Kingdom as that country was consumed by the bitter referendum campaign over whether Britain should leave the European Union. Brexiteers famously campaigned with a giant red bus emblazoned with the slogan \"We send the EU \u00a3350 million a week. Let's fund our NHS instead.\"\n It was a knowingly false equation, that money \"saved\" by withdrawal the EU would be directly available for investment at home -- akin to Big Brother's 2 + 2 =5 in Orwell's \"1984\" -- but one that the Remain camp seemed unable to neutralize. The distortions and untruths of the Brexit campaign only underscored the enduring relevance of Orwell's quip that, \"Intellectual honesty is a crime in any totalitarian country; but even in England it is not exactly profitable to speak and write the truth.\"\n Four years later, I was teaching in America. This time, my students and I were discussing Orwell in the context of a Trump presidency that has frequently been denounced by the left as Orwellian for its embrace of lying and \"alternative facts,\" but also in the context of a newly emergent \"cancel culture\" on the political left which has been perceived as Orwellian by public figures with far more credibility than Sen. Hawley.\n I can report that the extremist political rhetoric of the 2020 election campaign as well as the growth of demagoguery and totalitarianism around the globe has only spurred undergraduates' interest in Orwell; the course I'm finalizing is full and has a waitlist.\n I first read George Orwell in middle school, during the dying days of the Cold War, when \"Animal Farm\" was considered an ideal vehicle to teach American students about the perils of Soviet totalitarianism and to inculcate the virtues of America's commitment to free speech and the protection of political dissent. I went on to read \"1984\" in high school English, where my teacher made analogies between Big Brother and Joseph Stalin and the cult of personality and spelled out the connections between Newspeak and Room 101 and Soviet censorship and the torture and repression of the Gulag.\n Donald Trump Jr. is a year older than I am. Josh Hawley is a year younger. For American children of our generation, the Orwell whom we were taught in high school was a Cold Warrior, an anti-Communist crusader against thought policing and dictatorial repression.  If I had left Orwell behind in high school, I can imagine having sympathy for Trump and Hawley's claims that their First Amendment rights have been suppressed by a left-wing media establishment they deemed \"Orwellian.\"  After all, to quote the inscription beside the statue of Orwell outside the BBC's headquarters in London, \"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\"\n But I didn't leave Orwell behind.  In college, I read Orwell's indictments of racial oppression, based on his own experience as an imperial officer in Burma, and his writings on unemployment and poverty in Britain and France. Crucially, I read Homage to Catalonia, Orwell's memoir of his decision to volunteer alongside the Trotskyist POUM party in Spain in defense of the Spanish Republic against Franco's coup, only to discover that the POUM's worst enemy was arguably not Franco but the Stalin-backed Republican government which was intent on extinguishing their POUM \"allies\" with physical persecution and vicious propaganda.\n Orwell's memoir sought to dispel the propaganda and rehabilitate the POUM's reputation as champions of democracy. To his dismay, he found that his publisher Victor Gollancz would not publish the book, despite accepting the truth of Orwell's narrative, for fear of upsetting the Stalin-backed government and undermining the Republican cause.  Orwell, like Hawley, saw his book contract canceled -- and ultimately published the book through a small press that shared his political sympathies.\n The more Orwell I read when I was young, the more I came to appreciate that, even above freedom of speech, Orwell was dedicated to defending the truth.  In the world of \"1984,\" where Big Brother insists that 2+2 =5, \"freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\"\n Published in 1949, Orwell's \"1984\" is set, not in Communist Russia, but in Oceania, a dystopian Anglo-American superpower constantly at war with Russia (Eurasia) and China (Eastasia).  In setting his novel in a version of Britain, Orwell is underscoring the point that political repression and dishonesty are not the preserve of Soviet totalitarianism.\n The students who are enrolled in my class this spring were born well after the end of the Cold War.  Their interest in Orwell is driven presumably less by his political relevance as an anti-Communist tribune than by the question of whether modern political culture, with its information silos, lies and alternative facts, has become the dystopian nightmare that Orwell envisaged.",

        "body_text": "Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who will leave office in less than a week stated that he 'cannot wait to leave this job,' according to a transcript released by the Department of Defense.\n The admission, during a press gaggle Thursday on his way back from a trip to Nebraska, Tennessee and Colorado, was one of a number of stunning statements from the man President Donald Trump picked to take over the position just over two months ago.\n The comments came the same day the Pentagon said at least 21,000 National Guard are being mobilized in Washington, DC, amid security concerns around next week's inauguration following the deadly riots at the Capitol.\n Miller was asked about the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), a fifth-generation fighter jet considered the most expensive weapons program in history used by the Air Force, Marines and Navy. After clarifying that the question is about the F-35 and not a different weapons system, Miller begins his answer by saying, \"I so...I mean, I cannot wait to leave this job, believe me.\"\n He then apparently went on to disparage the latest American fighter jet, a program that cost more than $1 trillion, saying, \"Yesterday we were talking to some guy, some lieutenant colonel, or colonel, said 'what are you flying?' Said 'F-35,' I was like that's a piece of ... and he was like ... and he laughed, and I was like, 'No seriously, tell me about it.'\"\n \"I'm like, we have created a monster, but you know that,\" he concluded.\n Miller was also asked what he had learned about Russian activity below the threshold of war. \"Good on them\" was his surprising response.\n \"I kind of, you know, like professionally I'm like, wow, they're doing pretty well, and they're using a lot of irregular warfare concepts, information, all this stuff, in a way that, you know, like ... good on them,\" he said.\n The transcript does not make it clear what news outlets joined Miller on his trip or who asked the questions.\n A defense official traveling with Miller said, \"The Secretary often uses casual and humorous language with reporters and personnel during travel. That characteristic does not convey well in a written transcript but was obvious to participants.\"\n When asked what he wanted to see from Northern Command next week, Miller gave a meandering response that comes across as incoherent at times. \"Uh, I needed to look the commander in the eye, because, you know, the President, SecDef, me ... I, whatever the correct English is, you guys can clean that up.  Should have paid more attention in high school.  My wife would be ashamed of me not knowing the proper preposition\u2014and then, uh General VanHerck. So, you know, you just, I said it before, you can have [video tele-conferences] all day long, you know, but you wanna, like, I wanted to look the guy in the eye and get a sense for his soul and I think he probably needed to do that for me as well,\" Miller said.\n Miller became the acting secretary of defense when Trump fired Mark Esper via Twitter on November 9, two days after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the Presidential election.\n His appointment preceded a post-election purge that saw some of the senior-most Defense Department civilians ousted in a matter of days, including the leaders of the Defeat-ISIS task force, the top Pentagon officials overseeing policy and intelligence, and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, among others. The positions were quickly filled with individuals perceived as Trump loyalists.\n On Friday, Miller touted the ongoing contentious troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan to 2,500 personnel in each country, despite opposition from Capitol Hill and Esper.\n Miller moved forward with the Afghanistan withdrawal, despite the National Defense Authorization Act prohibiting the use of Pentagon funds to remove troops without a congressional review. Trump waived the limitations on the troop reduction in the \"national security interests of the United States,\" Major Rob Lodewick, a Pentagon spokesman said.\n This story has been updated with additional comments from Miller and background.",

        "body_text": "James Murdoch, the youngest son of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch, assailed \"media property owners\" and outlets that have promoted disinformation and conspiracy theories about the results of the 2020 election.\n Murdoch did not explicitly mention Fox News, which is controlled by his father and his brother Lachlan Murdoch. But it was clear that, even if he had other outlets in mind as well, his focus was on the right-wing cable network when he made those comments in an interview with the Financial Times published Friday. Since the election was called for Joe Biden, some Fox News personalities have amplified President Trump's false election fraud claims and sowed distrust in the voting system.\n \"The damage is profound,\" Murdoch said, referring to the election disinformation that has circulated in the US. \"The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so. Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.\"\n \"I hope that those people who didn't think it was that dangerous now understand, and that they stop,\" Murdoch added.\n Murdoch added that he had not \"seen any evidence of that yet.\"\n Following the interview, he released a joint statement to the Financial Times with his wife, Kathryn Murdoch.\n \"Spreading disinformation \u2014 whether about the election, public health or climate change \u2014 has real world consequences,\" the two said. \"Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever.\"\n A spokesperson for Murdoch did not respond to a request for comment.\n The younger Murdoch made a dramatic break from his family in August 2020, resigning from the board of directors of News Corp, his family's publishing empire. Murdoch said at the time he was exiting the company over \"disagreements over certain editorial content published\" by its news outlets and \"certain other strategic decisions.\"\n It wouldn't be the first time James Murdoch spoke out publicly about the coverage provided by the news outlets in his father's media empire. A spokesperson for James and his wife Kathryn told the Daily Beast that the couple was frustrated \"with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage\" on climate change as wildfires tore through Australia last year.  In an interview with The New Yorker in 2019, he said \"There are views I really disagree with on Fox.\"\n Murdoch has shown other signs of being at odds with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch's conservative political views. He previously donated to Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg and fumed about climate change denialism.",

She argued that Assange's case has \"major Constitutional implications\" and it could essentially \"turn investigative reporting into a criminal enterprise.\"\n Moris added that she hopes to make contact with someone in the White House about Assange's case, but so far has not been in contact with anyone.\n \"I am not in touch with anyone in the White House, hence the effort to ask people who might have contacts to speak to them themselves, and make the principled case for a pardon,\" Moris said.\n Assange was arrested in April 2019 when British authorities entered the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he had been holed up for seven years, and took him into custody on a US extradition warrant.\n The Wikileaks founder has been charged under the Espionage Act for his role in publishing classified military and diplomatic cables. He faces up to 175 years in prison.\n A British judge last week denied Assange bail, saying that \"there are substantial grounds for believing that if Mr. Assange is released today he would fail to surrender to court and face the appeal proceedings.\"\n The judge in the case, however, has denied a request to extradite Assange to the US.\n Trump has issued a number of controversial pardons as his days in office dwindle. In December, he pardoned longtime ally Roger Stone and former campaign manager Paul Manafort. He also pardoned four Blackwater guards convicted in an Iraq massacre.",

        "title": "A teen with autism died after Louisiana deputies sat on him for 9 minutes, parents' lawsuit says",
        "body_text": "The parents of a 16-year-old with severe autism who died last year are suing the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, sheriff, claiming the teen's death was caused by deputies who restrained and sat on him for 9 minutes.\n \"Never did we ever think that our 16-year-old son with special needs would die in front of our eyes at his age and in the hands of law enforcement,\" Donna Lou, the mother of the teen, Eric Parsa, said Thursday in a news conference.\n \"Unfortunately it is our reality of a nightmare that we have had to live with every day since his untimely death,\" Lou said.\n The family's lawsuit comes as police use of force has come under increased scrutiny, particularly against children with special needs. Donna Lou and Eric's father, Daren Parsa, are the latest parents in recent months to announce a lawsuit against law enforcement officers who, family members say, responded inappropriately and used excessive force against their children in the middle of a mental episode.\n Deputies responded in January 2020 to a shopping center in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans, as Eric experienced a \"meltdown\" related to his autism, according to the lawsuit and the family's attorneys.\n They handcuffed Eric, shackled his feet and restrained him face down on the pavement of the shopping center's parking lot, putting immense pressure on his back, according to the lawsuit, which calls the use of force \"excessive\" and \"unreasonable.\"\n Over the course of 9 minutes and 6 seconds, deputies failed to put Eric in a \"recovery position\" after subduing him that would have prevented the teenager from suffocating, the lawsuit says.\n The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (JPSO) said the lawsuit contained false and \"malicious accusations\" against the deputies.\n \"This case centers on a severely autistic teenager diagnosed with numerous other mental conditions which caused him to have frequent violent outbursts,\" the statement said, noting Eric attacked and bit his father.\n \"Once deputies arrived, they tried to control the violent teenager's outbursts to prevent him from again attacking his parents and first responders,\" the statement said. \"Deputies allowed the teenager's mother constant access to remain close to her son on the scene so that she could help first responders in defusing her son's violent behavior.\"\n \"While the Sheriff's Office remains deeply saddened over this unfortunate loss of life, it does not intend to allow Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Deputies to be maligned and slandered by those seeking to profit from this unfortunate situation,\" the agency's statement said, in part. \"The Sheriff's Office will timely respond to these matters as requested by the Court.\"\n CNN has reached out to the Jefferson Parish Attorney's Office for comment.\n The lawsuit filed in US District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana also names a number of JPSO sheriff's deputies and the owners of the shopping center where the incident occurred, claiming violations of Eric's and his parents' constitutional rights and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n It seeks unspecified damages, but Lou said she and Eric's father are sharing their story to prevent another family from experiencing what they've gone through.\n \"We bring this lawsuit in hopes that Eric's death would not be in vain,\" she said, \"and no other family would have to go through the same horror.\"\n Eric and his parents were leaving a laser tag facility at the shopping center on January 19, 2020, when Eric began to \"experience a sudden sensory outburst\" related to his autism, the lawsuit says, and began slapping himself and slapping and grabbing his father.\n Due to his limited language skills, \"Eric could have self-injurious and aggressive behaviors when he was frustrated,\" Eric's mother explained in a statement she read at the news conference.\n \"Eric was experiencing a crisis,\" she said.\n The manager of the laser tag business, who was familiar with the family, asked Lou if she would like the manager to call police, and Lou said yes. The shopping center had hired security officers that included JPSO deputies, the lawsuit says.\n An off-duty JPSO reserve deputy received the call from the laser tag manager, who informed him that Eric had autism and was in a \"confrontation\" outside with his father.\n Cameras mounted outside the business captured the incident, showing Eric and his father grappling with each other for several minutes until the first deputy arrived, driving a JPSO SUV.\n The deputy contacted other deputies for assistance in restraining Eric and also contacted EMS, the lawsuit says.\n The video shows Eric, who was obese, slapping his father and the deputy, who got Eric on the ground face down. The deputy -- whom the lawsuit describes as an overweight man -- handcuffed Eric and sat on his back for the next 7 minutes, the lawsuit says. Lou remained on the ground next to Eric, trying to calm him.\n \"Crucially, what the deputy should have done at that point, once things were calm and everything was fine, was they should have taken the weight off of Eric Parsa's back,\" William Most, an attorney for the family, said during the news conference. \"They should have rolled Eric Parsa onto his side to ensure that he could continue breathe. But the deputies did not do so.\"\n Over the next several minutes, six more deputies arrived on the scene. One of them relieved the first deputy, getting on Eric's back and, at one point, putting him in a chokehold, according to the lawsuit. Each of the deputies was aware Eric had special needs, the lawsuit says, but none intervened to move Eric onto his side into a \"recovery position.\"\n \"It wasn't until his body had gone limp and he had urinated on himself that deputies rolled him into 'recovery position,'\" the lawsuit says. \"By then it was too late.\"\n Eric was soon taken by ambulance to a local hospital where he went into cardiac arrest.\n The Jefferson Parish Coroner's Office classified the manner of death as an accident but said a contributing factor was the \"prone positioning\" Eric was in while restrained by deputies, according to the lawsuit.\n Lou said Thursday that Eric \"brought so much joy\" in his 16 years and said the developmental milestones that might be taken for granted in a typical child were what made her and Eric's father so proud.\n At the time of his death, Eric was in high school, working on social and independent life skills.

        "title": "Is Donald Trump's grip on the GOP slipping?",
        "body_text": "In the wake of a mini-rebellion among House Republicans -- 10 of whom sided with Democrats to impeach Donald Trump this week -- there are some signs that the death grip that the President has maintained over the GOP may be slipping.\n Just 6 in 10 Republicans approve of the job Trump is doing in a new Pew Research Center poll released Friday, a major dip from the 77% who felt the same way back in August.\n In fact, Trump's overall decline in job approval -- down to just 29% -- is primarily attributable to his stumbles among his party's base.\n There's other evidence in the Pew poll that suggests Trump's incitement of the crowd gathered at a January 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally -- and the overrunning of the US Capitol that followed -- has, at least temporarily, led previously loyal Republicans to peel away from the President.\n For example, only 10% of Republicans in a November Pew poll said Trump's post-election conduct was \"poor;\" that number doubled to 20% in the most recent Pew survey.\n One more: Less than 6 in 10 -- 57% -- of Republicans say Trump \"should continue to be a major political figure for years to come.\"\n Now, note that I didn't say above that Trump has lost his grip on the Republican Party. Because he has not.\n In that same Pew poll, two-thirds of Republicans (64%) said Trump either \"definitely\" or \"probably\" won the 2020 election. (He did not.) And less than 1 in 5 (18%) of Republicans said Trump deserves \"a lot\" of blame for what happened in the US Capitol on January 6.\n And as The Bulwark's Jonathan V. Last noted on Thursday:\n \"Donald Trump owns this party because he owns its voters. What guys like [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and [House Minority Leader Kevin] McCarthy don't understand is that to the extent that they have any power, they serve at the pleasure of the man who commands their mob. Sorry, I mean 'their voters.'\n \"Never forget that in the modern world: Popular Power > Elite Power\"\n I agree with Last in the main. There's no question that whoever controls the party's base controls the party. And that Trump is more that person than anyone else currently on the scene -- by a lot.\n The only thing I would suggest is that there are some signs of slippage. It's uniquely possible that these Republicans who have hopped off the Trump bandwagon will jump right back on once Joe Biden is president and the events of January 6 are in the rearview mirror.\n It's also possible that until Republicans find someone new, they will continue to linger in their feelings for Trump -- like a relationship that's gone bad but neither person has moved on because they haven't met someone new they like.\n In short: Trump isn't going away. But his influence may be waning just slightly.",

After four years and two impeachments, President Donald Trump is now making plans for his exit from the presidency.\n In what should have been a week littered with legacy-building efforts like interviews and speeches, instead we saw an increasingly isolated President surrounded by a Capitol complex that has been turned into a fortress.\n One week after a violent mob stormed the capitol, US troops quartered in the US Capitol complex. More US troops are now in Washington, DC, than in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined, in response to the deadly insurrection that is turning more disturbing as more details emerge -- and in the face of serious threats in Washington and around the country ahead of Biden's inauguration.\n Where things stand now, President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration won't serve as a completely clean break from Trump's Washington. For starters, the Senate faces juggling an impeachment trial with confirmation of Biden's appointees come January 20.\n This time next week, Biden will helm a nation in the midst of a still-deadly pandemic, increasingly complicated vaccination efforts, a dire economic situation and the worst domestic unrest in at least a generation.

It also doesn't keep logs of who users are calling or messaging. WhatsApp said it can't see a person's shared location and that it doesn't share a user's contacts with Facebook.\n The larger update to the policy impacts people who chat with businesses on WhatsApp. Businesses that use the app to connect with customers can choose to store logs of their conversations on Facebook hosting services.

        "body_text": "Mexico wants the US to vaccinate all Mexican migrant workers currently working in the United States \u2014 and it says Trump's own signature trade deal requires it.\n Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Marcelo Ebrard told reporters this week that under the terms of the recently enacted United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), millions of migrant workers should receive Covid-19 vaccines.\n \"It is a responsibility of each of the two countries to guarantee that all workers, independent of their immigration status, receive the vaccine,\" said Ebrard, referring to both documented and undocumented immigrants.\n The issue came front and center after remarks by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts last week appeared to suggest that undocumented migrant workers in the state's myriad meatpacking plants, would not be eligible to receive the vaccine.\n Ricketts came under fierce and immediate criticism for the remarks, with advocates saying that migrants both documented and undocumented are essential workers, and play an indispensable part in putting food on American tables.\n Ricketts later backed away from the remarks, saying immigration status would not be checked prior to receiving a vaccine. His office did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n Migrants workers are a critical part of industries ranging from agriculture to construction. However, there remains no national US policy of vaccinating migrant workers, as each state sets its own rules.\n As a result, Mexico has not dropped the issue, leading to Ebrard's comments this week where he argued two articles in the USMCA require the US to protect foreign workers from the coronavirus.\n The first is Article 23.3, point 2, which reads in part, \"Each Party shall adopt and maintain statutes and regulations, and practices thereunder, governing acceptable conditions of...occupational safety and health.\"\n He also cited Article 23.8, which holds that all parties must ensure migrant workers are protected under labor laws---whether they are citizens or not.\n The articles cited are vague, though, and experts say if the US doesn't want to do this, it doesn't have to.\n \"There is very little bite in terms of enforcement,\" said Monica de Bolle, a Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.  \"There isn't really any way the Mexicans use what's written in the agreement...to force the US to vaccinate migrant workers.\"\n De Bolle says the USMCA has weaker dispute resolution provisions than its predecessor NAFTA.  Taking such a dispute  to the World Trade Organization is also highly unlikely and would be unprecedented.\n Mexico could stop allowing its nationals to go to the US as migrant workers, potentially crippling numerous crucial supply chains.  However, that is highly unlikely, given the significance of that foreign-earned income so many Mexican families struggling to stay afloat.\n Despite Mexico's lack of recourse, though, Ebrard's claims could signal a short to medium-term strategy.\n \"Mexico know its current position is weak, but perhaps they are hoping the Biden administration will be much more open to that kind of demand than the Trump administration would be,\" said de Bolle.\n Drawing a line in the sand now lets the incoming administration \u2014 which is already expected to be friendlier to immigrants \u2014 know that for Mexico, this is an important issue that should be addressed early on in the new term.\n \"In a country that is currently experiencing an epidemic that is completely out of control, from a labor protections perspective it makes absolute sense that Mexico would demand something like this,\" said de Bolle.\n Reporting contributed by Natalie Gall\u00f3n.",

        "body_text": "US Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman has been hailed as an American hero for leading a growing mob away from the Senate chambers during last week's attack on the Capitol.\n Now, a bipartisan trio of lawmakers wants to recognize Goodman with a Congressional Gold Medal for potentially saving lives on one of the darkest days in US history.\n Democratic Reps. Charlie Crist of Florida and Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, and Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation this week to award Goodman with the medal, reserved for Americans who've made \"distinguished achievements and contributions\" to their country.\n Goodman's contribution was caught on camera. Footage from the insurrection captured by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic shows Goodman being chased up a Capitol staircase by a mob of insurrectionists shortly after they'd broken in. When he reached a landing, he looked to his left, where he noticed the door to the Senate chambers was still unguarded. He then led the rioters to the right, away from lawmakers and toward backup officers.\n The Senate chambers wouldn't be secured until one minute later, according to CNN's timeline of events from the riot.\n \"By putting his own life on the line and successfully, single-handedly leading insurrectionists away from the floor of the Senate Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman performed his duty to protect Congress with distinction, and by his actions, Officer Goodman left an indelible mark on American history,\" the legislation reads.\n The lawmakers said in statements that his actions were life-saving.\n \"When he was the only thing standing between Members of Congress and the violent mob, he quickly and selflessly redirected their fury upon himself so those Members could escape,\" Mace said. \"Thanks to his valor, we are here today.\"\n CNN has reached out to the US Capitol Police for comment and is waiting to hear back. The department hasn't publicly identified Goodman to CNN or other outlets.\n Previous Congressional Gold Medal honorees include the Tuskegee Airmen, the Rev.

        "body_text": "The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n (The Conversation)Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a longtime Republican, has spent the last two months standing up to intense and highly public pressure from members of Congress, who urged him to throw out legally cast ballots, and from President Donald Trump, who asked him to \"find 11,780 votes\" to change the outcome of the election.\n Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois became the first Republican member of Congress to call for Trump's immediate removal from office by the 25th Amendment, following the mob riot at the US Capitol on January 6.\n Dr. Ben Danielson, a well-regarded medical director of a Seattle medical clinic, resigned in November to protest ongoing racism in the hospital, noting concerns about his \"own complicity as a representative of a hospital that does not treat people of color as it should.\"\n All of these people spoke up to call out bad behavior, even in the face of immense pressure to stay silent. Although the specifics of each of these cases are quite different, what each of these people share is a willingness to take action. Psychologists like me describe those who are willing to defend their principles in the face of potentially negative social consequences such as disapproval, ostracism and career setbacks as \"moral rebels.\"\n Moral rebels speak up in all types of situations -- to tell a bully to cut it out, to confront a friend who uses a racist slur, to report a colleague who engages in corporate fraud. What enables someone to call out bad behavior, even if doing so may have costs?\n First, moral rebels generally feel good about themselves. They tend to have high self-esteem and to feel confident about their own judgment, values and ability. They also believe their own views are superior to those of others, and thus that they have a social responsibility to share those beliefs.\n Moral rebels are also less socially inhibited than others. They aren't worried about feeling embarrassed or having an awkward interaction. Perhaps most importantly, they are far less concerned about conforming to the crowd. So, when they have to choose between fitting in and doing the right thing, they will probably choose to do what they see as right.\n Research in neuroscience reveals that people's ability to stand up to social influence is reflected in anatomical differences in the brain. People who are more concerned about fitting in show more gray matter volume in one particular part of the brain, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. This area right behind your eyebrows creates memories of events that led to negative outcomes. It helps guide you away from things you want to avoid the next time around -- such as being rejected by your group.\n People who are more concerned about conforming to their group also show more activity in two other brain circuits; one that responds to social pain -- like when you experience rejection -- and another that tries to understand others' thoughts and feelings. In other words, those who feel worst when excluded by their group try the hardest to fit in.\n What does this suggest about moral rebels? For some people, feeling like you're different than everyone else feels really bad, even at a neurological level. For other people, it may not matter as much, which makes it easier for them to stand up to social pressure.\n These characteristics are totally agnostic as to what the moral rebel is standing up for. You could be the lone anti-abortion voice in your very liberal family or the lone abortion rights advocate in your very conservative family. In either scenario it's about standing up to social pressure to stay silent -- and that pressure of course could be applied about anything.\n What does it take to create a moral rebel?\n It helps to have seen moral courage in action. Many of the civil rights activists who participated in marches and sit-ins in the southern United States in the 1960s had parents who displayed moral courage and civic engagement, as did many of the Germans who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. Watching people you look up to show moral courage can inspire you to do the same.\n A budding moral rebel also needs to feel empathy, imagining the world from someone else's perspective. Spending time with and really getting to know people from different backgrounds helps. White high school students who had more contact with people from different ethnic groups -- in their neighborhood, at school and on sports teams -- have higher levels of empathy and see people from different minority groups in more positive ways.\n These same students are more likely to report taking some action if a classmate uses an ethnic slur, such as by directly challenging that person, supporting the victim or telling a teacher. People who are more empathetic are also more likely to defend someone who is being bullied.\n Finally, moral rebels need particular skills and practice using them. One study found that teenagers who held their own in an argument with their mother, using reasoned arguments instead of whining, pressure or insults, were the most resistant to peer pressure to use drugs or drink alcohol later on. Why? People who have practiced making effective arguments and sticking with them under pressure are better able to use these same techniques with their peers.\n Moral rebels clearly have particular characteristics that enable them to stand up for what's right. But what about the rest of us? Are we doomed to be the silent bystanders who meekly stand by and don't dare call out bad behavior?\n Fortunately, no. It is possible to develop the ability to stand up to social pressure. In other words, anyone can learn to be a moral rebel.\n This is an updated version of an article originally published on June 18, 2020.\n Catherine A.

Sign up here.)\n President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9 trillion proposal to boost the US economy and provide aid to those struggling in the pandemic. Dubbed the American Rescue Plan, it includes beefed-up stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment aid, an eviction moratorium and more assistance for small businesses, states and schools. The detailed plan will be one of the first tests of Biden's power. Conservatives will likely balk at its cost, especially since Biden plans to unveil a follow-up recovery plan that will include billions more in spending. But Biden's more progressive colleagues will likely keep the pressure on for more spending and widespread aid.\n By the time Biden is sworn in as president next week, 400,000 people across the country could be dead from Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts. Some hospital systems are now completely overwhelmed, and health care workers are scrambling to find places to store remains and begging their communities to stay home to stem the influx of patients and the rising death toll. In the UK, hospitals are so packed that nearby hotels are turning floors into Covid-19 recovery wards. The UK has also banned arrivals from some Latin American countries and Portugal following reports of a new coronavirus variant in Brazil.\n \"FBI agents are coming to find you.\" That's the message FBI Director Chris Wray had yesterday for violent Capitol insurrectionists. The Justice Department announced about 10 new charges in connection with last week's riot, including for two people who allegedly hurt police officers and a man who shocked many by carrying a Confederate flag inside the Capitol. Police officers at the scene of the Capitol breach have shared harrowing accounts of the violence. One said rioters grabbed for his weapon and shouted, \"Kill him with his own gun.\" In the aftermath, some members of Congress have said they've gotten threats and fear for their lives. At the Defense Department, longstanding efforts to stamp out extremism among military members have taken on a new urgency after it became clear veterans were involved in last week's violence.\n Another federal death row inmate was executed yesterday after the Supreme Court denied his legal team's last-ditch effort for a stay of execution. Lawyers for Corey Johnson argued he had an intellectual disability and that executing him while he was recovering from Covid-19 would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Johnson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of killing seven people in 1992 as a part of the drug trade in Virginia. As Biden prepares to take office, dozens of members of Congress are pushing to abolish the death penalty in all jurisdictions. Biden himself has pledged to abolish the federal death penalty, which was renewed in practice by the Trump administration. One more person, Dustin Higgs, is scheduled to be executed during Trump's presidency. Higgs' execution is set for today.\n Violent protests erupted in the Belgian capital of Brussels yesterday over the death of a man in police custody. The Brussels prosecutor's office says it has opened an investigation into \"involuntary manslaughter\" after a 23-year-old Black man lost consciousness at a police station shortly after being arrested. He later died at a hospital. The man's cause of death isn't clear. His family was told he had a \"cardiac abnormality\" but that the condition wouldn't be the sole cause of death. Toxicology reports also didn't reveal anything that would explain the death. Some protesters carried Black Lives Matter signs and shouted, \"We want the truth.\" About 100 people were arrested during the demonstrations.\n Henceforth known as THE Jacksonville Jaguars.\n It would be an inspiration for all of those times you encounter an unglamorous problem and think, \"What would Dolly do?\"\n The details don't matter, just give it to us.

North Korea's state-run news agency deemed the missile the \"world's most powerful weapon.\" Leader Kim Jong Un likes to show off or discuss his country's weaponry -- as a show of force or as a threat.\n That's how many Chinese firms the US Defense Department added to a list of companies the agency claims are owned or controlled by China's military.

        "body_text": "Los Angeles County, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in California, is running out of space to store the bodies of Covid-19 victims and officials are working to create more capacity.\n About 900 bodies are currently being held at the Los Angeles Medical Examiner Coroner's Office, which usually has a capacity of 500, according to spokeswoman Sarah Ardalani. She estimates that about 150 of the bodies are overflow from local hospitals that have run out of room.\n Since the initial Covid-19 surge last spring, a dozen refrigerated storage units have been on site at the downtown location, bringing capacity up to 2,000 bodies. A dozen more trailers will be in place by next week, along with six refrigerated containers, Ardalani told CNN.\n National Guard members have been assisting the coroner's office with transporting and storing bodies, but it is not enough. Ardalani said the office is working with the state to bring in more help.\n The number of available ICU beds has also dropped to the lowest level recorded yet, according to data from the California Department of Public Health. This despite indications that hospitalizations are beginning to level off in the state.\n There are currently 1,094 ICU beds available for California's 40 million residents. More than 22,000 people are hospitalized with the virus, and nearly 5,000 of them are in intensive care units.\n However, the positivity rate in California is maintaining a downward trend seen for the past several days and currently stands at 13.4%, compared with 14% last Friday, which marked the highest level seen since widespread testing began.\n About 90% of the state's residents are still under stay-at-home orders as projections show ICU capacity and other factors will remain at critical levels for at least the next four weeks.\n But there is hope.\n L.A.'s Dodger Stadium, which has been a testing site will now become a mass vaccination center. Vaccine administration at the stadium is expected to start Friday, with the capacity to vaccinate about 12,000 people a day when everything is fully up and running, according to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's website.\n \"Vaccines are the surest route to defeating this virus and charting a course to recovery, so the city, county, and our entire team are putting our best resources on the field to get Angelenos vaccinated as quickly, safely, and efficiently as possible,\"Garcetti said.",

        "title": "Why the Senate must confirm Biden's Homeland Security pick on Day 1",
        "body_text": "Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat, is the US representative from Mississippi's 2nd Congressional District and is chairman of the US House Committee on Homeland Security. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nIn nearly 28 years in Congress -- including six spent as chair of the US House Committee on Homeland Security -- I have never experienced a day quite like that which my colleagues and I endured last Wednesday. Having lived through 9/11 and other attacks, most Americans have little difficulty appreciating the threat of foreign terrorism and the need to vigilantly guard against it. But never in our lifetimes has the threat of domestic terrorism struck so close to the bedrock of our nation.\n Given this unprecedented domestic assault, the lingering atmosphere of lawlessness and intimidation in our capital and the credible threat of additional violence directed at our national government and statehouses across the country in the days ahead, it would be an abdication of our most vital responsibility to the American people to further compromise their security and that of our republic in this moment. To ensure Americans' safety and fulfill the oath of office, the US Senate must move quickly to confirm Alejandro Mayorkas to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security.\n The Cuban-born Mayorkas, 61, was among President-elect Joe Biden's first picks for his Cabinet in late November. He is not an unknown commodity, and he is one of the most knowledgeable homeland security experts in the country.\n Under former President Barack Obama, Mayorkas served as both the DHS deputy secretary and the head of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the department. And prior to his time in DHS, he was a US attorney in the Central District of California. In sum, Mayorkas is a deeply experienced leader, hailed by both Democrats and Republicans, who has been previously confirmed by the Senate on three occasions to serve in his previous roles. If confirmed, he'd become the first Latino and immigrant to serve at the helm of DHS.\n As deputy secretary of the agency, he helped lead a successful effort to guard against terror attacks, enhance our nation's cybersecurity and strengthen cooperation between the federal national security apparatus and state and local agencies. That proven record and crisis-tested experience is why Mayorkas has been endorsed by a broad, bipartisan range of former national security officials and law enforcement organizations -- and it's why we need him back on the job today.\n This is no time for delays or political gamesmanship -- not when American lives, and the American way of life, are on the line. By moving swiftly to confirm Mayorkas, Congress can send a clear message to all those who seek to intimidate or inflict violence upon our nation: that they can no longer exploit our political divisions to assault the principles that unite us. Of course, more important than the message is the practical imperative -- it is crucial that we have a highly qualified, capable Homeland Security secretary in place on Day 1 to safeguard our nation and protect us against all manner of threats.\n It's no mystery why nominees to lead our national security agencies are historically given confirmation votes no later than Inauguration Day -- as Obama's and President Donald Trump's Homeland Security nominees were confirmed on January 20 of 2009 and 2017, respectively.\n America's enemies, both foreign and domestic, thrive on and are emboldened by any inkling of chaos, dysfunction or vacuums of vigilant leadership in our security capabilities. Having a qualified, competent secretary of Homeland Security at the helm right away is critical even at times when threats are relatively quiet. Having one at the helm under today's conditions may well be an existential necessity.\n Given the blaring threat of further violence following last week's attack -- to say nothing of ongoing foreign terrorism threats, a pending crisis at our border and the massive cyberattack recently perpetrated by Russia against our government and private sector -- there is simply no excuse to delay a vote on the confirmation of Mayorkas.\n In this vulnerable moment for our nation, having seen the deadly reality of the threat up close, I implore my colleagues in the Senate to come together on behalf of the American people, follow historical practice and confirm our next secretary of Homeland Security as soon as possible.",

        "title": "Biden wrests control of Trump's spotlight and makes first big bet of presidency",
        "body_text": "Joe Biden's crisis presidency effectively began Thursday evening, when he urged Americans to mobilize behind a $1.9 trillion plan to end the pandemic, save the economy and revive the weakened heartbeat of a nation.\n The President-elect's appearance in Wilmington, Delaware, defined a precarious moment in US history as he prepares to confront the most extreme challenges of any new president in 90 years following his inauguration next Wednesday. Making his mission even harder, he will take the oath of office amid soaring fears of violence by pro-Trump extremists, which will mean the National Mall will be empty of its carnival crowds of thousands who traditionally witness the sacred transfer of presidential power.\n \"It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of (a) once in several generations economic crisis, with the once in a generation public health crisis,\" Biden said. \"The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight. There is no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.\"\n Biden's speech represented an attempt to wrest America's attention away from the fulminations of outgoing President Donald Trump and the crazed drama of his self-obsessed final days. It came as Biden and top aides worked with the incoming Democratic leadership in the Senate and top Republicans to try to ensure the constitutional circus of Trump's impeachment trial does not slow Biden's emergency Covid-19 package or the effort to confirm top Cabinet officials needed to help ease the country's misery and secure the homeland.\n Biden's speech did not just allow him to get a jump on his legislative agenda. It also gave him the chance to set out the dire state of the nation he will lead in just five days and to establish a baseline from which to manage the expectations on which he will be judged.\n He, for instance, blasted the current administration's vaccine rollout as a \"dismal failure.\" And he added: \"There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet.\" Such positioning served a rhetorical purpose by providing context before Biden attempts the more inspirational assignment facing new presidents of enlisting a nation to tackle the crises of their time in his inaugural address next week.\n Thursday's televised address was the first glimpse of a new, more traditional and detail-oriented vision of presidential leadership after the zero-strategy chaos of the Trump years. It represented Biden's opening gambit in the duel with Senate Republicans that will define his legislative prospects.\n Conservatives, for instance, are likely to balk at the cost of the program and its expanded aid for state and local jurisdictions that Democrats failed to insert in the previous emergency spending package last year. Those conservatives are unlikely to welcome Biden's pledge to soon unveil a follow-up recovery plan that will include billions more in spending. But such high price tags also represent pressure on Biden from the progressive wing of his party, in a preview of a dynamic that will endure for his entire term.\n Biden's vast plan is also the first test of his power to drive his ambitious agenda through the 50-50 Senate chamber, which will be controlled by Democrats thanks to the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. But the majority may have to resort to controversial procedural measures to give the new president what he wants, which could fracture Biden's hopes of future bipartisan cooperation.\n The President-elect's initiative is packed with extended unemployment benefits, rental assistance, aid to small businesses and $1,400 more in stimulus payments, in addition to the $600 already appropriated. Biden wants billions of new spending to help schools open, $20 billion for a national vaccine plan and $50 billion for expanding coronavirus testing and plans to hire an army of 100,000 public health workers.\n Such aggressive proposals are more than an attempt to fix the poorly planned and woefully executed Trump administration approach to the pandemic, which put the onus on states to stem the spread of the virus. They represent a recognition that the nation's future and the success of his presidency in its crucial first few months depend on urgent action and funding.\n The image of a president summoning the nation to unite behind a government plan, in part to pressure his opponents on Capitol Hill, is familiar from generations of US history. But it was a novel experience after four years in which White House legislative efforts have consisted of orders barked over Twitter and wild reversals of position that infuriated even Trump's allies.\n It's also been a while since a president, or a president-to-be, has demonstrated the ability to empathize with the bereaved -- as Biden did Thursday night -- and made the people's business his primary focus. Trump repeatedly failed at those duties -- even as the nation was engulfed in the worst public health crisis in generations, which has killed at least 387,000 Americans. Trump has been checked out for months, and he is now spending most of his time watching television, nursing his grievances and lashing out over his second, self-inflicted impeachment.\n No new commander in chief since Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 has faced a tougher baptism of crises than Biden. His inheritance dwarfs the alarming scenarios that confronted President Barack Obama, whom he served as vice president, in 2009.\n For many Americans, Biden's new plan for Covid-19 relief could not come quickly enough, as states struggle to get their most critical populations vaccinated -- facing shortages in supplies, health care workers to administer the vaccine and the resources to get doses all the way to the so-called last mile in each state's health care system.\n The Trump administration had promised it would vaccinate some 20 million people by the end of 2020, but so far Operation Warp Speed has been able to get only about 10 million doses out to state and local governments -- falling woefully short on that goal after the federal government essentially dumped the logistical responsibility of distributing those first doses on the states. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that only about 35% of the vaccines distributed to states have been administered.\n Earlier this week, federal health officials abruptly changed course to try to accelerate the pace of vaccine distribution. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that the administration would release the reserved second doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to ramp up the supply available to states in order to vaccinate new patients -- and Azar also said states could expand the universe of people eligible for the vaccine to those 65 and older. (He insisted that the government is 100% committed to ensuring that every American who receives a first dose of the vaccine will get a second dose.)\n Azar argued that states should not wait until one priority group is fully vaccinated before beginning to inoculate the next eligible group. But many states and local officials have said they simply do not have the promised resources needed to get those doses out more expeditiously.\n Biden addressed the lack of a systematic national distribution plan Thursday night -- and the underfunding of states to get the vaccine out and devise education programs to ease concerns among the vaccine-adverse. He said he was asking Congress for some $400 billion to help end the pandemic, with much of that money going toward speeding the delivery of vaccines to anxious Americans.\n \"The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,\" Biden said, noting that he would lay out his vaccination plan on Friday to \"correct course\" and to meet his goal of 100 million shots over his first 100 days.\n \"This is one of the most challenging operational efforts we have ever undertaken as a nation,\" the President-elect said. \"We'll have to move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated; to create more places for them to get vaccinated; to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms; to increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as fast as possible.\"\n \"The very health of our nation is at stake,\" Biden said. \"The more people we vaccinate, the faster we do it, the sooner we can save lives and put this pandemic behind us.\"",

        "body_text": "The government-sanctioned harassment of Martin Luther King Jr. provides the chilling spine of \"MLK/FBI,\" a documentary timed to the annual holiday for the civil rights icon. Director Sam Pollard's film also raises an interesting question -- namely, what historians and journalists owe King's legacy in terms of releasing material amassed specifically in an effort to sully his name.\n Former FBI director James Comey describes J. Edgar Hoover's obsession with King, and his unsettling campaign to discredit him, as \"the darkest part of the bureau's history.\" Determined to uncover communist influence within the civil-rights movement, FBI surveillance revealed a more salacious fact -- that King was unfaithful to his wife, Coretta Scott King, a disclosure that Hoover sought to use as leverage against him.\n Some additional information about the FBI spying on King came out in a document released in 2017. The ugly nature of that hounding included letters threatening exposure and urging him to commit suicide. As one historian notes, Hoover's broader goal was to hobble the movement that King led by \"destroying its figurehead,\" a mission that assumed greater urgency in Hoover's eyes after King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n Pollard explores the complicated relationship between King and President Lyndon Johnson, who were allies in championing civil rights before Johnson soured on King when he took a principled stand against the Vietnam War.\n Former King aide and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young recalls that the movement's leadership \"assumed the rooms were bugged,\" but they couldn't have anticipated the extent to which the FBI employed paid informants in order to spy on them.\n Hoover's vendetta -- stemming from his belief that King was \"morally unfit,\" says historian David Garrow -- offers a troubling portrait of government overreach and wiretapping. Yet the intellectual exercise buried within the film lies in the fact the intelligence gathered is scheduled to become unsealed in 2027, raising issues of how to handle material that is historically significant -- in terms of understanding the full extent of the FBI's transgressions -- and horribly intrusive to King's memory.\n The film is fleshed out with fascinating footage of King in various settings, including appearances on talk shows and receiving his Nobel award. The director juxtaposes that with a study of Hoover and the FBI culture he established, while touching lightly on his biography.\n \"MLK/FBI\" not only offers a compelling portrait of what was, but beyond just looking back, sets up a debate about what will be. In the process, the documentary sheds light on a dark part of US history while leaving viewers to contemplate just how dark its more sordid corners should remain.\n \"MLK/FBI\" premieres in select theaters and on demand on Jan. 15.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday evening outlined a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package, billed the American Rescue Plan, to fund a nationwide vaccination effort and provide more direct economic relief to Americans amid the pandemic, Kate Sullivan and Eric Bradner report.\n The package will allocate more than $400 billion toward addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, including $160 billion in funding to execute a national vaccination program, expand testing and mobilize a public health jobs program, among other measures. Biden unveiled plans for $1,400 stimulus checks for Americans as well as extending and expanding unemployment benefits, including a $400 weekly unemployment insurance supplement, through September.\n Biden did not detail how he plans to move his massive proposal through a Congress where Democrats will have narrow House and Senate majorities. But he has to make a running start.\n At the current rate of daily fatalities, the US death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic could reach 400,000 before he is sworn in next Wednesday. The virus is now killing at a faster rate than at any point in 2020: an average of 3.5 people are getting infected every second, and the five highest daily tallies for new infections and new deaths have all occurred in 2021.\n Infections are so widespread in Los Angeles County that essential workers have been warned to wear masks inside their own homes. Hospitals have reached breaking point, and the coroner's office is running out of space to store the bodies of Covid-19 victims. But there is hope: L.A.'s Dodger Stadium, which has been a testing site, will now become a mass vaccination center. While it may speed up efforts to vaccinate priority groups though, health officials have been hindered by supply shortages.\n Biden blasted the current administration's vaccine rollout as a \"dismal failure.\" And he added: \"There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet.\"\n These are some of the other key parts of Biden's proposal.

The country's health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, said the healthcare system in the hard-hit Amazonian city of Manaus is in \"collapse,\" adding that hundreds of people are waiting for hospital beds.\n Despite Brazil having the second deadliest Covid-19 outbreak in the world -- after the US -- the country's vaccination campaign has yet to begin. Pazuello said immunizations would begin this month, but did not specify a date. This comes as the UK bans arrivals from multiple Latin American countries \"following evidence of a new variant in Brazil,\" British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Thursday. On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch accused President Jair Bolsonaro of sabotaging efforts to stem the outbreak, instead pursuing policies that have undermined human rights.\n Children across the globe have seen their schools closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. 1.6 billion students were out of school during the first peak of the pandemic in April 2020, and almost 700 million remained out as 2020 drew to a close, Laura Smith-Spark writes. It may take years for the full impact of these months of missed schooling to be known, so what can history tell us about the long-term effects of disruptions to education?\n The most striking data came from a paper assessing the long-term education cost of World War II. The authors concluded that \"individuals experienced a sizable earnings loss some 40 years after the war, which can be attributed to the educational loss caused by the conflict.\"\n England's health service is currently staggering under an unprecedented crisis with more coronavirus patients in hospital than at any point in the pandemic.

The number of new skyscrapers built globally dropped more than 20% in 2020, attributed to the slowdown caused by Covid-19, as projects around the world ground to a halt amid restrictions on construction.There is a gap in vaccine confidence in Hispanic age groups. One study found that most Hispanic adults in the US want to be immunized eventually, but Hispanic adults under 50 are twice as likely to say they will \"definitely not get the vaccine.\" Grammy-nominated artist Post Malone is donating 10,000 pairs of his sold-out Duet Max Clog II Crocs to frontline workers at 70 hospitals across the country.Pope Francis and former Pope Benedict received the first doses of Covid-19 vaccine as the Vatican City began its vaccine program in a medical center set-up inside its main Auditorium Hall, where the pontiff often holds his weekly audiences.\n Even before the pandemic, fear of needles had a serious impact.\n Now, as Covid-19 vaccines roll out across the globe, addressing such concerns is essential to public health.

        "body_text": "Groups and individuals spreading lies about the 2020 election and calling to protest the outcome have continued to hide in plain sight on Facebook, even as COO Sheryl Sandberg this week tried to downplay the platform's role in the Capitol riots.\n From altering the names of their online forums to abusing the core features of Facebook's own services, conspiracy theorists have worked to evade content moderators despite the company's vows of a crackdown, new research shows.\n These groups' efforts to remain undetected highlight the sophisticated threat confronting Facebook, despite its insistence the situation has been less of a problem compared to on other platforms. It also raises new concerns that the groups' persistence on these mainstream social networks could spark a new cycle of violence that stretches well into Joe Biden's presidency.\n The latest examples surfaced on Thursday, as extremism experts at the activist group Avaaz identified 90 public and private Facebook groups that have continued to circulate baseless myths about the election, with 166,000 total members.\n Of those, a half-dozen groups appeared to have successfully evaded Facebook's restrictions on \"stop the steal\" content, according to Avaaz. Though many initially had \"stop the steal\" in their names, the groups have since altered their profiles, according to page histories reviewed by CNN Business \u2014 allowing them to blend in with other Facebook activity.\n \"So instead of 'Stop the Steal,' they became 'Stop the Fraud' or 'Stop the Rigged Election' or 'Own the Vote,'\" said Fadi Quran, campaign director at Avaaz.\n In the months since the election, the slogan \"Stop the Steal\" has galvanized Trump supporters, and a leader of the movement has said he worked with Republican lawmakers to plan the rally that preceded the riots at the Capitol. The watchdog group Media Matters has highlighted dozens of posts on Facebook by state Republican Party pages that promoted bus trips to Washington for the Jan. 6 events.\n Some of the Facebook groups Avaaz discovered contained posts mobilizing Trump supporters as well, including a promotional flier for Jan. 6 bearing the banner \"Operation Occupy the Capitol: Taking back our country from corrupt politicians.\"\n Facebook removed three of the groups on Thursday after the company was notified of their activity, spokesman Andy Stone told CNN Business. In a statement, he said the company has banned over 250 white supremacist groups to date and has enforced policies restricting QAnon and militia groups from organizing on Facebook. Facebook has said its broader ban on \"stop the steal\" content will take time to ramp up.\n \"We work with experts in global terrorism and cyber intelligence to identify calls for violence and remove harmful content that could lead to further violence,\" Stone said. \"We are continuing all of these efforts and working with law enforcement to prevent direct threats to public safety.\"\n But the evasion tactics, as illustrated by Avaaz's report Thursday and Facebook's subsequent enforcement, threaten to complicate those efforts.\n Some individuals have taken advantage of the basic design of Facebook products, including using Instagram Stories to spread their content. Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours \u2014 a feature some far-right activists are leveraging to circumvent content moderation, said Quran.\n \"Some of these Instagram accounts have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of followers, and they're inviting people to events such as the insurrection,\" Quran said. \"These actors are extremely sophisticated and innovative in how they weaponize these platforms.\"\n Quran said far-right actors have been witnessed using Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, to communicate, as well.\n There are other signs that opportunistic actors have exploited loopholes in Facebook's advertising systems \u2014 to Facebook's apparent financial benefit and potentially undercutting claims in July by Nick Clegg, Facebook's VP of global affairs, that \"Facebook does not profit from hate.\"\n Although Facebook currently has a ban on political and issue advertising nationwide, those restrictions do not extend to commercial ads. Advertisements promoting body armor, firearm accessories, holsters and other tactical products have recently appeared beside pro-insurrection posts on Facebook, according to researchers.\n The ads appeared in the Facebook feed of a dummy account set up by the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog, and made to resemble that of a far-right sympathizer. TPP used the account to join dozens of groups and pages linked to far-right movements.\n \"Facebook is microtargeting these ads to an account whose only activity involves joining dozens of groups and pages dedicated to militia and the far-right,\" Katie Paul, director of TTP, told CNN Business on Thursday. \"Facebook is sending a message: not only can users spend months violating platform policies to plan violence, Facebook will help users make their insurrection activity more effective while it profits from ads,\" she added.\n BuzzFeed News was first to report the advertising.\n \"We don't allow ads that praise, support or represent militarized social movements and ban ads that promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition, or explosives,\" said Facebook's Stone.\n Asked on Monday whether Facebook could have done more to prevent the riots, COO Sheryl Sandberg mostly disclaimed Facebook's responsibility in the matter.\n \"Our enforcement is never perfect, so I'm sure there were still things on Facebook,\" Sandberg told Reuters in an interview. Then she added: \"I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don't have our abilities to stop hate and don't have our standards and don't have our transparency.\"\n Internally, however, some Facebook employees reportedly questioned whether the company was doing enough as events at the Capitol spiraled out of control. According to the Wall Street Journal, divisions erupted within Facebook on Jan. 6 amid a spike in user reports of violent content.\n As a top executive urged restraint against stifling political speech, one employee protested, saying in a popular internal message that Facebook has been \"fueling this fire for a long time,\" according to the Journal. (Facebook declined to comment to the Journal on internal company deliberations.)\n Avaaz's Quran called Sandberg's deflection \"very dishonest.\"\n \"It indicated that instead of learning the painful lessons of what happened on Jan. 6 and Facebook's role in it, the leadership of the company was seeking to shift the blame away,\" Quran said. \"When she said that, it was like, 'Wow, this is a sign of a real problem, and a reminder why these platforms need to be regulated.'\"",

That's no surprise, given the news that 965,000 people filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week \u2014 the highest level since August.\n \"It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of [a] once-in-several-generations economic crisis, with the once-in-a-generation public health crisis,\" Biden said. \"The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight. There is no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.\"\n He wants Congress to pass a bill that includes:\n Another $1,400 check for eligible Americans, bringing the recent total to $2,000 per personAn extra $400 per week for those who are unemployed, up from the $300 weekly benefit approved in December$25 billion in additional rental assistance and an extension of the federal eviction moratorium$350 billion for state and local governments to maintain vital services$20 billion for a national vaccination program and $50 billion for more coronavirus testing\n Wall Street doesn't expect the full package to survive negotiations. Goldman Sachs political economist Alec Phillips notes that if Biden wants to pass the package by regular order and not via budget reconciliation process, as his team has indicated, he'll need 60 votes in the Senate. That would require 10 Republicans to come on board.\n \"We do not expect ten Republicans to support a $1.9 trillion relief package,\" he said in a note to clients late Thursday.\n Some are already pushing back on the wisdom of mailing out more cash.\n \"History shows such spending does nothing to stimulate the economy. In the end, it only adds to the federal debt,\" John Cogan and John Taylor, two senior fellows at the conservative Hoover Institution, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday.\n Goldman Sachs thinks Biden can still score a roughly $1.1 trillion deal, up from its previous expectation of a package worth $750 billion.\n Yet investors may hold off on cheering the news until they get a better sense of the timeline for turning plans into reality \u2014 and whether corporate tax increases are also on the horizon.\n America's banks have weathered the coronavirus storm better than some expected. But with the US economy buckling again, the next year looks anything but certain.\n Breaking it down: Banks saw shares tumble last spring as investors fretted about a flood of bad loans and rock-bottom interest rates. Since October, though, the KBW Bank Index has jumped 50%, thanks to the IPO boom, huge demand for mortgages and stimulus spending, which has raised hopes that the economy will see an explosion of activity in 2021.\n Can the rally last? That's the big question for investors as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report earnings Friday.\n The results from the latest quarter aren't expected to be great, but Wall Street is prepared to write them off. Instead, much of what happens next will depend on what executives have to say about the outlook.\n \"We still see signs that focusing on earnings results (what happened) is less profitable than what is going to happen (guidance),\" Bank of America analysts told clients in a recent note.\n Watch this space: After a difficult year, banks are eager to start rewarding investors by repurchasing shares again. The Federal Reserve suspended bank buybacks last year but said in December it will allow them to resume.\n With the economy in dire straits, banks will have to strike a careful balance between deploying cash to help shareholders and guarding against ongoing credit risks.\n JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for one, is confident his bank can do this.\n \"We will continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet that allows us to safely deploy capital by investing in and growing our businesses, supporting consumers and businesses, paying a sustainable dividend, and returning any remaining excess capital to shareholders,\" Dimon said in a statement after the bank announced it would launch a $30 billion buyback program in early 2021.\n Banking on a pandemic pet boom, Petco has launched the third IPO in company history \u2014 and investors are lapping it up.\n Details, details: The pet store, which has been around for more than five decades, raised $817 million from investors through its share issue. The stock \u2014 which trades under the ticker symbol \"WOOF,\" naturally \u2014 surged more than 60% in its latest Wall Street debut, giving the company a valuation of $6.45 billion.\n Petco has undergone a makeover since it went private in early 2016 through a leveraged buyout, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports. The company, now known as Petco Health and Wellness, invested heavily in e-commerce and building veterinary and other on-site services aimed at making it a one-stop shop for pet owners.\n \"We are the only retailer that offers all the pet parents' needs in one place,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin told CNN Business.\n But Petco faces heavy competition from the likes of online retailer Chewy, which has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the pandemic. Chewy's shares skyrocketed 210% last year and have kicked off 2021 with another 28% rally. It now has a value of $47.3 billion.\n Both companies are benefiting from an increase in pet adoption during the pandemic. But Chewy's sales are growing much faster \u2014 posing a challenge to Petco as it tries to solidify its place in the market.\n Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, PNC and Wells Fargo report earnings before US markets open.\n Also today: US retail sales and industrial production data for December arrives at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n Coming next week: Earnings season gets into full swing as Bank of America (BAC), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), United Airlines (UAL), Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM) share results.",

        "body_text": "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville has an idea about how to make next week's inauguration as safe as possible: Just move it to a few weeks later!\n \"We probably could have had a swearing-in and done an inauguration later after we got this virus behind us a little bit,\" Tuberville suggested in an interview with a local TV station. \"Again, we're talking about Washington, DC.\"\n Er, so, this is awkward, senator, but the whole Inauguration Day thing isn't, um, movable?\n See, there's this document called the Constitution -- it's kind of a big deal -- which makes very, very clear that the transfer of presidential power has to happen on January 20 at noon. It's all right there in section I of the 20th Amendment; \"The terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January.\" It was ratified by the states in 1933. Which was 88 years ago.\n When asked to clarify what the senator meant, Tuberville spokeswoman Ryann Durant said Friday, \"It's incorrect to interpret the senator's comments as calling for the postponement the actual act of swearing-in President-elect Biden. The senator spent the last two days visiting with Alabama medical care providers to receive updates on the ongoing pandemic. Understanding the widely recognized health and safety concerns regarding large gatherings, the senator was suggesting the public gathering for inaugural ceremonies could be reconsidered. As the Senator has previously said, President-elect Biden will take over next week.\"\n Which feels to me a lot like Tuberville trying to fix a mess he made -- long after the fact and only when it drew national attention.\n And keep in mind that this isn't the first time that Tuberville, who beat Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November, has shown a, um, lack of familiarity with the Constitution.\n In an interview with the Alabama Daily News conducted shortly after his victory, Tuberville expounded on how he thinks the government operates.\n \"Our government wasn't set up for one group to have all three branches of government \u2014 wasn't set up that way,\" Tuberville said, adding: \"You know, the House, the Senate, and the executive.\"\n So, a few things. First, the three branches of government are the executive, the legislative and the judicial. Second, the judicial branch isn't a partisan body where Republicans and Democrats fight for control.\n (In that same interview, Tuberville said his father fought in World War II \"to free Europe of socialism,\" which [checks history book] was not what World War II was a fight against.)\n Now, there's no requirement that you have to know the ins and outs (or even the basics) of the Constitution in order to hold an office. But one might also reasonably conclude that if you did happen to be elected to the United States Senate, you would want to buff up any weak(er) spots in your knowledge about the country's fundamental governing document.\n Not so apparently with Tuberville, who came to the Senate having never run for any elected office before -- his formative professional experience was as the head coach of the Auburn football team -- and whose first two votes in Congress were to object to the Electoral College counts in Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n Tuberville regularly touted his lack of political experience on the campaign trail as evidence he wasn't beholden to the permanent political class in Washington. \"I'm tired of seeing the kickbacks and the swamp,\" he told an audience in 2019. \"This is not an ego trip. I have money in the bank. I want this job.\"\n An editorial published in in the Anniston Star published shortly after Tuberville's win seems prophetic now as he struggles to grasp the basics of how the government works.\n \"Good luck in Washington, coach,\" read the piece. \"Getting acclimated to the issues will be tougher than going 7-3 against the Alabama Crimson Tide, as you did in your tenure at Auburn. And we know how hard that was.\"\n Uh, yeah.\n UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional comments from Tuberville's office and to reflect that his quote, as initially reported by the TV station, was missing the words \"done an.\"",

        "body_text": "The incoming Biden administration appointed a dozen communications staffers on Friday, including deputy press secretary and chief photographer.\n The appointments round out the White House press shop, communications offices and digital strategy teams, following several weeks of other announcements.\n TJ Ducklo, who was national press secretary for Biden's campaign during the general election, will be the White House's deputy press secretary, joining press secretary Jen Psaki and principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n Adam Schultz will be Biden's chief official White House photographer, a role that has gained more prominence in the social media age. Schultz was the lead photographer for Biden's campaign. Pete Souza was Barack Obama's chief photographer and Shealah Craighead currently serves in the same role for President Donald Trump.\n Additionally, Anita Dunn will join the administration as a senior adviser to the president. Dunn was Barack Obama's White House communications director in 2009 and was more recently a senior adviser to Biden's campaign. Axios, which first reported her appointment, said Dunn will \"work closely\" with communications director Kate Bedingfield and Psaki.\n Drew Heskett will be the presidential videographer, a role that was first established during the Obama presidency. Eric Bravo will be video editor.\n Matthew Hill, currently the senior spokesperson for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, will be senior associate communications director, joining Bedingfield. Khanya Brann will be senior communications assistant in Bedingfield's office.\n Rykia Dorsey Craig, Seth Schuster and Ike Hajinazarian will be regional communications directors. Todd Zubatkin and Terry Moynihan will be deputy directors for research.\n President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have consistently offered a contrast to the outgoing presidency's mendacity by speaking of the need to tell the truth clearly to the public.\n \"Speaking honestly, with empathy and directly to the public about our administration will be among the key pillars in this Presidency and White House,\" Biden said in a statement about Friday's appointments.\n Harris also spoke of the need \"to communicate clearly and honestly with the American people\" in her own statement.",

        "body_text": "\"WandaVision,\" Marvel Studios' first original series for Disney+, hits streaming this weekend. That's excellent news for Disney+, considering that Marvel is the company's mightiest brand. And it's bad news for Disney's rivals, since the new service has notched 86 million subscribers, even without an exclusive original series from Hollywood's biggest blockbuster franchise.\n Sure, Disney+ has a treasure trove of beloved content from its brands, including Disney Animation and Pixar, as well as one of the biggest blockbuster series in streaming with \"The Mandalorian\" from Star Wars. Yet, Disney+ hasn't really had the deepest bench for new and exclusive content since it launched in 2019.\n That changes this weekend with the arrival of \"WandaVision\" \u2014 a series that could make the mighty Disney+ mightier still.\n \"There are millions of Disney+ subscribers that spend $50 to $80 a year just for eight weeks of 'The Mandalorian.' If Disney can get its Marvel series slate right, those customers should be willing to pay a lot more for Disney+ in the coming years,\" Matthew Ball, a former Amazon (AMZN) Studios executive, told CNN Business.\n \"Marvel Studios is the most successful entertainment franchise in history,\" Ball said. \"Even Cicero would need an hour to extoll the Marvel Cinematic Universe's achievements and popularity.\"\n Case in point: Marvel has brought in more than $22.6 billion at the worldwide box office since 2008, according to Comscore (SCOR). That includes the biggest blockbuster of all time, 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" which made more than $2.7 billion. In a rapidly-evolving Hollywood, one constant over the last decade is that viewers love Marvel.\n \"WandaVision\" \u2014 which follows the exploits of superheroes Scarlet Witch and Vision as they seemingly enjoy suburban life \u2014 may also get more attention since it arrives as several Marvel movies have been shelved, along with most feature films, because of the pandemic. Disney is hoping that the fervent love for the brand translates from box office success to small screen subscriptions.\n Ball is bullish that it will. \"With more than 50 hours of connected stories, the MCU is already a series,\" he said. \"Even if there were a reason to doubt the MCU's ability to work as a serialized subscription video-on-demand series, [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige has 13 years of proving skeptics wrong.\"\n Marvel superheroes have already shown that they can find an audience on streaming. Characters such as Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage all had their own hit Netflix (NFLX) series before Marvel Television was shut down in 2019 and folded into Marvel Studios.\n While \"WandaVision\" is Disney+'s first series from Marvel Studios, it won't be the last. Disney (DIS) plans to release \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" \"She-Hulk,\" and \"Hawkeye,\" among a slew of others.\n Zak Shaikh, vice president of entertainment at media firm Magid, believes that the arrival of \"WandaVision\" is ultimately \"delivering on the promise of a Disney+ subscription.\"\n \"With feature films going through an especially tough time, it helps the overall Disney+ proposition to have Marvel generating content on their end of the platform,\" he told CNN Business. \"A series also helps the world-building, because there is more time to explore different facets of the Marvel Universe than the two hours of a movie.\"\n But now with more Marvel series heading to Disney+ and new films such as \"Black Widow\" and \"Eternals\" set to hit theaters this year, will the blockbuster brand become diluted?\n Not likely, according to Ball.\n \"Saturation and overly complex storytelling is always a risk, but thus far, more content has helped the MCU become a better, more popular and more beloved franchise,\" he said. \"In success, its TV series \u2014 especially those that allow it to further diversify its characters and narratives \u2014 should do the same.\"",

        "title": "How will school closures affect children in the long run? Wars, disease and natural disasters offer clues",
        "body_text": "Children across the globe have seen their schools closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n According to the World Bank, 1.6 billion students were out of school during the first peak of the pandemic in April 2020, and almost 700 million remained out as 2020 drew to a close.\n It may take years for the full impact of these months of missed schooling to be known, so what can history tell us about the long-term effects of disruptions to education?\n Nothing can be directly compared to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, said Alberto Posso, professor of economics at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, but some parallels can be drawn. \"As far as learning from history goes, I think the value is in the potential warning signs these things can give us,\" he said.\n Posso looked at examples including the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, teacher strikes in Argentina in the 1980s and World War II in a piece for The Conversation.\n Perhaps the most striking data came from a paper assessing the long-term education cost of World War II for children who were 10 years old during the conflict in Germany and Austria -- both participants in the war -- and comparable children in Switzerland and Sweden, countries that remained officially neutral.\n The authors of the 2004 paper, Andrea Ichino and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer, concluded that \"individuals experienced a sizable earnings loss some 40 years after the war, which can be attributed to the educational loss caused by the conflict.\"\n \"Austrian children missed around 20% of classes during the war and their earnings dropped by around 3%. German children lost around 25% of classes and had earnings dropped by around 5%,\" Posso told CNN, citing their findings.\n More recent insights can be drawn from the experience of children whose education was disrupted in the early 1990s by the Bosnian War -- with the obvious caveat that life during conflict is very different to life during a peacetime pandemic.\n Arnesa Buljusmic-Kustura, who was born in Sarajevo, was about four years old when the nearly four-year siege of the city began. She should have been starting kindergarten. Instead, she and her family were left sheltering in a basement with their neighbors.\n \"The war and genocide in Bosnia was taking place and for us in the city that really meant that we were completely cut off from the rest of the world,\" said Buljusmic-Kustura, 32, now a writer, researcher working on genocide education, and the deputy director of Remembering Srebrenica UK.\n \"We had no electricity, no water, really limited access to food and obviously we were subjected to daily bombing and shelling, as well as ongoing sniper attacks that were really targeting civilians and even children. So going to school was really unsafe,\" she told CNN.\n Instead, the adults took it in turns to distract the children from the situation, with a story or by practicing letters, Buljusmic-Kustura said. \"We didn't have formal schooling. What we did have was a community that came together and tried to engage us on a very different level.\"\n When peace came, Buljusmic-Kustura was able finally to attend the school five minutes' walk from her home. By that time she was seven-and-a-half years old, and about two years late starting first grade.\n In some parts of the city, impromptu classes had been held under cover for mostly older children as the siege went on, she said.\n Many, though, were in the same position as Buljusmic-Kustura. \"That first day of school I remember not being able to read or write or do those very basic things -- but neither did anyone else,\" she said.\n \"Because everybody had sort of experienced the same thing, there was a huge amount of understanding and a lack of this kind of competition that you now see. Because when you come from a place where you have experienced collectively something horrible, [people think] how do we rebuild our lives and how do we move forward?\"\n Buljusmic-Kustura moved to the United States as a refugee at the age of 12. She had to learn English from scratch but, after a few rocky months, she caught up with her peers, became a \"straight-A student\" and continued into further education.\n She relocated to London from Chicago at the end of April 2019 and has since seen the education of her daughter disrupted by both the move and the pandemic.\n Like many countries in Europe, the UK closed its schools to most children in March. They reopened from September to December but have since closed again, except for vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers, as the country endures its third national lockdown.\n Adi Jovovic, now 35, was also living in the heart of Sarajevo during the siege. \"When the war started I should have started first grade. I didn't go to school at all for a little while,\" he said.\n Eventually, Jovovic -- whose father worked with CNN reporting teams as a driver during the war -- started going to an informal \"school\" with adults who tried to step in as teachers.\n \"One day there would be grenades and bombs going off, so school would be canceled or we wouldn't go for a while, so it was really, really inconsistent -- similar to what kids are going through now, I guess, but even more inconsistent,\" he said. \"I'll be honest with you, I didn't learn anything in that time.\"\n Jovovic and his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, in March of 1994, when he was nine. He started in second grade at a school for children with English as a second language, attended summer school, focused on learning English, and by the end of third grade was ready to move to a regular school.\n Thanks in part to tutoring and a rigorous college prep school curriculum, Jovovic went on to high school and then to the University of Florida, gaining first an undergraduate degree and then a master's degree in chemical engineering. He now lives in Valdosta, Georgia, and is vice president of operations for a pecan processing facility.\n \"I still don't read and write Bosnian well, which is obviously a shame,\" he said. Jovovic blames the early disruption to his education for that lack of facility in a language he speaks fluently.\n \"Not having that fundamental education ... probably set me back a little bit. Now, ultimately I was able to catch up here but it's tough and I certainly feel for the kids who are going through it right now,\" he said.\n \"Virtual is nice but it's not the same as being in school. There's the social aspect of it they are not getting, which I argue is as important as the academia.\"\n Posso, the economics professor, agrees the impact of school closures has been lessened where children can access remote lessons using technology like Zoom. But where social inequalities already exist, the pandemic is making them worse, he said.\n \"Even within the UK there's going to be some segments of society [where] a lot of the poorer kids may not have access to good internet, a computer or educated parents who can help out with the home schooling. And as a result they can be quite disadvantaged,\" said Posso.\n \"The distinction is not going to be as clear as German versus Swiss kids, but within the UK I think we might see differences that maybe highlight existing social structures that are already unequal -- in other words, making inequality worse in the future.\"\n The situation in lower- and middle-income countries where child labor is more prevalent is even more concerning, he said.\n If parents lose their job because of the pandemic, students whose schools close may feel pressure to look for work and leave education altogether, said Posso. \"We already see a big jump in child labor when kids are around 14 or so. If you close schools, it's going to make it very difficult for many children to go back.\"\n Recent history suggests school closures can also have a particularly negative impact on girls, Posso said, especially those from poorer families and communities where girls' rights to education are less entrenched.\n During the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, West Africa, schools were closed and few children were able to access remote learning.\n A subsequent United Nations Development Programme report into the epidemic found that \"gender gaps in education have widened with school closures and because of girls' increased dropout rates, owing to teenage pregnancies and early marriages.\"\n With more people at home because of the pandemic, girls may also be expected to stay out of school in order to take on more household chores, said Posso.\n The World Bank warned last month that the pandemic risks pushing tens of millions more children worldwide into \"learning poverty\" -- meaning that they are unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10 -- with potentially lifelong effects on their earnings.\n Faced with this unprecedented situation, teachers and education leaders around the world should take action now to try to ease the effects of school closures when children return, said Michelle Kaffenberger, a research fellow on the RISE Programme at the University of Oxford.\n Her simulations indicate that a three-month school closure could reduce long-term learning by a full year's worth of learning.\n But if education leaders and teachers take steps to tailor learning to where the children are, rather than picking up where they ought to be, and focus on foundational skills in maths and reading, the impact can be lessened or even overturned, Kaffenberger told CNN.\n \"The crisis doesn't end when schools reopen,\" she said. \"The crisis is going to keep going, if adequate remediation is not taken when children come back.\"\n Kaffenberger cites research into the impact on schooling of the devastating 2005 earthquake in Pakistani-administered Kashmir as evidence. A study by Tahir Andrabi, Benjamin Daniels and Jishnu Das, published last May, uses survey data collected in 2009 to compare households close to the fault line with similar households that were not affected by the quake.\n \"Schools in the affected area were closed for an average of 14 weeks, a little more than three months. However, four years later children in the affected areas were not just three months behind, they were the learning equivalent of 1.5 years of schooling behind,\" Kaffenberger wrote in her own paper.\n Households affected by the quake received financial compensation, the paper's authors said, and the data did not indicate higher drop-out rates. But independently measured test scores provide \"evidence across the entire age range that persistent developmental deficits can arise in young children due to a large, albeit 'temporary,' shock,\" they concluded.\n Catching up whole cohorts of children will be really hard, said Kaffenberger, but existing programs in lower and middle income countries show that the approach she espouses does work.\n Buljusmic-Kustura sounds an optimistic note. Most of her classmates -- particularly among the refugee diaspora but also those who remained in Bosnia and Herzegovina -- managed to complete their schooling successfully and are doing well in life, despite their traumatic early childhood, she said.\n And while she was initially \"immensely concerned\" for her daughter, now nine, as UK schools closed, Buljusmic-Kustura has since been encouraged by seeing her keep in touch with classmates online and engage well with home schooling.\n Last week, she posted words of encouragement on Twitter for worried parents in the UK, saying the \"kids will be fine\" and will likely catch up on lost learning, given the right emotional and mental support.\n \"My education, my learning, even though it stopped, even though there was these huge impediments, there were times I couldn't go to school at all  ... it didn't prevent me from continuing to learn, and continuing to get my education and catching up,\" she said.",

        "body_text": "US retail sales dropped last month, the Commerce Department said Friday, marking the third straight month without any growth.\n America's economic recovery took a hit in the final months of 2020, and the retail sector hasn't been spared. Rising Covid-19 infections and renewed lockdown measures, as well as job losses, have weighed on consumer spending and were a drag on retail sales. The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since April.\n The pandemic has forced consumer to shop more online. But not even e-commerce was spared from the December dip, falling 5.8% from the prior month. Compared with the same period a year ago, however, online sales are still up more than 19%.\n Otherwise, the December declines were broad based: electronics and appliance stores saw sales decline 4.9% from the previous month, sporting goods' retailers fell 0.8%, and furniture and home furnishing stores registered a decline of 0.6%.\n \"The further slump in retail sales in December confirms that the continued surge in coronavirus infections is now weighing heavily on the economy,\" Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients Friday.\n Despite the recent pullback in consumer spending, retail sales were still up 2.9% in December from the same time last year.\n Some retailers have already reported holiday sales, and the results across the sector have been mixed, highlighting the wide gap between retail's winners and losers in the pandemic.\n Target (TGT) said sales grew 17.2% in November and December compared with last year. But others struggled, such as Victoria's Secret parent L Brands. L Brands' (LB) sales dropped 7% in November and December compared with the same time last year, the company said.\n The weak retail sales performance doesn't bode well for consumer spending, which is vital to the US economy. Economists are worried that the weak end to 2020 will make for a sluggish start to the new year. For gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic growth -- this could mean less growth than hoped for in the first quarter.\n The second pandemic stimulus package signed at the end of last month should help retail sales recover in January and throughout the first quarter of 2021, economists at Morgan Stanley projected in a research report this week. But the turn of the year alone won't be enough to make people shop and stimulate the economy.\n The University of Michigan's first look at January consumer sentiment was slightly below economists' expectations Friday morning, with the pandemic, including mental and physical health repercussions, top of mind.\n President-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, however, which includes additional direct checks for certain Americans, should also help give spending a boost.",

But if you've been waking up at 7 a.m. every day for the past 20 years, just the act of awakening an hour earlier is going to be a struggle \u2014 never mind also getting yourself to workout. I'm not saying it's impossible. However, let's be realistic about the difficulty level of resolutions we set in the context of our ingrained habits.\n Rather than resolving to make changes that knowingly create significant lifestyle disruptions, we can make nondisruptive enhancements to our unhealthy habits and leverage our existing healthy habits.\n For instance, if you're a daily coffee drinker who uses cream and sugar, could you decrease the amount you use, or try replacing the cream or sugar with a healthier alternative? Ten years ago, I replaced a teaspoon of sugar in my coffee with a sprinkle of antioxidant-rich cinnamon and never looked back. Averaging two cups of coffee a day, that means I've avoided ingesting 7,300 teaspoons of sugar over the last decade! That's a small change with a big long-term return.\n You can also make nondisruptive habit changes with habit stacking, a practice that involves adding a new healthy habit right before, during or directly after one of the ingrained habits you automatically do daily, like brushing your teeth or showering.\n I do 50 body-weight squats while brushing my teeth twice daily and do 10 push-ups right before I get in the shower. That's 700 squats and 70 push-ups weekly. It doesn't seem like much daily, but it definitely adds up. Could you add a boost of exercise to one of your existing daily habits?\n There is a tendency with resolutions to focus on fixing what we feel we're doing wrong, like \"not exercising enough\" or \"eating too many snacks.\" But when we look at what we're already doing right and strive to do more of it, that change in perspective can accomplish the same goal in a much more positive and sustainable way.\n Think about how often you take a walk. Maybe you already have a daily walking habit either by yourself or walking your dog. Could you extend your walking time by a few minutes? Those extra minutes will add up.\n Maybe you don't have a regular walking habit. That's OK. Think about any of the necessary times each day you have to walk a distance and get creative about ways to extend it. This could be as simple as taking a parking spot further from your office, if you drive to work. Or maybe there is a flight of stairs in your home or office. What if at least once per day, you doubled back and did the stairs twice? Remember, don't discount the value of making small changes; they add up to bigger returns over time.\n How's your water intake?\n Drinking water is important for our overall health and can also increase feelings of fullness to help us avoid unplanned snacking. I'm sure you're already drinking some, but could you increase it? It's recommended that women drink 72 ounces of water daily; men should drink 100 ounces. Consider the suggestion from the previous tip and swap out another not-as-healthy beverage you already drink daily to increase your water intake.\n It's easy to let things slide when no one else is watching. But when we track our activity, we're taking an extra step in personal accountability that makes us feel like \"someone\" is watching. Whether it's a smartphone app, watch, ring or even just a notebook, it tends to embody a bit of our conscience.\n Accountability is arguably one of the most significant factors in ensuring you stick to your health and fitness resolutions. That's why fitness trackers are so effective. In fact, people walk almost an extra mile per day when using an activity tracker on their phone or watch, according to a recent study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n In addition to the accountability factor, fitness trackers also take advantage of our competitive nature by inciting us to do more. When my Apple Watch sends me a message saying \"you can still make it happen,\" it motivates me to make whatever happen that my watch is telling me I haven't done yet, like reaching 10,000 steps or spending more time standing. And that's not just me \u2014 the BJSM study authors found that the participants in the study did better when their fitness trackers provided prompts.\n Regardless of how you track your fitness \u2014 using a wearable technology, an app on your phone or simply keeping a journal \u2014 it will inevitably help keep your health and fitness resolutions on track.\n If you have the funds to do so, making a resolution that involves investing in a way to increase your health and fitness is arguably one of the easiest ways to make a sustainable resolution. Of course, like any other resolution, it's only sustainable if your purchase realistically fits your lifestyle and doesn't require an overly ambitious commitment.\n There are far too many people with a cardio machine in the back corner of their bedroom that now serves as an oversize, expensive clothes hanger. Purchasing a piece of exercise equipment doesn't guarantee you'll use it. It's wisest to only make those purchases when you've already proven your commitment to that level and type of exercise outside of your home.\n The purchases that I suggest elicit easy-to-sustain changes because they require little to no additional effort, as they are making activities that you already do healthier and more beneficial.\n Now that you're armed with the knowledge and strategies to restructure your health and fitness resolutions for long-term success, it's time to let go of the impractical \"new year, new you\" mantra.\n Let's replace it with something more appropriate and go with this: \"simple sustainable steps for a happier, healthier you.\"\n Dana Santas, known as the \"Mobility Maker,\" is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book \"Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.\"",

        "title": "CVS and Walgreens under fire for slow pace of vaccination in nursing homes",
        "body_text": "(KHN)The effort to vaccinate some of the country's most vulnerable residents against Covid-19 has been slowed by a federal program that sends retail pharmacists into nursing homes \u2014 accompanied by layers of bureaucracy and logistical snafus.\n As of Thursday, more than 4.7 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid vaccines had been allocated to the federal pharmacy partnership, which has deputized pharmacy teams from Walgreens and CVS to vaccinate nursing home residents and workers. Since the program started in some states on Dec. 21, however, they have administered about one-quarter of the doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Across the country, some nursing home directors and health care officials say the partnership is actually hampering the vaccination process by imposing paperwork and cumbersome corporate policies on facilities that are thinly staffed and reeling from the devastating effects of coronavirus. They argue that nursing homes are unique medical facilities that would be better served by medical workers who already understand how they operate.\n Mississippi's state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said the partnership \"has been a fiasco.\"\n The state has committed 90,000 vaccine doses to the effort, but the pharmacies had administered only 5% of those shots as of Thursday, Dobbs said. Pharmacy officials told him they're having trouble finding enough people to staff the program.\n Dobbs pointed to neighboring Alabama and Louisiana, which he says are vaccinating long-term care residents at four times the rate of Mississippi's.\n \"We're getting a lot of angry people because it's going so slowly, and we're unhappy too,\" he said.\n Many of the nursing homes that have successfully vaccinated willing residents and staff members are doing so without federal help.\n For instance, Los Angeles Jewish Home, with roughly 1,650 staff members and 1,100 residents on four campuses, started vaccinating Dec. 30. By Jan. 11, the home's medical staff had administered its 1,640th dose. Even the facility's chief medical director, Noah Marco, helped vaccinate.\n The home is located in Los Angeles County, which declined to participate in the CVS/Walgreens program. Instead, it has tasked nursing homes with administering vaccines themselves, and is using only Moderna's easier-to-handle product, which doesn't need to be stored at ultracold temperatures, like the Pfizer vaccine. (Both vaccines require two doses to offer full protection, spaced 21 to 28 days apart.)\n By contrast, Mariner Health Central, which operates 20 nursing homes in California, is relying on the federal partnership for its homes outside of LA County. One of them won't be getting its first doses until next week.\n \"It's been so much worse than anybody expected,\" said the chain's chief medical officer, Dr. Karl Steinberg. \"That light at the end of the tunnel is dim.\"\n Nursing homes have experienced some of the worst outbreaks of the pandemic. Though they house fewer than 1% of the nation's population, nursing homes have accounted for 37% of deaths, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n Facilities participating in the federal partnership typically schedule three vaccine clinics over the course of nine to 12 weeks. Ideally, those who are eligible and want a vaccine will get the first dose at the first clinic and the second dose three to four weeks later. The third clinic is considered a makeup day for anyone who missed the others. Before administering the vaccines, the pharmacies require the nursing homes to obtain consent from residents and staffers.\n Despite the complaints of a slow rollout, CVS and Walgreens said they're on track to finish giving the first doses by Jan. 25, as promised.\n \"Everything has gone as planned, save for a few instances where we've been challenged or had difficulties making contact with long-term care facilities to schedule clinics,\" said Joe Goode, a spokesperson for CVS Health.\n Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, acknowledged some delays through the partnership, but said that's to be expected because this kind of effort has never before been attempted.\n \"There's a feeling they'll get up to speed with it and it will be helpful, as health departments are pretty overstretched,\" Plescia said.\n But any delay puts lives at risk, said Dr. Michael Wasserman, the immediate past president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.\n \"I'm about to go nuclear on this,\" he said. \"There should never be an excuse about people not getting vaccinated. There's no excuse for delays.\"\n Nursing homes are equipped with resources that could have helped the vaccination effort \u2014 but often aren't being used.\n Most already work with specialized pharmacists who understand the needs of nursing homes and administer medications and yearly vaccinations. These pharmacists know the patients and their medical histories, and are familiar with the apparatus of nursing homes, said Linda Taetz, chief compliance officer for Mariner Health Central.\n \"It's not that they aren't capable,\" Taetz said of the retail pharmacists. \"They just aren't embedded in our buildings.\"\n If a facility participates in the federal program, it can't use these or any other pharmacists or staffers to vaccinate, said Nicole Howell, executive director for Ombudsman Services of Contra Costa, Solano and Alameda counties.\n But many nursing homes would like the flexibility to do so because they believe it would speed the process, help build trust and get more people to say yes to the vaccine, she said.\n Howell pointed to West Virginia, which relied primarily on local, independent pharmacies instead of the federal program to vaccinate its nursing home residents.\n The state opted against the partnership largely because CVS/Walgreens would have taken weeks to begin shots and Republican Gov. Jim Justice wanted them to start immediately, said Marty Wright, CEO of the West Virginia Health Care Association, which represents the state's long-term care facilities.\n The bulk of the work is being done by more than 60 pharmacies, giving the state greater control over how the doses were distributed, Wright said. The pharmacies were joined by Walgreens in the second week, he said, though not as part of the federal partnership.\n \"We had more interest from local pharmacies than facilities we could partner them up with,\" Wright said. Preliminary estimates show that more than 80% of residents and 60% of staffers in more than 200 homes got a first dose by the end of December, he said.\n Goode from CVS said his company's participation in the program is being led by its long-term care division, which has deep experience with nursing homes. He noted that tens of thousands of nursing homes \u2014 about 85% nationally, according to the CDC \u2014 have found that reassuring enough to participate.\n \"That underscores the trust the long-term care community has in CVS and Walgreens,\" he said.\n Vaccine recipients don't pay anything out-of-pocket for the shots. The costs of purchasing and administering them are covered by the federal government and health insurance, which means CVS and Walgreens stand to make a lot of money: Medicare is reimbursing $16.94 for the first shot and $28.39 for the second.\n Technically, federal law doesn't require nursing homes to obtain written consent for vaccinations.\n But CVS and Walgreens require them to get verbal or written consent from residents or family members, which must be documented on forms supplied by the pharmacies.\n Goode said consent hasn't been an impediment so far, but many people on the ground disagree. The requirements have slowed the process as nursing homes collect paper forms and Medicare numbers from residents, said Tracy Greene Mintz, a social worker who owns Senior Care Training, which trains and deploys social workers in more than 100 facilities around California.\n In some cases, social workers have mailed paper consent forms to families and waited to get them back, she said.\n \"The facilities are busy trying to keep residents alive,\" Greene Mintz said. \"If you want to get paid from Medicare, do your own paperwork,\" she suggested to CVS and Walgreens.\n Scheduling has also been a challenge for some nursing homes, partly because people who are actively sick with Covid shouldn't be vaccinated, the CDC advises.\n \"If something comes up, say, an entire building becomes Covid-positive, you don't want the pharmacists coming because nobody is going to get the vaccine,\" said Taetz of Mariner Health.\n Both pharmacy companies say they work with facilities to reschedule when necessary. That happened at Windsor Chico Creek Care and Rehabilitation in Chico, California, where a clinic was pushed back a day because the facility was awaiting Covid test results for residents. Melissa Cabrera, who manages the facility's infection control, described the process as streamlined and professional.\n In Illinois, about 12,000 of the state's roughly 55,000 nursing home residents had received their first dose by Sunday, mostly through the CVS/Walgreens partnership, said Matt Hartman, executive director of the Illinois Health Care Association.\n While Hartman hopes the pharmacies will finish administering the first round by the end of the month, he noted that there's a lot of \"headache\" around scheduling the clinics, especially when homes have outbreaks.\n \"Are we happy that we haven't gotten through round one and West Virginia is done?\" he asked. \"Absolutely not.\"\n KHN correspondent Rachana Pradhan contributed to this report.This story was produced by KHN (Kaiser Health News), which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.

        "body_text": "Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday declared the presidency was no job for a woman because of their emotional differences to men, and dismissed speculation his daughter would succeed him next year.\n \"My daughter is not running. I have told Inday not to run because I pity (her) knowing she will have to go through what I am going through,\" Duterte said at the launch of a highway project, referring to his daughter Sara by her nickname.\n \"This is not for women. You know, the emotional setup of a woman and a man is totally different. You will become a fool here. So... that is the sad story.\"\n The Philippines has had two female presidents, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Corazon Aquino.\n Duterte, 75, is notorious for comments often deemed offensive, sexist and misogynistic, but his office typically calls his remarks harmless jokes. He remains hugely popular among female voters in the Philippines.\n Daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio, 42, who succeeded him as mayor of Davao City, came top in a recent opinion poll that asked the public to choose a preferred candidate from a list of possible contenders for the 2022 elections. Two other women, Vice President Leni Robredo and Senator Grace Poe, were hypothetical contenders.\n Responding to Duterte's remarks, Cristina Palabay of human rights group Karapatan said women are as capable as men in any job. \"What matters most ... is if the interests of the poor majority are upheld,\" she said.\n Duterte-Carpio has cultivated an image as a reluctant successor as mayor of Davao, where she is hugely popular for showing the same tough, no-nonsense character as her father, who ran the city for two decades and has openly told police to kill criminals if they resist arrest.\n She is no stranger to presidential duties, serving as first lady because of her father's annulled marriage.\n Duterte-Carpio on Thursday told Reuters she had informed her father she did not intend to run and would not be a late entry as he was six years ago.\n \"I am not being coy nor am I doing a 'last-minute',\" Duterte-Carpio said in a text message. \"If the whole country does not want to believe (this) then I can't do anything about it. Not everyone wants to be president. I am one of them.\"\n She added: \"I thank all of them for their trust and confidence in what I can do but my refusal to run for president is not the end of the world.\"\n Akbayan Partylist, a left-wing group of lawmakers, said in a statement on Friday that a Duterte dynasty would mean a whitewash of the President's \"incompetent, corrupt and murderous malgovernance.\"\n \"Sara Duterte should not run for president. But it's not because she is a woman ... Sara as president will not exact accountability from her father over his high crimes against the people,\" it said.",

In the same rollout, Biden indicated that Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, who was appointed by President Barack Obama during his first term, will stay in that role.\n The President-elect, who ran on a campaign that promised to prioritize science, made clear his aspirations for Lander's responsibilities in a letter he wrote to the new director.\n Drawing from one of his role models, Biden told Lander that President Franklin D. Roosevelt penned a letter in 1944 to his science adviser asking him how science and technology could \"best be applied to benefit the nation's health, economic prosperity, and national security\" following World War II.\n He tasks Lander with a similar responsibility, asking him and his team to work to provide his administration with recommendations that can set the country on course for the next 75 years.\n Biden asks him to consider five main questions, including what lessons can be learned from the pandemic, how scientific breakthroughs can influence climate change and economic growth, and how the United States can ensure it is competitive with China in its technological growth.\n \"I believe that the answers to these questions will be instrumental in helping our nation embark on a new path in the years ahead\u2014a path of dignity and respect, of prosperity and security, of progress  and common purpose,\" Biden tells Lander in the letter.\n In addition to Lander and Collins, Biden's team has announced that Alondra Nelson, a researcher whose work focuses on science, technology and social inequality, will serve as deputy director for science and society.\n Per the release, Frances H. Arnold and Maria Zuber will serve as the external co-chairs of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.",

        "title": "Vaccination megasites pop up in empty malls",
        "body_text": "Now that Covid-19 vaccination efforts are ramping up, local health officials are on the hunt for locations that can quickly be converted into vaccination clinics, and malls across the country, battered by declines in in-person shopping, are starting to play a role.\n Mall operators are sitting on plenty of abandoned retail space that might be ideal for the purpose \u2014 and some landlords hope that opening vaccination sites might bring in badly needed foot traffic.\n When Dr. Herbert Conaway, the director of Burlington County Health Department in New Jersey, was looking for a location for one of the state's six vaccination \"megasites,\" he realized a local, shuttered Lord & Taylor might fit the bill.\n Conaway said his department began scouting for locations in late November. \"Our initial idea was to identify outdoor areas, but that wasn't ideal in the cold weather,\" he said, referring to the recommended 15-minute post-vaccination observation period.\n A megasite is designed to handle as many as 2,500 individuals getting vaccinated a day, he said, and the Lord & Taylor store would provide enough square footage to set up operations.\n What's more, he said the mall's location \u2014 between four major highways, made it easily accessible for throngs of people on a daily basis.\n Within 48 hours, Conaway met with the manager of the Moorestown Mall where the Lord & Taylor is located, surveyed the site and made a case for it to be selected by the state as a large-scale vaccination hub.\n \"We would have to set up the bare bones of the operation in the store, but most of it was active space. The utility was on, the escalators worked, there was plenty of parking, a backup generator,\" he said.\n Within days, empty clothing racks and other remnants of the store's retail past were cleared out. It was quickly fitted with 20 vaccination stations, electronic surveillance and systems to manage, store and maintain Covid-19 vaccines.\n The county successfully met its goal of opening the site on Jan. 15, said Conaway.\n \"We initially have 20 lanes. As and when we get more vaccines, the hope is to increase it to 40 lanes,\" he said.\n The Moorestown Mall is operated by PREIT, a regional mall operator with 19 properties in its portfolio. Conaway said the rental fee was a \"reasonable $10,000 a month.\" PREIT declined to confirm the amount.\n But it said that it has offered vacant big-box stores and other retail spaces for conversion into local vaccination sites.\n \"Our local mall managers have been reaching out to county and state officials to be community partners with them on this initiative,\" said Heather Crowell, spokeswoman for PREIT which has malls primarily on the East Coast, including the Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey and the Willow Grove Mall in Pennsylvania.\n According to Moody's Analytics Real Estate Information Services (REIS), the rate of mall vacancies is currently at a historic high of 10.5%, exceeding the previous peak of 9.3% in 2011.\n \"At this point for malls, any good use of all the fallow space they're sitting on is a positive thing,\" said Victor Calanog, head of commercial real estate economics at Moody's Analytics REIS. The pandemic-induced surge in online shopping has only accelerated the rate of store closures, leaving mall owners with a glut of empty stores.\n As droves of people come for their shots, landlords hope that many could decide to have a bite to eat at the mall before returning home, or even knock off a few items from their shopping list since they're already there.\n \"We're hoping as consumers come through our properties, they hopefully get to know what the mall offers with restaurants and stores, both of which have been very challenged,\" said PREIT's Crowell.\n Brookfield Properties, the second-largest mall operator in the country, is also betting on the same spillover effect.\n Caryn Torres, vice president of property management with Brookfield, said two properties are currently involved in vaccination efforts: The Sooner Mall in Norman, Oklahoma has a vaccination clinic located in a vacant retail space, and another clinic is been outfitted at The Mall at Barnes Crossing in Tupelo, Mississippi.\n \"We have another 10 to 12 malls for which we are finalizing details. In those we are also looking at empty store spaces, including department stores,\" said Torres. All spaces will be donated for use, she added.\n About an hour and forty minutes away from the Moorestown Mall, an empty Sears store at the Rockaway Townsquare Mall in Morris County, New Jersey was also turned into a vaccination megasite.\n The mall is owned by Simon Property Group, the largest mall operator in the country.\n The site opened on Jan. 8, said Jeffrey Paul, director of Morris County Office of Emergency Management. Paul said the county approached Sears and \"entered into an agreement with them\" to use the space. \"We retrofitted it appropriately. For us, it's a convenient central location with easy access to the public.\"\n The Sears space is set up with 20 vaccination lanes, with the ability to scale up to more lanes that can handle at least 2,400 people a day, he said.\n A Sears spokesman said that in addition to the Morris County, NJ location, it has several other locations across the U.S. used for Covid testing and vaccinations. Simon Property Group did not respond to requests for comment on the site.",

        "body_text": "Despite hopes of widespread vaccinations this year, experts warned the start of 2021 would be a very rough time in this pandemic.\n It turns out the first two weeks have been abysmal.\n The United States just shattered its all-time records for the most Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths reported in one day:\n Many hospitals are now filled beyond capacity, meaning even those without Covid-19 -- say, car accident victims -- might not get immediate care.\n A Boeing 747 can carry about 400 passengers. That means in one day, US deaths from Covid-19 were on par with 11 jumbo jets crashing, killing everyone on board.\n People are letting their guard down due to pandemic fatigue. And many of those who are sick of taking precautions are getting sick.\n Now that the weather is colder, more people are socializing indoors. And the coronavirus primarily spreads during close contact with others through respiratory droplets -- produced when someone talks, coughs, sings or even breathes.\n Sometimes, viral particles can \"linger in the air for minutes to hours,\" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n \"These viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected or after that person has left the space,\" the CDC said.\n Socializing indoors with anyone outside your bubble -- even just one friend -- is risky. Gathering with multiple friends indoors can be dangerous.\n \"If you go to a party with five or more people, almost certainly there's going to be somebody with Covid-19 at that party,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\n One reason why the coronavirus spreads so easily is because people can be contagious without knowing they're infected -- and can pass along the virus without looking or feeling sick.\n The CDC estimates more than 50% of all infections are transmitted from people who aren't showing symptoms.\n \"This means at least half of new infections come from people likely unaware they are infectious to others,\" the agency said.\n What's the difference between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread?\n And just like doctors predicted, holiday travel and gatherings have triggered new waves of infections, hospitalizations and deaths across the country.\n Fallout from the holidays could still ripple across the United States for weeks to come.\n \"It takes two to three weeks for patients to get sick enough to need the hospital after they've gotten the virus,\" said Dr. Anish Mahajan, chief medical officer at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.\n Even though Christmas was less than three weeks ago, \"we're already full.\"\n \"We don't have any more ICU capacity,\" Mahajan said. \"All of the hospitals in the region are putting ICU patients in unusual places in the hospital just to find room for them.\"\n Some patients have been put in hospital break rooms, parking garages and gift shops.\n New for 2021: The United States has confirmed at least 76 cases of a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus that was first detected in the United Kingdom.\n Those US cases were found in 12 states: California, Florida, Minnesota, New York, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin and Georgia, according to CDC data posted Wednesday.\n But the real numbers could be much higher because the United States lags behind dozens of other countries in the proportion of Covid-19 cases that are analyzed through genetic sequencing.\n And the United States ranks 61st in how quickly virus samples are collected from patients, analyzed and then posted to an international database to find new variants.\n Earlier this month, a CDC official said the agency plans to double the number of samples it sequences by mid-January -- with a target of 6,500 per week.\n Understanding the genetic makeup of a virus and how it changes is critical to ensuring vaccines remain effective.\n All viruses mutate over time, and new variants are common.\n But scientists advising the UK government have estimated that the variant could be up to 70% more effective at spreading than others.\n While it may be more transmissible, there's no evidence this variant first detected in the UK is deadlier or causes more severe disease, the CDC said.\n But the strain first detected in the United Kingdom isn't the only one causing concern.\n A variant first detected in South Africa has been shown it might be able to escape some of the antibodies produced by a Covid-19 vaccine.\n That strain was first spotted two months ago in South Africa and has been found in 12 countries. As of Thursday, it has not been detected in the United States.\n The vaccine rollout is happening more slowly than expected.\n The Trump administration initially said it aimed to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020.\n That didn't happen. Not even close.\n As of Thursday morning, about 10.2 million vaccine doses had been administered, out of roughly 29.3 million doses that have been distributed across the United States, according to the CDC.\n And the two vaccines distributed in the United States right now -- from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- require two doses for each person.\n The federal government recently said it will stop holding back doses kept in reserve -- intended to help guarantee second doses -- so more people can get their first dose faster.\n When can you get vaccinated? It depends on your health, job and where you live.\n In the coming weeks and months, the US Food and Drug Administration might grant emergency use authorization to other vaccines -- such as those from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca.\n But either way, millions of Americans will have to wait months before getting a vaccine.\n If you want to get life closer to normal (and more quickly), it's time to double down on safety measures:\n Wear a mask in public and every time you're around someone who doesn't live with you.

Two of the assailants were arrested and are currently under interrogation, the spokesman said.\n Most of the victims were women and children, said Rachel Taruwayo, the regional coordinator for the provincial government.\n On Thursday, they reached a police post about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the scene of the attack and were taken to a hospital. The woman and child are now out of danger, said David Dedonga, a doctor at Bwanasura hospital.\n The ADF has intensified its attacks against civilians in the eastern provinces of the DRC in recent years, the United Nations said in July. These attacks have left more than 1,000 dead between January 2019 and June 2020 and may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the UN.\n The group has battled governments in East Africa since the 1990s and has ties to several international jihadi groups.",

        "body_text": "Canada got a one-two punch Friday as public health officials said vaccine deliveries would be delayed and its Covid-19 measures still aren't working to control a resurging virus.\n \"We have to buckle down, this is our best way through in the coming weeks of winter,\" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a news conference Friday in Ottawa. \"We've seen the kinds of impossible choices hospitals in other countries have had to face when they become overwhelmed, deciding who gets an ICU bed and who doesn't. Well, that's not where we want to be.\"\n The vast majority of Canadians have been dealing with weeks of stay-at-home orders and yet daily case counts have, at best, plateaued at a high levels.\n More worrying, government officials say Covid-19 related deaths are steadily rising and may soon exceed levels seen during the first peak.\n \"We have yet to see the kind of widespread and sustained declines in daily case counts that would indicate we're bringing the pandemic under control nationally,\" said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer during a news briefing Friday.\n Health officials released new modeling Friday that showed Covid-19 remains on a \"rapid growth trajectory\" in most of Canada.\n Hospitalizations and daily case numbers have already surpassed those of the first peak in the spring. Earlier this week the province of Ontario warned one in four of its hospitals has run out of ICU beds.\n Data released Friday shows Canada now has an average of more than 4,700 people being treated in hospital on any given day, with nearly 20% of those patients in ICUs.\n All of this comes despite lockdowns already in place in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Taken together, that means more than 60% of Canadians are under stay-at-home orders, with most retail and restaurants closed for anything other than pickup or delivery.\n Health officials pleaded with provincial leaders Friday to keep stringent measures in place with healthcare systems at a critical point and already overloaded.\n \"If we ease measures too soon, the epidemic will resurge even stronger, this is why measures need to be consistent and sustained long enough to sufficiently suppress epidemic growth to allow for lasting control,\" Tam said.\n The grim forecast comes as Canada announced it would receive fewer Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in the coming weeks. The company announced a temporary slowdown in its European manufacturing facilities.\n \"Pfizer believes that by the end of March we will be able to catch up, such that we will be on track with the total committed doses for Q1. This is unfortunate, however such delays and issues are to be expected when global supply chains are stretched well beyond their limit,\" said Anita Anand, Canada's procurement minister during a news conference Friday.\n Canadian government data reveals little more than 1% of Canadians have been vaccinated so far. Given mounting problems with vaccine supply, health officials say the rollout will be too slow to have a significant impact on infection rates for months to come.\n \"This kind of issue is out of our hands,\" said Trudeau, adding, \"I want to be very clear, this does not impact our goal to have enough vaccines available by September for every Canadian who wants one.\"",

        "title": "Wealthy homeowners are getting richer, while first-time buyers struggle",
        "body_text": "The pandemic has further expanded the divide between people who are thriving financially and those who are barely hanging on. The stock market continues to soar, enriching wealthy investors, while millions of other Americans are out of work and must rely on unemployment and other benefits.\n A similar divide is happening in the housing market. People who already owned high-end property before the pandemic are seeing their wealth grow as the luxury end of the market booms. Meanwhile, being able to afford a new home is getting further out of reach for those looking to buy in the low- and middle-tiers of the market.\n Homeowners with mortgages gained an average of $17,000 in equity in the third quarter of 2020 over the year before, the biggest equity gain since 2014, according to CoreLogic.\n Home prices across the board have risen as demand has soared. The pandemic-induced recession brought mortgage rates down to record lows, just as many people sought to relocate to homes offering more space for remote work. That demand, combined with a shortage of supply of available homes on the market, has helped push the median home price in the US to $310,800, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's 14.6% higher than a year ago, according to NAR's most recent numbers.\n Rising home prices and record low inventory have made it even more difficult for would be first-time buyers, who are also hindered by ongoing economic uncertainty and tightening lending standards.\n \"Housing affordability, which had greatly benefited from falling mortgage rates, is now being challenged due to record-high home prices,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"That could place strain on some potential consumers, particularly first-time buyers.\"\n The homeownership divide had already been growing since 2007, when the Great Recession hit, according to research from the Mortgage Bankers Association's Research Institute for Housing America.\n The study found that wealth among US households became increasingly unequal between 2007 and 2016. The bottoming out of home prices in 2012 and a decline in the homeownership rate through 2015 ate away at household net worth. Median real household net worth dropped from $140,000 in 2007 to $97,000 in 2016, or 30% lower than it was before the financial crisis.\n The report said that while real household net worth improved between 2016 and 2019 due to rising home prices and homeownership rates, as well as the stock market's steady climb, those gains are likely to be offset by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n \"Middle-class households did not fully recover from the financial crisis, and the poor saw their net worth turn negative and stay negative,\" said John C. Weicher, director for the Center for Housing and Financial Markets at the Hudson Institute, who conducted the study.\n \"Meanwhile, the rich recovered faster and their share of wealth increased,\" he said. \"The result is a less-equal America, and many families that fell behind have reasons to worry as they cope with the pandemic and move closer to retirement.\"\n One big problem is that the cost of a home is still rising at a pace that is no match for meager increases in income.\n Home prices are increasing faster than wages in 53 of the nation's 100 largest cities, according to Point2, a real estate data company. There were 15 cities last year where mortgages alone took up more than 30% of homeowners' income, up from 13 cities where that was the case in 2010.\n Homebuyers in the most unaffordable cities would need to earn up to $43,567 more per year to avoid being cost burdened, according to Point2, which noted that this comes at a time when many Americans may have seen household income disappear due to job losses.\n Meanwhile as entry-level home buyers are being shut out, those who can afford it are buying larger or more expensive homes.\n While there were 22% fewer homes sold under $100,000 in November compared with the year before, largely because of lack of inventory, the number of high-cost homes sold has skyrocketed, according to NAR. Closings for homes between $750,000 and $1 million were up 85% in November compared with the year before, and homes sold over $1 million were up 88%.\n This rift in homeownership hits especially hard for the Black and Hispanic families who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n \"There is robust home price appreciation and that builds wealth for those who own a home,\" said Laurie Goodman, vice president at the Urban Institute and co-director of its Housing Finance Policy Center. \"But the Black and Hispanic homeownership rates were a lot lower than Whites to begin with.\"\n Prior to the pandemic, the White homeownership rate was about 72%, while the Hispanic rate was 48% and the Black rate was 42%, according to the 2019 American Community Survey from the US Census. The pandemic is likely to make this gap even wider for people of color, she said.\n \"As credit has tightened as a result of the pandemic, you increasingly squeeze out Black and Hispanic borrowers who tend to have a higher debt-to-income ratio and lower credit scores,\" said Goodman.\n Homeownership is one of the most direct ways to build generational wealth, she said, and while the average Black or Hispanic homeowner has much less wealth than their White peers, a greater portion of their wealth is home equity.\n Goodman said the median wealth of a Black homeowner is $113,000 and their home equity is $67,000, and for a Hispanic homeowner the median total wealth is $165,000 of which home equity is $95,000. Meanwhile, the median wealth of a White homeowner is $300,000, of which $130,000 is home equity, according to the Urban Institute's research based on data from the Survey of Consumer Finance.\n \"For Black homeowners, way over 50% of their wealth is in their home,\" she said.",

        "body_text": "Sylvain Sylvain, guitarist of the influential American punk glam rock band New York Dolls, has died of cancer at the age of 69, according to a statement posted on his Facebook page.\n Sylvain, real name Sylvain Mizrahi, died on Wednesday after fighting the disease for two and a half years, according to the post, which was shared on Thursday night.\n \"As most of you know, Sylvain battled cancer for the past two and 1/2 years. Though he fought it valiantly, yesterday he passed away from this disease,\" the post read.\n \"While we grieve his loss, we know that he is finally at peace and out of pain. Please crank up his music, light a candle, say a prayer and let's send this beautiful doll on his way.\"\n Sylvain was born in Cairo, Egypt, before emigrating to New York with his family as a child.\n He was a founding member of the New York Dolls, which formed in 1971 and racked up a cult following, with band members famed for their androgynous clothing, makeup and high heels.\n The band has been credited with heavily influencing rock and New Wave music. They broke up in 1977 but reformed in 2004, splitting up again in 2011.\n Writing on the Facebook post, music journalist Lenny Kaye -- best known as the guitarist of the Patti Smith Group -- led a tribute to Sylvain. He said Sylvain was the \"lynchpin\" of the band.\n \"The New York Dolls heralded the future, made it easy to dance to,\" he wrote.\n \"From the time I first saw their poster appear on the wall of Village Oldies in 1972, advertising a residency at the Mercer Hotel up the street, throughout their meteoric ascent and shooting star flame-out, the New York Dolls were the heated core of this music we hail, the band that makes you want to form a band,\" Kaye said in the post.\n \"Thank you Sylvain x 2, for your heart, belief, and the way you whacked that E chord.  Sleep Baby Doll.\"\n Tributes have poured in from the music industry.\n New York Dolls front man David Johansen, now the only surviving member of the band's original lineup, said on Instagram:\n \"My best friend for so many years, I can still remember the first time I saw him bop into the rehearsal space/bicycle shop with his carpetbag and guitar straight from the plane after having been deported from Amsterdam, I instantly loved him.\n \"I'm gonna miss you old pal. I'll keep the home fires burning. au revoir Syl mon vieux copain.\"",

        "title": "Wells Fargo can't seem to escape its troubled past",
        "body_text": "Wells Fargo is still being haunted by its history of ripping off customers.\n More than four years after the Wells Fargo (WFC) fake-accounts scandal erupted, the bank reported Friday another $321 million of quarterly losses tied to customer refunds. That brings Wells Fargo's 2020 total for what it calls customer \"remediation\" to a staggering $2.2 billion.\n Wells Fargo did not specify which of its many scandals were responsible for the latest refunds, which bank executives had previously suggested were in the rearview mirror. Instead, the bank said the money is \"primarily for a variety of historical matters.\" That could include anything from the millions of fake accounts Wells Fargo admitted to opening, to forcing customers to pay for unneeded auto insurance or charging unnecessary mortgage fees.\n The losses underscore how Wells Fargo is still being dogged by what the Federal Reserve has called \"widespread customer abuse.\"\n Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo's fourth CEO since the fall of 2016, acknowledged the toll on the bank's bottom line.\n \"Our results continued to be impacted by the unprecedented operating environment and the required work to put our substantial legacy issues behind us,\" Scharf said in a statement.\n Wells Fargo has repeatedly signaled confidence that it had turned the page on its scandals. In July, John Shrewsberry, its former chief financial officer, said the \"worst\" was over in terms of customer refunds. Then the bank reported another $961 million of remediation in the third quarter.\n In October, Shrewsberry acknowledged to reporters that his earlier prediction was \"wrong,\" but added that the bank believed it has \"now fully accounted for what it takes to close these things out.\" That, too, turned out not to be the case.\n Mike Santomassimo, Wells Fargo's new CFO, told reporters on Friday that the process has dragged out in part because it sometimes involves going back \"many years\" across different platforms and systems, some of which have changed over time.\n \"It can get pretty complicated and complex,\" said Santomassimo, who took over as CFO last year.\n Former Wells Fargo executives continue to get punished by regulators for their behavior at the bank. The Office of Comptroller of the Currency announced Friday a $3.5 million fine against James Strother, the bank's former general counsel. The OCC cited Strother's role in Wells Fargo's \"systematic sales practices misconduct.\" The agency said last year it was seeking a $5 million fine against Strother. As part of the settlement, Strother has agreed to cooperate on other potential OCC investigations into Wells Fargo.\n Despite its ongoing legal troubles, Wells Fargo managed to grow its fourth-quarter profit by 5% to $3 billion. That's because in the prior-year period Wells Fargo set aside $1.5 billion for litigation expenses linked to its scandals.\n But the bank disappointed Wall Street by reporting a 10% slide in revenue to $17.9 billion. The bank's shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading, eating into its 2021 gains. Last year, Wells Fargo lost 44% of its value, far outpacing the losses among other big banks.\n As it has done in recent years, Wells Fargo is leaning on share buybacks to placate frustrated shareholders. The bank boosted its buyback plan by another 500 million shares. At current prices, that translates to more than $16 billion worth of buybacks.\n The bank is really hurting from extremely low interest rates, which make it hard for lenders to make money. Net interest income, a key metric of profitability, plunged 17% because of low rates and fewer loans.\n Wells Fargo suffered a 26% quarter-over-quarter decline in markets revenue, driven by an across-the-board slump in trading volumes. By contrast, rival JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported a record quarterly profit Friday, boosted by its Wall Street arm.\n Unlike its rivals, Wells Fargo can't outrun low rates by either lending more or spending less. That's because Wells Fargo is still operating under an unprecedented asset cap imposed by the Fed three years ago. Those sanctions limit Wells Fargo's ability to lend and requires it to spend more to resolve its compliance problems.\n Wells Fargo reported average loans of $900 billion, down 6% from a year earlier. That includes a sharp 15% decline in loans to businesses.\n After setting aside $14 billion to cushion against bad loans during the first three quarters, Wells Fargo is no longer stockpiling cash. The bank modestly trimmed its reserve levels during the final three months of 2020, underscoring the improved economic outlook for the US economy.\n The bank is also under pressure from Wall Street to cut costs, and aims to cut another $1.5 billion of expenses in 2021, which will include laying off workers.\n Over the next three to four years, Wells Fargo said it hopes to eliminate $8 billion of expenses in various ways. The bank closed 329 branches last year and is planning to shut another 250 in 2021.\n Like other major companies, Wells Fargo is also rethinking its office space. The bank plans to cut its 46 million square feet of office real estate by 15% to 20% by the end of 2024.",

Home appliance firm Electrolux said it will hand over its oxygen supplies used in manufacturing air conditioners to public hospitals, according to CNN Brasil.\n Since early Wednesday, hospitals and emergency rooms in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas State, have been facing an acute shortage of oxygen.\n Although state and municipal authorities have not released official figures, health workers have told local news organizations that dozens of patients have died recently due to a lack of oxygen, vital in the treatment of the novel coronavirus.\n On Wednesday, 1,454 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Amazonas and 186 people were buried in Manaus, surpassing the previous record set on April 26 when 140 people were buried.\n Bolsonaro said Friday that \"all means\" are being made available to help Amazonas tackle its outbreak, which has been complicated by a new variant of the virus.\n His claim came a day after Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello described the healthcare system in the Amazonas state capital, Manaus, as being in \"collapse,\" and warned of a looming oxygen shortage.\n Manaus, globally known as the gateway to the Amazon region, also suffered badly in the first wave of the pandemic between April and May, when its public health and funeral systems collapsed.\n CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Marcia Reverdosa and Taylor Barnes contributed reporting",

        "body_text": "Michael Dowling is president and chief executive officer of Northwell Health, New York State's largest health care provider and employer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n As the coronavirus continues to spread rampantly throughout the United States, it is urgent that government agencies and health care providers embrace an \"all hands-on-deck\" emergency response approach to vaccinate Americans equitably, safely and as quickly as possible. Admittedly, the effort is off to a slow start, but it's fruitless and unfair to blame federal or state governments, or the millions of health care workers trying to administer the vaccine while caring for the more than 128,000 Americans now hospitalized with the virus.\n While the federal government's \"Operation Warp Speed\" has delivered more than 31 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to date, only about 12 million of them have been administered. The reason? So far, most of the responsibility has fallen on state and local governments and health care organizations to set up an adequate infrastructure to seamlessly deliver the vaccine to the expanding number of people permitted to get it.\n Understandably, the public does not want to hear excuses about why it's taking so long, but vaccinating hundreds of millions of people is an unprecedented national undertaking that requires enormous resources and staffing, as well as flawless timing, precision and execution.\n The supply chain begins with the federal government, which arranges for the vaccines to be shipped to individual states, based largely on their populations and how many people are eligible. Because of the daunting logistical challenges, it has taken states, local governments and health care providers a couple of weeks to establish a workable infrastructure for storing the vaccine; distributing doses to individual hospitals, doctors' offices and other medical practices; working with county and city governments to identify \"point of distribution\" sites in local communities; setting up IT systems to schedule appointments based on available supply; validating people's eligibility; administering doses of the vaccine before they expire; and then scheduling and arranging for second doses.\n Now that the infrastructure is in place, the process is becoming much more seamless. In New York, the state has established 10 regional vaccination hubs, led mostly by local hospitals and health systems. New York's largest health system, Northwell Health, which I lead, is responsible for working with Nassau and Suffolk counties to vaccinate 2.3 million eligible people on Long Island. So far, we have inoculated about 58,000 people, including health care workers and frontline caregivers in the community.\n The good news is we now have the ability to vaccinate up to 20,000 people a day on Long Island. But the supply is not going to meet the demand in the weeks ahead, raising concerns about our ability to administer second doses in a timely manner while also reaching those who are newly eligible with a first dose.\n Presuming that larger shipments will eventually make their way into our communities, health officials must focus on reaching people in areas hit hard by the virus, especially minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted. At New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's request, Northwell established a Health Equity Task Force and is working closely with community leaders on how to best educate residents about the vaccine's safety, efficacy and availability, while continuing to promote mask-wearing and social distancing.\n To build and maintain confidence among Americans, it's also imperative that we roll out extensive, timely and easy-to-understand public service campaigns to educate consumers about the limited supply, high demand and tight eligibility requirements that will drag out this vaccination effort for several months.\n Literally, tens of thousands of lives hinge on our ability to do it right and put an end to this terrible crisis. But rest assured, just as the health care community has risen to the occasion to save millions of lives during this pandemic, we will succeed in administering the vaccine to all those who want and need it.",

        "body_text": "In his address to the nation Thursday evening, President-elect Biden said about the coronavirus pandemic, \"The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight.\" But here's a question worth asking: Is it, truly, in plain sight?\n The political and national security crisis triggered by domestic terrorism at the US Capitol, and the ensuing impeachment of President Trump, has unquestionably overshadowed the public health crisis. And yet the suffering is still very real and the situation has never been more dire. Earlier this week, the US set another single-day death record when 4,462 people died in one day, according to Johns Hopkins data. Each day brings north of 200,000 new cases. And the total US death toll is approaching 400,000 \u2014 a number the country will likely surpass before Inauguration Day.\n But you wouldn't necessarily know that by scanning the front pages of newspapers or the homepages of major news websites this week. I noticed, for instance, that The New York Times and The Washington Post only had one reference each to the virus on their Thursday front pages. When scanning CNN.com earlier this afternoon, there were no coronavirus stories in the top half of the website. And even when outlets are making time or room for the coronavirus, most stories center around the vaccines, not the deaths and economic crisis.\n No doubt, journalists are doing their very best to juggle all of these stories. But as we cover DC politics and the fallout from last week's attack, we should not forget that thousands of Americans continue to lose their lives each day to this ruthless virus. And while the vaccine rollout is gradually improving, the situation right now is, frankly, very alarming and urgent...\n Much of the suffering happening right now is coming from the West Coast. In Los Angeles County, one person is dying of Covid-19 every six minutes, according to Hopkins data. Hospitals are struggling. As someone who hails from the Pacific-facing side of our country, but now lives in NY, I can attest to the fact that the East Coast gets special treatment from national news outlets. If it storms in New York or one of our neighboring cities, the whole world knows about it. But the West Coast, far from the biggest newsrooms, doesn't get that special treatment.\n And I'd argue that bias is having a noticeable effect on how the crisis unfolding in L.A. is being covered. When was the last time you saw a national news outlet carry a press conference from a California official on the virus, for example? Compare that to how often Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo were on TV when NY experienced its surge.\n Don't take my word for it -- take Sara Sidner's. The L.A.-based CNN correspondent, who was overcome with emotion during a live shot on \"New Day\" Tuesday morning, joined Brian Stelter on this week's \"Reliable Sources\" podcast. She matter-of-factly said that \"there is a bias\" and it's readily apparent now that she lives on the West Coast...\n Sidner told Stelter about recent visits to hospitals that look like war zones. \"There are people everywhere,\" she said -- \"people with real emergencies that need an ICU bed are in the emergency room hallways. That's how little room there is.\"\n \"And to see the doctors and nurses running from person to person,\" she said, \"it was terrifying, because when you live and work in a community, you are a part of the community. And I was thinking to myself, if I got into an accident right now, or if a friend of mine got into an accident, or a complete stranger, just a fellow American got into an accident \u2014 right now, this is where they're going to be treated: in the hallways, because the Covid patients need to be separated out. That's insane in the most wealthy nation on Earth. What are we doing?\"\n Sidner also said that she felt \"exposed and embarrassed\" when her rage turned into tears on live TV. It is what \"we're taught not to do,\" she said. But her human reaction helped draw newfound attention to the Covid-19 crisis, Stelter pointed out. \"If it did something to help,\" she said, \"then I'll embarrass myself every single day, all day long.\" Listen to the full conversation via Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, or your favorite app...\n >> LA Times: \"Hospitals teeter on edge of 'last-resort' guidelines for care...\"\n >> SF Chronicle: \"California braces for highly contagious new virus variants as vaccinations lag...\"\n >> Arizona Republic: \"Arizona hospital leaders warn care may be rationed...\"\n >> Atlanta Journal-Constitution: \"Georgia reports 100-plus new COVID-19 deaths for third straight day...\"\n >> Miami Herald: \"We asked how hard it is to get a vaccine in South Florida.

        "title": "US Capitol Police banned building tours on day of riot after Democrats raised security concerns",
        "body_text": "Days before the violent insurrection at the US Capitol, the then-US House Sergeant at Arms sent a memo to members of Congress banning tours of buildings on January 6, the day lawmakers gathered inside to certify Joe Biden's victory, according to a copy of the memo obtained by CNN.\n The lockdown was in response to alarm from some congressional members who were growing concerned about seeing large groups of pro-Trump supporters walking around the Capitol the week around the swearing in of the new Congress leading up to the January 6. It was a level of traffic that had not taken place since officials tightened access to the building in March of last year to limit spread from the coronavirus pandemic, multiple Democratic lawmakers and aides told CNN.\n Tours of the building in the days leading up to the violent insurrection of the Capitol have become a flashpoint in the fallout from last week's riots, with some Democrats openly accusing some Republican members of aiding the President's supporters in reconnaissance on the Capitol by providing tours.\n No proof has been provided so far, but investigators are looking at the possibility that some members of Congress unwittingly provided tours in the days before the rally to people who later were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol, a US law enforcement official said.\n No evidence so far has emerged to show complicity by members of Congress, but prosecutors are examining whether some people may have used tours to familiarize themselves with the Capitol building layout, the official said.\n The ban on tours also stemmed from concerns about who Republicans might bring in that day, a senior Democratic aide told CNN.\n Prior to the pandemic, the public had wide-ranging access to the Capitol complex, including the tunnels connecting the member office buildings to the Capitol itself. After, the Sergeant at Arms banned all tours of the Capitol Grounds at the start of the pandemic, but members of Congress were able to ignore the guidance. Lawmakers or staff led tours have never had to register visitors with Capitol Police, a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of overall protocols told CNN.\n Capitol police don't keep security logs either, two current US Capitol Police officers told CNN.\n \"Rules don't apply to the members. Never have, never will,\" one officer said.\n \"(Members) can just waive people through. If they do that, we're advised to notify the Sergeant-at-Arms,\" another officer said. \"We can't stop them.\"\n The January 4 letter obtained by CNN went further and banned all tours. In it then US House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving explicitly wrote, the Capitol and the Capitol Visitor Center \"remain closed to all tours, including Member, staff-led and public tours\" on January 6.\"\n CNN was only shown part of the letter because the remainder contained sensitive security information about lawmakers' movements.\n Irving stepped down last week after the riots. CNN has reached out to Irving, the acting House Sergeant at Arms, the US Capitol Police and former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund about why there was a need to ban tours on January 6, with no response.\n The existence of previously unknown tensions about member-led tours in the days leading up to January 6 help explain why soon after the violence at the Capitol some Democrats called for a review of who was brought on the tours.\n Multiple Democratic aides have told CNN that tours had been given in the days leading up to the Capitol attacks, and even some members have confirmed that other lawmakers were involved in leading them.\n Since the riot, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill has accused her Republican colleagues of leading \"reconnaissance\" missions around the Capitol and has been joined by a chorus of 30 of her Democratic colleagues in a letter sent to the acting House and Senate Sergeant at Arms along with the acting chief of the Capitol Police.\n Sherrill told reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that she turned over her findings to \"certain agencies.\" She, nor any of those who signed the letter, have named any specific members.\n Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who is leading the investigation into Capitol Police's handling of the attack, said Wednesday that he has heard of members who showed rioters around the Capitol on January 5, but wanted to wait for verification before naming any names.\n \"I've heard a couple, but I'm going to wait to make sure we get verification. I don't want to throw any member under the bus,\" Ryan said. \"Now you look back on certain things and you look at them differently so, yeah, we're looking into it.\"\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday said accusations from her fellow Democrats will be investigated.\n \"If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, then there have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecution for that,\" Pelosi said.\n A senior Republican aide pushed back on the accusations that GOP members were specifically responsible for the new guidance from the Sergeant at Arms.\n \"Capitol tour guidance issued to members and staff has been consistent throughout the year because of the pandemic, and members of both parties were sworn in last week with family in town to experience the event,\" the aide told CNN. \"It's unfortunate that Democrats are intentionally ignoring those facts and are not using this time for bipartisan fact-finding.\"\n However, some Republicans are raising concerns about the activity of their colleagues leading up to the riots.\n In an interview with CBS on Thursday, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump, said it was \"certainly possible\" that his GOP colleagues gave reconnaissance tours.\n \"I think it's certainly possible\" Kinzinger said. \"I don't know, but I think it was possible that you know, people were showed around. I hope not.\" Kinzinger added that if the claims of reconnaissance missions were verified \"there should be criminal charges and certainly be expelled from the House of Representatives.\"\n A senior Democratic aide told CNN the request to ban tours was the result of Republican lawmakers wanting to bring members of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement into the building. Thousands of members of the group were scheduled to gather outside that day.\n The aide said that there was widespread concern about the member-led tours infringing on security, and said the issue was raised with the House Sergeant at Arms, Capitol Police and House administration.\n \"In the three days leading up to the 6th, there was ongoing communication, both at the member and the staff level with relevant entities\" the Democratic aide said, adding that \"there was a very specific concern around building access.\"\n Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon told CNN that she saw groups of six to eight people in MAGA apparel on tours one or two days before the attack.\n \"I had seen what appeared to be tour groups of folks dressed in MAGA attire, in the halls, in the tunnels\" Scanlon told CNN.\n \"I can verify that it happened. There were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN. \"We haven't seen tour groups in the Capitol or in the tunnels for months, and so that's why it was noticeable.\"\n A Democratic lawmaker told CNN it was particularly alarming at the time to learn participants on these tours did not have to pass through security or be screened by Capitol Police before entering the Capitol.\n A second Democratic lawmaker described seeing a group walking through the Longworth tunnel the day before the attack wearing MAGA hats and no masks.\n This member recounted asking a Capitol Police officer why they were there, because they were not supposed to be there. The officer responded that there was nothing to be done since the group was brought in by a lawmaker. The member was specifically concerned about the group not wearing masks and asked them to put their masks on to no avail.\n Looking back, the lawmaker wondered if focusing on Covid-19 exposure was wrong and should have instead raised the larger question of whether these tours were preparation for the upcoming attack.\n On the morning of January 6, a Democratic lawmaker shared that members of Congress had to use a badge to enter the building with even a spouse having to show ID. Even though this was the mandate, the source did not know if every building complied with the new guidance of strict identification practices.\n CNN's Ryan Nobles, Peter Nickeas and Mark Morales contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Will Donald Trump go down as the worst president in history?",
        "body_text": "With just days left in his time as president, Donald Trump undoubtedly has begun to consider how history will remember him. The early returns aren't promising.\n \"On several occasions, Trump has suggested that he expects to take his place on the list of former presidents aside Abraham Lincoln, presumably knocking George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and all the others in the top rank down a tick,\" wrote presidential historian Joseph Ellis in a op-ed for the Los Angeles Times this week. \"To put it politely, he needs to adjust his expectations.\"\n Added Ellis: \"Donald Trump is quite likely to assume the title as the worst president in American history.\"\n Deciding how presidents rank is, admittedly, a very subjective matter. And it's usually done by people like Ellis, academics and authors who have devoted their professional lives to the study of the presidency, which may not be a group naturally inclined to like Trump's decided anti-intellectual approach to, well, everything.\n But those are the people who tend to rank the presidents. So, let's look at a few of the more recent rankings -- and where Trump stands.\n In 2019, Siena College released its latest rankings, the result of the combined views of 159 presidential scholars who rated each of the 44 men who have been president (Grover Cleveland was president twice!) on 20 different aspects of the job. (The categories range from \"integrity\" to \"willing to take risks\" to \"luck.\")\n In those rankings, Trump placed third to last -- behind only James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson.\n \"The serving president has entered the survey between 15th, Obama, and 23rd, G.W. Bush, as scholars begin to observe their accomplishments, assess their abilities and study their attributes,\" said Don Levy, who runs the Siena College polling operation. \"This year, Donald Trump enters the survey at 42nd, and he is only ranked outside of the bottom five in two of the 20 categories that scholars use to assess the presidents, 'luck' and 'willingness to take risks.'\"\n On \"luck,\" Trump ranked tenth. On \"willingness to take risks,\" he was 25th. (Remember that this came out in early 2019, long before the world had ever heard of \"Covid-19.\" The arrival of the pandemic is very likely to drop Trump's \"luck\" score in future surveys.)\n The other major recent study of best (and worst) presidents came in 2018 from Brandon Rottinghaus from the University of Houston and Justin S. Vaughn of Boise State University. Known as the \"Presidents & Executive Politics Presidential Greatness Survey,\" this one poll 170 members of American Political Science Association.\n Trump ranked dead last in this survey, trailing Buchanan, William Henry Harrison, Franklin Pierce and Johnson, respectively. Broken out by the relative ideology of the panel, Trump fared little better. Among self-identified conservatives, Trump was ranked as the 40th best president. (Buchanan was conservatives' choice as worst president.) Among moderates and liberals in the survey, Trump was ranked dead last.\n That same group was asked who the next president on Mount Rushmore would be. (This is a theoretical question since there is no more room to add a face to Mount Rushmore.) Only two presidents got double-digit votes: Franklin Roosevelt (108) and Barack Obama (12). Trump got a total of 0 votes.\n Which is going to be a tough pill to swallow for Trump, who, according to The New York Times, broached the possibility of adding his visage to Mount Rushmore with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. This, from Noem, is enlightening on that subject:\n \"He said, 'Kristi, come on over here. Shake my hand,'\" Noem told the Sioux Falls Argus-Leader about a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office. \"I shook his hand, and I said, 'Mr. President, you should come to South Dakota sometime. We have Mount Rushmore.' And he goes, 'Do you know it's my dream to have my face on Mount Rushmore?'. \"I started laughing. He wasn't laughing, so he was totally serious.\"\n (Sidebar: Noem did give Trump a four-foot replica of Mount Rushmore with his face on it. Not kidding.)\n Now, making historical judgments about a president in the middle of his term -- or even immediately after his term ends -- is a dicey business. Ulysses S. Grant was widely seen to be a failure in the immediate aftermath of his presidency but has fared far better in the light of history. (Grant is ranked 24th by Siena and 21st in the \"Presidential Greatness Survey.\") Ditto George H.W. Bush (21st in Siena, 17th in the \"Presidential Greatness Survey.\")\n But at least at first glance, it seems unlikely that time will benefit Trump. After all, what these presidential rankings missed is the second half of Trump's terms in office, which was dominated by his administration's botched handling of the coronavirus pandemic, his tone-deaf response to the \"Black Lives Matter\" protests in the summer of 2020 and his fact-free allegations of a rigged 2020 election. None of which age well. Not to mention the fact that Trump made history this week as the only president to be impeached twice.\n \"I suspect the tour guides at Buchanan's National Historic Landmark homeplace, Wheatland, in Pennsylvania, are already celebrating,\" concluded Ellis in his op-ed. \"Their man, they must fondly hope, will never be last again.\"",

        "body_text": "It's folly to examine why some things go viral on the internet, and by doing so one risks discounting the beauty of the simplest answer: They just do. Nothing makes sense. Roll with it.\n Or at least, that's the easiest thing to tell yourself when \"The Wellerman,\" a 19th Century whaling song, has been knocking around in your head for a week straight.\n The jaunty tune about sugar and tea and rum is the center of a very cool, well-executed trend on TikTok started by Scottish musician Nathan Evans. His version of the song, which was previously brought into modern popularity by the group The Longest Johns, has garnered almost 5 million views on the video-sharing app TikTok.\n \"I think it's because everyone is feeling alone and stuck at home during this pandemic and it gives everyone a sense of unity and friendship,\" Evans, the 26-year-old singer from Airdrie, Scotland, told CNN.\n \"And shanties are great because they bring loads of people together and anyone can join in. You don't even need to be able to sing to join in on a sea shanty!\"\n Since Evans posted his song on TikTok in late December, other musicians have used the app's duet feature to add their own voices and instruments to the mix, resulting in a harmonic kaleidoscope of renditions that have gained their own popularity. Other sea shanties took off as well (there is some difference in the definition of these maritime songs, but we'll just stick to shanties for now). Everyone was having a good time.\n Then, things got weird. TikTok users started creating dubstep shanties. Smash Mouth's 1999 \"All Star,\" already a god-tier meme in its own right, got the shanty treatment. Awareness of this new nautical trend migrated to Twitter and other social media platforms. \"The Wellerman\" rose up the Spotify charts.\n For whatever reason, sea shanties hit a nerve. And yes, you could chalk it up as another internet oddity.  But surely, there must be something more here, right? Why else would people say things like \"2021 is the year of the sea shanty,\" or post memes about how \"The Wellerman\" has become part of the soundtrack of our current state of acute global and political crisis?\n \"I can't tell if the whole sea shanty thing is the perfect wholesome distraction from the horror of life in 2021, or the final nail in coffin of my psyche,\" Blink-182 frontman Mark Hoppus said on Twitter.\n It's true the songs are pretty catchy, and that's by design. Shanties are a type of work song, passed around by laborers, often underpaid and overworked, to alleviate the monotony of their toil.\n Monotony and economic uncertainty? In our 2021? Maybe it's not so much of a stretch after all.\n This shanty moment is also another example of TikTok's cultural range. The video-sharing app regularly catapults meme music into chart-topping bangers and transforms already-big hits like Cardi B's \"WAP\" into major cultural moments. (And yes, there are now sea shanty versions of \"WAP,\" too.) This is where a fun joke about a \"Ratatouille\" musical, of all things, can become a real event, and where tunes from the past, whether it be Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\" or a 19th century nautical ditty, can be remixed and reborn in an instant.\n And all of this happens because one person sees what another has done, and decides to join in. In fact, Evans says that's been his favorite part of watching the trend grow.\n \"So many people have joined in, and also the happiness and joy it has brung so many other people, it is absolutely incredible,\" he says.\n This type of exchange is literally the basis of folk traditions, and one of the reasons sea shanties and the music of everyday people is kept alive through history and across cultures.\n Was this just the right moment in time, when, isolated and restless, craving release from political upheaval and existential worry, people chose to reach across oceans and engage in a little sea shanty obsession?\n Maybe. Or maybe it shouldn't make sense, and we should just roll with it.",

The position does not require Senate confirmation.\n Earlier this week, Biden tapped veteran American diplomat William Burns to be the agency's director. Since Burns would be the first leader in the CIA's history whose experience comes from the State Department, Cohen, as Burns' deputy, has the more formal experience in the intelligence field.\n During his first stint as deputy CIA director, Cohen helped oversee the intelligence agency's strategic modernization and led foreign intelligence collection. He ended his tenure in 2017 by being awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA's highest honor.\n Before joining the CIA, Cohen served in the Treasury Department as the undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, where he played a vital role in combating illicit finance and developing economic sanctions against foreign governments, including Russia, Iran and North Korea.\n His office also developed the Obama administration's blueprint for targeting ISIS and other terrorist organizations in the financial realm, which earned him the nickname in the Obama White House the \"financial Batman.\"\n In forming his administration, Biden has tapped many former Obama-era officials with whom he has worked closely or who have years of experience in government.\n Cohen is currently a partner at the private law firm WilmerHale in Washington, DC, where he had practiced law before joining the Obama administration.\n In 2019, Cohen made a surprise brief cameo as an unnamed resident of Winterfell in HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\"\n This story has been updated with additional background information.",

        "title": "Biden outlines plan to administer Covid-19 vaccines to Americans",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden on Friday outlined a plan to administer Covid-19 vaccines to the US population that includes opening up eligibility to get more people vaccinated, creating more vaccination sites and taking measures to increase the supply and distribution of the vaccines.\n His plan includes mobilizing more personnel to support the vaccination effort, launching a public education campaign to address those hesitant to take the vaccine and focuses on ensuring equitable access to the vaccine across the country.\n \"Our plan is as clear as it\u00a0is bold: Get more people vaccinated for\u00a0free.\u00a0Create more places for them to\u00a0get vaccinated.\u00a0Mobilize more medical teams to\u00a0get the shots in people's arms.\u00a0Increase supply and get it out\u00a0the door as soon as possible,\" Biden said during an event in Wilmington, Delaware.\n Biden described the vaccine rollout in the United States under President Donald Trump as a \"dismal\u00a0failure thus far.\"\n \"If you were to ask most people\u00a0today, they couldn't tell you\u00a0who exactly is getting\u00a0vaccinated.\u00a0What they do know is there are\u00a0tens of millions of doses of\u00a0vaccine sitting unused in\u00a0freezers around the country, while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it,\" Biden said.\n The President-elect continued: \"We'll fix the problem by\u00a0encouraging states to allow more\u00a0people to get vaccinated beyond\u00a0health care workers and move\u00a0through those groups as quickly\u00a0as they think we can.\"\n Biden cautioned that \"things will get worse before\u00a0they get better,\" and said that any policy changes implemented by his administration \"are going to take time to\u00a0show up in the Covid statistics.\"\n But the President-elect said he was \"convinced\" that his administration could meet his goal of administering 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office.\n \"This is a time to set big goals\u00a0to pursue them with courage and\u00a0conviction, because the health of the\u00a0nation is literally at stake,\" Biden said.\n While Biden has set out ambitious goals for ramping up the supply of vaccine and the speed of vaccinations, he has offered few of the nitty-gritty details on how his administration intends to achieve them.\n For instance, it's still unclear how Biden might use the Defense Production Act in a way that could ramp up vaccine supply, rather than the production of ancillary supplies like syringes.\n His transition team has not provided a target number for federalized vaccination sites, except to say that \"thousands\" will be set up. And Biden's team has offered few details on how it plans to track states' progress to ensure Americans are being vaccinated at a pace that keeps up with Biden's goal of 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days.\n A fact sheet provided by his transition team says Biden's plan \"encourages states to open up eligibility beyond healthcare workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, to include frontline essential workers like teachers, first responders, grocery store employees, and anyone who is 65 and older.\"\n Health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities are the first in line for the coronavirus vaccines, as recommended by vaccine advisers to the CDC. Next in line are older adults, ages 75 and older, and \"frontline essential workers,\" including first responders, the advisers recommended.\n The President-elect will use federal funds to create new community vaccination centers across the country and launch mobile vaccination clinics and provider partnerships to reach under-served urban areas and rural communities.\n His plan will make vaccines available in pharmacies and increase the capacity at chain and independent pharmacies across the nation. As Biden has pledged in the past, he will use the Defense Production Act to maximize the manufacturing of the vaccine and increase the supply.\n \"President-elect Biden's plan will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they are available, so more people can get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small reserve for any unforeseen shortages or delays,\" the fact sheet reads.\n Biden will aim to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, CNN previously reported. The Trump administration's strategy originally was to hold back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available, but it has since reversed course and said it would distribute reserved second doses immediately, effectively adopting Biden's approach after disparaging it.\n Biden's plan will increase the public health workforce to support the vaccination effort, which includes allowing for additional professionals to administer vaccines and encouraging states to expand the scope of practice laws and waive licensing requirements where appropriate. The President-elect will also mobilize a public health jobs program to support the response to the pandemic.\n The President-elect's plan would reimburse state deployments of the National Guard to support vaccinations, and would provide a cost match for state and local emergency costs through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n Biden has said his first priority when he takes office next week is to vaccinate Americans against the virus as the pandemic continues to devastate the nation.\n The President-elect on Thursday outlined\u00a0a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package\u00a0to fund his nationwide vaccination effort and provide direct economic relief to Americans who are struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n The American Rescue Plan calls for investing $20 billion in a\u00a0national vaccination program, including launching community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units in difficult-to-reach areas. It would also increase federal support to vaccinate Medicaid enrollees.\n The proposal also includes $1,400 stimulus checks, more aid for the unemployed, those facing food shortages and those facing eviction. It includes more money for child care and child tax credits, additional support for small businesses, state and local governments, and increased funding for vaccinations and testing.\n The President-elect on Thursday did not detail how he plans to move this massive proposal through Congress, in which Democrats will have narrow House and Senate majorities, but both congressional Democratic leaders voiced support for the proposal and pledged to help turn it into law.\n Biden's presidential transition team on Friday announced that Dr. David Kessler, a former head of the US Food and Drug Administration, would lead federal Covid-19 vaccine efforts for the incoming administration. Kessler will help lead Operation Warp Speed,\u00a0the federal government's vaccine program that began under Trump, to speed up vaccine development and distribution.\n The current Operation Warp Speed team under Trump has also encouraged states to broaden their vaccination guidelines beyond what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended. Only about 40% of doses of vaccine distributed have made it into people's arms, according to the latest CDC data released Friday.\n More than 390,600 Americans have died from the virus as of Friday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Friday, the CDC reported 31 million doses of vaccine have been distributed and 12 million doses have been given to people.\n The President-elect has received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, and was administered both shots live on camera while reassuring the American public of its safety. He received the second dose earlier this week.\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has received the first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, and also did so on camera.\n CNN's Sara Murray contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, under pressure from his Black constituents over his decision to initially support objections to Congress' certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory last week, explained his decision-making in a letter Thursday but did not apologize for sowing doubt about election security.\n Lankford was among several Republican senators who had planned to dispute the results before last week's riot by pro-Trump extremists, which prompted him to drop his objections.\n In his letter, obtained by CNN and earlier reported by the Tulsa World, he claims that his initial objection was based not out of a desire to change any state's vote but to seek \"more election information,\" even though dozens of lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump's campaign alleging fraud and irregularities were swiftly rejected in court and all 50 states certified their results weeks ago.\n He also suggests he didn't realize that many of the false claims spread by Trump and his allies about fraud in major cities of battleground states amounted to racist allegations, even though it's well known that those areas have large Black populations and are heavily Democratic.\n \"My action of asking for more election information caused a firestorm of suspicion among many of my friends, particularly in Black communities around the state,\" Lankford wrote. \"I was completely blindsided, but I also found a blind spot. What I did not realize was all of the national conversation about states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, was seen as casting doubt on the validity of votes coming out of predominantly Black communities like Atlanta, Philadelphia and Detroit.\n \"After decades of fighting for voting rights, many Black friends in Oklahoma saw this as a direct attack on their right to vote, for their vote to matter, and even a belief that their votes made an election in our country illegitimate,\" continued Lankford, who has previously participated in GOP-led Senate hearings that have largely served to sow doubt about the 2020 election results and has signed on to Sen. Tim Scott's bill to create a commission to address voting irregularities.\n Lankford also wrote, \"In this instance, I should have recognized how what I said and what I did could be interpreted by many of you. I deeply regret my blindness to that perception, and for that I am sorry.\"\n CNN has reached out to Lankford's office for comment about what prompted the letter.\n In the wake of his efforts to discredit the election, several Black leaders in Oklahoma have called on Lankford to resign or be removed from the 1921 Race Massacre Centennial Committee, Tulsa World reported.\n A Black Oklahoma state official, who was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly about a sensitive topic, blasted Lankford's letter, telling CNN's Abby Phillip that calling it an apology is \"misleading\" and \"inaccurate.\"\n \"He did NOT apologize for questioning the Electoral College vote. He expressed regret that (many) Black Tulsans were offended by his actions.\"\n This official said that \"it is not our interpretation, it was the infliction and infection of racism that targeted Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin, all states decided by the free and fair votes of Black and brown voters.\"\n Immediately following last week's riot -- which left five dead and the Capitol ransacked -- several Republicans, including Lankford and Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, reversed their previous objections to certification. The two said in a joint statement that the attack was \"an assault on democracy.\"\n \"We now need the entire Congress to come together and vote to certify the election results. We must stand together as Americans. We must defend our Constitution and the rule of law,\" the pair said.\n CNN's Abby Phillip, Jake Tapper, Lauren Fox and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

        "title": "What latest CDC Covid-19 death projections mean and what you can do to change it",
        "body_text": "Over 90,000 Americans could die of Covid-19 in the next three weeks, according to new predictions from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is occurring as the United States has surpassed 388,000 reported deaths, with the country shattering the record of over 4,000 deaths per day for two days last week.\n The numbers are sobering. Public health experts have sounded the alarm for months that even with the great promise of vaccines on the horizon, there are dark days ahead, with the worst of the pandemic potentially yet to come.\n What do these projections mean? We talked to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, to learn how people can make sense of the numbers and what can be done to change the trajectory of the pandemic.\n This is so tragic, and I hope that we do not become numb to these numbers. Each person is someone's grandparent, parent, spouse, child or friend.\n The people we could see dying in the next two or three weeks are those who have already been exposed to coronavirus, possibly during the December holiday season. The best that can be done is for these individuals to seek prompt medical care and to receive the best care possible to treat their illness, but it's too late to prevent them from getting infected.\n That's not the case for all the people who haven't been infected yet. There is a big difference between modeling for a weather forecast and modeling for an infectious disease. You may be able to predict the path of a hurricane and then get out of that path, but you can't change where the hurricane goes. That's different with a pandemic. The future is not preordained. Our individual and collective actions now are what determine how much the virus spreads.\n We've been talking about basic public health measures for months now, and they are still our best guard against this very contagious respiratory illness. Keeping physical distance \u2014 because this virus requires close contact. Being outdoors is better than indoors \u2014 because outdoor air disperses virus particles. Wearing a mask \u2014 that can prevent transmitting and acquiring coronavirus. Avoiding crowded gatherings \u2014 and knowing that more than half of transmission (according to the CDC) is by people who don't have symptoms and who may be infected but not know it. Washing our hands frequently and well.\n These measures are additive. The more you do, the more consistently, the better you're protected. Our individual actions protect us and those around us. They also protect the community, by lowering the spread of coronavirus and helping to reduce the strain on our overwhelmed hospitals and public health systems. Collectively, our actions help to change the trajectory of the disease and are key to stopping this escalating surge.\n Another reason is that people may be misunderstanding what the arrival of the vaccines mean. There is such limited supply, and distribution of vaccines has been much slower than we would have liked. Many people will not have access to the vaccines for months. Even those who have had the vaccine may still be able to spread the virus to others.\n Don't get me wrong \u2014 the vaccines will be a game changer when enough people can get vaccinated. It's incredible that we have safe and highly efficacious vaccines. But they are not what's going to get us out of this very dangerous surge. What will get us out are these public health measures.\n I wish there were an easier way out. I think everyone would want that, and I know that everyone is tired and wish that this pandemic could end. But we need to continue to be vigilant and keep up our guard.\n Not having gatherings, indoors, with anyone we don't live with will also make a huge difference. In many parts of the country, what's driving the latest surge are these indoor gatherings \u2014 think dinner parties and game nights. It's in these intimate settings that people are letting down their guard and getting infected.\n I understand why people want to get together with their extended family and friends. The weather is cold, and it's hard to see one another outdoors. However, our loved ones are just as likely to be asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 as strangers. We need to be extremely careful and only have outdoor or virtual visits with those not in our immediate household.\n I'm seeing more patients who have no idea where they contracted the coronavirus. There is a familiar story: They have been so careful to quarantine and not expose themselves to risk. Maybe all they're doing is going to work in environments that require masks and distancing, or maybe only exposures they have are through grocery shopping and running errands.\n There is just so much coronavirus around us that the same activities that were pretty safe a few months ago are just riskier now. That means we need to be even more vigilant. If you were going grocery shopping once a week, consider reducing it to once every two weeks. If you are particularly vulnerable to severe disease, consider having your groceries delivered. Be even more attentive if you have to take the subway or bus to get to work. Of course, wear a mask at all times (at least a three-ply surgical mask). Again, make sure that you do not get together indoor with people, even your close friends.\n That means we have to hang in there just a little bit longer. There is hope on the horizon, but we do have some difficult weeks and months ahead. We can get through it, with optimism and caution.",

        "body_text": "Domestic extremists pose the most likely threat to the presidential inauguration, particularly those who believe the incoming administration is illegitimate, according to a joint bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and eight other agencies obtained by CNN.\n The assessment, dated January 14, also notes that since the attack on the US Capitol, Russian, Iranian, and Chinese influence actors have \"seized the opportunity to amplify narratives in furtherance of their policy interest amid the presidential transition,\" adding that there's a lack of specific, credible information indicating that they are seeking to commit violence.\n The joint assessment provides a breakdown of additional concerns leading up to inauguration day, including possible violence and cautioning of use of unauthorized, unmanned aircraft system operations that could disrupt law enforcement operations.\n \"In light of the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January, planned events in Washington, DC, in the lead up to and day of Inauguration Day offer continued opportunities for violence targeting public officials, government buildings, and federal and local law enforcement,\" the assessment reads.\n CNN previously reported that federal law enforcement officials are warning that domestic extremists are likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on President-elect Joe Biden's upcoming inauguration and throughout 2021 after seeing the success of last week's siege on the US Capitol.\n The joint threat assessment obtained by CNN on the 59th Presidential Inauguration reiterates those warnings, maintaining that there are concerns about potential violence, and that acts of violence and criminal activity \"can take place with little or no warning.\"\n \"We assess that acts of violence and criminal activity can take place with little or no warning and be directed toward law enforcement officers, public property, and bystanders around the White House and the National Mall,\" the bulletin reads.\n It also notes that a confluence of events in 2020 and 2021 have fueled plotting and attacks, including Covid-19 related lockdown measures, grievances over policing and police brutality, as well as perceptions about the presidential election and its result, according to the bulletin: \"We assess that these plots and attacks highlight the persistent and lethal threat DVEs pose to soft targets, government officials, and law enforcement.\"\n DHS Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said Friday that the Department of Homeland Security is monitoring online chatter, but that there are no specific, credible threats at this time.\n \"We certainly agree there's a good deal of online chatter. It isn't just about Washington, by the way. There's also conversations about state capitals but very unspecific,\" Cuccinelli told CNN's New Day, citing a briefing with state and local law enforcement earlier in the week along with FBI Director Chris Wray. \"It's that higher level of tension that we focus on.\"\n The joint bulletin nods to calls for violent action online and cites media reporting that violent planning has begun for Inauguration Day on various social media platforms.\n Asked about CNN reporting that discussions were underway to raise the terrorism threat level, Cuccinelli said Friday, \"At this point in time, the decision has been made not to raise that level.\"\n \"Again, we are, as we communicated with our state partners, we've prepared our own civilian law enforcement around the country to be ready to deploy to assist state and local allies to the extent they call on us to do so,\" Cuccinelli added. \"We are pre-positioning people on alert statuses around the country.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "title": "Thousands of Amazon warehouse workers to vote on whether to form company's first US union",
        "body_text": "Thousands of Amazon warehouse workers at an Alabama facility will begin voting next month on whether to unionize their workplace, potentially paving the way for the first US-based union at the e-commerce giant.\n The election will allow approximately 6,000 employees at the company's Bessemer, Alabama, facility to cast a vote by mail-in ballots beginning Feb. 8, according to a decision from the National Labor Relations Board posted on Friday.\n The union push comes at a time when Amazon's warehouse working conditions have come under heightened scrutiny during the pandemic. The company has hired hundreds of thousands more workers globally to support a surge in demand. A number of warehouse workers have spoken out about safety concerns since the start of the pandemic.\n While some Amazon workers are unionized in Europe, the company has so far fended off unions in the United States. A union election was held in 2014 at a Delaware warehouse, but resulted in workers largely rejecting the effort.\n The potential unionization at Bessemer has been months in the making. Workers at the facility first filed a notice in November with the NLRB about holding an election.\n \"Having a union at Amazon would give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better,\" reads a website in support of unionizing Amazon's Bessemer workers.\n Amazon did not immediately respond to CNN Business' request for comment.\n During a series of hearings in late December with the NLRB, Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) agreed on who would be allowed to vote. The list includes a range of hourly full-time, part-time and seasonal fulfillment associates.\n The NLRB wrote that it believes conducting the election by mail, as opposed to in-person as Amazon preferred, is \"the safest and most appropriate method\" given \"the extraordinary circumstances presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.\"",
