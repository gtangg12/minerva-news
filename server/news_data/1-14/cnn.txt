        "title": "Powerful earthquake in Indonesia's Sulawesi kills dozens, injures hundreds",
        "body_text": "At least 42 people have died with hundreds more injured after a 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island early Friday, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.\n Thirty-four people died in the city of Mamuju, to the north of the epicenter, while another eight died in Majene.\n In Majene, at least 637 were injured and 15,000 residents have been displaced, according to the country's National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB).\n Thousands of residents fled their homes to seek safety following the quake, which could be felt strongly for five to seven seconds and damaged at least 300 houses in Majene, BNPB said.\n Other buildings have also been badly damaged, including a military command office in Majene, and hotels and government buildings in Mamuju.\n Many people are still trapped under collapsed buildings, according to local search and rescue teams.\n \"Our priority is saving victims who are still buried under the buildings,\" Safaruddin Sanusi, head of West Sulawesi's Communications and Information Department, told CNN Friday. \"For example in the [West Sulawesi governor's office] we are still trying to evacuate two security guards who are trapped inside.\"\n Nearly half of the buildings in Mamuju have been wiped out by the quake, he added.\n \"Most...of [the] people in Mamuju city are now displaced. They are afraid to stay at their houses.\"\n The communications chief also said the quake had damaged four of Mamuju's largest hospitals.\n \"Mitra Manakara [Hospital] is flattened by this earthquake, while three others, Mamuju Central Hospital, Bhayangkara Hospital and Regional Hospital are also in [a] bad situation,\" he said.\n \"We need more extrication equipment and more personnel to work fast [on] saving victims trapped under the building.\"\n \"Our obstacle here is that we don't have heavy equipment to rescue them,\" Saidar Rahmanjaya, head of the Local Search and Rescue Agency of Mamuju, West Sulawesi, told local television.\n Arianto Ardi, the section head of Mamuju's Search and Rescue Agency, told CNN that officials had finished evacuations at three homes that were wiped out from the earthquake.\n The agency evacuated eight people from the first home. Three survived and five people died.\n Another difficulty was the lack of communication among rescue teams, as local telephone networks were down following the quake, he said, adding that there were eight locations where people were in urgent need of rescue.\n Shalahuddin Salman, a resident of Mamuju, said many people were trapped because they were sleeping when the quake struck in the middle of the night.\n \"We saved four family members but one still can't be evacuated,\" he told CNN after he and a few others rescued a family from underneath a collapsed building. \"(He's) trapped inside the building. We believe he is dead.\"\n Shalahuddin said he worried that many people were trapped under the debris of the Mitra Manakara private hospital, an eight-floor structure that had been flattened by the quake.\n Meanwhile, thousands of people who were able to flee have chosen to stay away from their homes out of fear of another earthquake or tsunami, said West Sulawesi's Police Grand Commissioner Syamsu Ridwan.\n \"Some of them are going to the higher place to avoid tsunami, although we have a confirmation that we have no tsunami after this big earthquake,\" he said.\n The country's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency said the earthquake did not trigger a tsunami based on meteorology and climatology agency modeling.\n The earthquake also triggered a power outage and caused three landslides along the main road connecting Majene and Mamuju.\n Hours earlier on Thursday, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck in the same district damaging several houses.\n Straddling the so-called Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" Indonesia, a nation of high tectonic activity, is regularly hit by earthquakes.\n In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands of people.\n Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of people killed in the earthquake. It is 42, according to official figures early Saturday.\n Additional reporting by Reuters.",

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy S21 smartphones: smarter, cheaper but don't come with a charger",
        "body_text": "Samsung's new Galaxy S21 lineup has an updated look and lower price tags, but customers will also notice two items missing from the box: headphones and a charger.\n In a digital press conference on Thursday, with the tagline \"Welcome to the Everyday Epic,\" the company demoed its three new Galaxy S21 smartphones in varying sizes -- a 6.2-inch Galaxy S21, a 6.7-inch S21+ and a 6.8-inch S21 Ultra. Samsung showed off its faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, advanced AI-powered cameras, new colors in a matte finish and premium earbuds you can buy to go with it. All models come with built-in 5G capabilities.\n The Galaxy S21 ($799) and S21+ ($999) are $200 cheaper than the models they're replacing, and the S21 Ultra ($1199) is $300 less than its predecessor. These prices are the same as Apple's iPhone lineup, though the S21 Ultra costs $100 more than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.\n The S21 and S21+ (available in purple, black, gray, white and pink) and the S21 Ultra (available in black, silver, brown, titanium and navy) will be available for pre-order on Thursday. All devices start shipping on January 29.\n The three models support the S Pen stylus used in its Note series phones, but all three models ship without a charger, which Samsung says is for sustainability reasons. Apple made a similar movie with the iPhone last year.\n The upgrades are indeed improvements to the Galaxy lineup, most significantly to the camera technology, but Samsung's \"epic\" motto feels off, both because the changes are more evolutionary than revolutionary and because of the backdrop to the announcements. Life feels anything but epic: More people are stuck inside, the news cycle is exhaustive and unemployment levels remain high. Let's be honest, the day is a win if we change out of sweatpants.\n Meanwhile, ambient sound lets you hear the world around you on top of what you're listening to. If you're using them on Zoom call, you can still hear your kid in the background. The two features work together intelligently, too. When your child inevitably comes to talk to you during your meeting, Galaxy Buds Pro will detect them speaking, lower the volume and automatically switch to the ambient noise setting so you can hear him better.\n The set, which comes in purple, black and silver, costs $199 -- $50 less than the rivaling Apple AirPods Pro. The company claims it gets 5 hours of playback and 13 hours of reserved power when fully charged.\n Samsung's annual Galaxy event usually coincides with Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February -- the first major tech event that was canceled last year due to the pandemic -- but the company moved it up to land on the last day of this year's all-digital CES consumer tech conference.\n Following a long thread of rumors, Samsung also unveiled a Bluetooth location tag called Galaxy SmartTag that lets you locate non-connected devices with a physical tag that attaches to keys, a bag or a pet's collar.",

        "title": "I've had it with interviewing Trump supporters who go off the deep end",
        "body_text": "Alisyn Camerota is a CNN anchor and co-host of CNN's morning show, \"New Day.\" The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nPerhaps you've seen one of the dozens of voter panels with Trump supporters that I have moderated on \"New Day\" over the past five years. Maybe you caught the one shortly after Trump's 2016 victory in which I slapped my forehead when a panelist tried to tell me that three million \"illegals\" cost Trump the popular vote. Or maybe you saw the one where a panelist told me he would believe Donald Trump over Jesus Christ.\n Since 2015, I've listened closely to Trump supporters' feelings and motivations.  I've drawn insights from every one of my panelists on the appeal of Donald Trump as a disruptor, how they believed he was \"a fighter\" for them, how they believed his success in business would translate into lifting the US economy. I hoped my voter panels would help our viewers understand all sides. I hoped the panels could model civil discourse and how to hear each other. But a week after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, I'm rethinking my position.\n The cries from right-wing politicians telling us we need to hear the feelings of Trump supporters are wearing thin, as is the idea that the mob at the Capitol was somehow \"silenced\" or \"censored\" for too long. In the hour before the deadly insurrection last Wednesday, President Trump told his supporters, \"Make your voices heard.\" Later, after they'd trashed the seat of American democracy, he told them he loved them and that they were \"very special.\"\n So, let us look at some of the \"very special\" people the President wants all of us to listen to -- like the guy dressed up in the badger pelt, horns and face paint. Authorities say he's a prominent QAnon crackpot and longtime Trump supporter.  He was taken into custody on Saturday, charged with violent entry into the Capitol. I'm hard pressed to see what this malign Minotaur has to teach the rest of us.\n Or how about the 60-year-old man from Arkansas, kicking his feet up in the office of the Speaker of the House? He left a \"nasty note\" for Nancy Pelosi and stole some of her mail. I guess he didn't know that's a federal crime. I'm not sure we should take any pointers from him either.\n Then there's this guy from Florida who decided to help himself to the Speaker's lectern, smiling for the cameras as he absconded with it. He was arrested on Friday, charged with theft of government property. Before coming to CNN, I spent five years as a crime reporter, and it was an enduring truism that the dumbest criminals took photos of themselves with the stolen stuff.\n For the record, I don't think the arsonists and vandals who caused damage in Portland, Oregon and other cities last summer need to be listened to either -- but I don't hear any political leaders saying they should be. In fact, Speaker Pelosi and President-elect Joe Biden have publicly condemned those far-left rioters who wreaked havoc.\n The mob that descended on the Capitol had their chance to have a say last Wednesday. Hundreds of journalists with cameras were positioned along the protest route to capture the rioters' feelings and anger. But instead of speaking out peacefully, the crowd turned to violence: They broke windows, scaled walls, carried a Confederate flag into the Capitol Rotunda, defecated in the halls of the Capitol, killed a police officer, savagely beat another one with a pole holding an American flag and crushed yet another officer in a door while he screamed for help.\n Of course, the domestic terrorists who stormed the Capitol do not represent all 74 million Trump voters. But you'd be amazed how many Trump supporters still believe the fact-free nonsense the rioters were chanting. According to a Quinnipiac poll, 73% of Republican voters believe there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election, despite dozens of Trump-appointed judges rejecting those specious claims and Republican Secretaries of State investigating and confirming that there were very few incidents of voter fraud.\n That's the problem with listening to Trump supporters now versus four years ago. Today, so many more appear to have become openly delusional and untethered from reality. Case in point: A Pew poll finds that roughly 41% of Republicans who have heard of QAnon, a group that peddles the conspiracy theory that a ring of satanic pedophiles have taken over the US government, say QAnon is a good thing for the country. Some pundits say none of this is the fault of the Trump supporters -- that they've been tricked and misled by Donald Trump and his allies. If that's true -- if they are that easily duped and manipulated -- all the more reason to tune them out.\n By the way, there are also three networks and dozens of online sites devoted almost exclusively to amplifying President Trump's nonsense.\n So, spare us, Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who tried to claim on Wednesday that the impeachment hearing was taking \"half the country('s)...voice away.\" And save it, newly-seated Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wore a mask that read \"Censored\" as she spoke out to tens of millions of Americans. It's simply not true. We heard you all loud and clear, and now a Capitol police officer is dead and our democracy was put in peril.\n I'm glad I sought out Trump voters to help me understand their perspective throughout this administration. Their insights informed my reporting every single day. I wish I could say that listening to his die-hard supporters had helped them, but I don't see a lot of healing or catharsis in the Trump crowd. Being heard didn't seem to alleviate the grievances of so many of them, if poll responses are an indication. Rather, many only grew more dug into their faulty beliefs.\n Yes, many Trump voters on our panels expressed deep and sincere regret at supporting Trump in 2016. Some of them say they wish they could take back their vote so as to prevent all the division and lying that's come since. But what can we make of Trump's most ardent current supporters? Today I see only more passion for him among this group -- and more rage at Democrats, the press, the so-called \"Deep State,\" Vice President Mike Pence and everyone else who they think has done Donald Trump wrong.\n So now, at the end of Trump's term and after the deadly Capitol insurrection, I think the time for listening to present-day Trump supporters is over. There is nothing that anyone in this destructive and delusional group can teach the rest of us about being open-minded and tolerant.\n Yes, I still believe in civil discourse and hearing all rational sides -- not the crazy, violent side, which is what my CNN colleagues got at the Capitol when their questions were met with threats from the mob last Wednesday. I think at this point the smartest thing the rest of us could do is no longer give warped Trump supporters a platform and no longer lend them our ears. It's time to turn off their microphones.",

        "title": "'Kill him with his own gun': Police describe facing the mob at the Capitol",
        "body_text": "As DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone lay on the ground at the US Capitol building, stunned and injured, he knew a group of rioters were stripping him of his gear. They grabbed spare ammunition, ripped the police radio off his chest and even stole his badge.\n Then, Fanone, who had just been Tasered several times in the back of the neck, heard something chilling that made him go into survival mode.\n \"Some guys started getting a hold of my gun and they were screaming out, 'Kill him with his own gun,'\" said Fanone, who's been a police officer for almost two decades.\n Fanone, one of three officers who spoke with CNN, described his experience fighting a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters who'd invaded the Capitol in an insurrection unheard of in modern American history.\n Federal officials have said the details of the violence that come out will be disturbing.\n \"People are going to be shocked by some of the egregious contact that happened in the Capitol,\" acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday in reference to attacks on police officers.\n Fanone, a narcotics detective who works in plain clothes, heard the commotion at the Capitol and grabbed his still brand-new police uniform that had been hanging in his locker and put it on for the first time, he said. He raced to the building with his partner and helped officers who were being pushed back by rioters.\n But Fanone, who said he'd rather be shot than be pulled into a crowd where he had no control, was suddenly in his biggest nightmare as an officer. And in those few moments, Fanone considered using deadly force. He thought about using his gun but knew that he didn't have enough fire power and he'd soon be overpowered again, except this time they would probably use his gun against him and they'd have all the reason to end his life.\n \"So, the other option I thought of was to try to appeal to somebody's humanity. And I just remember yelling out that I have kids. And it seemed to work,\" said the 40-year-old father of four.\n A group within the rioters circled Fanone and protected him until help arrived, saving his life.\n \"Thank you, but f*** you for being there,\" Fanone said of the rioters who protected him in that moment.\n Fanone's anger and frustration was a sentiment felt by law enforcement around the country, furious that Trump supporters had breached the grounds of the Capitol on the very day Joe Biden's win was confirmed by the House and Senate.\n Fanone's dramatic encounter with the Trump supporting rioters was repeated all over the grounds of the US Capitol as law enforcement officers battled to push them back. Fanone, one of scores of officers who were injured in the brutal battle, shared his story for the first time, still suffering the effects of a mild heart attack.\n Since the breach of the Capitol, investigators have been dissecting every aspect of the day's events, from the response of US Capitol Police to the nationwide manhunt for everyone involved.\n Investigators are now looking into the notion that here was some level of planning, with enough evidence to indicate that it was not just a protest that got out of control, law enforcement sources tell CNN.\n \"Certainly some things that we saw on the ground were some indication that there were some coordination going on, but I think as we get further into the investigation, a lot of that will be revealed,\" acting MPD Chief Robert Contee told reporters Thursday.\n Fanone said the rioters had weapons, either of their own or taken from his fellow police.\n \"We were getting chemical irritants sprayed. They had pipes and different metal objects, batons, some of which I think they had taken from law enforcement personnel. They had been striking us with those,\" said Fanone, who added that he wasn't going to be sitting at a desk while an insurrection was happening at the Capitol.\n \"And then it was just the sheer number of rioters. The force that was coming from that side,\" he added. \"It was difficult to offer any resistance when you're only about 30 guys going up against 15,000.\"\n Officer Christina Laury, a member of the Metropolitan Police Department's gun recovery unit, got to the Capitol at around 12:30 p.m. ET and saw the riotous groups gaining ground.\n Laury, who was guarding the line to make sure there were no gaps for anyone to slip through, was hit with a much stronger type of pepper spray that's supposed to be used only on bears, she said.\n \"The individuals were pushing officers, hitting officers. They were spraying us with what we were calling, essentially, bear mace, because you use it on bears,\" she said.\n \"Unfortunately, it shuts you down for a while. It's way worse than pepper spray,\" Laury added. \"It seals your eyes shut. ... You've got to spray and douse yourself with water. And in those moments it's scary because you can't see anything and have people that are fighting to get through.\"\n She was lucky enough not to be struck with anything but saw others beaten with objects.\n \"They were getting hit with metal objects. Metal poles. I remember seeing pitchforks. They're getting sprayed, knocked down,\" said Laury, who added that reinforcements kept rotating in so others could rest during the hours-long battle.\n \"Just puling officers back to heal up and (reinforcements) stepping in to get to the front line. And then they go down and more officers step in and the officers that were knocked down, they're better again and they're just battling because the bottom line is, we're not letting anyone through.\"\n Officer Daniel Hodges was one of those officers who tried to battle back rioters but was roughed up in the fight. Hodges gained notice after footage of him circulated being crushed by a door. The 32-year-old officer is seen in the clip with blood dripping through his teeth as he kept gasping for enough air so he could yell \"Help\" at the top of his lungs.\n Hodges raced to the Capitol to offer support like many others and soon found himself being assaulted from an angry mob that, he said, believed they were patriots.\n \"There's a guy ripping my mask off, he was able to rip away the baton and beat me with it,\" said Hodges, who was stuck in the door and added that his arm was bent before they ripped the weapon away.\n \"He was practically foaming at the mouth so just, these people were true believers in the worst way.\"\n Hodges was eventually rescued by other officers who eventually came to his aid.\n \"You know things were looking bad,\" said Hodges, who miraculously walked away with no major injuries and may have suffered a minor concussion. \"I was calling out for all I was worth, and an officer behind me was able to get me enough room to pull me out of there and get me to the rear so I was able to extricate myself.\"\n This was Hodges's first visit to the Capitol building.\n The patrol officer said he had been hearing about the possibility of violence for years so he wasn't surprised that the rioters would storm the Capitol. What did surprise him was how the insurrectionists thought the police would be on their side.\n \"Some of them felt like we would be fast friends because so many of them have been vocal,\" Hodges said. \"They say things like, 'Yeah, we've been supporting you through all this Black Lives Matter stuff, you should have our back' and they felt entitled.\"\n He added, \"They felt like they would just walk up there and tell us that they're here to take back Congress and we would agree with them and we'd walk in hand in hand and just take over the nation. But obviously that's not the case and it will never be the case.\"\n Now, only days before Biden's inauguration, federal authorities are warning of other threats that may come.\n DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly warned people not to come to the city for the inauguration.\n Hodges echoed her sentiments, and wanted not only residents, but Trump supporters and extremists to stay home too. But with one caveat.\n \"Stay home. Stop this,\" said Hodges. \"On the other hand, I hope they're caught. Let's leave it at that.\"",

The committee said Haines will appear in person while some members may join via WebEx.\n A source familiar, who said the timeline for confirmation was not expected to be altered significantly, said the reason for the delay was a senator wanted the hearing in person, and Friday's session was slated to be remote.\n The committee had been seeking to expedite the hearing with a virtual session but needed consent from all the senators on the panel to do so.\n Biden transition team spokesman Ned Price said Thursday that the team was \"disappointed\" by the delay.\n \"DNI-designate Haines was looking forward to appearing before the Committee tomorrow. We are disappointed the hearing was delayed, particularly given the urgency to have national security leaders in place in this time of crisis. Nevertheless, DNI-designate Haines eagerly awaits the opportunity to answer the Committee's questions next week,\" Price said.\n Acting Intelligence Chair Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, and Vice Chair Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Thursday night the committee was working \"as fast as possible.\"\n \"Despite the unusual circumstances on Capitol Hill, the committee is working in good faith to move this nominee as fast as possible and ensure the committee's members have an opportunity to question the nominee in both open and closed settings. The Director of National Intelligence plays a crucial role in overseeing the 18 agencies that make up our nation's Intelligence Community, and the committee looks forward to holding a hearing next week with Ms. Haines,\" their joint statement read.\n Haines, a former top CIA official and deputy national security adviser, would be the first woman to lead the US intelligence community if confirmed by the Senate.\n This story has been updated with additional information.\n CNN's Mike Callahan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "There is growing concern about security on Capitol Hill, as well as worries from lawmakers facing threats to their personal safety, law enforcement sources and members of Congress tell CNN.\n Some members of Congress have told their party leadership that they are in fear for their lives and the lives of their families, sources told CNN. And multiple members of Congress have taken new security measures, sources tell CNN.\n The more they learn in news reports and online, the more concerned they grow, several sources said. There's a growing realization about the danger they were in, the sources said, especially when they see videos that reflect how coordinated the attack seemed at times.\n One video of particular concern shows militia members with their arms on each other's shoulders, pushing each other in a line that snakes through a crowd surging against a door into the Capitol building, one congressional source told CNN.\n Rep. Peter Meijer, a freshman Republican from Michigan said on CNN Wednesday he was afraid of the threats he was going to face for being one of 10 Republicans to break ranks and vote to impeach Trump.\n \"I am,\" Meijer said on CNN when asked if he was afraid of threats being made against him. \"But I am not going to let that sway my decision. I think if we give the assassins veto, if we give the insurrectionists veto, we lose something in this country, and I won't let that happen again.\"\n Meijer has since added that he plans to buy body armor and was adjusting his daily routines to protect himself from death threats.\n \"It's sad that we have to get to that point, but you know, our expectation is that someone may try to kill us,\" Meijer said Thursday on MSNBC.\n Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told PBS NewsHour on Wednesday that he had \"absolutely\" received threats against his life from Trump supporters prior to the impeachment vote pressuring him to vote in favor of the President after he voted to certify the 2020 presidential election results for Joe Biden. Johnson did not vote to impeach Trump.\n \"I mean just today, just this morning, one of my offices received a threat against my life. I've received other threats against my safety. My address, a picture of my home where my family lives was posted on kind of an anti-Dusty Facebook page. These are dark times. There is a tremendous amount of outrage and rage\" Johnson told PBS Wednesday. \"The reality is, I think not just me but all of my colleagues, we need to acknowledge we may well be in danger, but we still need to do our jobs.\"\n Johnson said the threats so far are coming from supporters of President Donald Trump so far.\n \"In the last week, a preponderance of the threats have come from those on the extreme far right,\" acknowledging that in the past he has received threats from the left.\n Projecting safety concerns about the upcoming inauguration, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told CNN Wednesday that while he felt safe being at the Capitol that day, he was unsure about how safe he would feel on Inauguration Day until he was given more details.\n \"I feel safe today, I have no idea how I'm going to feel on the 20th because I don't know what they are going to put in place\" Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, said.\n Since the violent attack on the Capitol and in preparation for inauguration, metal detectors have been installed in front of the House floor that all members and staff must pass through, a move met with pushback from all sides. While some have complained of its inconvenience or pointed out how the lines it has created could result in Covid exposure, other have pointed out their installation underscores the lack of trust that exists on the Hill in the wake of the attack.\n \"It's a very sad commentary that we've had to install metal detectors outside the House floor because fellow colleagues could pose a threat to the safety and security of members\" a Democratic aide told CNN.\n Similarly, some Republican members have also been uncomfortable about some of their caucus who are known to carry guns, according to a GOP source.\n Several House members have been making inquiries with private security firms about obtaining personal protective details in the wake of violence and threats against Congress, according to a person familiar with the security planning.\n In response to mounting concerns from members about their safety, the Committee on House Administration circulated a letter earlier this week reminding them what security measures they could expense, and the process for beefing up their security protocols. Members can get reimbursed for purchasing a bulletproof vest, for hiring security personnel in certain instances or for getting their own security training, and for making a range of security enhancements to their district offices.\n Lawmakers are adamant that the pressure must be kept up on Trump to keep him in check in during these the final days, the sources told CNN. McConnell has leverage over the President because he could, at least theoretically, begin the impeachment trial before Trump leaves office, if he wanted to take that step.\n As CNN previously reported, there are still more questions than answers about whether the pro-Trump rioters had any inside help.\n There are early indications, as well as unverified accusations, that some GOP lawmakers collaborated with some of the extremist conspiracy theorists that organized the rallies and could have even given \"reconnaissance\" tours to rioters before the attack.\n A group of Democratic lawmakers asked the US Capitol Police to launch an investigation to possible collaboration between members of Congress and the rioters who attacked the building.\n Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who was captured in an iconic photograph hiding in the House gallery during the attack, said Thursday on CNN that some lawmakers gave tours even though tours have been prohibited since the pandemic began.\n \"We are going to follow where the facts lead us,\" Crow said. \"We're not going to make any assumptions. I'm not a mind reader.\"\n He also said he had \"misplaced confidence\" in the US Capitol Police to keep him and other lawmakers safe from threats.\n Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, one of the co-signers of the letter, confirmed to CNN that she saw groups of six to eight people in MAGA apparel on tours. one or two days before the attack.\n \"I had seen what appeared to be tour groups of folks dressed in MAGA attire, in the halls, in the tunnels\" Scanlon told CNN.\n \"I don't know exactly what day it was, it was just surprising to see that happen because since Covid the building has been shut down. There aren't supposed to be any tours. So I kind of assumed it must be a new member who didn't know the rules or something. But, I mean, I can verify that it happened. There were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff.\"\n As the massive criminal probe ramps up, this angle will be an intense focus for the Justice Department and FBI as they try to figure out if any lawmakers or staffers aided a conspiracy to attack the Capitol and disrupt the Electoral College proceedings.\n \"Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said in an ominous statement earlier this week announcing her strong support for Trump's impeachment.\n It isn't clear what future revelations Cheney was referring to, but she is a plugged-in lawmaker with connections throughout Washington, who would likely be in a position to gain insights on the investigation before things become clear to the public.\n This story and headline have been updated to include additional developments Friday.\n CNN's Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Ex-DHS chief attempts to skirt legal mess to keep Trump administration's immigration policies in place",
        "body_text": "Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf ratified his own policies and several controversial Trump immigration measures, in a last-ditch effort to overcome legal challenges that threatened his tenure.\n Wolf stepped down Monday amid legal turmoil over his authority to lead the department. Multiple courts have ruled that Wolf was unlawfully serving as the acting secretary, which would mean that policies he approved while in the role could not legally remain in -- or go into -- effect.\n Wolf's resignation from the acting secretary role meant Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor is serving as acting secretary in the final days of the Trump administration. However, Wolf remained at the department in his Senate-confirmed undersecretary of policy role.\n Gaynor delegated authority to Wolf on Tuesday to ratify regulations and policies, which would allow Wolf to make the policies, rules and regulations he approved during his time as acting secretary the formal policy of the department in a way that gives the DHS more solid legal footing. Those policies included several asylum policies, a rejection of new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications and a fee rule at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, as well as a memo regarding \"First Amendment Protected Activities.\"\n The legal issues all stem from Prsident Donald Trump's unwillingness to nominate a permanent secretary sooner.\n There have been several attempts by DHS to clean up the legal mess stemming from changes to the department's order of succession that helped pave the way for Wolf to take over the top role.\n Last year, in an attempt to self-correct the succession order, DHS had Gaynor temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf's legitimacy as acting chief of the department. Under one interpretation, Gaynor should have been the lawfully serving acting secretary based on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n That did not alleviate the legal issues and, on Wednesday, Wolf once again ratified numerous policies.\n In a memo signed Wednesday, Wolf said he ratified the policies \"out of an abundance of caution\" because of a Government Accountability Office opinion and recent actions filed in federal court alleging that the DHS order of succession was not valid. It's unclear if the latest move will help DHS with its legal issues.\n The government watchdog and federal judges have cast doubt on Wolf's legitimacy to lead the department, including in a court ruling last Friday blocking Trump administration asylum limits.\n In November, a federal judge ruled that Wolf had not been legally serving as acting secretary when he signed rules limiting applications and renewals for the DACA program, invalidating those rules.\n Government attorneys informed the court on Thursday that no changes have been made to the operation of the DACA policy as a result of Wolf's ratification.\n In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Wolf said he had resigned in part because there was \"no legal path forward\" to successfully fight the court challenges, putting policies in jeopardy. \"I wanted to make sure that they (DHS) had an acting secretary that could make certain decisions,\" Wolf said. \"I didn't want all those decisions to be litigated.\"\n \"As the administration's clock ticks down, look for more (DHS) actions to try to protect Trump/Stephen Miller immigration policies beyond January 20,\" former DHS General Counsel John Mitnick said on Twitter in response to the ratification.\n Miller is President Donald Trump's lead immigration adviser and has been the architect of his hard-line immigration agenda,\n On Wednesday, Wolf said he was \"hopeful\" that the incoming Biden administration will look at some of the measures that have put in place and \"try to understand before they decide to change or go a different route.\"\n Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to change course, pledging to bring more refugees to the United States, to repeal regulations that have made seeking asylum in the US exceedingly difficult and to halt construction on the border wall.\n CNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The Department of Defense is increasing its efforts to find and eliminate extremism within its ranks, particularly among those who espouse White supremacist beliefs, according to two senior defense officials who wanted to underscore the message that the military will not tolerate extremism within the services.\n The effort, which started long before the riots of last week, has taken on increased urgency after a violent mob of President Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an assault that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer. CNN has reported that the mob included veterans and Thursday's briefing comes two days after an extraordinary intervention from the country's most senior generals, who issued a statement reminding service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism.\n CNN also reported Tuesday that the Army is taking additional steps to screen the National Guard contingent that's providing security at Biden's inauguration for extremism.\n \"We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism in the Department of Defense,\" said Garry Reid, the director for defense intelligence. \"DoD policy expressly prohibits military personnel from actively advocating supremacist, extremist or criminal gang doctrine, ideology, or cause.\"\n Extremist groups, including White supremacists, place a premium on recruiting current and former members of the military, a senior defense official said, while also trying to get their group's extremist members into the armed forces. The groups want the experience and expertise of the military.\n \"We know that some groups attempt to actively recruit our personnel into their cause, or actually encourage their members to join the military for purposes of acquiring skills and experience,\" the senior defense official said. \"We recognize those skills are prized by some of these groups not only for the capability it offers them, but it also brings legitimacy to them in their mind for their cause.\"\n The Department of Defense has observed an increase in White supremacist beliefs among active-duty service members and veterans, a senior defense official said, partly because of the growing prevalence of these beliefs in the country but also because of increased efforts to find and track extremism within the ranks.\n \"We clearly recognize the threat from domestic extremists, particularly those who espouse White supremacy or White nationalist ideologies,\" the official said.\n \"We cannot let these things fester within organizations and become OK. Once that happens, then your reporting does suffer. So our emphasis within all the ranks is that it is not OK,\" the official added.\n The officials were not able to immediately provide data on the number of service members who are facing disciplinary action for supporting extremist beliefs or how many military applicants are screened out because of a connection to extremism.\n The Department of Defense is also reviewing its current policies, laws and regulations regarding extremism to better prohibit and prevent service members from becoming associated with extremist ideologies. A report is due by the end of March. The review was initiated before the storming of the Capitol on January 6.\n The general counsel at the Department of Defense is also working on drafting legislation that would update the Uniform Code of Military Justice to address extremism and extremist activity within the military.",

        "body_text": "When Andrea Hall leads the nation in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at Joe Biden's inauguration next week, she'll not only represent the kind of progress envisioned by the incoming president but she'll also deliver the words with a sense of mission, doing her part to bring together a divided country.\n \"Everything it expresses, I want to embody that in that moment,\" Hall, a Georgian who in 2004 became the first Black woman promoted to fire captain in the history of the City of South Fulton Fire Rescue Department, told CNN on Thursday. \"And just making sure that I am representing my family, my professional family here in South Fulton, representing the nation, and making sure that they understand the passion from which I speak those words about being indivisible as a nation ... because that's what it's going to take to move our country forward.\"\n Hall, 47, also serves as the president of the International Association of Firefighters Local 3920 in Georgia, the first major labor group to back Biden during his presidential campaign. She'll be among several notable speakers at next Wednesday's ceremonies: Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez will perform, and Amanda Gorman, the first-ever national youth poet laureate, will deliver the poetry reading.\n Tony Allen, the CEO of the inauguration committee, said Hall and the other inauguration participants represent \"one clear picture of the grand diversity of our great nation and will help honor and celebrate the time-honored traditions\" of the presidential inauguration. In a statement announcing the selections, Allen pointed to a common theme throughout Biden's campaign: \"We are an America united in overcoming the deep divisions and challenges facing our people, unifying the country, and restoring the soul of our nation.\"\n Hall immediately agreed to participate, she told CNN, but beyond the nervousness she anticipates feeling, she's well aware of this particularly fraught moment in US history -- an inauguration taking place among a politically fractured nation, a pandemic, a harsh economic downturn and the aftermath of last week's domestic terror attack on the US Capitol.\n She wants to make sure \"I am being an appropriate or the proper representative for the words in the Pledge of Allegiance.\"\n The word allegiance itself, Hall explained, is saying that \"you are giving yourself to this great nation and you are pledging yourself to defend it, to protect it, to take care of it, to honor it, to respect it.\"\n \"Those are all things that I try to embody in my regular life,\" she said.\n Hall started her career as a firefighter in 1993 in Albany, Georgia, as the city's first female firefighter before joining South Fulton in 1999.\n \"It was a challenge, and I was up for the challenge,\" Hall said when asked why she wanted to be a firefighter, a profession long dominated not just by men, but by White men.\n She considers herself a \"servant leader,\" one whose job is to serve. That's how she sees Biden, too.\n \"I think he has the right amount of empathy, the right amount of experience and wisdom to lead us in that direction,\" Hall said.\n Her younger sister, Whitney Williams-Smith, who was named the Savannah Fire Department's first Black and female chief fire marshal in April 2020, credits Hall's mentorship and hard work for where she is today. As a young girl, Williams-Smith would iron fire department insignia patches onto her older sister's work shirts and eventually followed in her footsteps to become a firefighter with the Albany Fire Department.\n On Wednesday, Williams-Smith will have the honor of joining her sister at the inauguration as her guest.\n \"She's always been my superhero,\" Williams-Smith told CNN. \"I wouldn't be where I am today without her. She opened a lot of doors for me. ... To be part of the occasion with her is so amazing.\"\n Hall herself told CNN she's \"humbled,\" but acknowledged that the moment is \"so much bigger than me.\"\n \"This is really about the firefighters and the front-line workers who represent our industry in this country. It is about Fulton and the people who I represent here in the community of people that we serve,\" she said. \"It's really about us being on the precipice of moving our country forward to a more united place.\"\n CNN's Sarah Mucha and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",

The contract was executed on behalf of the Trump Organization by a close personal friend of Donald Trump, Jr. named Gentry Beach,\" according to the court filing.\n The President's Inaugural Committee was not part of the contract, the attorney general's office alleges, but after the Trump Organization failed to pay the invoice, a collection agency contacted Rick Gates, a top official on the committee, seeking payment. Gates, according to court filings, forwarded the invoice to people working on the inaugural's finances.\n Representatives for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n Depositions of witnesses as part of the lawsuit have been underway over the past several months.\n In December, the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, was interviewed for more than five hours. Tom Barrack, chairman of the inaugural committee, was deposed on November 17, according to a court filing. Court filings indicate that Gates was also deposed.",

This will be his first time as an NFL head coach.\n \"I'm ready to coach the Jacksonville Jaguars,\" Meyer said in a news release. \"Jacksonville has an enthusiastic fan base, and the fans deserve a winning team. With upcoming opportunities in the NFL Draft, and strong support from ownership, the Jaguars are well-positioned to become competitive.\"\n Meyer's last head coaching job was with Ohio State, from 2012-2018. He helped steer the team to a national title in 2014. He also won two national championships when he was head coach of the Florida Gators, in 2006 and 2008. After stepping down as head coach at Ohio State, Meyer was a studio analyst for Fox Sports.\n \"This is a great day for Jacksonville and Jaguars fans everywhere,\" said Jaguars owner Shad Khan. \"Urban Meyer is who we want and need, a leader, winner and champion who demands excellence and produces results. While Urban already enjoys a legacy in the game of football that few will ever match, his passion for the opportunity in front of him here in Jacksonville is powerful and unmistakable. I am proud to name Urban Meyer the new head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\"\n The Jaguars hold the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL draft.\n Before joining Fox, Meyer had a 187-32 record during head coaching stints at Ohio State, Florida, Utah and Bowling Green. He is the only modern-day coach to win national championships in two different conferences -- the SEC in 2006 and 2008 at Florida and the Big Ten in 2014 at Ohio State, according to the Jaguars.\n Meyer left Ohio State after the 2018 season, when he said he was dealing with severe headaches, related to an issue from a brain cyst.\n That final season with the Buckeyes also was one with controversy. Meyer was suspended for three games without pay in the wake of an investigation into what he did about spousal abuse allegations against former assistant coach Zach Smith, the university said.\n When he left the program, Meyer said at the time he was retiring from coaching.\n Meyer will replace previous head coach Doug Marrone, who was fired earlier this month after leading the Jaguars to a one-win season.",

        "title": "Senate GOP torn over convicting Trump: 'There's no love lost'",
        "body_text": "To many Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, there's no question in their minds: President Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses.\n But getting McConnell and at least 16 other Republicans to convict Trump after he's left office is another question entirely.\n \"There is no love lost within the Senate Republican Conference for Trump,\" said one GOP source familiar with internal discussions. \"Everybody is ready for this to end. But there is a really open question about how many people will vote to convict him after his term will have expired.\"\n Several senior GOP sources told CNN on Thursday that many Republicans are torn over whether Trump's actions warrant the unprecedented step of prohibiting him from ever serving in office again after he leaves the White House next week.\n Republicans say it will ultimately be up to a combination of factors -- the case built by House impeachment managers, whether new information comes out about Trump and the deadly Capitol riot and whether emotions are still raw when it comes time to vote -- to determine whether Republicans will break ranks and end Trump's political career for good.\n Privately, Republicans have reviewed internal polling showing Trump's support cratering among GOP voters since Election Day -- especially since last week when he incited a violent mob of his supporters to riot in the Capitol leading to the deaths of five people, two sources said. But even after he leaves office, he is bound to still maintain significant sway with the GOP base, something Republicans facing reelection -- and potential primary challengers -- will be forced to confront.\n Republicans are by and large split into several camps. Some, like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, oppose the proceedings because, they argue, it's constitutionally dubious to convict a President once he leaves office, a position many Republicans are bound to take.\n \"I doubt we can even have a trial for a former President, which is what we are dealing with here,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told CNN on Thursday.\n Others, such as Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, are likely to align with many House Republicans who said that the impeachment proceedings will further divide the country.\n \"An impeachment vote will only lead to more hate and a deeply fractured nation,\" Scott, who is facing voters in 2022, said this week.\n Yet, some Republicans say that it's critical to lay down a marker to make clear that Congress will not stand for future presidents who may follow Trump's path -- and that the President's actions crossed a clear line that must never be replicated again.\n \"I believe that this President has committed an impeachable offense,\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Alaska television station KTUU on Wednesday, adding that it would be \"appropriate\" for the Senate to bar him from holding office again.\n \"I think that is one of the most consequential actions that we should take, and I think that would be appropriate.\"\n In a statement Thursday, Murkowski said she would \"listen carefully\" to the arguments before making a decision on her vote, but said the House acted \"swiftly, and I believe, appropriately with impeachment.\"\n McConnell, for one, has privately told his colleagues he is genuinely undecided and will keep an open mind when listening to the arguments presented by House Democratic impeachment managers, according to people familiar with the matter. He wants to let the passions of the moment cool down and let the trial play out before taking a position that many view will be the key in swaying Senate GOP votes -- and determining whether Trump is convicted.\n \"There is no difference in the (GOP) conference that there are potentially impeachable offenses here,\" the first Republican source said. \"I think almost everybody believes that.\"\n Indeed, many remain sharply critical of Trump's remarks to his supporters at the rally last week that preceded the Capitol riot.\n \"If anything, he urged in a very emotional situation, very inappropriate action by people that appear to be his supporters,\" said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, after the rioters stormed the Capitol.\n Republican senators, who are out of Washington until next week, are mostly keeping quiet ahead of the trial. More than a dozen Senate GOP offices either declined or did not respond to requests for comment Thursday on the House's approval of an article of impeachment, which charged Trump with inciting an insurrection and was backed by 10 House Republicans.\n House Democrats, recognizing that they have to convince at least 17 Republicans to go along with conviction, are beginning to build their case internally. Among the questions they're trying to resolve: Whether to bring in outside witnesses, including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose interaction with Trump was cited in the impeachment article after the President pressured the Republican election official to \"find\" the votes necessary to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the state.\n \"We'll get you answers as we get some answers,\" Raskin said Wednesday night when asked if he would seek witnesses in the impeachment trial as he walked into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's suite.\n Walter Jones, a spokesman for the Georgia secretary of state, wouldn't say Thursday if Raffensperger or another top election official, Gabriel Sterling, would be willing to testify at the trial.\n \"Our team is fully focused on the current session of the Georgia General Assembly at the moment,\" Jones told CNN.\n Raskin, a constitutional scholar, is expected to argue that there is ample precedent for the Senate to convict a federal official after leaving office -- a case central to convincing some fence-sitting GOP senators since Trump's defense team is expected to argue such an action is unconstitutional.\n \"Whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a President that is no longer in office is debatable,\" said Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who emerged as a leading GOP critic of Trump's post-election rhetoric. \"Should the Senate conduct a trial, I will again fulfill my responsibility to consider arguments from both the House managers and President Trump's lawyers.\"\n There's never been an impeachment trial for a former president, and Trump's allies have argued the Senate doesn't have the constitutional authority to hold a trial for the President once he's left office. The Senate has only convicted eight officials in history.\n \"The Constitution specifically says the President shall be removed from office upon impeachment. It doesn't say the former president,\" Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump's first impeachment legal team, told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. \"Congress has no power to impeach or try a private citizen.\"\n But several constitutional scholars say that's not true. Stephen Vladeck, a CNN analyst and University of Texas law professor, noted in a New York Times op-ed Congress impeached and tried a secretary of war in 1876 after he had resigned, and the Senate concluded it had the power to try former officers.\n The Constitution, Vladeck noted, says the Senate's judgment in impeachment cases includes removal from office as well as \"disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\"\n \"That latter clause is the key, because it drives home that the Senate has two decisions to make in impeachment cases: First, it must decide whether an officer should be removed,\" Vladeck wrote. \"Then it must decide whether this person should be disqualified from holding any future federal office. Indeed, of the eight officers the Senate has ever voted to remove, it subsequently voted to disqualify only three of them \u2014 reinforcing that removal and disqualification are separate inquiries.\"\n McConnell, in his statements about the upcoming trial, has not suggested that he thinks it would be unconstitutional or that he would make any effort to stop the trial on those grounds. Still, Republicans, including McConnell, may ultimately be swayed by the arguments and could point to Trump's status as a former president as a reason not to vote to convict him.\n In a memo obtained by CNN laying out the timeline for impeachment, McConnell did not question whether the trial should happen. But he did raise a question that doesn't yet have a clear answer: Whether Chief Justice John Roberts would preside like he did for Trump's first impeachment trial.\n \"When a sitting President is tried by the Senate, the Constitution requires that the Chief Justice preside over the trial. The Senate Impeachment Rules require that the Senate invite the Chief Justice to attend the Senate and preside over the trial,\" McConnell wrote. \"Ordinarily, that invitation would issue on January 19. Whether the Chief Justice would actually preside over the trial after President Trump ceases to be President on January 20, however, is unclear.\"\n Even as GOP support for Trump has begun to deteriorate, many Republicans have to worry about political ramifications back home. One GOP source said an internal poll since Election Day has seen Trump slide more than double digits among Republican voters nationally.\n Still, Trump supporters are bound to be a force in GOP primaries -- and how they vote on conviction is likely to set the tone for the election cycle.\n The landscape is challenging for Senate Republicans, when they must defend 20 seats compared to 14 for Democrats. Senate Republicans up for reelection who find Trump guilty could easily be facing Trump-backed primary challengers. Before the riots, Trump was already demanding a primary challenge to the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, for saying the President's efforts to overturn the election would fail.\n \"You just got to take things in stride,\" Thune said, leaving the Capitol the night of the riots, when asked if he were worried about a primary challenge. \"It's a free country. I suspect that we'll see a lot of that activity in the next couple of years for some of our members -- myself included perhaps. You just got to play the hand you're dealt.\"\n While Trump has been significantly weakened politically in the fallout from the riots he incited, there's still likely to be a loyal pro-Trump base in the Republican Party after he leaves office. Among those in cycle being watched closely: Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio and Todd Young of Indiana.\n Many are staying mum on how they might come down.\n \"I believe we need to wait and hear the evidence,\" said Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the 86-year-old veteran Republican who could retire rather than seek reelection in 2022. \"And as a juror, I would carefully consider the evidence presented.\"\n CNN's Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Corey Johnson was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, and was pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n Johnson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of killing seven people in 1992 as a part of the drug trade in Virginia. The weeks preceding his execution were defined by a tense legal battle after he contracted Covid-19 while on death row.\n In his final statement, Johnson apologized for his crimes and told the families of the victims that he hoped they would find peace. He also thanked the staff at the prison, the prison's chaplain, his minister and his legal team.\n \"I would have said I was sorry before, but I didn't know how. I hope you will find peace,\" he said, according to a statement released by his lawyers. \"To my family, I have always loved you, and your love has made me real. On the streets, I was looking for shortcuts, I had some good role models, I was side tracking, I was blind and stupid. I am not the same man that I was.\"\n The Supreme Court denied a last-ditch effort late Thursday by Johnson's legal team that leaned on claims of an intellectual disability and his Covid-19 diagnosis, arguing that his infection paired with a lethal injection would amount to a cruel and unusual punishment.\n That appeal came after an appellate court on Wednesday tossed out a lower court's decision to stay the executions of Johnson and another death row inmate who contracted the virus, Dustin Higgs, whose execution is scheduled to take place Friday.\n \"The government must stop trying to execute Corey Johnson while he is still recovering from the COVID-19 infection he contracted as a result of the government's own irresponsibility in carrying out executions during the pandemic,\" Donald Salzman, an attorney for Johnson, had said in a statement earlier Thursday.\n \"There is no principled reason not to wait until the injunction expires in March to assess whether Mr. Johnson's lungs have healed sufficiently that he will not suffer excruciating pain during an execution.\"\n After Johnson's death, his legal team mourned his passing in a statement, saying that he should never have been executed.\n \"We loved Corey Johnson, and we knew him as a gentle soul who never broke a rule in prison and kept trying, despite his limitations, to pass the GED. His family and loved ones are in our hearts,\" his attorneys said. \"We wish also to say that the fact Corey Johnson should never have been executed cannot diminish the pain and loss experienced by the families of the victims in this case. We wish them peace and healing.\"\n Johnson's legal team has also said that he has an IQ of 69, which would be lower than one standard offered by the Supreme Court as a guide for states weighing whether such an execution met the Constitution's cruel and unusual punishment standards.\n \"He is a person with intellectual disability who cannot constitutionally be executed,\" Salzman argued Thursday morning. \"The government should withdraw Corey's execution date, or President Trump should grant him clemency.\"\n According to the US Justice Department, Johnson and several co-conspirators were partners between 1989 and 1992 in a \"large drug-trafficking conspiracy\" based in Richmond, Virginia.\n As part of their operation, the department said, Johnson murdered seven people over \"perceived slights or rivalry in the drug trade\" -- Peyton Johnson, Louis Johnson, Bobby Long, Dorothy Armstrong, Anthony Carter, Linwood Chiles and Curtis Thorne. Johnson said each name in his final statement, saying, \"I want these names to be remembered.\"\n Johnson was found guilty of seven counts of capital murder in 1993, with the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia jury unanimously recommending seven death sentences.\n Thursday's execution, six days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, coincides with a new push from more than three dozen members of Congress for Biden's incoming administration to prioritize abolishing the death penalty in all jurisdictions.\n While Biden has pledged to abolish the federal death penalty and to give incentives to states to stop seeking death sentences as a part of his criminal justice plan, 40 members of Congress want to make sure the practice ends on his first day in office.\n As part of his final words, Johnson made mention of his last meal.\n \"The pizza and strawberry shake were wonderful, but I didn't get the jelly-filled donuts that I ordered,\" he said. \"What's with that? This should be fixed.\"\n This story has been updated with Johnson's final statement and a statement from his attorneys.",

        "title": "No alcohol and no checked guns: Airlines tighten security for Inauguration Day",
        "body_text": "Airlines and the Transportation Security Administration are stepping up security for flights to and from Washington, DC, amid threats of additional violence.\n The FBI has received information indicating \"armed protests\" have been planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN.\n In response, the TSA is increasing passenger screenings and airlines are banning some guns and alcohol and taking extra measures to keep airline crew members safe.\n Delta Air Lines (DAL) announced Thursday it will not accept firearms as checked baggage on Washington-bound flights.\n \"We're going to not allow anyone to check a firearm into any of the metro DC airports starting this weekend and carrying through the next week, unless you're law enforcement and you're authorized to be carrying one,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in an appearance on CNBC.\n Passengers, with only a few law enforcement-related exceptions, are prohibited from carrying firearms, ammunition and other weapons onboard a plane.  But the TSA does allow the transportation of an unloaded weapon in a locked and hard-sided container as checked baggage in a passenger plane's baggage hold.\n After Delta's announcement, all the other major US airlines - American, United, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue and Spirit airlines - announced they all were instituting the same policy banning checked firearms on Washington-bound flights. United will also ban guns on flights to Richmond, Virginia.\n American said that active duty military members traveling on Defense Department orders are exempt from the policy, and that it would waive fare differences for customers needing to rebook travel as a result of this temporary policy change. It added that passengers returning to Washington on a round-trip ticket should contact customer service about guns they might have checked on their outbound flight.\n American Airlines (AAL) told CNN Wednesday it is suspending alcoholic beverage service on flights to and from DC area airports between January 16 and January 21.\n The airline said it also has revised its pre-departure announcements to further emphasize the importance of following crew member instructions and complying with mandatory face-covering policies.\n There were reports of rowdy passengers on some DC-bound flights around the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Alaska Air (ALK) banned 14 passengers on a January 7 flight from Washington Dulles Airport to Seattle because they were \"non-mask compliant, rowdy, argumentative and harassed our crew members.\n Bastian said that 99.99% of passengers have been well behaved, but said it would take action against problem passengers.\n Southwest Airlines told CNN it currently does not serve alcohol on any flights due to service changes related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n TSA told CNN Wednesday that it is instituting a second screening of some passengers boarding flights, in addition to standard screening procedures at TSA checkpoints.\n \"This is a routine practice and represents one of the multiple layers of security that we employ,\" agency spokesman Carter Langston told CNN when asked about an account of TSA officers stopping passengers at the gate of a Washington-bound flight to check identification and bags.\n \"It may occur with greater frequency due to recent and upcoming events, but it is a routine practice,\" Langston said.\n The screening of Washington-bound passengers is in addition to a heightened security and police presence at the three DC-area airports that has included armored vehicles and a notable increase in the number of visible officers in terminals. TSA told CNN on Monday that the agency is on \"high alert.\"\n American is relocating crew members from hotels in downtown Washington to those closer to airports. It will provide them private transportation between hotels and airports through January 24, and increase staffing at DC-area airports.\n Airlines are also taking extra precautions during the pandemic. All the airlines have announced bans on future flights for passengers who do not comply with their mask mandates put into place last June.\n Bastian said on a conference call Thursday that Delta has banned more than 800 passengers since the start of the mask mandate. A number of those have been banned in just the last week, although he said that it's \"not a huge number.\" He earlier told CNBC that 99.99% of passengers were behaving, but that it would take the steps needed to deal with unruly passengers.\n \"We're all on high alert, based on the events over the past couple of weeks up in Washington,\" Bastian said on CNBC. \"We are doing an awful lot in terms of gathering information and talking to the intelligence agencies both federal and local as well as FAA and TSA. We've increased the amount of security, both at airports and in the skies, seen and unseen.\"\n Alaska Air (ALK) banned 14 passengers on a single flight from Washington to Seattle the day after the attack on the Capitol, saying that they were \"non-mask compliant, rowdy, argumentative and harassed our crew members.\" On Thursday the airline  announced it was instituting a new policy of ordering DC-bound passengers to remain in their seats for the final 60 minutes before landing, and for 60 minutes after takeoff on flights leaving DC airports.\n The Federal Aviation Administration also said it it is launching a \"special emphasis enforcement program\" to crack down on passengers who \"assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crew member in the performance of a crew member's duties.\"\n FAA Administrator Steve Dickson wrote in an order that the agency recently has seen a \"proliferation\" of incidents of passengers refusing to comply with pandemic-related safety measures, such as wearing masks, as well as an increase in bad behavior \"following the January 6, 2021 violence at the US Capitol.\"  The agency can fine passengers up to $35,000 for violations.\n On Tuesday the FBI has publicly acknowledged for the first time that it is considering adding individuals who attacked the US Capital last week to the federal no-fly list.\n -- CNN's Zachary Cohen and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The Trump administration is inflicting even more damage on Chinese businesses \u2014 including smartphone maker Xiaomi \u2014 with just days to go before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\n The addition is worrisome news for Xiaomi, which recently surpassed Apple (AAPL) to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, according to market intelligence firm IDC. The company's stock plunged more than 10% in Hong Kong on Friday.\n The Defense Department said in a statement that it is \"determined to highlight and counter\" the relationship between China's military and firms that \"appear to be civilian entities\" but which support the military with advanced technology and expertise.\n Beijing on Friday blasted the new restrictions as an abuse of power by the United States.\n American industry has a \"long history\" of civil-military relationships, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters at a regular press briefing, accusing the Trump administration of \"double standards\" and \"bullying.\"\n The US Commerce Department also put CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil producer, on another list that effectively cuts it off from American supplies and technology. The company was already on the Defense Department's list.\n \"CNOOC acts as a bully for the People's Liberation Army to intimidate China's neighbors,\" said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement, referring to the country's military. His agency claimed that CNOOC has been harassing and threatening offshore oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea by other countries, such as Vietnam.\n Xiaomi denied it was owned or controlled by the Chinese military in a stock exchange filing.\n \"The company confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a 'Communist Chinese Military Company' defined under the [National Defense Authorization Act],\" it said in the statement.\n Xiaomi added that it will \"take appropriate course of actions\" to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders.\n CNN Business has also reached out to CNOOC, Comac and other companies added to the US government lists on Thursday, but has yet to receive a response.\n The moves are the latest in a slew of actions the Trump administration has taken against Beijing in the weeks leading up to Biden's inauguration, and could complicate US-China relations for the incoming government.\n \"The new administration will likely not be as belligerent but may also not be as willing to unwind Trump-era policies as many might hope,\" Jeffrey Halley, senior market strategist for Asia Pacific at Oanda, wrote in a research note on Friday.\n The ban will cause \"immediate selling pressure\" on Xiaomi's stock, but will have little impact on the company's operations, analysts from Citi said in a research report on Friday.\n Before Thursday, the Pentagon had already added 35 Chinese companies to its military list, including chipmaker SMIC and tech firm Huawei. The Commerce Department has also imposed restrictions on many companies. (SMIC has denied that it has a relationship with the Chinese military, while Huawei has denied various US allegations that it poses a risk to national security.)\n The New York Stock Exchange also announced last week that it would delist three Chinese telecom company stocks to comply with US President Donald Trump's executive order banning American investment in certain companies.",

        "title": "Mitch McConnell's dilemma ",
        "body_text": "Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nThe die is cast. The House impeached President Donald Trump Wednesday for inciting an insurrection against the United States government, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has decided the trial should take place next week, when Senate Democrats will be in charge of the chamber.\n This is significant because the majority determines the impeachment trial rules, just as Republicans did during Trump's first trial. We don't know exactly what kinds of changes this may bring to Trump's second impeachment trial, but the President cannot rely on Senate Republicans to construct for him a procedural fortress. This time, Trump is largely on his own.\n There are a number of political issues at play for McConnell and his Republican conference, and reasonable people of goodwill are going to reach different conclusions about them. People I respect tremendously, like Republicans Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the House and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, for instance, both voted to certify the Electoral College, making President-elect Joe Biden's victory official, but split on whether impeaching Trump is the right answer for our country.\n Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who stood with the Constitution last Wednesday as a violent mob stormed the capitol, has concluded an impeachment trial cannot take place after a President leaves office. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, one of the most thoughtful Republican leaders I've ever known, is wrestling with whether impeachment is \"best to heal our country.\"\n And on top of all that, polling taken since the attack shows that Trump remains popular among many Republicans and is likely the frontrunner for the 2024 nomination, should he run for a third time.\n Every Senator has his or her own political fortunes, morals and futures to think about. Senators are different from House members; they are not \"in cycle\" every two years (and this occasionally breeds courage and statesmanship during the intervening four years), and most are far more confident in their own political positions back home than the average representative. And the Senate, as designed and described by the Founding Fathers, is supposed to be the more sober, thoughtful and measured of the two chambers. I am sure many -- if not most -- senators are asking: If Trump's conduct isn't impeachable, then what is?\n Republican Senators, 17 of whom would be required to convict Trump -- if all 50 Democrats do as well -- must tackle three questions: Can political violence and a direct assault on the Constitution and Congress go unpunished? Is it worth it (or allowable) to convict Trump after he leaves office? And, if the Republican Party has reached the political limits of Trumpism, is conviction a good way of separating the GOP from Trump? The answers aren't so simple, as we've seen in the mixed signals from Senators so far.\n Even aside from from last Wednesday's shameful events, Republicans know there's a limit to what Trump can do politically. In two national elections, he received a smaller percentage of the vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012, and Republicans aren't in control of anything in Washington as Trump leaves town. One of Trump's final acts was to sabotage Republican chances in the Georgia Senate runoffs, costing the GOP its majority.\n If a Senator believes Trump to be the wrong person to lead the Republican Party moving forward, and/or that he must be punished for subversive actions, the question then becomes: Does convicting him make him go away faster or does it make him a martyr? I've seen persuasive arguments on both sides of this question.\n Even before last Wednesday, Republican leaders were wondering what to do with Trump (or, perhaps, what he would do to them). Trump was defeated, fair and square, but has clearly been a source of new people and new money for the Republican Party, even as he's also a source for the disastrous lie that he won in a landslide.\n He is also the single greatest motivator for new Democratic voters and money, driving up their turnout more than his own. He clearly doesn't intend to retire from politics, and grassroots Republicans remain grateful that he smashed the Clintons and routinely smashes the media. He has also caused a great many Republicans to buy into the magical thinking that he -- and he alone -- possesses some secret political sauce that delivered him the presidency in 2016 against all odds, and would have in 2020 had he not been \"cheated.\"\n And perhaps most disturbingly, he has signaled a future where extra-constitutional, extra-procedural and extra-legal measures can and will be taken when political outcomes don't go his way. The call to the Georgia Secretary of State, the vulgar harassment of Mike Pence, the organization of the deadly mob -- all of it stems from an unwillingness not just to accept the results of the election and a desire to subvert the legislative branch of government, but also to ignore the finality of decisions made by the judicial branch.\n No matter what Republicans do with Trump, I fear we've entered a political period when far too many on the right and left are willing to tolerate political violence and rule breaking. For a solid year, many on the left have tolerated riots and mobs in major American cities (along with the flouting of Covid-19 safety measures) with the explanation that as long as the cause is righteous you can do what you want. One could make the argument that Trump's supporters have simply adopted that frame of mind; we know that Trump didn't win, but they don't.\n Mind you, none of this is good, helpful or in adherence with American democratic norms, nor should it be tolerated. But it exists as part of our reality, so we must deal honestly with it.\n The second impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump will be the first true reckoning on the question of what our political class intends to do about it.",

She said the technicians have been eager to sign up to learn how to give shots.\n \"We've had pharmacy techs from all over the country excited to help solve this pandemic,\" Arnold said.\n It's not difficult to teach someone how to give a vaccination, said Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n \"Training to do injections into the deltoid muscle -- that's the muscle in the upper arm -- is a very straightforward thing. You can train someone to do it accurately in relatively short order,\" he said.\n He said even someone without experience in giving shots can be trained in a matter of days.\n \"You teach them the basics and good hand hygiene and you start them on oranges,\" he said, meaning trainees are taught to inject oranges before they try it out on people. \"Pharmacy schools already have superb curriculum for all this, and so do nursing schools.\"\n On Tuesday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said states should \"move on\" from hospitals to venues like pharmacies in order to increase vaccination numbers, and that states have been given permission to start using 19 pharmacy chains and associations to administer vaccines.\n Since October, CVS has hired more than 10,000 pharmacy technicians to help with the vaccine rollout. They're currently helping vaccinate residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, and later \"they'll play a much larger role with the retail rollout, where we'll have the capacity to administer 20-25 million shots per month,\" said CVS spokesman TJ Crawford.",

Given the existing threats, Ms. Monaco's temporary role will be focused solely on the period leading up to the inauguration.\"\n The shift comes alongside concerns from authorities about more extremist violence in the coming days after supporters of President Donald Trump breached the US Capitol last week in a deadly riot that left five people dead.\n Federal law enforcement agencies have issued an urgent call for assistance in securing the nation's capital as the inauguration nears, CNN has reported, warning that domestic extremists are likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on Biden's inauguration and throughout 2021 after seeing the success of the Capitol siege.\n As a result, more than 20,000 National Guard troops could be in Washington to help secure Biden's inauguration, DC Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday, and sources told CNN that officials are considering raising the terrorism threat level, though one source cautioned no changes are expected as of now.\n Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol at a significantly scaled-down event. Biden said this week that he was \"not afraid of taking the oath outside\" and that his team had been receiving briefings in the wake of the violence.\n A former homeland security adviser in the Obama administration, Monaco has become a close aide to Biden. She will \"pause activities and engagement related to her nomination to serve as Deputy Attorney General\" while assisting with the inauguration, the Biden transition official said Wednesday evening.\n \"This is an all-hands-on-deck period,\" the official added, \"but the goal is to quickly and seamlessly turn full responsibility to the incoming Homeland Security Advisor and team as soon as possible.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information Thursday.\n CNN's Alex Marquardt and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Bigger stimulus checks. More aid for the unemployed, the hungry and those facing eviction. Additional support for small businesses, states and local governments. Increased funding for vaccinations and testing.\n These are key parts of a $1.9 trillion proposal that President-elect Joe Biden unveiled Thursday evening.\n Billed as the American Rescue Plan, the package augments many of the measures in Congress' historic $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill from March and in the $900 billion legislation from December, which was scaled back to garner support from Senate Republicans.\n Now that Democrats control both chambers and the White House, Biden is pushing for the big steps he says are needed to address immediate needs and control the coronavirus pandemic. He also plans to lay out an economic recovery plan in coming weeks that aims to create jobs and combat the climate crisis, among other measures.\n The plan calls for sending another $1,400 per person to eligible recipients. This money would be in addition to the $600 payments that were approved by Congress in December and sent out earlier this month -- for a total of $2,000.\n The new payments would go to adult dependents that were left out of the earlier rounds, like some children over the age of 17. It would also include households with mixed immigration status, after the first round of $1,200 checks left out the spouses of undocumented immigrants who do not have Social Security Numbers.\n Biden would increase the federal boost the jobless receive to $400 a week, from the $300 weekly enhancement contained in Congress' relief package from December.\n He would also extend the payments, along with two key pandemic unemployment programs, through September. This applies to those in the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program who have exhausted their regular state jobless payments and in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides benefits to the self-employed, independent contractors, gig workers and certain people affected by the pandemic.\n Lawmakers only provided an additional 11 weeks of support in the December package, which will last until March.\n The plan would provide $25 billion in rental assistance for low- and moderate-income households who have lost jobs during the pandemic. That's in addition to the $25 billion lawmakers provided in December.\n Another $5 billion would be set aside to help struggling renters to pay their utility bills. Biden is also calling for $5 billion to help states and localities assist those at risk of experiencing homelessness.\n The plan would extend the federal eviction moratorium, set to expire at the end of January, to September 30, as well as allow people with federally-guaranteed mortgages to apply for forbearance until September 30.\n Biden would extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits through September, instead of having it expire in June. He would invest another $3 billion to help women, infants and children secure food, and give US territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. And he would partner with restaurants to provide food to needy Americans and jobs to laid-off restaurant workers.\n The plan calls on Congress to create a $25 billion emergency fund and add $15 billion to an existing grant program to help child care providers, including family child care homes, to pay for rent, utilities, and payroll, and increased costs associated with the pandemic like personal protective equipment.\n It also proposes expanding the child care tax credit for one year so that families will get back as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13.\n Biden wants to boost the Child Tax Credit to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those between ages 6 and 17 for a year. The credit would also be made fully refundable.\n And he proposes to raise the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for a year to close to $1,500 for childless adults, increase the income limit for the credit to about $21,000 and expand the age range of eligibility to cover older workers.\n Both of these are aimed at supporting low-income families, including millions of essential workers.\n Biden is also calling on Congress to subsidize through September the premiums of those who lost their work-based health insurance.\n He wants to increase and expand the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies so that enrollees don't have to pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage -- which is also one of his campaign promises. (The law is facing a challenge from Republican-led states that is currently before the Supreme Court.)\n Also, he wants Congress to provide $4 billion for mental health and substance use disorder services and $20 billion to meet the health care needs of veterans.\n The plan would reinstate the paid sick and family leave benefits that expired at the end of December until September 30.\n It would extend the benefit to workers employed at businesses with more than 500 employees and less than 50, as well as federal workers who were excluded from the original program.\n Under Biden's proposal, people who are sick or quarantining, or caring for a child whose school is closed, will receive 14 weeks of paid leave. The government will reimburse employers with fewer than 500 workers for the full cost of providing the leave.\n The plan calls for providing $15 billion to create a new grant program for small business owners, separate from the existing Paycheck Protection Program.\n It also proposes making a $35 billion investment in some state, local, tribal, and non-profit financing programs that make low-interest loans and provide venture capital to entrepreneurs.\n Biden wants to send $350 billion to state, local and territorial governments to keep their frontline workers employed, distribute the vaccine, increase testing, reopen schools and maintain vital services.\n Asked during a call with reporters whether states could use the funds to offset declines in tax revenue spurred by the pandemic, a senior Biden administration official did not clarify. The aid is intended to be flexible, an official told CNN later.\n Additional assistance to states has been among the most controversial elements of the congressional rescue packages, with Democrats looking to add to the $150 billion in the March legislation and Republicans resisting such efforts. The December package ultimately dropped an initial call to include $160 billion.\n Biden's plan would also give $20 billion to the hardest-hit public transit agencies to help avert layoffs and the cutting of routes.\n The plan would provide an additional $170 billion to K-12 schools, colleges and universities to help them reopen and operate safely or to facilitate remote learning.\n Congress approved $82 billion in aid for schools in December.\n The plan calls for investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program, including launching community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units in hard-to-reach areas. Biden would also increase federal support to vaccinate Medicaid enrollees.\n The proposal would also invest $50 billion in testing, providing funds to purchase rapid tests, expand lab capacity and help schools implement regular testing to support reopening.\n It would also fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers, nearly tripling the community health workforce. It would address health disparities by expanding community health centers and health services on tribal lands. And it would provide support to long-term care facilities experiencing outbreaks and to prisons for mitigation strategies.\n Biden is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and to end the tipped minimum wage and the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities.\n This story has been updated with additional details.\n CNN Business' Anna Bahney contributed to this report.",

The threat of violent protests from election-denying Trump supporters and the presence of 20,000 National Guard troops will keep anyone from forgetting Trump's turbulent leadership, or lack thereof. The FBI has warned of armed protests in all 50 state capitals and the TSA is moving to restrict guns in checked baggage.\n Anyway, the soon-to-be former President may by then have already fled to Florida rather than stay in Washington to watch his successor take the oath of office. Instead of inaugural balls, there will be a TV special hosted by Tom Hanks.\n It will be unusual, but it will still be an inauguration.\n None of the pageantry -- inaugural balls, inaugural parades, inaugural luncheons -- is laid out in the Constitution.\n All you need to swear in a new president, now that the electoral votes have been counted, is for Biden to say these words, which are written in the Constitution, at noon on January 20:\n \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n Usually the chief justice of the US Supreme Court administers the oath, but that's a custom, not a requirement. If the chief justice isn't available, it can be another judge. Calvin Coolidge's dad, a justice of the peace, gave his son the oath in the family living room in Vermont after Warren G. Harding's death. The only woman to deliver the oath of office to a president was Sarah Hughes, a federal district judge in Texas, who was called onto Air Force One after JFK's assassination to make LBJ president.\n Most presidents have employed Bibles. Obama used two at the same time! But that's a custom. Theodore Roosevelt didn't use one.\n There's not technically any need for an inaugural address, although every elected president has given one. Some are short (George Washington's second was 135 words) and some are long (William Henry Harrison's was more than 8,000 words and the lore is he caught cold while giving it and died of pneumonia a month later). It's a valuable custom for a new president to use the address to lay out his (or, in the future, her) agenda and move on from what may have been a bruising campaign.\n Abraham Lincoln, after states seceded due to his election, tried to keep the nation together at his first inaugural. At his second, after the bloody Civil War, and with his soon-to-be assassin in the audience, he tried to sew it back up, with \"malice toward none and charity for all.\"\n Teddy Roosevelt talked about the importance of American democracy not just for Americans, but for mankind.\n FDR said the only thing Americans had to fear was \"fear itself.\"\n JFK said you should be asking what you could do for your country.\n And Ronald Reagan, conversely, said, \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\"\n Trump used his inaugural address to talk about how he'd end \"American carnage,\" but since Capitol Police recently had to retake the Hill from a riotous mob of Trump-supporting election deniers, you've got to assume he failed.\n Pay special attention to how Biden references his predecessor, soon to face an impeachment trial, during his inaugural address.\n A lot.\n Biden had planned to make a statement by arriving in Washington by Amtrak from Wilmington, Delaware, where the train station bears his name -- a testament to the days when he was a senator and used to make the round-trip home to be with his kids. That's off. He'll stay the night before in Blair House, across from the White House, instead of a hotel.\n Normally, members of Congress get a raft of tickets to distribute at will. This year they each get a +1. The public is being encouraged to stay away and the National Mall will be shut down. There will be no public parade from the Capitol to the White House, but instead a virtual parade bringing in people from around the country.\n The inaugural balls -- usually there are multiple and the new president makes a short appearance at several -- will be replaced by a produced TV show featuring stars like Hanks along with Justin Timberlake. This will feel very much like the Covid inauguration.\n All the normal VIPs, incoming and outgoing Cabinet members, lawmakers and Supreme Court justices are likely to attend, as is outgoing Vice President Mike Pence. Trump will not. It's rare, but not unheard of, for a president to skip the transfer of power.\n Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga will add some show-biz glitz to the ceremony, which will still take place at the West Front of the US Capitol, looking out on an empty Mall, a show of defiance to the people who stormed the Capitol on January 6, maybe. But also a reminder that this is a very singular beginning to a new administration. Read more.\n Andrew Johnson was sworn in after Lincoln's death and as John Wilkes Booth was being pursued. At the time, according to The New York Times that day, travel out of the city was restricted.\n There's precedent for pared-back inauguration ceremonies, even for an elected president. FDR took his fourth oath of office -- something now forbidden by the 22nd Amendment, which allows only two terms -- in the White House at the height of World War II.\n Andrew Jackson, Trump's favorite president, had to flee the White House as his supporters surged in to see him. They trashed the place.",

        "body_text": "About 10 new charges announced by the Justice Department on Thursday rammed home the message from law enforcement that it will find the participants in the siege of the Capitol that killed five people, including a Capitol Police officer.\n The new charges on Thursday rounded up two people who allegedly hurt police officers and a man who shocked many across the country by carrying a Confederate flag inside the Capitol, where he was photographed extensively.\n CNN has counted at least 44 federal criminal defendants related to the January 6 insurrection. FBI Director Chris Wray said on Thursday that more than 200 people have been identified as suspects, and he sent a message to those still at large.\n \"We know who you are if you're out there, and FBI agents are coming to find you,\" he said during an inauguration security briefing at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington.\n Kevin Seefried told the FBI he had taken the Confederate flag into the Capitol last week after he and his son, Hunter Seefried, came to the nation's capital on January 6 \"to hear President Trump speak.\" They marched to the Capitol following a person with a bullhorn, they told the FBI, according to the court record.\n The two Seefrieds were charged on Thursday with entering restricted grounds and violent entry or disorderly conduct inside the Capitol, according to a criminal complaint in the DC District Court. Hunter Seefried is also accused of punching through a glass window in the Capitol, according to court records.\n Kevin Seefried was one of the more highly sought-after people depicted in the riot as the FBI asked the public for tips last week.\n The images of him carrying the Confederate battle flag in the Capitol merited its own \"seeking information\" flier as the FBI sought to identify him; many other viral photos from January 6 haven't been singled out in such a prominent way.\n Seefried's alleged breach was the first time the Confederate battle flag, which persists as a symbol of racism and White supremacy in modern America, had been inside the US Capitol. During the Civil War, Confederate soldiers failed to penetrate Washington.\n Two men were separately charged for incidents of violence against police during the Capitol siege, marking the first notable federal charges for alleged crimes against law enforcement.\n Robert Sanford was arrested on Thursday in Pennsylvania and accused of throwing a fire extinguisher that hit three police officers in the head while they were in part of the crowd on a Capitol terrace. Sanford now faces four federal criminal charges related to the riot, including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers on duty.\n Court documents and images of the scene led prosecutors to allege that Sanford had hurled a red object, which appeared to be a fire extinguisher, toward police, striking one who was wearing a helmet. The fire extinguisher then ricocheted, hitting two other officers, one of whom was not wearing a helmet.\n Another man -- Peter Francis Stager of Arkansas -- faces a criminal charge related to allegedly beating a uniformed officer. He allegedly used a flagpole that had an American flag on it to hit the officer as he lay on the ground surrounded by the mob, according to court records in DC District Court.\n A video also showed Stager saying \"death is the remedy\" for people in the Capitol, prosecutors said.\n There are no known arrests related to the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick at this time.\n A judge decided to keep Cleveland Meredith Jr. -- who is accused of bringing a trailer of ammunition to Washington and texting about shooting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- in jail as he awaits trial. In doing so, the judge made one of the first major protective decisions among the serious cases related to the Capitol violence last week.\n \"If I had a more concerning threats case come before me, I don't remember it,\" Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey of the DC District Court said on Thursday during an hourlong hearing on whether Meredith should stay detained. On Wednesday, the judge had questioned whether the Justice Department had done enough to address a need to keep Meredith in jail, since he is now detained on two relatively minor charges.\n Meredith is alleged to have driven from Colorado to Washington a day before Trump's rally, with more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition and an assault rifle. He is said to have texted acquaintances that he wanted to shoot or run over Pelosi and shoot DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, according to court records. He also discussed \"war time\" and days of bloodshed after Trump's rally, law enforcement has said. He currently faces two charges, for writing the threats and possession of an unregistered firearm and ammunition, according to court documents.\n Prosecutors noted in the hearing on Thursday that they believed Meredith was a follower of QAnon and that he had headbutted another person in Washington last week in a road rage incident.\n Harvey rejected arguments that Meredith couldn't legally be held or that he could be released and monitored and wouldn't be a danger.\n New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner John Miller warned on a teleconference call Thursday that the temperature is high, as it pertains to the intelligence surrounding the inauguration. There are no credible threats to New York City, Miller said.\n \"Nothing compares to any past threats; we have never had Americans fighting Americans on the streets of the nation's capital, probably since the Civil War,\" Miller said.\n Miller said that the rioters had been successful in getting into the Capitol indicates it was a \"significant milestone\" for the movement.\n But he went on to say there's indication that the arrests made across the country may have hampered that movement.\n A recurring theme in the descriptions of allegations against federal defendants has been how many willfully surrendered to law enforcement after being identified as part of the melee and spoke to authorities about taking part.\n One man arrested on Thursday in Alabama, Joshua Matthew Black, for instance, spoke about spilling blood on the Senate floor in the name of Jesus -- while he himself was bleeding from the cheek, according to his criminal charging documents and images of him from that day and afterward.\n Speaking to the FBI later, he told them he had accomplished his goal.\n Wray, the FBI director, said in a inauguration security briefing at FEMA on Thursday that the bureau was monitoring all incoming leads, from calls for armed protests to other threats growing out of January 6.\n He noted the FBI has some \"confidence\" in its preparation and security for the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden next week.\n CNN's Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz, Allison Malloy and Paul Murphy contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Joe Lockhart is a CNN political analyst. He was the White House press secretary from 1998 to 2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. He cohosts the podcast \"Words Matter.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nThere was a rare moment of bipartisan agreement on Wednesday's impeachment vote condemning the violence surrounding the domestic terrorist attack on our Capitol. But Republicans and Democrats didn't do enough to focus on the months that led up to the coup attempt and why it happened. They focused on blaming President Donald Trump and the appropriate way to hold him alone accountable.\n Ten House Republicans voted to impeach the President, acknowledging his role in inciting violence. But many, citing the President's speech during his \"Save America Rally\" moments before the riot began, claimed there was no evidence of incitement and that the President was just doing his patriotic duty by encouraging his supporters to use their voices. And, as they argued against impeachment, they disingenuously claimed that it was in the interest of healing the country's divide.\n But lost in the debate was the root cause -- the big lie and who was telling it -- that set off the chain of events leading to the ransacking of the Capitol and the death of five Americans: The baseless claim that  Trump had the election stolen from him by a grand conspiracy led by everyone from the Democrats, George Soros and the late Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, remains the primary source of domestic discord and potential future violence and political chaos.\n This is what should have taken center stage during the hearing. While Democrats were rightly enraged by the actions of the President at the rally just before the march on the Capitol, each speaker should have spent more of their limited time at the podium to remind their colleagues and the American public of the lie that sparked this fire.\n Republicans voting against impeachment, not surprisingly, were not anxious to probe the fundamental reason of the insurrection.\n While focusing on process and what was in the best interests of the country, they chose to ignore the claims made about the legitimacy of the election. That's likely because they were part of the chorus spreading the disinformation. Remember on the day of the coup attempt, 147 Republican House members voted to block the vote of the Electoral College, in an attempt to overturn the election. A small number of Senators joined this seditious effort by forcing a vote on these outrageous claims.\n To this day, the vast majority of elected Republicans have not acknowledged the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n Not surprisingly, the President continued with the big lie at the heart of the whole problem. In his first video reaction to the rioting, he emphasized the election was stolen from him, granting his supporters a feeling of legitimacy in their efforts to try to stop Congress by any means necessary. In repeated comments and tweets, the President then gave lip service to opposing violence but never backed down from the lie of a stolen election.\n And if you think he might accept reality for the good of the country, you have not been paying attention. Even Thursday morning, his confidant, Peter Navarro, tried to justify the actions of Trump's supporters while still claiming that the election was not legitimate. He told Fox Business -- no surprise there -- that the 74 million people who voted for Trump are rightly \"pissed off\" because their voice was silenced on Election Day. He knows that's not true, as does the President and every Republican and conservative member of the media.\n Going forward, everyone in Congress needs to be accountable for the big lie.\n Democrats need to do this by focusing on the legitimacy of the election if they expect to push through Biden's agenda and avoid an epidemic of domestic terror around the country.\n Accountability for the Republicans will be them understanding that they can't have it both ways: calling for unity while still maintaining the election was stolen. Until the President and the Republicans are forced to reckon with that big lie, there is very little chance that our politics can or will return to the pre-Trump era.\n It is not an understatement to say our democracy rests on this. Whether Trump is convicted in the Senate is also an important symbol of accountability. And that goes for holding all of the elected officials like Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, accountable for their part in trying to undermine what has been proven to be a fair election. Failure to do so might lead to a repeat of the level of distrust in America's free and fair elections that led us to witness domestic terrorism on the Capitol and the first time a President has been impeached twice.",

        "body_text": "Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n In today's business news: Costco has some sad news for analog photographers, Taco Bell is bringing back potatoes, and Petco is taking on Chewy. Let's get into it.\n Costco\u00a0is shutting down its photo centers next month, so if you still have your 10th grade dance recital on a VHS that you've been planning to digitize, now's the time.\n This news is most relevant for those of us old enough to recall \"film\" and those hours of kinetic anticipation before seeing how your photos turned out. Taking a selfie in the early\u00a0'90s was really, really hard.\n Among the other photo center services that are going away on February 14 \u2014\u00a0wait really, Costco? Valentine's Day?\u00a0\u2014 are ink refills, the ability to take passport photos, and photo restoration. But if you still like holding physical photos like some kind of dinosaur, fear not. Costco still has an online photo center where you can get prints.\n Petco launched its third IPO in company history\u00a0Thursday, and the red-hot market welcomed it back with open arms. After raising $817 million, Petco's shares surged 56%,\u00a0giving the company a market valuation of about $6.2 billion. Side note: major props on Petco's choice of ticker: WOOF.\n Petco has had a makeover since it went private in 2016, my colleague Matt Egan writes. The company, now branded Petco Health and Wellness, invested heavily in e-commerce and building veterinary and other on-site services aimed at making it a one-stop shop.\n Pets (and the businesses catering to them) may be the biggest winners of the pandemic. Adoption is up, and people are spoiling the heck out of their bebes.\n Just look at Petco rival Chewy, whose shares have skyrocketed 273% in the past year.\n This will be a fun rivalry to watch play out. Chewy is an all-online retailer that's growing much faster than the 55-year-old Petco, but Petco is profitable (its operating income rose by 84% during the first three quarters of 2020 to $127 million.) That said, it's also saddled $3.2 billion of debt.\n Petco couldn't have picked a better time to rejoin the public market. US-listed companies have raised $14.2 billion through 49 IPOs so far this year \u2014 and we're literally two weeks in. That is by far the highest for this point of the year in stats going back to 1995. Besides Petco, this week also marked strong debuts for online lending startup Affirm and clothing reseller Poshmark, which spiked more than 130%.\n Our relentless coverage of fast food continues.\u00a0This just in: Taco Bell potatoes are coming back.\n We can confirm: Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes and the Spicy Potato Soft Taco will be back on the menu this March after being unjustly removed last summer.\n ICYMI, folks were pretty upset about that decision. \"Taco bell getting rid of potatoes is worse than my parents'\u00a0divorce,\" one person tweeted in July.\n It takes a lot of time and effort to prepare potato bites, according to\u00a0Liz Matthews, Taco Bell's global chief food innovation officer. That's why they got the boot. But the backlash was bigger than the Bell expected, my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner reports.\n I guess they've been\u00a0tot\u00a0their lesson now?\n Anyway, we shall not rest until we find out what happened to the Mexican Pizza.\n The\u00a0US national debt\u00a0spiked by $7 trillion during Trump's tenure \u2014 and it's about to soar even higher under Biden. Although adding to America's mountain of debt may be painful, my colleague Matt Egan writes, now is not the time to tighten the belt, considering the scale of the economic crisis and dirt-cheap borrowing costs.\n Jobless claims remain well above the worst levels of the Great Recession. The\u00a0United States lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since the spring. And last week,\u00a0a staggering 965,000 Americans filed\u00a0for first-time unemployment benefits, up sharply from 784,000 the previous week.",

He was sentenced to five months in prison, a $250,000 fine, two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.\n Loughlin was released from prison in December after serving two months for her part in the scam.\n A judge has yet to rule on the emergency motion.",

        "title": "Trump explodes at Nixon comparisons as he prepares to leave office",
        "body_text": "In his final days in office, President Donald Trump has found the parts of the job he loved replaced by cold legal warnings, forced video addresses and a shrinking circle of downtrodden aides, all anxiously wondering what life will be like after noon on January 20.\n Gone are the clicks of flashing cameras. Absent is the roar of a cheering crowd. Instead of a commanding final full week of winning, the President is playing the role of victim and not a gracious leader departing office.\n Trump has been consumed by the unraveling of his presidency during his last days in office, according to people around him, which included a casual discussion among advisers recently about a possible resignation.\n Trump shut the idea down almost immediately. And he has made clear to aides in separate conversations that mere mention of President Richard Nixon, the last president to resign, was banned.\n He told one adviser during an expletive-laden conversation recently never to bring up the ex-president ever again. During the passing mention of resigning this week, Trump told people he couldn't count on Vice President Mike Pence to pardon him like Gerald Ford did Nixon, anyway.\n Eager for a final taste of the pomp of being president, Trump has asked for a major send-off on Inauguration Day next week, according to people familiar with the matter, before one last presidential flight to Palm Beach.\n But the signs of his impending departure are everywhere -- including right outside his window. Workers hung bunting Thursday that read \"2021 Biden-Harris Inauguration\" from temporary stands across from the White House North Portico. It was visible from his third-story residence.\n Inside the building, Trump has been weathering a second impeachment and growing isolation from his onetime allies in sullen desolation. He has grown more and more worried about what legal or financial calamities may await him when he is no longer president, people who have spoken to him said, fueled by warnings from lawyers and advisers. He is weighing pardons, including for himself and his family, as he attempts to muster a legal team for another impeachment trial. And he is resentful of Republicans who he feels abandoned him in his hour of need, including the GOP leaders of the House and Senate.\n Aides have pleaded with Trump to deliver some type of farewell address, either live or taped, that would tick through his accomplishments in office. But he has appeared disinterested and noncommittal. On Thursday, it was Pence carrying out tasks ordinarily left to a president, like visiting national guardsmen posted at the US Capitol or visiting White House operators to say farewell.\n With less than a week left in office, Trump's staff is preparing to leave the White House campus for a final time. Many officials have already departed, but those who are still coming into the office have focused on the offboarding process and packing up their offices. There were signs of moving activity Thursday, including a gray van from the fine art movers Crozier. Debbie Meadows, the wife of the chief of staff, was spotted carrying out a stuffed pheasant from her husband's office and loading it into her car.\n The upstairs of the White House press shop now sits virtually empty. Desks where assistants used to sit outside the office of the press secretary are now vacant, with the exception of boxes and stacks of documents. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who has been largely invisible during the final days of the Trump White House, has also started packing up her office.\n One of Trump's Cabinet officials, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appeared on television from Palm Beach. Another official, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow, received applause from junior aides as he left the building.\n As one of their final acts, Trump's team is working to organize a crowd to see him off on the morning of Biden's inauguration, when he plans to depart Washington while still president and is expecting a major send-off. Even though some of his allies had encouraged him to attend Biden's inauguration, and Trump quizzed his circle on whether he should, few ever expected him to participate in the swearing-in of his successor.\n Trump told people he did not like the idea of departing Washington for a final time as an ex-president, flying aboard an airplane no longer known as Air Force One. He also did not particularly like the thought of requesting the use of the plane from Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n For now, Trump is undecided on whether he will pen a letter to Biden to leave in the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Some of his advisers have encouraged him to think about continuing the tradition. Early in his presidency, Trump liked to show off to visitors the letter he received from President Barack Obama, which included the now-prescient line: \"Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.\"\n Initially, Trump had planned to depart the White House a day early. But he now plans to leave on the morning of January 20. His departure aboard Marine One from the White House South Lawn will likely be visible and audible to the Bidens, who will spend the night before the inauguration at Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the executive mansion. Its use was offered to them by the State Department rather than the Trumps, who refuse to make contact with the incoming president and first lady.\n Final plans for Trump's departure were still being laid a week ahead of time, but Trump has expressed interest to some in a military-style sendoff and a crowd of supporters, according to a person with whom he has discussed the matter. Whether that occurs at the White House, Joint Base Andrews or his final destination -- Palm Beach International Airport -- wasn't clear. Trump is expected to be ensconced in his Mar-a-Lago club or his nearby golf course by noon on Inauguration Day, when his term officially ends.\n Having the outgoing president 1,000 miles away from the incoming one provides some logistical challenges. For instance, handoff of the nuclear football -- a 45-pound briefcase that accompanies the president everywhere he goes in case of nuclear attack -- won't be as simple as it would be if the two men were in each other's vicinity.\n A person familiar with the matter said the White House Military Office will ensure there are multiple nuclear footballs -- one to accompany Trump to Florida and one that will be ready in Washington for when Biden officially becomes president. The nuclear codes Trump carries on a card alongside the football -- the so-called \"biscuit\" -- would no longer work past noon.\n Though Trump, in private, still contends he won the 2020 election, he has fully resigned himself to leaving the White House and entering life as a private citizen -- and with it the potential legal exposure and business troubles sparked by his role in inciting the riots last week.\n The first order of business will be his second impeachment trial, which is now set to begin after Biden is sworn in. Trump is still enlisting lawyers to represent him during the proceedings, and appears to have soured on Rudy Giuliani, whose legal fees he has ordered aides not to pay. A band of Trump associates had worked recently to dissuade the President from listening to Giuliani because they believed he was providing him with misinformation.\n Instead, Trump is looking to a new set of attorneys, including potentially John Eastman, the conservative attorney who falsely told Trump that Pence could block the certification of Biden's win. A person familiar with the matter said Eastman could join Trump's legal team defending him in the upcoming impeachment trial.\n Trump's senior advisers in the White House have said they don't believe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will vote to convict him, but is happy to let the option hang over his head during his final days in the White House, given his deep anger at the President.\n According to those around him, Trump has been more focused on potential post-presidency legal woes since well before the November election, and his worry has increased in the months since, people familiar with the matter said.\n Yet he has also been lashing out at aides, allies and lawyers trying to protect him from criminal exposure following his role in inciting rioters during last week's insurrection attempt at the US Capitol. Some of his attorneys have tried to explain that his notion of a self-pardon may not hold up, which has led some inside Trump's circle to believe he is less likely to attempt it before he leaves office.\n Those concerns are partly what helped convince Trump to record a video on Wednesday condemning the riots and insisting they did not reflect his political movement.\n \"No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,\" he said from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\n Trump had seemed reluctant to tape the video, in part because he believes the carefully denunciations of his supporters make him look like he's caving to pressure to tone down his stance on the election.\n A source familiar with conversations said there was a coordinated full-court press by allies and aides, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, chief of staff Mark Meadows and senior adviser Jared Kushner to convince the President he had to come out forcefully against further violence and that if he didn't -- and another incident happened -- he would \"own it.\"\n \"Silence is not an option,\" the source said in describing one of the conversations. \"We need to break the cycle.\"\n After an ad-libbed video on the day of the insurrection attempt, Trump's subsequent appearances have been more tightly scripted, with heavy input from the White House counsel's office on the text. Trump has read them from teleprompters set up by the White House Communications Agency as senior officials look on, ensuring he does not diverge from the words as written.\n While Trump has long fretted about his potential legal troubles, it has only been recently that he has weighed anxiously the potential business downsides to his divisive tenure. The decision by the PGA this week to strip his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course of a championship tournament infuriated the President.\n Another discussion that could be hampered by the fallout from the riot he helped stoke is his presidential library. Before Trump's rabble-rousing speech, there had been talk of securing property in Florida and having Dan Scavino, his longtime aide, run it. But now there are questions about who would donate to Trump's library in the current climate.\n For a man highly attuned to the kind of pomp he believes affirms his elevated position in life, the abrupt removal of the PGA honor came as a blow not only to his bottom line but to his ego. And it provided an unpleasant harbinger of the life he might lead once he leaves office, without the fanfare that accompanied his every move as president.\n This week has provided him a preview of sorts. He has remained behind closed doors for most days, with no cameras documenting his moves and no audiences to applaud him as he goes about his day. The circle of obsequious aides that have surrounded him for most of his term is shrinking, replaced by only a few -- such as Scavino and personnel chief Johnny McEntee -- who will remain with him until he departs the White House.\n The President has been discussing his election conspiracy theories with his former chief strategist Steve Bannon -- who's facing federal fraud charges -- in recent weeks, a senior Trump adviser confirmed, as he pushes away advisers who tell him what he doesn't want to hear.\n Events that would ordinarily be open to press, such as ceremonies awarding the Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts, have been limited to only government cameras.\n According to one official, aides worried that Trump might respond off-the-cuff to a question about the riots and veer from the carefully scripted comments condemning the actions. They determined it was better to limit Trump's opportunities before the media.\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the year of the presidential election that Trump is contesting. It is the 2020 presidential election.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Dana Bash, Jamie Gangel and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "More than 38,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 in the first two weeks of the new year.\n Another 92,000 could die from the virus over roughly the next three weeks, according to an ensemble forecast published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n The numbers are scary and reflect what public health experts have repeatedly warned: While the end is in sight -- with the help of ongoing Covid-19 vaccinations -- the nation still faces challenging times ahead.\n With so many deaths from Covid-19, researchers said Thursday the pandemic will reduce US life expectancy by more than a year to 77.48 years for 2020 -- lower than any year since 2003.\n \"Some reduction in life expectancy may persist beyond 2020 because of continued Covid-19 mortality and long-term health, social, and economic impacts of the pandemic,\" Theresa Andrasfay of the University of Southern California and Noreen Goldman of Princeton University's Office of Population Research wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n Currently, more than 130,300 people are hospitalized with the virus, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project.\n In Pennsylvania, officials said the number of hospitalizations are nearing double the peak experienced during spring. Louisiana's governor said earlier this week the state was seeing a \"huge spike\" in infections and hospitalizations. And in Arizona, officials on Tuesday reported record-high Covid-19 hospitalization and ICU numbers.\n Hundreds of thousands of infections are added to the country's tally every single day, with the US adding more than three million new reported infections since the start of the month.\n In Los Angeles County, about one in three residents has been infected with the virus since the pandemic's start, according to data published by county officials. Outbreaks have increased across workplaces as well as schools and day care settings, they said.\n Echoing other leaders' warnings, the LA officials added they have \"not yet fully seen the effect of transmission in the period from around Christmas to New Years.\"\n And with all eyes now turned to the nation's capital ahead of Inauguration Day, cases in Washington, DC have never been higher. Right now, it's averaging more than 320 new cases every day -- about a 38% jump from the previous week. DC has reported a total of more than 32,600 Covid-19 cases since the pandemic's start, about 10% of which have been added in 2021.\n President-elect Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package which he unveiled Thursday, includes $160 billion in funding to carry out a national vaccination program, expand testing and mobilize a public health jobs program, among other things.\n So far, more than 30.6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been distributed nationwide and more than 11.1 million Americans have received their first dose, according to data from the CDC.\n According to CNN's analysis of data from a dozen states that publish demographic information online, roughly twice as many women as men are getting vaccinated. In at least three -- Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Nebraska -- women account for more than 7 in 10 people vaccinated.\n Experts say this may reflect who has been eligible early in the vaccine rollout: health care workers and older adults.\n Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Thursday that the state has vaccinated more than 1 million people since the vaccines were first distributed a month ago.\n \"This is the biggest vaccination effort we have ever undertaken, and it would not be possible without the dedication and tireless efforts of our healthcare workers,\" Abbott said in a news release. \"We still have a long road ahead of us, but Texans continue to prove that we are up to this challenge.\"\n Some experts have encouraged states to open vaccine eligibility to more groups, to help speed up vaccine administrations.\n In New Jersey, residents 65 and older and residents aged 16 to 64 with certain chronic health conditions are now eligible to sign up to get vaccinated, officials announced Wednesday. California also expanded its eligibility guidelines to include residents 65 and older. A news release from the state's health department added that healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities remain California's top priority for vaccines.\n \"There is no higher priority than efficiently and equitably distributing these vaccines as quickly as possible to those who face the gravest consequences,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. \"Individuals 65 and older are now the next group eligible to start receiving vaccines. To those not yet eligible for vaccines, your turn is coming.\"\n The announcements follow similar ones made by state leaders including Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, who earlier this week said residents 65 and older or those with preexisting medical conditions can make appointments for Covid-19 vaccinations.\n \"My main priority is not to try and fight this pandemic with stricter and stricter orders,\" Reeves said. \"It's to get better and better at distributing the vaccine, and that's what our focus is now.\"\n And while expanding the list of who can get vaccinated, states are coming up with more options for where residents can get their shots.\n The Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles will become a mass vaccination site with the capacity to vaccinate 12,000 people a day, Mayor Eric Garcetti said Thursday evening, calling it the \"biggest vaccination site in the country.\"\n New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is working on a plan to use the Yankee Stadium as a vaccination site, he said Wednesday.\n \"That plan is in motion,' he said, adding the city will release more details when the plan has been worked through.\n De Blasio's announcement came about a day after he and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen said a 24-hour vaccine mega site will be set up at Citi Field in Queens later this month.\n In Hawaii, officials said they are opening two new Covid-19 mass vaccination sites, which they hope can in a few weeks be able to vaccinate between 3,000 and 4,000 people daily.\n And in California, the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim is now Orange County's first \"super\" Covid-19 vaccination site. Hundreds of cars had lined up for its opening on Wednesday, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported.\n The site will be able to vaccinate upwards of 7,000 people each day, said Andrew Do, acting chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors.\n The National Guard is being used to administer the vaccines in 16 states and territories, National Guard spokesman Wayne Hall said Thursday.\n Pharmacies will also play a key role in helping administer vaccines.\n On Wednesday, the head of one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains expressed optimism that it could soon be giving as many as a million vaccine doses daily.\n \"We're very hopeful that the federal program will open up soon and open a more direct distribution into pharmacies across the country, which will open up access,\" CVS Health Executive Vice President Karen Lynch said Wednesday during the annual J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference.\n CVS can administer 25 million vaccinations a month, Lynch said, through its retail locations across the country.\n \"We have a large reach,\" Lynch added, saying the company's 10,000 stores can reach about 85% of the American population.\n Walgreens said earlier this week it expects to administer about 30 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine across the country by the end of this summer, once vaccines are available to the wider population.\n The drugstore chain said it is hiring and training staff and increasing digital and phone booking capabilities in preparation for the wider vaccine rollout.\n \"We're making sure that everyone is ready to get after this as soon as the vaccines become available en masse, which we believe will be probably March, April,\" Walgreens COO Alexander Gourlay said at the conference.\n CNN's Amanda Watts, Alexandra Meeks, Gregory Lemos, Lauren del Valle, Jamiel Lynch, Michael Nedelman, Sarah Moon and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Ex-Obama official who helped fix botched healthcare.gov rollout to join Biden's Covid-19 team",
        "body_text": "Andy Slavitt, the former acting chief of Medicare and Medicaid under the Obama administration, is expected to join President-elect Joe Biden's Covid-19 team in a senior advisory role, CNN has learned.\n Slavitt's role is expected to be temporary, sources said, as the incoming Biden administration is days away from inheriting the daunting task of getting the spread of Covid under control and quickly vaccinating the country. The expected hire underscores the all-hands-on-deck approach the Biden team appears to be taking when it comes to the coronavirus, as it looks to meet its goal of administering 100 million vaccine shots during Biden's first 100 days in office.\n Slavitt declined to comment.\n Notably, prior to being named acting head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Slavitt had been brought on to help the Obama administration fix the botched rollout of its healthcare.gov website. That effort to fix the Obamacare enrollment website was spearheaded by Jeff Zients, who is now Biden's Covid coordinator.\n Zients confirmed to CNN Thursday night his decision to bring Slavitt onto the Biden Covid team as a senior adviser.\n In an interview, Zients said the decision to add Slavitt to the team was a clear sign that the incoming administration was \"pulling out all the stops\" to get Covid under control.\n \"He's totally battle-tested and I think he'll be invaluable in helping to deliver a clear and consistent message to the American people,\" Zients said. \"The reason we need to pull out all the stops is that this program is really not on track. What we're inheriting from the Trump administration is much worse than what we could have imagined. There's no existing infrastructure on vaccine distribution, so we'll have to start from Day One.\"\n Zients also told CNN that while the Affordable Care Act rollout problems had presented a significant challenge, the coronavirus pandemic and vaccine distribution were in a different league altogether.\n \"While I am proud of the effort on healthcare.gov, this is a different in kind challenge for the American people and the world,\" Zients said, \"and we need as many experienced people as possible to get this in a better position.\"\n Working hand-in-hand with Zients, Slavitt is expected to focus in part on messaging around Covid and vaccine distribution -- a challenge that incoming Biden officials have described as unprecedented -- including trying to build up public trust about the vaccine. A source familiar added that Slavitt will also engage medical providers, pharmacies and other major players as the new Biden administration works to vaccinate the American population as quickly as possible.\n CNN has previously reported that the incoming Biden administration is concerned about Covid vaccine supply issues and the speed of distribution. Complicating matters has been what the Biden team has described as a lack of full cooperation and transparency on Covid from the outgoing Trump administration. Biden laid out the details of his Covid relief proposal Thursday evening in Wilmington, Delaware.",

        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday evening outlined a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package to fund a nationwide vaccination effort and provide direct economic relief to Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic, telling Americans that \"the health of our nation is at stake.\"\n \"There is real pain overwhelming the real economy -- one where people rely on paychecks, not their investments, to pay for their bills and their meals and their children's needs,\" Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, in which he took aim at the nation's searing income inequality.\n He did not detail how he plans to move his massive proposal through a Congress where Democrats will have narrow House and Senate majorities, though both congressional Democratic leaders pledged to shepherd Biden's vision into law.\n Instead, Biden spoke about the economic and health threat of the pandemic, calling them \"once-in-several-generations\" crises, and cast delivering economic relief and rapidly vaccinating Americans as urgent challenges.\n \"In this pandemic in America, we cannot let people go hungry. We cannot let people get evicted. We cannot let nurses, educators and others lose their jobs when we so badly need them. We must act now and act decisively,\" Biden said.\n RELATED: Here's what's in Biden's coronavirus rescue plan\n The American Rescue Plan will include allocating more than $400 billion toward addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, including $160 billion in funding to execute a national vaccination program, expand testing and mobilize a public health jobs program, among other measures.\n His proposal includes $1,400 stimulus checks for Americans and extending and expanding unemployment benefits, including a $400 weekly unemployment insurance supplement, through September.\n Biden downplayed the deficit spending his proposal would require, saying that the benefits of aggressively spending to combat the economic impact of the pandemic would \"far surpass the costs\" and that the United States' debt outlook would be \"more stable, not less stable, if we seize this moment with vision and purpose.\"\n In a call with reporters Thursday previewing the speech, Biden senior officials expressed confidence in meeting the President-elect's goal of 100 million shots, which is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses, in his first 100 days in office.\n Biden has been pushing for Congress to increase the stimulus check amount to $2,000, which would be accomplished by passing the additional $1,400 checks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, rejected a bill last year that would have increased direct stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000. But with Democrats winning control of the Senate earlier this month, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer will become Senate majority leader, and Democrats have a better shot at passing the legislation.\n In a joint statement, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Biden's proposal, noting that it includes much of what congressional Democrats had pushed in recent months -- including the larger stimulus checks and funding for state and local governments.\n \"We will get right to work to turn President-elect Biden's vision into legislation that will pass both chambers and be signed into law,\" the Democratic congressional leaders said.\n The Biden officials criticized the Trump administration's vaccination efforts, with one official saying the country is \"woefully behind on where we need to be in responding to this crisis,\" and that nearly a year into the pandemic, \"there is no federal comprehensive strategy or infrastructure in place to ensure that vaccinations make it into the arms of the US population.\"\n The President-elect's speech came the day after the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time. The Senate trial could complicate and delay Biden's efforts to swiftly pass his Covid-19 relief and vaccination legislative package, as well as the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet nominees.\n Biden's plan invests $50 billion to expand Covid-19 testing, providing funds to purchase rapid tests, expand lab capacity and help schools and local governments implement regular testing protocols. Biden will also ask for $30 billion to invest in the disaster relief fund to ensure sufficient supplies and protective gear, and to provide total federal reimbursement for critical emergency response resources.\n The President-elect called on Congress to extend the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums and continue applications for forbearance on federally-guaranteed mortgages until September 30. He also requested an additional $30 billion in rental, utility, energy and water assistance for those hit hardest by the pandemic.\n He also made the case that Congress should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, a campaign promise from the President-elect.\n That proposal could meet major opposition from Republicans. But Biden pointed to Florida, a Republican-led state, saying that \"as divided as that state is,\" it just passed an amendment raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n \"No one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line,\" Biden said.\n Biden said he plans to also announce a second legislative package in the coming weeks focused on jobs and economic recovery, \"designed to invest in American innovation competitiveness, combating the climate crisis by investing in clean energy jobs and infrastructure, the care workforce and the caring economy.\"\n In order to aid struggling small businesses, Biden is proposing $15 billion in flexible grants to more than 1 million of the hardest hit small businesses. He is proposing investing $35 billion in government funds into state, local, tribal, and nonprofit small business financing programs.\n Biden's plan would provide additional resources for high-quality, affordable child care. He will request a $25 billion emergency stabilization fund to assist child care providers in covering their costs to operate safely. It would also provide emergency paid leave to an additional 106 million Americans in order to help reduce the spread of the virus.\n The President-elect proposed that the child tax credit be made refundable for the year, and that Congress increase the credit to $3,000 per child, or $3,600 for a child under the age of 6, and make 17-year-olds qualifying children for the year.\n The President-elect also proposed working with Congress in order to support restaurants, bars and other businesses that have disproportionally suffered amid the pandemic.\n Biden is calling on Congress to provide $350 billion in emergency funding for state, local and territorial governments in order to support front line workers, keeping them on the job and paid.\n \"Our rescue plan will provide emergency funding to keep these workers on the job and maintain essential services,\" Biden said.\n This story has been updated with details from Biden's speech and his plan.\n CNN's MJ Lee contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Known as Canis dirus, meaning \"fearsome dog,\" it had been thought that dire wolves were simply a beefier version of the gray wolf. However, a new study published in the journal Nature has revealed just how different they really were.\n The prehistoric carnivores roamed North America until they went extinct some 13,000 years ago. Dire wolf fossils are among the most common recovered at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.\n \"The going narrative has been that gray and dire wolves were very closely related, like sister or cousin lineages, or perhaps the same animal,\" lead study author Angela Perri, an archaeologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, told CNN via email.\n \"We were pretty comfortable with that assessment for 150 years, as that's what the similarities in their skeletons suggested. Now the genetics have revealed that they are only very distantly related, having split from each other around 6 million years ago,\" Perri added.\n For the first time, experts sequenced DNA from five dire wolf fossils, which were found in Wyoming, Idaho, Ohio and Tennessee, respectively. They date back to over 50,000 years ago.\n Analysis showed that unlike many doglike species that seemingly migrated between North America and Eurasia over time, dire wolves evolved solely in North America for millions of years.\n The animals' stark divergence from gray wolves, researchers believe, places them in an entirely different genus.\n \"This is surprising because we have thought they were closely related for so long. Their skeletons and teeth are very similar -- it is clearly a case of convergent evolution,\" Perri said. \"We also learned that they were so genetically distinct from each other that there is no evidence they could interbreed and produce offspring,\" she added.\n Dire wolves overlapped with coyotes and gray wolves in North America for some 10,000 years before their extinction -- but still, there is no evidence that they interbred with these species.\n The dire wolves were ill equipped to adapt to the changing conditions at the end of the ice age due to their evolutionary differences, experts believe.\n \"On average dire wolves are roughly 20% larger than the average gray wolf today. It also appears that they were adapted to living in low land warm environments, so we envision them being much more like warm climate canids -- shorter fur, perhaps reddish, with large ears for thermoregulation,\" Perri said.\n \"Much different from the huge, furry gray animals depicted in frozen environments of Game of Thrones,\" she added.",

        "body_text": "As vaccines start to be administered across the world, the beginning of the end of the pandemic is at last in sight.\n But some countries are at risk of missing out. While the African Union has secured 270 million vaccine doses for distribution across the continent, in addition to those promised by the global vaccine program COVAX, this could still fall short of demand for the region.\n Even if enough vaccines are secured, there is an enormous logistical challenge: how to transport temperature-sensitive vaccines to places without reliable electricity and refrigeration.\n The answer is in developing a \"cold chain\" -- a network of vehicles, fridges and cold rooms -- that can be used to transport the vaccine seamlessly from the manufacturer to the immunization point.\n \"We should have been designing the cold chain the day we started designing a vaccine,\" says Toby Peters, a professor in cold economy at the University of Birmingham, in the UK, who is working with the UN-backed Africa Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Cooling and Cold Chain to improve refrigeration networks in Africa.\n \"We knew we were going to have to move billions of vaccines around the world, all the way out to rural communities, and that we'd need a temperature-controlled environment,\" he adds.\n The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has to be kept at minus 75 degrees Celsius (minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit,) while Moderna's can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n These temperature requirements will be out of reach for most African countries, says Peters, but options like the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which can be kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), will be more feasible.\n Even so, existing cold chain networks will not be enough. Without new technology, up to 25% of vaccine supplies could be lost, says Peters.\n There are almost 600 million people in Africa living off the grid, and rural clinics often lack a grid connection.\n This is where solar energy comes in, says Hugh Whalan, CEO of PEG Africa, a company that offers pay-as-you-go solar-powered products to people in West Africa.\n In preparation for a Covid-19 vaccination drive, the company -- with funding from Power Africa, a network of private and public groups set up by USAid -- has started providing solar-power systems to off-grid health clinics.\n \"Fridges need power to run reliably in order to safely store vaccines, or else they will spoil. So we provide the power,\" he tells CNN.\n Previously, PEG Africa's refrigeration efforts had focused on establishing a cold chain for food products, helping produce get to market without spoiling. It is currently testing pay-as-you-go solar freezers among fisherwomen in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal.\n When the pilot finishes in the middle of this year, Whalan hopes to use the same financing and distribution infrastructure to roll out solar-powered fridges and freezers to health clinics and immunization points.\n Of the two fridge suppliers PEG Africa is working with, one has already received performance, quality and safety (PQS) certification from the World Health Organization, and the other is in the process of acquiring it.\n Before a vaccine is administered to someone, it typically has to travel from the manufacturer to an airport, to a national vaccine store, to a provincial vaccine store, to a local health center and, finally, to the end location where it's given to a patient.\n \"The last mile is the biggest challenge, and it's where there's the biggest gap,\" says Peters.\n Gricd, a small Nigerian startup, is hoping to help fill this gap. It's building solar-powered cold boxes for vaccine transportation that can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and can be controlled remotely and monitored in real time.\n The company says it has worked with Nigeria's National Centre for Disease Control and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research during the pandemic, helping to collect and transport Covid-19 test samples from remote areas. It has also secured partnerships with private healthcare companies in South Africa, Ghana and Egypt, says Oghenetega Iortim, the company's founder.\n The boxes range in size from 15 to 100 liters, with the smallest able to transport around 200 doses of vaccine. The 15-liter box is designed specifically for the \"last mile\" -- the final stage of the journey.\n \"It could fit into any existing transport medium, be it a boat, the back of a motorcycle, a bicycle, or a person's back,\" says Iortim.\n Since they run off solar-powered batteries -- which maintain a stable internal temperature for up to a week -- they are suitable for areas that are off the grid, he adds.\n They also contain a device that monitors location, humidity and temperature, and transmits this data to the distributor in real time.\n \"It alarms you if something goes wrong -- if the temperature suddenly drops or if there's a blackout -- and you can take proactive measures to make sure the vaccines don't lose their potency,\" says Iortim.\n While Gricd products have not yet received PQS certification from the WHO, Iortim says that the cold boxes are in the process of acquiring certification. He adds that the product has been certified by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria.\n This is not the first time Africa has encountered the logistical challenges of vaccination. There have been mass child immunization drives, for example, as well as vaccine distribution for Ebola and other diseases.\n But these have focused on certain geographical areas or specific parts of the population, says Peters.\n \"What we haven't done before is try to vaccinate the whole world as quickly as possible,\" he says.\n He hopes innovations in the cold chain for Covid-19 could produce wider long-term benefits, and be applied to both food and health.\n \"As we come to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in new equipment ... are we designing a system to solve a problem today, or are we designing a system which has lasting legacy?\" he says.",

        "body_text": "Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and other late-night TV hosts got a second chance to make fun of an impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n The pair opened their shows with jokes about the second impeachment, which has never before happened in US history: \"It was a day of reckoning in Washington today as the House of Representatives voted to impeach Donald Trump... again,\" Kimmel said to kick off ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on Wednesday.\n Kimmel mentioned that Wednesday's impeachment was bipartisan, with Republicans joining all Democrats voting to impeach.\n \"Your President gave a big \u2014 I mean little \u2014 thumbs up to an army of morons marching down the street, kicking in doors, killing a police officer and smearing their feces all over your office,\" Kimmel said. \"And most of these Republicans are like, 'Well, you know, the office did need some freshening up. Some color on the walls is nice.'\"\n The host then asked, \"I wonder if he's tired of all the winning yet?\"\n Over on CBS, Colbert covered the proceedings in a segment called \"Don and the Giant Impeach 2: Go Fast, We're Furious.\"\n Colbert noted that the impeachment article charged the president with inciting violence against the Government of the United States, which the host said was a \"pure dereliction of duty.\"\n \"That's like your doctor yanking out your IV, or a lifeguard drowning your grandpa, or the host of your book club failing to buy boxed wine,\" Colbert said. \"We were counting on you, Brenda!\"\n The CBS host also pointed out Trump is getting impeached with just a week left in his term: \"Do you know how bad of a job you have to be doing to get fired while you're getting fired?\"\n Seth Meyers spent nearly 13 minutes of NBC's \"Late Night\" talking about the impeachment during his \"Closer Look\" segment, saying that Trump has been mostly silent during the impeachment since he was banned from many social media services like Twitter (TWTR).\n \"However you feel about the merits of the Twitter ban, it's a huge quality-of-life improvement,\" Meyers said. \"It's like waking up the morning after construction finally stops outside your window. We no longer have to put up with President Jackhammer.\"\n Meyers then added that beyond being impeached twice, Trump also lost the popular vote twice.\n \"It's like entering the Tour de France, coming in dead last and getting kicked out for steroids,\" Meyers said. \"And then entering again the next year only to forget your bike, forcing you to steal someone else's and scream, 'you'll never catch me!' before crashing into a cow.\"",

        "body_text": "If there is one thing the people of a beleaguered, weary and divided America could probably agree on right now, it would be the collective need for a break from politics.\n Finding respite in popular culture from the stress of recent events, however, won't be easy. Politics and political figures are intersecting with pop culture, whether we want them to or not.\n That's because the selected photo showed Harris wearing a casual black jacket, white top and Converse sneakers, posing in front of a pink and green background (the colors of her sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha). Some deemed the choice \"disrespectful\" and not befitting the first American woman to serve as vice president, let alone the first woman of color.\n Vogue is, of course, the fashion bible so the controversy was the topic of much debate on social media.\n Schwarzenegger posted a video on social media in which he said \"President Trump is a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst President ever. The good thing is he will soon be as irrelevant as an old tweet.\"\n And lest we forget Schwarzenegger is a movie star, he used as a prop a sword he said belonged to Conan the Barbarian, the character he played in the 1982 film of the same name.\n \"Our democracy is like the steel of this sword,\" he said. \"The more it is tempered, the stronger it becomes.\"\n That's because the singer tweeted an invite for his followers to come to Parler, the social media platform favored by the far-right.\n \"BTLittrell come find me... hahah like where's Waldo, he tweeted. \"Join me on Parler Social Media!\"\n His mentions sparked plenty of anger and disappointment, with some expressing that they were done supporting the singer, while others argued Littrell had a right to his political opinions.\n Those wanting to join him didn't have long to act on his suggestion. Parler went offline after Google, Apple and Amazon dropped it amid complaints the company hadn't done enough to stem the violent rhetoric surrounding the Capitol riots.\n Parler has since sued Amazon, which hosted it online.\n I have gone on record with my stance that celebs have an absolute right to be politically active, as do all citizens, as long as they do so peacefully.\n But in the painful days we have already endured, with sadly more probably to come, it would be nice if pop culture could offer more of a distraction that many of us need right now.\n Oscar-winning actress Regina King makes her feature film directorial debut with this movie.\n Based on an actual night in 1964 in which Cassius Clay (soon to be Muhammad Ali), Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown gathered to celebrate Clay's heavyweight title win, it is adapted from a Kemp Powers stage play.\n \"One Night in Miami\" starts streaming Friday on Amazon Prime.\n What could be better than a blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe?\n In this series, Wanda Maximoff (played by Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) are two beings living idealized suburban lives while concealing their superpowers. That changes when they begin to suspect that everything is not quite as it seems.\n \"WandaVision\" debuts on Disney+ Friday.\n Is there such a thing as too many Kardashian-type reality shows? (You probably already know the answer to that.)\n Netflix has a new series that \"follows a wildly wealthy group of Asian and Asian American friends (and frenemies) in Los Angeles.\" The show promises plenty of glitz and drama.\n \"Bling Empire\" starts streaming Friday.\n The boy band Why Don't We disappeared from the scene for a minute and sparked #WhereIsWDW on Twitter.\n The group is back Friday with its sophomore album, \"The Good Times and the Bad Ones.\"\n Let's hope that title is an omen regarding the new music.\n If you love, love, love the British royal family as much as I do, let me hip you to this podcast.\n \"Royally Obsessed\" features co-hosts Roberta Fiorito and Rachel Bowie discussing all news related to the House of Windsor.\n There is plenty of discussion about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and baby Archie, natch, so I'm here for it.\n How well will \"Sex and the City\" age?\n That is the question now that HBO Max has announced it's rebooting the popular series, 17 years later after it went off the air.\n Only three of the original stars are returning: Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n Their costar Kim Cattrall said long ago she would not be interested in returning for more.\n Much has changed since the HBO series (and its big-screen adaptations) were out.\n Where have the lives of characters of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker), Miranda Hobbes (Nixon) and Charlotte York Goldenblatt (Davis) led them to this point?\n New York City always felt like one of the cast members -- and the Big Apple is definitely not the same. So, what does it all mean for the next chapter of \"Sex and the City\"?\n We'll be dealing with Carrie fever while we wait and see. (HBO Max is owned by CNN's parent company.)\n Happy 99th birthday, Betty White!\n The beloved actress celebrates her big day on Sunday -- and aren't we all the better for it?\n There are few in Hollywood who have achieved the level of admiration that White has over the course of her accomplished career.\n She truly is our \"Golden Girl.\"",

The statement says protests will be allowed in designated locations and will be limited to those with permits.\n \"Demonstrations will be limited in number and participants will be screened prior to entry and escorted to their permitted location, in addition to other safety related requirements. Only those holding permits will be allowed within the closed area,\" the statement from the park service reads.\n The statement reads, \"The closure has been ordered to ensure safety and security within the area of the National Special Security Event designated by the Department of Homeland Security for the 59th presidential inauguration.\"\n CNN previously reported that the National Mall would be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day due to security concerns, according to an official familiar with discussions.\n The official said there will be no big screens, no toilets, no panels were people stand, and that the public will not be able to get down to the mall where traditionally thousands gather to watch the new president be sworn in.\n President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol during a significantly scaled-down event on January 20. Biden said this week that he was \"not afraid of taking the\u00a0oath outside\" and that his team had been receiving briefings in the wake of the violence.\n Biden's advisers, who are helping plan the inaugural, say it is intended to be a virtual event. They did not object to heightened security restrictions recommended by authorities pertaining to the Mall or the area surrounding the White House.\n The restrictions on the National Mall were first reported by the Washington Post.\n Authorities are bracing for more extremist violence in the coming days after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed and breached the US Capitol last week in a deadly riot that left five people dead.\n A senior official with Biden's inaugural committee said in a statement that the committee was \"confident in our security partners who have spent months planning and preparing for the inauguration, including events on the National Mall.\"\n \"We are continuing to work with them to ensure the utmost safety and security of the President-elect, Vice President-elect, participants, and the public during this historic event,\" the official said.\n Federal law enforcement agencies have issued an urgent call for assistance in securing the nation's capital as the inauguration nears, CNN has reported, warning that domestic extremists are likely more emboldened to\u00a0carry out attacks on Biden's inauguration and  throughout 2021 after seeing the success of last week's siege on the US Capitol.\n More than 20,000 National Guard troops could be in Washington to help secure Biden's inauguration, Washington Police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday, and sources tell CNN that officials are considering raising the terrorism threat level.\n On Wednesday, Biden received a briefing from senior officials at the FBI, the Secret Service and key members of his national security team about the potential for additional extremist violence in the coming days, according to the President-elect's transition team.\n Biden had been planning to take the Amtrak to Washington next week to be sworn in as president, but those plans were scrapped amid the dramatically heightened security\u00a0surrounding the inauguration, two officials familiar with the planning previously told CNN.\n The US Secret Service on Wednesday officially took charge of security for\u00a0Biden's inauguration, working in coordination with federal law enforcement agencies and the Pentagon.\n Trump, who incited the riot at the US Capitol and has continued to spread lies about the election, has said he will not attend the inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence will attend the inauguration, according to a source familiar with the plans\n This story has been updated with an official announcement by the National Park Service and additional information about the inauguration.\n CNN's Sarah Mucha, Gregory Wallace, Josh Campbell and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A huge fire swept through Rohingya refugee camps in southern Bangladesh early Thursday, the United Nations said, destroying homes belonging to thousands of people.\n The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said more than 550 shelters -- home to about 3,500 people -- were either totally or partially destroyed in the blaze, as well as 150 shops and a facility belonging to a non-profit organization.\n Photographs and video provided to Reuters by a Rohingya refugee in Nayapara Camp showed families sifting through charred corrugated iron sheets for salvage. But little remained of the camp, which had stood for decades, aside from concrete poles and the husks of a few trees.\n \"Everyone is crying,\" refugee Mohammed Arakani said. \"They lost all their belongings. They lost everything, completely burned down, they lost all their goods.\"\n UNHCR said it was providing shelter, materials, winter clothes, hot meals, and medical care for the refugees displaced from the camp in the Cox's Bazar district, a sliver of land bordering Myanmar in southeastern Bangladesh.\n \"Security experts are liaising with the authorities to investigate on the cause of fire,\" the agency said, adding that no casualties were reported.\n Onno van Manen, Save the Children's Country Director in Bangladesh, called the fire \"another devastating blow for the Rohingya people who have endured unspeakable hardship for years.\"\n Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the fire service spent two hours putting out the blaze, but was hampered by the explosion of gas cylinders inside homes.\n The Bangladesh government has moved several thousand Rohingya to a remote island in recent weeks, despite protests from human rights groups who say some of the relocations were forced -- allegations denied by authorities.\n More than a million Rohingya live in the mainland camps in southern Bangladesh, the vast majority having fled Myanmar in 2017 from a military-led crackdown that UN investigators said was executed with \"genocidal intent,\" charges Myanmar denies.\n The fire destroyed part of a camp inhabited by Rohingya who fled Myanmar after an earlier military campaign, according to refugees.",

        "title": "Secret Service pays high rent for apartment near Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's home for toilets and office space for agents",
        "body_text": "The US Secret Service is renting a small studio apartment in Washington, DC, near the home of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, a source with knowledge of the service's activities told CNN on Thursday, in order for agents to use the bathroom and have office space.\n The apartment was needed to provide a \"downtime\" facility in the Kalorama neighborhood, the source said. The neighborhood is a popular residential area for dignitaries and diplomats, in addition to the President's daughter and son-in-law. Former President Barack Obama also has a home in the neighborhood.\n The Kushner-Trump home is substantial in size, at 5,000 square feet, and has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. But, the agents on the family's protective detail do not enter the home, the source said, though this person neglected to say whether that was at the request of the Kushners or due to Secret Service protocol.\n The source notes the rental of the apartment was not only to provide toilet facilities, but also to serve as a downtime break room for agents in the area. There is also office space with Internet and a printer, as well as a kitchen, where agents can refuel after long shifts and during hours where finding open restaurants in the area proves challenging, the source said.\n The Washington Post, which first reported on the expenditures, reported that since September 2017, the federal government has rented the space for $3,000 a month, or more than $100,000 to date.\n White House spokesman Judd Deere denied that the Kushners did not allow their Secret Service detail to use the bathroom.\n \"This is just another false narrative. When discussions regarding protecting their home were initially had in 2017, Ivanka and Jared made clear that their home would always be open to the incredible men and women on their detail. It was only after a decision by the USSS was made that their detail sought other accommodations,\" Deere said.\n \"The Kushners have a tremendous amount of respect for the servicemen and women on their detail and for the United States Secret Service as a whole. Their home will always be open to them and they have immense gratitude for their service over the last four years.\"\n When reached for comment, Secret Service spokeswoman Justine Whelan said that \"the US Secret Service does not discuss protectees.\"\n Later, a Secret Service spokesperson told CNN, \"The Secret Service makes every effort, particularly at a residence, to conduct protective operations with minimum impact on a household. In accordance with this practice, Secret Service personnel do not request access to the facilities at private residences. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have not denied Secret Service personnel access to their home to include use of the restroom.\"\n Two law enforcement officials told the Post that the facilities inside the family's house were designated from the outset as not to be used by the Secret Service agents. One official told the paper that they were unaware of the reason for this rule, while the other told the paper that it was established by Trump and Kushner.\n The Post reported that the Secret Service agents' predicament was unique in the significant extent that it took them to secure a bathroom, with one law enforcement official familiar with the situation telling the Post, \"It's the first time I ever heard of a Secret Service detail having to go to these extremes to find a bathroom.\"\n The agency spent months trying to secure facilities, including a porta-potty that was removed after neighbors complained, according to the Post.\n Then, law enforcement officials told the paper, agents began to use the bathrooms in a garage-turned-command post at Obama's house used by his security detail. That option came to an end when the Obama detail banned the Trump/Kushner detail after a Secret Service supervisor from the latter \"left an unpleasant mess\" in that bathroom at a date prior to fall 2017, the paper reported, citing a person briefed on the event.\n Agents then began to drive to Vice President Mike Pence's house at the Naval Observatory about a mile away to use a bathroom there, or used facilities at local restaurants, the law enforcement officials told the Post.\n In September 2017, agents reached out to Kay Kendall, who is chairwoman of the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, lives in the neighborhood and owns a house across the street from the Trump/Kushner family, she told the Post.\n The house has a basement unit with a bathroom, and when she asked its current tenant -- former Connecticut Rep. Anthony \"Toby\" Moffett Jr. -- if she could separate it off, he agreed in exchange for reduced rent, Moffett told the Post.\n The list of properties leased by the General Services Administration includes a property on the same street as where the Trump/Kushner family resides.\n The law enforcement officials told the Post that the agents in the Kushner/Trump detail approved of the studio, with natural light and a bathroom.\n \"It's been no big deal,\" Moffett told the paper. \"They have been very nice to our grandchildren.\"\n CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "North Korea unveils submarine-launched ballistic missile at military parade",
        "body_text": "North Korea has celebrated the end of a rare political meeting by unveiling what appears to be a missile designed to be fired from a submarine.\n Images released by the country's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) showed thousands of people and soldiers at a nighttime military parade in Pyongyang, the capital, including leader Kim Jong Un.\n The headliner, however, was the new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) -- which KCNA declared was the \"world's most powerful weapon.\" Pyongyang also showed off an apparent new short-range ballistic missile which, like its submarine counterpart, likely runs on solid fuel. Solid-fueled missiles can be fired on shorter notice than liquid-fueled counterparts.\n The display comes just days after Kim said North Korea was pursuing sophisticated new armaments for the country's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, including a nuclear-powered submarine, tactical nuclear weapons and advanced warheads designed to penetrate missile defense systems.\n Analysts said Kim's plans -- and the missiles put on display -- are worrying signs for the future of any possible disarmament talks between Pyongyang and the incoming administration of US President-elect Joe Biden.\n \"No matter who is in power in the US, the true nature and the true spirit of the anti-North Korea policy will never change,\" Kim said Saturday. \"The development of nuclear weapons will be pushed forward without interruption.\"\n Thursday's parade was held to celebrate the conclusion of the Eighth Workers' Party Congress -- a meeting for North Korea's elite to gather and reflect on successes and failures in years past and set an agenda for the near future. They are typically held every five years or so, but Kim's father and predecessor -- Kim Jong Il -- stopped holding them after 1980. Kim Jong Un revived the congresses in 2016.\n Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, hinted earlier this week that Pyongyang might mark the end of the Congress with a parade.\n The main focus of the Eighth Congress was North Korea's dire economic situation. The Covid-19 pandemic, sanctions and natural disasters have all upended Kim's long-stated goal of improving the living standards of all North Koreans. That dire outlook, however, has not impacted Pyongyang's ambitious and expensive plans for weapons development, regardless of its limited resources.\n \"Kim continues to show the world that despite North Korea's economic difficulties over the last year, the focus on sustaining nuclear forces and modernizing conventional weaponry has not shifted,\" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert in North Korea's nuclear program.\n Panda said the SLBM displayed was \"evidence of North Korea's growing sophistication with large solid propellant-based ballistic missiles,\" but noted it's also important to consider why Kim may have wanted to show them to his own people.\n \"These parades aren't just for the outside world, of course,\" said Panda, author of \"Kim Jong Un and the Bomb: Survival and Deterrence in North Korea.\"\n \"Even as Kim openly acknowledges economic difficulties, he can shore up his leadership by showing the people of Pyongyang -- North Korea's elite -- that he's been able to deliver on military modernization.\"\n The SLBM and the new systems announced by Kim during the Congress are at various stages of development, but nearly all of them would need to be tested in order to be considered operational -- the type of testing that's anathema to Washington. A test-launch of a new missile, warhead or nuclear device would likely set the stage for a showdown between the two countries in the early days of a new US administration that needs to confront a raging coronavirus pandemic and unprecedented political unrest at home.\n However, some analysts were encouraged by the fact that North Korea did not show off its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are designed to send a nuclear weapon across the planet -- potentially to the United States.\n The weapons systems displayed as a whole were less impressive than those trotted out in October, when North Korea celebrated the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Communist organ that rules the country. The parade to end that occasion included a gargantuan ICBM so big it needed to be put on an 11-axle truck. Experts believe the massive design meant it likely could be armed with multiple warheads.\n One of the most puzzling sights at the parade Thursday, however, was the fact very few people photographed were wearing masks. The lack of masks was unsurprising given recent history: very few masks were seen at an October parade and at the start of the Party Congress last week.\n But holding such a large, maskless gathering is very risky. Kim's regime has gone to great lengths to educate its people on the danger of the coronavirus and to stop its spread, likely because it knows its dilapidated health care infrastructure would be overwhelmed by a major outbreak of Covid-19.\n North Korea claims to not have recorded a single case of Covid-19, so holding a major event without masks may be a way to reinforce that narrative. But almost no one believes the country as been spared from a pandemic that has infected more than 93 million people and killed nearly 2 million.\n CNN's Jake Kwon contributed to this report.",

The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the authors. View more opinion at CNN.\nThe popular 1990s sitcom \"Seinfeld\" was often described as a television show \"about nothing\" -- a characterization that could easily apply to the Republican Party today.\n The party of Ronald Reagan -- once a stalwart of fiscal conservatism, free trade and hawkish foreign policy -- is now lost in a wilderness of its own making.\n Over the past four years, Republicans who have supported and enabled President Donald Trump have been more interested in retaining their hold on power than standing up for any principles or coherent policies. With no one to stop him, Trump, the only US president who has been impeached twice, has completely remade the GOP in his own disgraceful and pathetic image.\n After Trump supporters broke into the US Capitol last week in a desperate attempt to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory, 10 House Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney, broke ranks Wednesday to impeach Trump.\n Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who whipped Senate Republicans into line and enabled Trump's wild behavior, has indicated that he, too, has had enough. While it remains to be seen whether he will vote to convict Trump for inciting an insurrection, he believes impeachment might make it easier to get rid of Trump and oust Trumpism from the party, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.\n Some Republicans have shown a willingness to press the reset button in attempt to remove the stain of Trump from their party, but there is no going back. For every Liz Cheney, there are more than a dozen elected GOP officials who are still committed to Trump.\n Despite the fact that Republicans lost control of the House, Senate and White House during Trump's term, all signs suggest he will continue to control the party as its de facto leader, weighing down the more traditional wing of the party from wresting back control.\n Why are so many Republicans still sticking with Trump?\n As a result, many GOP House members are far more worried about losing their seats to a fellow Republican in a primary challenge than they are to losing to a Democrat in a general election. Moderate Republicans who are concerned about being outflanked by a challenger on the right may therefore fall in line with more outspoken and extreme Congress members to save their own skin.\n Consider the following: While the public's opinion of Trump has been remarkably consistent over the past four years, the political insurrectionists who invaded the US Capitol last week succeeded in dragging Trump's standing to a staggering low. A recent Quinnipiac poll conducted after the attack shows that just 33% of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as President. Nevertheless, 71% of Republican voters say they still approve of Trump, according to Quinnipiac.\n This presents an interesting conundrum for McConnell -- how will he get a popular but toxic ex-President out of national politics and away from the Republican Party? One might expect McConnell to use the guise of an impeachment trial to force Trump out of politics and remove the threat of a 2024 presidential run. But we're not holding our breath.\n What is \"The Party of Trump\" in a post-Trump world? The answer is quite simple: It's a party of dysfunction, at odds with itself. The GOP is now the party about nothing.",

        "body_text": "New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing the New York City Police Department and its leadership over its \"excessive, brutal and unlawful\" handling of George Floyd protests, James said in a news release.\n James also wants to install an external monitor to oversee the department's policing tactics.\n The suit, filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court, comes after a monthslong investigation into the NYPD's actions during protests from May through December over the killing of Floyd while he was in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.\n The investigation found that officers allegedly used \"indiscriminate, unjustified, and repeated use of batons, pepper spray, bicycles and a crowd control tactic known as 'kettling' against peaceful protestors,\" the  release said.\n \"There is no question that the NYPD engaged in a pattern of excessive, brutal, and unlawful force against peaceful protesters,\" said James.\n \"Over the past few months, the NYPD has repeatedly and blatantly violated the rights of New Yorkers, inflicting significant physical and psychological harm and leading to great distrust in law enforcement.\"\n The suit names the NYPD, the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea and NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan as failing to address a \"longstanding pattern of abuse\" by not properly training, supervising and disciplining officers to prevent and address misconduct, the release said.\n NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said Thursday that the department \"welcomes reform\" and but reiterated that \"adding another layer of oversight does not speed up the process of reform.\"\n \"Our reform does not start at the George Floyd protests,\" he told reporters. \"We've been in a state of reform that goes back many years. The suit as filed doesn't seem to meet the standard for a federal monitor and it doesn't seem to illustrate a pattern and practice which is required under the law.\"\n In a statement to CNN, de Blasio said he met with James on Wednesday and the two share a common goal \"to drive major police reforms.\"\n \"I couldn't agree more that there are pressing reforms that must -- and will -- be made this year,\" de Blasio said, adding that those include major discipline reforms and recommendations from a city Department of Investigation report.\n \"That work is critical and is happening right now. A court process and the added bureaucracy of a federal monitor will not speed up this work. There is no time to waste and we will continue to press forward.\"\n Patrick Lynch, president of New York City's Police Benevolent Association, said in a statement that what the city witnessed in June was \"a failure of New York City's leadership.\"\n \"They (city leadership) sent cops out to police unprecedented protests and violent riots with no plan, no strategy and no support,\" Lynch said. \"They should be forced to answer for the resulting chaos, instead of pointing fingers at cops on the streets and ignoring the criminals who attacked us with bricks and firebombs.\"\n The union submitted testimony as part of James' investigation, including testimonials from injured officers.\n The complaint filed Thursday includes dozens of examples of what the attorney general called blatant use of excessive force and other misconduct by officers. James said that since May her office had received more than 1,300 complaints, conducted a three-day public hearing and collected more than 300 written statements.\n A hospital employee on the front lines of the fight against Covid-19 at a news conference announcing the suit Thursday described how he was allegedly attacked by NYPD officers on his way home from a shift.\n Rayne Valentine, who works at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, said he was walking to a subway station after his shift and saw at least six NYPD officers pursuing and then using physical force against another man during a protest. Valentine said he began to record what was happening on his cell phone.\n The hospital worker said an officer told him to get back and that he complied, but the officer still charged at him. The lawsuit alleges multiple NYPD officers hit and kicked Valentine for about 90 seconds, leaving him bloodied. Valentine said he had to return to the hospital where he works to receive seven staples to close the wound on his head.\n James said officers struck protesters with blunt instruments at least 50 times, unlawfully deployed pepper spray on at least 30 occasions and pushed or struck protesters at least 75 times.\n James's office investigated complaints from incidents between May 28, 2020, and December 11, 2020, and found that officers conducted mass arrests without probable cause and \"targeted and retaliated against First Amendment activity\" frequently, the news release said.\n James' lawsuit joins others filed by groups such as Legal Aid and the ACLU, which in October filed a federal suit against de Blasio, the NYPD and its leadership on behalf of 11 plaintiffs who claim they were subjected to brutality by police while peacefully protesting.\n Last month, a report from the city Department of Investigation said the NYPD failed to anticipate the large number of protesters or violence during the demonstrations. That failure, combined with insufficient staffing and lack of training, led to poor judgment and excessive force.\n CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "'WandaVision' flexes some different muscles as Marvel adds its power to Disney+",
        "body_text": "Marvel flexes different muscles with \"WandaVision,\" leveraging major assets while stretching its creative formula in this first series for Disney+. The result wields more of a scalpel than a hammer, wryly celebrating the history of television while slowly, very slowly, pulling the viewer into an enticing \"The Twilight Zone\"-esque mystery.\n The first three episodes of the nine-part series prove stingy with significant clues, so the audience should be forewarned to buckle in for the ride. The satirical framework -- placing the central duo in old sitcoms -- will also resonate more with an audience able to appreciate how meticulously director Matt Shakman and head writer Jac Schaeffer have replicated them, unless the kids were weaned on programs like \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and \"Bewitched\" and will get visual gags about married couples in separate beds.\n The most familiar elements, happily, see the return of Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as Wanda and the Vision, the Scarlet Witch and synthetic android whose unlikely love affair migrated from the pages of the Avengers comics to the screen.\n They're reintroduced, somewhat jarringly, in a black-and-white sitcom episode, reflecting a real fondness for the genre, and portrayed with spot-on performances by the leads. The show features plenty of knowing nods to early-TV conventions -- including canned laughter, Kathryn Hahn as the nosy neighbor, and theme songs courtesy of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the couple that lodged all those \"Frozen\" tunes in parents' heads.\n What's really going on here, given where movie-goers saw these Avengers last? That's the fundamental mystery, one the producing team is clearly in no hurry to divulge. Patience becomes a virtue, taking in the sitcom homages while maintaining a watchful eye for sly Marvel references and cleverly placed dollops of color, presenting possible cracks in the black-and-white veneer.\n The usual special-effects pyrotechnics, meanwhile, are channeled into much more subtle triumphs of production design and costuming -- a TV show that turns decades of TV history into an ally.\n Overall, \"WandaVision\" serves as a shrewd and generally impressive calling card for Marvel's broader Disney+ strategy, after the high bar that Lucasfilm established with \"The Mandalorian.\" Unlike the smaller-scale shows produced for ABC and Netflix, these projects draw upon high-profile names from the movies -- with the still-to-come \"Loki\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" -- then showcase them in ways that emphasize character over cinematic blockbuster trappings.\n Of course, something structured like \"WandaVision\" can only truly be judged once you've reached the end of the journey. For starters, though, the studio's streaming vision looks quite clear, even if these heroes' black-and-white fate doesn't.\n \"WandaVision\" premieres Jan. 15 on Disney+.",

        "body_text": "Electric eels have been found to hunt in packs in the first documented case of its kind, which researchers have called an \"extraordinary discovery.\"\n Scientists working in the Brazilian Amazon River basin were surprised to find a small lake containing more than 100 adult electric eels, which are usually found to be solitary animals, and stunned to see them cooperating to hunt fish, according to a press release from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum on Thursday.\n \"This is an extraordinary discovery,\" said the museum's fish research associate David de Santana, who led the research team, in the press release. \"Nothing like this has ever been documented in electric eels.\"\n The electric eels -- a type of knifefish -- were living in a lake on the Iriri river in Par\u00e1 state, northern Brazil.\n They would work together to push small tetra fish into tight shoals, before hunting parties of up to 10 eels would split from the main group and attack the fish, stunning them.\n This behavior is reminiscent of packs of wolves and pods of killer whales, according to the press release, and is novel in electric eels.\n In this situation, with so many prey fish around, \"hunting alone would be less efficient,\" de Santana told CNN. \"By acting in groups the eels have more chance of success.\"\n While hunting in groups is common in mammals, it's quite rare in fish. De Santana said in the press release there were only nine other species of fish known to hunt in such a way \"which makes this finding really special.\"\n Volta's electric eels (Electrophorus voltai) can grow up to 8 feet long and produce 860-volt shocks -- the strongest of any animal on Earth and enough to power 10 light bulbs.\n These shocks last around two-thousandths of a second and can cause painful muscle spasms strong enough to knock a human off their feet, according to the press release.\n Normally, electric eels use these shocks when they hunt resting fish at night, stunning them so they are easy to eat, but hunting tetras in packs makes sense in some environments.\n \"Our initial hypothesis is that this is a relatively rare event that occurs only in places with lots of prey and enough shelter for large numbers of adult eels,\" said de Santana.\n However, there are likely many places in the Amazon Basin with these characteristics, de Santana told CNN, adding that he saw a small congregation of electric eels during a trip to Suriname in 2018.\n Now we are having much more access to those remote areas in the Amazon because of deforestation,\" he said. \"So maybe it will be more often that we are going to find this kind of behavior or that we're going to hear local people talk about that.\"\n The findings were published in the journal Ecology and Evolution on Thursday.",

        "title": "States skeptical of Biden's Covid-19 vaccine plan as they await the missing details",
        "body_text": "State officials are skeptical that President-elect Joe Biden can meet his goal of 100 million coronavirus shots in his first 100 days, with a week to go before his start date and a slew of unanswered questions still swirling around his plan.\n Multiple state officials and sources familiar with the Biden transition team's outreach told CNN in recent interviews that they are unclear on major details of the Biden team's plans -- including those for mass vaccination sites, vaccine supply issues and funding for local governments.\n CNN previously reported that the incoming administration is still deliberating major details of its national vaccination plan. Biden is expected to unveil his plans for vaccines on Thursday, along with a major Covid relief package that his advisers have told allies in Congress is expected to be in the ballpark of $2 trillion, according to two people briefed on the deliberations.\n The Biden team has been leaning heavily on individual states to provide critical Covid-19 data during the transition, due largely to a lack of cooperation and transparency from the outgoing Trump administration.\n But states have questions, too, starting with a critical one: Will there even be enough vaccines to pull off 100 million shots in the first 100 days?\n \"It's definitely aggressive,\" Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN.\n Hannan said she has been in contact with Biden's transition team about the challenges of vaccine distribution and that she isn't yet convinced the vaccine supply will be able to keep up with Biden's ambitious goals.\n The Biden transition team declined to comment.\n The lack of clarity has made it difficult for states to map out their vaccination campaigns -- and they're unsure whether the situation will improve under Biden. Sources familiar with planning in both Republican- and Democratic-led states spoke with CNN.\n Multiple sources told CNN that the Biden team has said it shares the concerns about vaccine supply and speed of distribution. Biden's team has also been asking state-level officials why there hasn't been more Covid-19 testing, the sources say.\n CNN previously reported that Biden himself is deeply worried about the array of public health challenges his administration is about to acquire, and his senior-most advisers are in a sober mood over it.\n While many state officials have raised concerns, sources have also described a widespread sense of relief. They note a stark contrast between the outgoing Trump administration's and the incoming Biden team's handling of matters related to the coronavirus. Multiple people described the Biden team as, so far, noticeably more engaged and willing to listen to local officials.\n \"What the states have been doing is fly the plane a bit as they build it\" is how one source familiar with the Biden team's outreach to states described their Covid-19 relief work under the Trump administration's watch.\n Both Biden's pick for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, and his choice to lead the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, have been particularly active in their outreach, said two sources familiar with the Biden team's outreach to states.\n In addition, an effort is underway to enlist Republican governors in the attempt to publicly push Congress for more funding to help with distribution and other Covid-19 mitigation, sources said.\n They have also raised the possibility of establishing mass vaccination sites, one development that has raised questions among some state officials.\n Biden has said he will look into tapping the CDC, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Guard and the military to launch vaccination sites in school gyms and football stadiums and to set up mobile units to reach disadvantaged communities. His transition team has discussed the potential use of the US military and the National Guard in Covid mitigation efforts with governors and the Department of Defense, a transition official said.\n CNN first reported last week that the Biden team plans to release nearly all doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to immediately administer more shots. The Trump administration has since announced that it will follow suit.\n One Democratic state official said they worried that while a more federalized approach like this may be innovative, it may not solve the problem of slow vaccinations.\n \"Just giving us the vaccine doesn't necessarily help, because we still need more people to administer it,\" the official told CNN.\n This official noted that under some state plans, medical providers are supposed to reach out to their patients to give the vaccine. But many smaller practices lack enough staff for this responsibility, and they don't have the resources to hire.\n While the Trump administration has come under fire for the lack of a federal infrastructure to help states distribute the vaccine, this official, whose state has not been in regular contact with the transition team, raised the possibility that changing the process now could cause more harm than good.\n \"A lot of that sounds very Pollyanna, because I hear the phrase 'mass vaccination site,' and I think to myself, OK, what operating system are they using to register all these people?\" the official said. \"It's all very pie-in-the-sky.\"\n For his part, Biden has publicly stressed the need for Congress to make more funding available for Covid-19 relief.\n His team is also grappling with how best to quickly ramp up vaccination rates without driving people away -- particularly those in communities of color -- who might be fearful of visiting sites run by, for instance, the National Guard.\n \"There would, hopefully, be a lot of tailored approaches to different communities,\" said Dr. Nicole Lurie, a volunteer adviser to Biden's team and a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services. \"Some may want and need help standing up mass vaccination sites; others may not.\"",

        "title": "New $300 weekly federal unemployment benefits start to reach Americans in need",
        "body_text": "Jobless Americans in many states are starting to see heftier unemployment checks, thanks to the $900 billion relief package Congress approved in late December.\n But many whose benefits ran out last year will have to wait for their payments to restart. And freelancers, independent contractors and certain people who can't work because of coronavirus restrictions will have to provide more proof of employment when filing new applications or continuing their claims.\n The new congressional relief deal provides a $300 weekly federal enhancement in benefits through March 14. And it extends by 11 weeks the two pandemic programs that were created in the $2 trillion CARES Act in March and were set to expire at the end of 2020.\n The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program expanded jobless benefits to gig workers, freelancers, independent contractors, the self-employed and certain people affected by the coronavirus. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program provided an extra 13 weeks of payments to those who exhaust their regular state benefits.\n Both programs will close to new applicants on March 14, but continue through April 5 for existing claimants who have not yet reached the maximum number of weeks.\n About half of states should be paying the $300 weekly boost by the end of this week, said Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. That's in line with experts' projection that it would take two to three weeks for many state agencies to reprogram the new measures into their systems.\n Several states, including New York and California, moved quickly to put parts of the new law in place. The California Employment Development Department, for instance, has paid a total of $434 million in enhanced federal payments to more than 1 million claimants, as of Tuesday.\n In Georgia, nearly 167,000 out-of-work residents received their newly extended pandemic benefits and almost 300,000 jobless claimants got the extra $300, as of early January, the state agency said.\n However, more than 239,000 Georgians who exhausted pandemic benefits on or before December 26 will have to wait a few more weeks to start the 11-week extension, though payments will be retroactive.\n \"We're pushing as quickly as we possibly can,\" said Kersha Cartwright, an agency spokeswoman.\n Laid-off Ohioans, for instance, can't submit either new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance applications or ongoing weekly claims at the moment. The state Department of Job and Family Services expects those who were already approved to be able to file by the third week of January. And it expects to start issuing the $300 benefit by then too.\n The latest relief package requires those seeking Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits to submit additional paperwork that substantiates that they had a job or were self-employed.\n Last year, state agencies could simply accept attestations from claimants about their employment and income. But lawmakers tightened the rules partly because the program, which opened up the unemployment system to many Americans who had never been eligible, has been contending with widespread fraud.\n The jobless who apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits before January 31 and receive a payment on or after December 27 must provide documentation to their state agency within 90 days, according to the US Department of Labor. Those who file a new application on or after January 31 must submit the paperwork within 21 days.\n Proof of employment could include paycheck stubs, W-2 tax forms or earnings statements, while proof of self-employment could include federal employer identification numbers, business licenses, tax returns or business receipts, the agency said.\n Oregon, for instance, is still waiting for more information about the new required documentation, among other program changes. The state agency doesn't yet know when it will start sending payments to people with new pandemic unemployment claims or to those whose benefits ran out last year.\n States have some flexibility in the documentation requirements and the deadlines, Evermore said. However, this could broaden the disparity between states, with some instituting strict guidelines and others less so.\n In Georgia, the state agency is still determining the best way for jobless residents to fulfill the documentation requirements, Cartwright said. The new rules place a big burden on state agencies to both collect and verify the paperwork, she said.\n \"It will slow everything down for everyone,\" Evermore said.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nStocks rallied to record highs as a mob descended on the US Capitol. But now that President Donald Trump has become the first American president in history to be impeached twice, investors are taking a moment to recalibrate.\n \"Everyone's trying to balance what this means in the short term,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told me. \"People aren't sure what to make of it.\"\n What's happening: Uncertainty about what comes next has forced investors to press pause. Stocks have been in a holding pattern for the past few trading sessions, and Thursday's futures are muted.\n One fear is that the looming impeachment trial in the Senate will derail President-elect Joe Biden's economic agenda. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it won't begin until after Biden is sworn in next week.\n The delay is bad news for Wall Street, which had been banking on the swift passage of another sizable stimulus package now that Democrats have control of both chambers of Congress.\n With the US economy under renewed pressure as coronavirus infections and deaths rise, stimulus checks, funding for state and local governments and enhancements to unemployment benefits are increasingly important.\n Biden, who is due to outline his economic rescue package on Thursday, has expressed concerns about Congress' ability to multitask.\n \"This nation ... remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\"\n But exactly how lawmakers will manage this difficult juggling act remains to be seen.\n Big picture: Wall Street is eager to look past what some view as \"political noise\" and let the market rally resume. Optimism that vaccine efforts will lead to a recovery in corporate earnings in the second half of the year remains strong, as does faith that central banks like the Federal Reserve will keep providing necessary support.\n \"The stock market only cares about the direction of the economy, earnings, interest rates and the actions of the Fed,\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in an email.\n Should the fate of stimulus \u2014 and therefore the economy \u2014 be tied to impeachment proceedings, however, investors may have no choice but to let the politics play out.\n Wall Street is cheering after Intel (INTC) said it had replaced CEO Bob Swan after a rocky two-year run.\n The latest: The company said Wednesday that Pat Gelsinger, who has led software firm VMWare for roughly a decade, would take the reins on Feb. 15.\n The announcement sent shares up 7%. They're rising another 2% in premarket trading Thursday.\n Investor insight: Intel's stock fell nearly 17% in 2020 while other tech firms rallied, as it lagged behind competitors in producing the most advanced microprocessors and struggled with manufacturing delays.\n In the meantime, AMD (AMD) stole market share in the key PC and data center markets, while Nvidia (NVDA) invested heavily in AI, my CNN Business colleagues Clare Duffy and Jordan Valinsky report. Intel's PC business also recently took a blow when Apple announced it will use its own processors, rather than Intel's, in its new series of Macs.\n AMD's stock doubled last year, while Nvidia \u2014 which is looking to buy chipmaker Arm for $40 billion \u2014 saw shares climb more than 120%.\n These dynamics stirred up a rebellion from activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point, who called on the company's chairman to hire an investment adviser to explore \"strategic alternatives\" aimed at regaining ground.\n Prior to his role at VMWare, Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, becoming became the company's first-ever chief technology officer. Analysts hope that given his technical background, he'll be able to make some important changes \u2014 and get Intel back on track.\n Dollar General (DG) is determined that its employees get coronavirus vaccines \u2014 so much so that it's offering to cover the cost.\n The pitch: The chain said Wednesday that it will give its workers a one-time payment \u2014 equivalent to four hours of pay \u2014 after receiving a completed vaccination, my CNN Business colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn reports.\n \"We do not want our employees to have to choose between receiving a vaccine or coming to work,\" Dollar General said in a press release, noting that its hourly workers face hurdles to getting vaccinated, such as travel time, gas mileage or childcare needs.\n That said: The company, which had 157,000 employees as of Oct. 30, called getting a vaccine a \"personal decision\" and said it wouldn't require it.\n Such incentives could become increasingly popular among employers that are hesitant to issue outright vaccine mandates but want to protect workers.\n But a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines across the United States may mean that even with employer support, some frontline workers can't access shots.\n Most states are still only vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, according to Kaiser. Essential workers, including retail and grocery store workers, are set to be vaccinated at a later stage, though their eligibility varies by states.\n BlackRock (BLK) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) report earnings before US markets open.\n Also today: Initial US jobless claims are expected to have ticked up to 795,000 last week, another sign of job market strain.\n Coming tomorrow: Bank earnings kick off with Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).",

        "body_text": "As Texas shifts its focus to large community vaccination efforts, some frontline health care workers remain unprotected.\n About 10% of the rural hospitals in Texas have yet to receive a single Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to a group representing rural hospitals in the state.\n Of the 16 hospitals which have not been allocated a vaccine shipment, 15 have sought doses from neighboring providers or pharmacies to get their staff vaccinated, Don McBeath, director of government relations for the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals (TORCH) told CNN.\n \"There's been a very high level of frustration for a number of weeks with many of the rural hospitals in Texas, because they were watching the state move into the general public category, administering vaccine, yet we had so many rural hospitals that have not even been able to receive any for their frontline employees,\" said McBeath.\n Last week, 25 of the state's 157 rural hospitals had yet to receive a vaccine shipment, according to McBeath. On Sunday, an update from the state on vaccine allocations revealed 16 rural hospitals were still not on the distribution list, including Golden Planes Community Hospital.\n \"We have not received one single dose,\" said Don Bates, CEO of Golden Planes. Some of his employees have received a vaccine from their local United supermarket, which had some extra doses to share.\n McBeath said that the surges of Covid-19 seen in Texas and across the nation are \"as bad or worse\" in rural areas, where small hospitals can't afford to have staff out of commission because there are so many patients who need care.\n If some of these hospitals have staff out sick or quarantining from Covid-19 exposure, \"you don't even have enough employees to run a 24-hour operation,\" he said.\n \"That's why we've plead to the state, over and over, to make the rural hospitals a priority -- to figure out a way to make it work,\" he added.\n Hospitals must have an application approved by the Texas Department of State Health Services before they can receive and administer vaccines.\n \"There are still some hospitals working to complete their enrollment as a vaccine provider. We've been working diligently with TORCH and the facilities directly to help them complete that process so they can receive vaccine,\" Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CNN. \"Rural hospitals serve an important role in providing care in their communities, and we will allocate vaccine to them as they enroll.\"\n Some hospital CEOs say the enrollment process isn't so simple.\n Bates said he's tried to submit the application for his hospital at least a dozen times. \"When you're on the computer with an application, and they request yet another revision, that kicks you into a loop of waiting 14 more business days,\" he said.\n Bates likened it to calling the fire department when your house is burning down and having them respond, \"Well, how many buckets of water do you need?\"\n He said his application was approved in the last week, but the hospital has not been informed how many doses it will receive and when.\n \"If we're approved, send me vaccine,\" said Bates. \"Let me get shots in arms.\"\n Nathan Staggs, CEO of Anson General Hospital, another hospital waiting on vaccines, said his application was approved Wednesday. He said nearly half of his staff have recently had coronavirus, and some others have received doses through local pharmacies.\n \"There was a lot of frustration for my staff -- 'Why can I go to a pharmacy in the grocery store in Abilene and get a vaccine, but I can't get one at work?'\" said Staggs.\n Around the country, the coronavirus vaccine rollout has been slower than federal officials initially projected. Just over 10 million people have received their first coronavirus shots and 29.3 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. At the urging of federal officials, many states are opening up vaccines to additional priority groups.\n The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement on its website that during the week of January 11, Texas will direct most Covid-19 vaccines received to large sites or hubs in the state to vaccinate more than 100,000 people.\n Bates said those major hubs could be hours away for people living in rural communities. As vaccinations become available to the wider population, he said his employees are still waiting for their turn.\n \"What does that mean for us? Do we continue to wait?\" he said.\n Texas, like other states, is working on speeding the administration of vaccines. The health department is communicating regularly with hospital heads.\n Bates said the message from the state has been clear: \"Get more shots in arms.\"\n \"Well, send me vaccines, and I'll do it,\" he said.",

Another gasses, beats, and shoots rubber bullets at people defending Black Lives,\" he wrote in an Opinion piece for The Guardian.\n \"And even though I live nowhere near Washington DC, this is personal for me.\"\n In August, Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot seven times by a White police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Blake survived but was left paralyzed from the waist down. His shooting followed a summer of unrest and racial reckoning and ignited widespread protests in Kenosha.\n Last week -- and a day before the riots in the nation's capital -- Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced the officer who shot Jacob Blake, Rusten Sheskey, would not face charges. Graveley said at the time Blake was \"actively resisting\" and armed himself with a knife. CNN has reached out to the district attorney for comment on the opinion piece.\n \"This justice system calls these people 'protesters', and they are protected by the first amendment,\" Justin Blake wrote about the rioters. \"Sheskey operates under this justice system, and it is unacceptable. He claimed self-defense after he shot Jacob in the back, in front of his kids, also in broad daylight. No plausible explanation exists for this escalated response.\"\n \"The fact that the Capitol insurrection and Jacob's shooting both happened in broad daylight shows how barefaced state-sanctioned violence has become,\" he added.\n Sheskey's attorney previously told CNN the officer used deadly force not only to defend his life but because he was afraid Blake, while attempting to flee, was trying to kidnap a child in the backseat of the vehicle at the scene.\n Attorney Brendan Matthews, the lawyer for Sheskey and the Kenosha Professional Police Organization, said in an email to CNN that he respects Justin Blake's ability to express his opinion.\n \"Personally, I wish he exhausted his energy and media platform in a productive manner that seeks to improve America's racial divide, not exacerbate it,\" he wrote.\n The district attorney's decision last week, Justin Blake wrote, \"makes crystal clear to Black people in Kenosha and Wisconsin that we are not safe in our communities.\"\n If the justice system valued Black lives, Justin Blake wrote, Sheskey would be fired, and Kenosha's police chief and Kenosha County's sheriff would resign.\n Sheriff David Beth and Graveley declined to comment.\n While not referencing him by name, the opinion piece links out to an article on Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old who is facing homicide charges in the death of two men, after, authorities allege, he fired at demonstrators during protests over Jacob Blake's shooting.\n Armed groups, Justin Blake writes, \"threatening our community would be treated as the violent terror groups they are, and authorities would protect us from them. The Kenosha police department would adopt the #8cantwait platform, which includes requiring de-escalation and comprehensive reporting to prevent future police shootings.\"\n Body cameras would be implemented, he wrote, and documents related to his nephew's shooting investigation would be released to the public.\n \"Jacob would get justice,\" he wrote. \"But we're not there yet. That's why we're rising up. Jacob deserves better than this. Kenosha deserves better than this.\"",

        "title": "Trump's historic 2nd impeachment trial hangs over Biden and Republicans",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump's unique second impeachment sealed history's verdict on a corrupt and disgraced presidency. But the political endgame of this tragic saga is only now beginning and will decide the extent of America's recovery from his malevolent term.\n The soon-to-be ex-President's Senate impeachment trial will mean his toxic presence will pollute the opening of Joe Biden's presidency. It will also seriously complicate his successor's quest to leverage the apex of his power in his early days in office to get a grip on a murderous panic that's never been worse.\n Trump's disastrous final days in office have brought the Republican Party to an existential moment. How GOP senators decide to deal with the strongman who bullied and manipulated them for five years will show whether their out-of-control party can revive its conservative soul or is destined to race into a conspiratorial, anti-democratic dead end.\n The Senate trial -- unlike the first time around -- will take place under Democratic Party control and will not unfold in a vacuum. The reaction to Trump's latest impeachment and acrimonious exit from office will wash across an uneasy, angry nation, traumatized by the Washington insurrection he inspired.\n The tens of thousands of troops and security forces should be able to secure Biden's inauguration, but FBI warnings of uprisings in 50 states reflect the brittle atmosphere, which the trial could make even more tense.\n The coming weeks will make clear whether the fury and radicalism inspired by Trump will recede when he is in internal political exile in Florida. Or they will reveal if something more serious is brewing -- even an unthinkable White nationalist insurgency triggered by Trump's refusal to accept his election defeat that will preoccupy the already crisis-challenged Biden presidency.\n On a related note, the President-elect has already expressed concern that the all-consuming drama of a Senate trial will slow his vitally needed first agenda items, including more funding to scale up a faltering vaccine distribution effort and more help for the crippled economy.\n The first-ever impeachment trial of an ex-president -- in itself the final, surreal shattering of norms of the Trump era -- will also go a long way toward deciding how quickly America's political institutions and the galvanizing role of truth in public life, which have both been under constant assault from the current President, can be rehabilitated. Perhaps the courage of 10 Republican lawmakers who joined Democrats in a bipartisan impeachment in the House on Wednesday augurs a breach in rigid political battle lines.\n But Trump retains a mystical hold on the Republican base and has the capacity to harass and threaten GOP senators who will sit in judgment. Scenes of Republican lawmakers being harangued by ferocious Trump supporters in airports in recent days offer a small taste of the price to be paid for those who desert their leader.\n Given that most of the House GOP voted not to punish the President for whipping up an effective coup against another branch of government, hopes for a new dawn of Republicanism may be farfetched.\n The next weeks will also see the President's retreat into a private life that suddenly seems deeply uninviting.\n Trump's conduct in shattering the US tradition of peaceful transfers of power has made him a pariah. Companies and banks are rushing to disassociate themselves from him -- a fact that might have motivated his belated call for calm in a video released after he was impeached again.\n Multiple civil and legal challenges lie in wait when Trump is no longer shielded by the presidency. The President is already deeply concerned about the impact of the last week on his personal brand, sources told CNN. With his enterprises already feeling the negative effects of a polarizing presidency, the future of the President's business looks cloudy at best.\n Washington has a week to digest the institutional upheaval of the first double presidential impeachment in history. It will fall to incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to wrestle with the fierce constitutional questions that will uniquely apply to the trial of an ex-president.\n The first issue will be timing and whether the Senate can accommodate Biden's plea to keep open for pandemic-related business and the push to confirm his top Cabinet appointments at a moment of rarely seen national crisis. Timing will be another question -- as the new White House will be agitating for a trial of days, not weeks.\n \"Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could have called the chamber back from its recess to begin the trial with Trump still in office. But he has clear political reasons for allowing Democrats to set the terms -- and potentially feel the backlash -- of the process.\n Intense intrigue surrounds how McConnell will vote himself after he made it known that he supports the notion of impeachment for the assault Trump incited last week on the Capitol -- including his beloved Senate.\n True to form, McConnell appears determined to keep his counsel to see how the treacherous politics of impeachment play out. But were he to break finally with Trump he would give other Republican senators political cover to follow suit and possibly bring a two-thirds majority needed to convict within reach.\n McConnell is said to be furious with Trump. The outgoing majority leader is protected from primary challenges after embarking on a new six-year term and he lost his majority, to a great extent, owing to the President's antics before the Georgia runoff elections earlier this month. The Kentuckian who made a Faustian bargain with Trump to reshape the Supreme Court and the judiciary with conservative nominees now has little to gain by shielding the President as he did after the first impeachment.\n That means that McConnell and those senators who ditched the President and refused to back his efforts to thwart the transfer of power on the day when the mob invaded the Capitol now have the chance to effectively expel Trump from the party and US politics for good.\n The impeachment debate in the House on Wednesday laid bare the forces that are ripping the party of Lincoln apart. House Republicans were split among fervent Trump backers, lawmakers who admitted he some bore responsibility for last week's outrage and those who cast fateful votes to desert their President.\n While only 10 Republicans voted with Democrats, this was the most bipartisan of the previous three House impeachment votes in US history. The exchanges on the floor revealed the extent to which Trump has transformed his party.\n House lawmakers -- who serve mere two-year terms -- are most responsive to the sentiments of their bases, so it's not surprising many felt no option but to stick with the President. A stream of hypocrisy, false moral equivalence and open lying about the results of the election dominated interventions from the Republican side of the chamber -- which mirrored the malfeasance and misinformation of Trump's scorched-earth politics.\n In a slight concession to disgust on Capitol Hill over Trump's behavior, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy did argue that the President should have immediately denounced the rioters when they breached the Capitol last week. But the California Republican claimed that Democrats, not Republicans, were further dividing the nation by pressing ahead with the impeachment push. This from a Republican leader who spent two months amplifying Trump's false claims of election fraud, which have shattered the confidence of millions of Americans in the democratic process.\n Other Trump acolytes in the House showed their ongoing influence by arguing that the Democratic impeachment effort was nothing more than the continuation of an effort to destroy Trump's presidency that started within hours of him taking power. True believer Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida drew jeers from Democrats when he accused them of far worse behavior than the President.\n \"Make no mistake, the left in America has incited far more political violence than the right for months. Our cities burned, police stations burned, our businesses were shattered. And they said nothing, or they cheerlead for it, and they fundraised for it, and they allowed it to happen in the greatest country in the world,\" Gaetz said. His comparison misrepresented the true scale of demonstrations against racist policing and the horror of a never-before-seen assault on the citadel of US political power.\n Ultimately, the future of the Republican Party will rest on whether Gaetz or McConnell turns out to be its more authentic voice.\n The last thing Biden could have wanted when he takes control of a sickened, internally estranged, economically crushed nation on January 20 at noon is a political imbroglio that could threaten to make the crises worse.\n He must now strike a tone of calm and unity while an impeachment trial -- historically one of the most divisive varieties of political theater -- plays out. The trial means that the poisoned shadow of Trump will darken the early days of his term, which he had hoped to use to promote literal and political national healing.\n In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Biden called the assault on the Capitol \"unlike anything we have witnessed in the 244-year history of our nation\" but didn't directly criticize Trump by name and went on to stress the need for the Senate to balance its constitutional duties with working on other urgent business.\n \"From confirmations to key posts such as Secretaries for Homeland Security, State, Defense, Treasury, and Director of National Intelligence, to getting our vaccine program on track, and to getting our economy going again. Too many of our fellow Americans have suffered for too long over the past year to delay this urgent work,\" Biden said.\n But the heightened political tensions of an impeachment trial may have already dashed those aspirations.",

She donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center that helped develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n The state's equivalent of Disney World even bears her name.\n It's fitting, then, that she be honored with a statue in front of the Tennessee Capitol.\n Earlier this week, Tennessee Rep. John Mark Windle proposed erecting a statue of Parton that will sit on the state Capitol grounds \"to recognize her for all she has contributed to this state.\" If it's commissioned, the Parton sculpture will face the historic Ryman Auditorium, a music venue where she's played throughout her career.\n If approved, the statue would be paid for by the \"Dolly Parton fund,\" which would include gifts, grants and other donations. The public would have a say in the statue's design, too, according to Windle's bill. CNN has reached out to Windle for comment and is waiting to hear back.\n A sculpture of Parton would be a decidedly less controversial addition to the Tennessee State Capitol, which housed Confederate monuments.\n In June 2020, state historians moved to remove a bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan member Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Capitol and relocate it off the grounds, but state lawmakers have opposed the move, the Tennessean reported.\n Parton hasn't publicly commented on the proposal. CNN has reached out to her representatives and is waiting to hear back.\n But to feel Parton's love for her home state, one only has to listen to her 1973 classic about her rural upbringing, \"My Tennessee Mountain Home.\"\n \"In my Tennessee mountain home\n Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\n In my Tennessee mountain home\n Crickets sing in the fields nearby.\"",

        "body_text": "When Tom Rice voted \"yes\" on the impeachment of Donald Trump over the President's role in inciting the riot that led to the storming of the US Capitol, most close congressional watchers assumed he had made a mistake.\n After all, there was little to indicate that the reliably conservative South Carolina Republican would join nine other colleagues in breaking with the President (and the party) to back impeaching Trump. Unlike Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyoming) and Adam Kinzinger (Illinois), Rice hadn't been an outspoken critic of Trump. And unlike Reps. John Katko (New York) and David Valadao (California), Rice doesn't represent a swing district.\n \"Compared to the often raucous members of the state's congressional delegation, Rice has been more low-profile and focused on his legislative work,\" wrote the Almanac of American Politics of Rice, who has represented eastern South Carolina's 7th district since 2012.\n But Rice hadn't made a mistake or accidentally pressed the wrong button. His vote to impeach was real -- and without question, the most surprising of the 10 Republicans who bucked the President.\n Here's how Rice explained his vote:\n \"Once the violence began, when the Capitol was under siege, when the Capitol Police were being beaten and killed, and when the Vice President and the Congress were being locked down, the President was watching and tweeted about the Vice President's lack of courage.\n \"For hours while the riot continued, the President communicated only on Twitter and offered only weak requests for restraint ...\n \"... It has been a week since so many were injured, the United States Capitol was ransacked, and six people were killed, including two police officers. Yet, the President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were 'perfectly appropriate.'\"\n The combination of Trump's incitement of the crowd, his attacks on Vice President Mike Pence during the riot itself and his total lack of remorse over his role in the overrunning of the Capitol added up to be more than Rice could take. As he concluded his statement: \"I have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But this utter failure is inexcusable.\"\n A look back at Rice's past comments on Trump, particularly in the wake of last week's riots, provide some evidence that this move wasn't entirely unexpected.\n While Rice did vote in favor of the Electoral College objections raised by Republicans in Arizona and Pennsylvania, he expressed some misgivings about doing so in the wake of the Capitol violence. \"I am incredibly disappointed in the President,\" Rice told a local TV station last Wednesday. \"The President needs to step up right now and say this election is over. I'm tired of it. He needs to concede. He needs to say that this election is over and tell these folks to calm down.\"\n And Rice, despite representing a comfortably Republican seat, has resisted the urgings of some in the district to throw in his lot with the House Freedom Caucus -- Trump's base within the House. \"Donald Trump was backed by an overwhelming majority in my district and in South Carolina,\" Rice said. \"And while I don't necessarily agree with his tactics, I agree with 95% of his policies.\"\n Perhaps the biggest previous indicator of Rice's impeachment vote comes in this quote from an interview in 2017 with the Charleston Post & Courier. \"People don't pay me for smiling,\" Rice said. \"They pay me to get results.\"\n That's not the typical quote from a politician. And as Rice showed with his vote on Wednesday, he's no normal politician.",

Xi also emphasized that China was working to open up further to \"enterprises from across the world, including Starbucks and other American companies,\" the agency reported.\n In a statement, Schultz said it was a \"great honor\" to have received a reply from Xi.\n \"I truly believe Starbucks' best days are ahead in China and that the values of creativity, compassion, community and hard work will guide the company toward an even greater business and community contribution, while continuing to build common ground for cooperation between our two countries,\" he added.\n Schultz stepped down as chairman of Starbucks in 2018, after which he took on the honorary title of chairman emeritus. At the time, he said that he was exploring a run for president as an independent candidate in 2020. Those plans were eventually called off.\n Schultz is outspoken on political issues.

Astronomers believe that the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies actually power quasars, acting like an engine.\n When gas falls into quasars at the centers of galaxies, they form disks of gas and dust that emit electromagnetic energy. This creates a brightness greater than entire galaxies.\n Jets shoot out of the quasar, pulsing with X-rays, and they are some of the hottest things in the entire universe. The jets blow gas and dust, which are essential to form stars, out of the galaxy.  When a quasar forms, it signals the end of a galaxy's star-forming days.\n This quasar is a thousand times more luminous than our Milky Way galaxy, and it's powered by the earliest known supermassive black hole. The light from this quasar took more than 13 billion years to reach Earth, and astronomers were able to observe it as the quasar appeared just 670 million years after the Big Bang.\n Its black hole engine weighs more than 1.6 billion times the mass of our sun, making it twice as massive as that of the previous record holder.\n \"This is the earliest evidence of how a supermassive black hole is affecting the galaxy around it,\" said Feige Wang, lead study author and NASA Hubble fellow at the University of Arizona, in a statement. \"From observations of less distant galaxies, we know that this has to happen, but we have never seen it happening so early in the Universe.\"\n The quasar has been dubbed J0313-1806 by the astronomers who discovered it.\n \"The most distant quasars are crucial for understanding how the earliest black holes formed and for understanding cosmic reionization -- the last major phase transition of our Universe,\" said Xiaohui Fan, study coauthor and regents professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona, in a statement.\n To picture the brightness of this highly energetic object, imagine our sun -- but 10 trillion times more luminous.\n Astronomers were surprised to discover this quasar was fully formed in such a short time, astronomically speaking, after the Big Bang. The presence of the massive black hole that powers it at this early point in the universe's timeline also challenges how astronomers understand black hole formation.\n For example, how did this black hole have time to form?\n \"Black holes created by the very first massive stars could not have grown this large in only a few hundred million years,\" Wang said.\n Typically, such massive black holes form when giant stars explode and collapse, forming black holes that grow in size. They can also form when a dense cluster of stars collapses. Both of these take time.\n \"This tells you that no matter what you do, the seed of this black hole must have formed by a different mechanism,\" Fan said. \"In this case, it's a mechanism that involves vast quantities of primordial, cold hydrogen gas directly collapsing into a seed black hole.\"\n The brightness of the quasar indicates that the black hole is gobbling up about 25 stars like our sun each year, which powers an outflow of gas moving at 20% the speed of light.\n This loss of gas typically halts the birth of stars in a galaxy because that gas is a necessary ingredient in star formation.\n \"We think those supermassive black holes were the reason why many of the big galaxies stopped forming stars at some point,\" Fan said.\n Ultimately, the black hole will eventually run out of food, stunting its growth, Fan said.\n Multiple telescopes were used in the discovery and astronomers are eager to observe it more in the future.\n The galaxy that hosts the quasar is rapidly producing stars at a rate that is 200 times faster than the Milky Way.\n \"This would be a great target to investigate the formation of the earliest supermassive black holes,\" Wang said. \"We also hope to learn more about the effect of quasar outflows on their host galaxy -- as well as to learn how the most massive galaxies formed in the early Universe.\"",

        "body_text": "Gaby Goldstein is co-founder and political director at Sister District,  an organization that builds Democratic power in state legislatures through grassroots action and progressive policy transfer between state legislators. David Daley is the author of \"Unrigged: How Americans Are Battling Back to Save Democracy\" and \"Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn't Count.\" The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\nAstonished Americans watched a violent insurrection storm the nation's Capitol on January 6, as rioters smashed through barricades and windows, threatened lawmakers and disrupted the constitutionally mandated tally of the Electoral College votes certifying Joe Biden as the next president.\n None of us should have been surprised. Months of escalating threats and violence at our state capitols should have served as notice of what was coming. For the past year, state lawmakers have been at the frontlines of pandemic response and in the crosshairs of militia members who disagree with public health mandates and restrictions.\n All too often, these rioters have been greeted as allies by Republican state legislators -- one allegedly opened the door to protesters. At least a dozen GOP state lawmakers are reported to have attended the pro-Trump rally that fired up the crowd ahead of the riot, and a Republican member of the West Virginia Republican House of Delegates who recorded himself storming the US Capitol is facing a criminal charge.\n In Oregon last month, where the state Capitol has been closed to the public, a Republican lawmaker, who said that legislative proceedings should be open to everyone, allegedly held open a side entrance to allow a gathered mob inside. Protesters, many of whom were angry about the state's Covid-19 restrictions, ultimately sprayed a chemical irritant into the House chamber and struggled violently with state and local police.\n In Idaho last August, anti-government and anti-vaxxer groups succeeded in disrupting a special session on the pandemic by overwhelming police and forcing their way into the Idaho House chamber. The GOP speaker allowed them inside, claiming he wanted to avoid violence. When protesters returned the next day, the legislators were again forced to postpone the session.\n Perhaps the original dress rehearsal for the Washington assault, however, occurred in Michigan last May, when an armed mob pushed its way into the state Capitol to protest a pandemic stay-at-home order issued by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Maskless militia berated police, attempted to access the chamber floor, compared Whitmer to Hitler and carried nooses. \"Liberate Michigan,\" Donald Trump had tweeted. In October, the FBI arrested 14 members of a Michigan paramilitary group on charges that they plotted to kidnap and possibly execute Whitmer and planned to stage a violent assault on the state Capitol.\n And while the astounding crimes at the US Capitol last week rightly captured headlines, the day was also rife with violence and threatened violence at other state capitol buildings as well. Armed militia descended on the statehouses in Oklahoma, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Washington state (including a breach of the Washington governor's mansion). There were additional skirmishes in Ohio and California, and lawmakers in several states were evacuated.\n If this comes as news, it could be because there are fewer reporters than ever covering statehouses. According to a 2020 Pew Research Center study, the number of newspaper newsroom employees nationwide fell by 51% between 2008 and 2019. A 2014 Pew study   found that the number of statehouse reporters dwindled by 35% between 2003 and 2014 alone.\n Like so many policies that begin in state capitols and find their way to the national stage, the sickness the world watched unfold in Washington has been on full display in Lansing, Salem, Boise and elsewhere for the last year. Armed extremists have been allowed to menace lawmakers in buildings that belong to the people and must remain transparent and accessible to the people. And Republican state legislators have stoked the fires by doubling down on conspiracy theories and lies in their words and actions.\n The US Capitol, with a more than 2,300 member police force and a $460 million annual budget, should have had the resources to secure itself. Indeed, the law enforcement response to the attack was wholly inadequate, and it stands in stark contrast to the police treatment of Black people protesting for civil rights. There was no excuse for the lack of preparation, as the attack was presaged by months of extremist activity in statehouses across the country.\n We ignore what happens in our state capitols at our peril. The conditions that have led to this violence will not disappear overnight when Biden assumes office. State lawmakers will continue to bear a tremendous responsibility in pandemic response and recovery, including vaccine distribution, to the continued ire of violent mobs. And Trump's supporters both inside and outside our statehouses remain steadfast, as new reports indicate plans for additional state capitol attacks on January 17 and the FBI has issued a bulletin warning of upcoming armed protests being planned at all 50 state capitols.\n Our state capitols stand as the symbols and workplaces of our democracy at home. As lawmakers begin to return for winter sessions, they are tasked with making difficult decisions in the face of pandemic-slashed budgets and a continued public health crisis. We must ensure that lawmakers in all our houses of government are secure. In a democracy, the people's work must be conducted safely and in public.",

Exports, meanwhile, rose to an all-time high.\n \"After having recovered from its own Covid-19 crisis, China was open for business when the pandemic triggered huge demand in the US (and other countries) for Covid-19 related goods,\" Kuijs said.\n China's trade relationship with the United States, meanwhile, became even more imbalanced: Beijing's trade surplus with Washington rose to $317 billion in 2020, a 7% increase from the year prior and the second highest amount on record, according to Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING. The amount is just $7 billion shy of 2018 levels, when Trump launched a blistering trade war to right what he called a lopsided relationship with the world's second largest economy.\n \"As [China] plays a critical role in many supply chains and remains a fundamentally very competitive place to produce, it is much easier said than done to 'decouple' from it,\" Kuijs said.\n China's future isn't without its challenges, though. Analysts point out that President-elect Joe Biden likely won't reverse some of the pressure on the country after he takes office next week.\n \"The Biden government will take a different, less combative and more steady approach to China,\" Kuijs said. \"But it is politically not possible for Biden to remove the tariffs on Chinese goods any time soon.\"",

        "body_text": "The House vote to impeach President Donald Trump, historic as it was, has created a series of complicated questions for the looming Senate trial -- nearly all of which will have repercussions for the opening days of incoming President Joe Biden.\n It's something Democratic senators and aides say they're keenly aware of as they've worked through possible scenarios -- keeping Biden's team in the loop each step of the way.\n Biden himself called current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday in an effort to attempt to map a path forward that allows his administration to start its work -- both nominations and potential stimulus legislation -- as soon as possible.\n The stakes are enormous and will dictate how quickly Biden gets his team in place, as well as whether he and his new Senate majority can launch what are expected to be legislative efforts.\n \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,\" Biden said in a statement following the impeachment vote Wednesday night, alluding to his desire to \"bifurcate\" the process in the upper chamber.\n The ability to solidify doing two things at once weighs heavily on what comes next. As McConnell made clear in a statement Wednesday, Senate trials have historically not been short.\n \"The Senate has held three presidential impeachment trials,\" McConnell said. \"They have lasted 83 days, 37 days, and 21 days respectively.\"\n While Democrats have been eying a tighter timeline, no final decisions have been announced -- either on how the trial will play out or when one will begin.\n But past trials underscore the complicated balancing act that lawmakers are grappling with. Running through previous trials provide a guide, but with the caveat that everyone involved is attempting to work through alternatives. That said, this, based on those past trials, is what lawmakers are facing at the moment.\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not outlined when the articles will be walked over to the US Senate. That's not a symbolic action -- it's a trigger, based on the Senate rules of an impeachment trial.\n Should Pelosi and the impeachment managers choose to send the articles to the Senate before or upon the chamber's return Tuesday, it would immediately set into motion a series of events that would not only lock up the chamber's schedule, but also potentially Biden's options in his first days in office.\n Once the message reaches the Senate, the secretary of the Senate informs the House that the chamber is ready to receive the managers. In Trump's first impeachment trial, the Senate instructed the House managers to exhibit the articles the next day.\n If that happened this time around, the trial would begin on January 20 -- Biden's Inauguration Day. If that isn't the agreed upon pathway this time around, the exhibition of the article, which entails reading it aloud on the Senate floor, would happen later than that.\n As of Thursday, House Democrats close to the impeachment process still did not have clarity on when the impeachment article would be sent to the Senate. The talks, they said, were still ongoing as top Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer continued to work with Republicans to see if they could agree on when to start the trial and whether Republicans would agree to spend mornings on Biden nominations.\n In the two prior impeachments, the Senate agreed to start the trial immediately after the exhibition of the articles. That would trigger the invitation to Chief Justice John Roberts to arrive at an agreed upon time to be sworn in to preside over the trial.\n Roberts, of course, plays a central role in the swearing in of the President on Inauguration Day, though the rules allow for the Senate's president pro tempore to be used in the role if Roberts is absent.\n Shortly thereafter, the senators themselves would be sworn in, and Trump or his team would be summoned to appear before the chamber to answer to the article of impeachment. Then preparations would be ordered to begin for the trial.\n If the articles were sent Tuesday or before, all of this could be required to occur as inauguration is playing out or shortly thereafter.\n Once the trial begins, it gavels into session at 12 p.m. ET every day that follows, save for Sundays, until completion.\n It's the period before 12  p.m. that is currently being examined as an option for other Senate business. Once the trial starts on any given day, it is the only business of the Senate that can occur.\n There is a clear effort underway to give Biden an opportunity to move forward on his nominees and agenda items during the morning.\n Schumer has been working with Republicans to try and see if an agreement could be made to allow Biden to work through nominees in the morning and then turn to an impeachment trial in the afternoons.\n \"We are working with Republicans to try to find a path forward,\" Schumer's spokesman told CNN on Thursday.\n Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said on CNN Thursday that Democrats would push to be able to address Biden's legislative and nominee agenda while working through the trial.\n \"We certainly stand ready to do both at the same time,\" Gillibrand said in an interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan.\n McConnell, in his call with Biden, said he would talk to the Senate parliamentarian about what is possible in terms of making this happen. Technical questions abound, including whether any such action would require consent from all 100 senators. But the Senate always maintains the power to set its own rules -- a fact Biden is leaning on to open the door to pretrial action on his agenda.\n Whether that can and will be utilized in this, the second impeachment trial of Trump, will go a long way to determining how quickly Biden can not only have his team in place, but also whether he can kick-start his ambitious stimulus and recovery legislative agenda.\n This is another question we don't have an answer for right now. A lot will depend on what House managers aim to accomplish with the trial. Do they seek additional witnesses or evidence? All of that takes time.\n Democratic senators are keenly aware that while they would like to proceed quickly to ensure Biden can move ahead with his own agenda, they don't want to speed up a trial so much that it sets a precedent.\n Democrats were outraged when Republicans didn't allow witnesses in the Trump's first impeachment trial. Once the second trial begins, Schumer and other Democrats will have full control over how to run the show. Nothing can be filibustered once the trial begins, meaning you need only a simple majority to make decisions about witnesses, when to vote on conviction, etc.",

        "body_text": "People who have been infected with Covid-19 are likely to be protected against catching it again for at least five months, according to a new study led by Public Health England (PHE).\n The study -- which has not yet been peer reviewed -- found that past infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of reinfection, compared to people who have not been infected before.\n But researchers warned that the protection was not absolute, meaning some people do catch the virus again, and that it was unclear how long any immunity lasts. It is also possible that those who have a degree of immunity against the virus may still be able to carry the virus in their nose or throat and therefore transmit it to others.\n \"We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,\" Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and co-leader of the study, said in a statement.\n \"Even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others,\" Hopkins said.\n The SIREN research study regularly tested almost 21,000 health workers from across the UK between June and November. Among them, 6,614 people participants tested positive for antibodies against the virus, while more than 14,000 had no signs of previous infection.\n But of those who had been infected, 44 developed possible new infections -- representing an 83% level of protection against reinfection.\n The study will continue to monitor healthcare workers for 12 months to see if protection lasts even longer, but for now the length of protection identified means that people who caught the virus in the first wave of infections may now be able to catch it again. It will also look into the impact of the new variant and the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.\n But early insight from the next stage of the study shows that some people with existing immunity carry high levels of virus and could transmit the virus to others.\n Hopkins highlighted this during an interview with the BBC's Today program on Thursday.\n \"We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals.\"\n Hopkins stressed that people who had previously caught Covid-19 still needed to obey social distancing rules to avoid transmitting the disease.\n \"The SIREN study has major implications for how we can get out of the current crisis. The good news is that this study gives further weight that reinfections of Covid is rare, at least at this stage, and that having antibodies will provide protection for a meaningful amount of time, although it may not be lifelong immunity,\" Dr. Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, told the Science Media Centre.\n \"The concerning finding is that some people who have Covid antibodies appear to still be able to carry the coronavirus and could spread it to others. This means that the vast majority of the population will either need to have natural immunity or have been immunised for us to fully lift restrictions on our lives,\" he said.\n Lawrence Young, Virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology, Warwick Medical School added that because the results cover the months before the new variant took hold, \"it will be important to determine whether previous infection with the old virus variant is able to offer protection from re-infection with the new virus variant.\"\n England is currently under a stringent national lockdown after cases surged over the holiday period. The UK has recorded more than 3.2 million cases of infection.\n CNN's Meera Senthilingam contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A $2,000 stimulus check will be at the heart of a $2 trillion Covid relief plan that President-elect Joe Biden is set to unveil Thursday evening.\n An economic package passed by Congress in December provided for fresh $600 stimulus payments despite calls from politicians on both sides of the aisle for bigger checks. Biden's plan calls for adding up to $1,400 to the payments -- totaling $2,000 for those eligible, according to a fact sheet provided by the administration on Thursday.\n Congress included payments of $1,200 in its initial stimulus when shutdowns because of the coronavirus began last spring.\n Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley both pushed to increase the amount of the new payments, and President Donald Trump also came out in support of $2,000 checks -- though he adopted that stance after leaving negotiations up to lawmakers and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Trump stalled signing the bill over the issue but ultimately signed it into law.\n Current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected a standalone bill on increasing the value of the checks, but with Democrats about to take control of the chamber -- and of Congress -- following victories in two Georgia Senate runoff elections, Biden will likely have the votes to approve increased relief spending.\n Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said that one of the first bills he'd like to pass once he becomes Senate majority leader would raise stimulus payments to $2,000.\n Those eligible for the stimulus payments could receive up to $1,400 that would top off the $600 payments that began going out earlier this month. In a letter to his Democratic colleagues sent this week, Schumer indicated that he is planning on payments that would increase the total payout to $2,000.\n \"Democrats wanted to do much more in the last bill and promised to do more, if given the opportunity, to increase direct payments to a total of $2,000,\" he wrote.\n Eligibility for the $600 payments is largely based on income. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year receive the full $600. Heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. They will receive $600 per child under the age of 17.\n The payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. They phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n Undocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers are ineligible for the payments. But in a change from the first round, which was sent last spring, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers.\n During the first round, the federal government sent $1,200 payments to eligible Americans. They were mostly sent out between April and August.\n CNN's Kate Sullivan contributed reporting.",

Customers can still print photos and access other perks on Costco's website, the company said.\n Costco (COST) didn't immediately reply to CNN Business about the closures. But a letter obtained by a photo blog reportedly sent from Costco to its customers explained that the \"need for printing photos has steeply declined\" since the introduction of high-quality cameras on smartphones and social media.\n Once a staple at grocery stores and pharmacies, photo centers have become increasingly extinct as more people choose to share their photos online rather than print them out.\n It's also part of broader changes implemented at Costco over the past year, including limiting the number of people served at its other departments like in optical or hearing aids because of local laws due to the pandemic.

Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Rep. Filemon Vela Jr. of Texas as vice chairs. Bottoms, Whitmer and Duckworth were all under consideration to be Biden's running mate.\n Jason Rae, who's a member of the DNC Executive and Rules & Bylaws Committee, was nominated to serve as secretary; Virginia McGregor, who serves as deputy national finance chair of the DNC and national co-chair of the DNC's Women's Leadership Forum, was nominated for treasurer, and Chris Korge, the national finance chairman for the DNC since 2019, was nominated again for national finance chair.\n \"This group of individuals represent the very best of the Democratic Party. Their stories and long histories of activism and work reflects our party's values and the diversity that make us so strong,\" Biden said in a statement.\n The President-elect continued, \"As our country faces multiple crises from systemic racism to the COVID-19 pandemic, working families in America need and deserve real leadership. We need to elect Democrats across our country and up and down the ballot. To do that is going to take tireless leadership, committed to strengthening Democratic infrastructure across our states. These leaders are battle-tested and ready for this immense task. I know they will get the job done.\"\n The Democratic National Committee is at a moment of change as Biden prepares to take office, shifting from an oppositional force challenging Donald Trump at every turn to a political megaphone for a Democrat-dominated Washington.\n Harrison told CNN last week that he sees the job as being a reliable megaphone to tout White House and Capitol Hill accomplishments -- something that changed when Democrats won control of the Senate.\n \"The job of doing the work is on the Hill and in the White House, the job of making sure that message gets out and it is promoted and disseminated to voters and so those voters have an understanding of it, I believe that's the job of the DNC,\" Harrison said, adding that the DNC's messaging should make people \"understand this is what you get, when you have Democrats in control.\"\n Before the Georgia runoffs were called, Democrats were preparing for Biden's first years in office to be a slog defined by Republican roadblocks in the Senate. But once Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock swept to victory last week, a new reality dawned on Democrats: The Democratic National Committee will not only be an extension of the White House political operation over the next four years, but arguably the party's most potent amplifier to herald and brag about Democratic accomplishments in Washington.\n \"The ante has increased dramatically after Georgia,\" Harrison told CNN.\n Biden is stepping into the White House hoping to avoid the fate of former President Barack Obama, who suffered major losses in the first midterms after his 2008 win. Many of the same political advisers around Biden currently were top officials during the eight years of the Obama presidency, creating the scenario of the 2022 midterms being a second chance for these Democrats.\n In response to questions about how Biden will approach the DNC as president, a Biden campaign official said, unlike the Obama White House, the Biden team will not be creating an outside group like Obama's Organizing for America and \"instead will be channeling our efforts through the party structure.\"\n \"Moving forward, the DNC under President-elect Biden will continue to invest in state parties and maintain a strong partnership with them,\" the official said, an important point for state party chairs who, more than anything, just want to know that the funding from the national party will continue.\n But questions remain about just how the Biden White House will work with the committee, with much of the focus falling to Jen O'Malley Dillon, Biden's incoming deputy chief of staff.\n The DNC will fall within O'Malley Dillon's purview in the White House, Democratic sources tell CNN, meaning Biden's former campaign manager will be tasked with ensuring that the political committee works in step with Biden's political goals. O'Malley Dillon was the executive director of the DNC after Obama's 2008 election.\n Harrison had been widely seen by broad swaths of the Democratic Party as the only real contender for party chair. After running the South Carolina Democratic Party, Harrison ran to be party chair after the 2016 election, eventually losing to Perez. Harrison then ran for Senate in 2020, challenging Trump loyalist Sen. Lindsey Graham. While he failed to unseat Graham, Harrison raised his profile and turned himself into a prolific fundraiser, raising over $130 million in what became a nationalized campaign.\n Harrison was believed to be a strong pick by Democrats because he has held a number of party roles -- state chair, DNC officer, candidate -- and is viewed as someone who understands what it is like to be a Democrat in a red state where the investment is needed.\n Harrison, should he win the expected support from DNC members, will take over a much different Democratic National Committee than the one current Chair Tom Perez took over in 2017. When Perez took over the DNC in 2017, party loyalists were aghast at two key issues: The state of disrepair inside the committee after the departure of former chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the level of distrust raging among more progressive Democrats over how Sen. Bernie Sanders was treated in his 2016 nominating fight against Hillary Clinton. Perez got to work on addressing both those issues, investing millions in rebuilding the party's infrastructure and overseeing the creation of the Unity Reform Commission that studied the issues that led to the widespread mistrust.\n \"I'm a firm believer that good governance is great politics,\" Perez said in an interview with CNN. \"But what I've learned from 2009 and 2010 is that the misinformation campaigns that are going to come out there are going to be relentless. And so we need to make sure that we are not only delivering on our promises, but communicating to people across this country, exactly what we are doing.\"\n This story and headline have been updated with Biden's announcement of Harrison as his nominee.",

        "body_text": "A Pennsylvania man whom authorities say threw a fire extinguisher and struck a Capitol Police officer during the deadly riot at the US Capitol last week has been arrested and charged in federal court.\n Robert Sanford, 55, was arrested on Thursday morning in Pennsylvania, the Justice Department said. Court documents say Sanford was seen on video carrying a \"red object, which appears to be a fire extinguisher,\" as he stepped over a short wall at the lower west terrace of the Capitol. He allegedly threw the fire extinguisher toward police officers, striking one, who was wearing a helmet, before ricocheting and hitting two others.\n Officer William Young said he \"felt a hard strike to the back of his helmet,\" according to the court documents, and saw a fire extinguisher on the ground but didn't see who struck him. Young was evaluated at the hospital and cleared to return to duty.\n The records said Sanford was identified on Tuesday to the FBI's Pennsylvania branch and charged on Wednesday in US District Court.\n He faces four counts: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; disorderly or disruptive conduct on Capitol grounds; civil disorder; and assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers while engaged in the performance of official duties, the documents say.\n It was not immediately clear if he has an attorney.\n His arrest adds to a growing list of individuals charged in last week's deadly riot, which left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was participating in the attack.\n So far, more than 30 people have been arrested on federal charges, with some of the defendants being accused of bringing weapons to Capitol Hill and others having been photographed ransacking the building. Many are charged with unlawful entry or violent entry.\n Among those arrested this week alone are Robert Keith Packer of Virginia, who has been identified as a man who was inside the Capitol wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the phrase \"Camp Auschwitz,\" and Larry Rendell Brock, a retired Air Force Reserve officer from Texas who was photographed roaming the Senate chamber clutching a white flex cuff, which is used by law enforcement to restrain or detain subjects.\n CNN's Jason Hanna, Katelyn Polantz and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has defended his company's decision to ban President Donald Trump, while acknowledging that the move stems from its failure to promote \"healthy\" conversations and sets a \"dangerous\" precedent.\n \"I believe this was the right decision for Twitter,\" Dorsey said in a series of 13 posts on his platform, citing \"extraordinary and untenable\" circumstances after Trump incited a riot at the US Capitol last week, an event that forced the social media company to \"focus all of our actions on public safety.\"\n \"I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here,\" Dorsey said. \"Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\"\n For the past four years, Twitter (TWTR) was central to Trump's presidency, a fact that also benefited the company in the form of countless hours of user engagement. Twitter took a light-touch approach to moderating his account, often arguing that as a public official, Trump must be given wide latitude to speak. But the riot at the Capitol led to a ban.\n Dorsey grappled with the implications of the decision in his posts, admitting that \"having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications.\" Removing users, he said, fragments the public conversation and divides people.\n \"While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us,\" he said.\n The CEO also addressed similar actions taken by other social media companies, such as Facebook (FB) and Snapchat (SNAP), to ban the president. These actions were not coordinated, Dorsey said, but present a challenge for the tech industry.\n \"The check and accountability on this power has always been the fact that a service like Twitter is one small part of the larger public conversation happening across the internet,\" he said. \"If folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another internet service.\"\n \"This concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet tool providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous,\" he continued.\n Amazon (AMZN) effectively killed off Parler, a platform favored by the far-right, when it canceled its web hosting contract.\n The decision to ban the president from Twitter had immediate consequences: Trump lost access to more than 88 million followers, and the move exposed the company to censorship complaints from Republicans. Democrats blasted social media's role in enabling Trump and warned of new legislation to regulate the tech industry.\n Dorsey suggested in his posts that the tech industry's actions could have longer term implications, too.\n \"This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same,\" Dorsey said.\n \"Yes, we all need to look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement. Yes, we need to look at how our service might incentivize distraction and harm. Yes, we need more transparency in our moderation operations. All this can't erode a free and open global internet,\" he added.\n \u2014 Brian Fung contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Venezuela's revolution has stalled. Is Juan Guaid\u00f3 still the answer?",
        "body_text": "Flanked by flags in the makeshift assembly hall of a non-descript office building, the leader of Venezuela's opposition told lawmakers that 2021 would be the year that would change Venezuela's fate.\n \"It's the end of a cycle, because in 2021 Venezuela will be reborn and will see freedom,\" Juan Guaid\u00f3 said at the January 5 meeting, as he asked the opposition to unite around him.\n There was some applause from dozens of opposition members present or calling into the wood-paneled room in East Caracas -- but it was a stark contrast from nearly two years ago, when the young leader took the stage with a similar promise of freedom.\n In January 2019, surrounded by friends and allies, Guaid\u00f3 -- recently minted the head of opposition-controlled National Assembly -- had stood before a roaring crowd. In his left hand, he held a small pocket Constitution engraved with the face of South American revolutionary and local hero Simon Bolivar, then raised his right hand and began reciting an oath: \"I swear,\" he said, pausing as the crowd began cheering. \"To formally assume the power of the National Executive as the President of Venezuela.\"\n The crowd went wild, waving flags, holding their fists in the air in celebration, some even brought to tears by his declaration. For many, this seemed to be a turning point toward justice, after a widely disputed election in which Nicolas Maduro claimed a second term as Venezuela's President.\n The opposition's argument was that Guaid\u00f3 should instead serve as Venezuela's interim president per his constitutional duty as President of the National Assembly -- at least until free and fair elections could be held.\n The United States under President Donald Trump soon recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the country's lawful leader. More than 60 countries soon did the same. Venezuela suddenly seemed poised for change after years of corruption and mismanagement under the governments of Hugo Chavez and Maduro, widely considered responsible for driving the country into extreme poverty.\n Weeks of demonstrations in support of Guaid\u00f3's claim to the presidency ensued, especially in the capital Caracas, some attracting hundreds of thousands of people. The popular movement culminated in a botched coup attempt in April 2019, when Guaid\u00f3 announced a revolutionary uprising at dawn from Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, also known as \"La Carlota\" in Caracas, alongside supporters, allies and a group of soldiers.\n He called it \"the final phase of Operation Freedom\" and said it would put an end to Maduro's control of the Venezuelan government -- but the uprising ultimately failed.\n Protests have since waned and animosity against the regime tuned down. Many Venezuelans, already on their knees after years of economic decline, seem to have lost the urgency of their desire for political change, as the country grapples with a deadly pandemic.\n Last month, most opposition figures from the National Assembly, including Guaid\u00f3 withdrew ahead of another round of elections, saying they didn't have a fair shot. They said they saw the vote as fraudulent after Venezuela's Supreme Court - which is full of Maduro loyalists - wrested control of the main opposition parties and handed it over to politicians loyal to the regime. And though they maintain they are the only democratically elected and rightful representatives of the Venezuelan people, the unseated opposition legislators have been forced into hiding and meet in secret locations.\n Some in the international community, including the United States, have promised continued support for Guaid\u00f3 and his movement. \"The international community cannot allow Maduro, who is in power illegitimately because he stole the 2018 election, to gain from stealing another election,\" a spokesperson for the US State Department Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs told CNN  on January 8.\n \"Neither Maduro nor his new, fraudulently elected illegitimate National Assembly will represent the voice of the Venezuelan people, which should be expressed through free and fair elections.\"\n But many in the country and abroad now doubt that Guaid\u00f3 can deliver on his promise to restore democracy. Even the European Union, while rejecting the results of the National Assembly elections, did not refer to Guaid\u00f3 as \"Interim President\" in a recent statement, saying \"the EU will maintain its engagement with all political and civil society actors striving to bring back democracy to Venezuela, including in particular Juan Guaid\u00f3 and other representatives of the outgoing National Assembly elected in 2015.\"\n Meanwhile, cracks are appearing in Guaid\u00f3's armor at home, with some in the opposition questioning his strategy.\n On August 23, fellow opposition politician and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles called for Venezuelans to participate in the December election, breaking ranks with the rest of the opposition which had called for a boycott. \"It's not about returning to argue what we already know: that the Maduro regime doesn't want the discontent to use their vote, that they are capable of everything even while having 80% of the country against them,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"It's about... debating a route that isn't solely that of abstention and resignation.\"\n Another former presidential candidate from opposition ranks, Maria Corina Machado, wants more extreme action than Guaid\u00f3 took. \"Today we call for the strategy of force,\" she said in a video to her supporters on December 30  \"Yes, I am calling for it, because it is the only that allows us to remove these criminals from power.\"\n Machado believes Guaid\u00f3's team missed its chance to effect real change, she told CNN last month.  \"I think there's been a lack of accountability from the interim government (of Juan Guaid\u00f3),\" she said. \"We had the greatest opportunity ever to get rid of this horrible regime and I think the opposition has committed important mistakes.\"\n Despite her criticism and the fact that some lawmakers have recently given in to regime pressure and switched sides to support Maduro, Machado claims Venezuela's opposition is still united -- though its strategy needs to change.\n \"Society has been more united and supportive when the opposition has been able to manage a strategy that the population feels can be effective in producing regime change,\" she explains, adding that \"Juan Guaid\u00f3 had huge support\" while people believed his strategy of relying mostly on international pressure, especially US sanctions, could deliver. As it became clear it would not, \"people started doubting as well,\" she adds.\n Many on the streets of Caracas seem to agree with Machado. Nearly two years after Guaid\u00f3's  declaration, they feel momentum has shifted, that Maduro has tightened his grip on power and that another shift is needed.\n \"The form of struggle needs to change,\" with a pro-opposition union leader said, out elaborating how.  Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussion , they added that that Venezuelans are \"disappointed\" and \"no longer expect anything\" from Juan Guaid\u00f3. \"People feel he does not represent a solution. And what people need is a solution.\"\n Back in the wood-panelled room in East Caracas, Guaid\u00f3 told lawmakers he welcomed \"constructive criticism\" from all sides, acknowledging that some had proposed different strategies, including Capriles and Machado, whom he said had done \"so much\" for Venezuela.\n However, he also asked them to debate each other's differences from a position of \"unity, needed to face this dictatorship.\"\n \"This is the moment, the last call from your country,\" he said, asking for perseverance. \"[This is] a call to each and every one of you for the need to rebuild this moment and find a definitive way to achieve a democratic transition.\"\n There's certainly a feeling in Venezuela that a new cycle is about to begin as Joe Biden takes over as President of the United States, offering a potential reset in relations. But it's still unclear whether that means more US engagement with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, or an even tougher stance towards his regime.\n And it's becoming increasingly apparent that there might not be room for Guaid\u00f3 in that cycle.",

Rick Snyder, who faces two counts of willful neglect of duty. Snyder has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n The eight others include members of Snyder's staff, officials from the city of Flint and state public health officials. They face a variety of charges ranging from willful neglect of duty to involuntary manslaughter.\n \"The Flint water crisis is not some relic of the past,\" Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud, one of the prosecutors leading the investigation, said.\n \"At this very moment the people of Flint continue to suffer from the categorical failure of public officials at all levels of government who trampled upon their trust and evaded accountability for far too long,\" she said.\n In a statement, Snyder's attorney Brian Lennon said the charges were \"wholly without merit,\" adding Snyder's lawyers were \"confident\" he would be \"fully exonerated if this flimsy case goes to trial.\"\n \"These unjustified allegations do nothing to resolve a painful chapter in the history of our state,\" Lennon said. \"Today's actions merely perpetrate an outrageous political persecution.\"\n Flint has been exposed to extremely high levels of lead since 2014 when city and state officials switched the city's water supply from the Detroit Water System to the contaminated Flint River in an effort to cut costs.\n The switch was supposed to be temporary while a new supply line to Lake Huron was completed. When the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality failed to treat the corrosive water, it ate into the city's iron and lead water pipes and leached into the drinking water.\n The contaminated water led to two outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, a serious type of pneumonia caused by bacteria.\n Investigators reviewed millions of documents and several hundred electronic devices and executed dozens of search warrants, Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy, who is leading the case along with Hammoud, said Thursday, calling it \"one of the largest criminal investigations currently underway in the world.\"\n Under Michigan law, prosecutors were unable to present evidence that led to the charges. Worthy said the team was \"confident\" in the charges\n \"Like any other case, we charge cases that we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Worthy said. \"We do not charge cases that we cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt, so we are confident in all charges that we have meted out today.\"\n Like Snyder, former Flint Public Works director Howard Croft pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of willful neglect of duty. The charges against Snyder and Croft -- which first came to light in court documents Wednesday -- are misdemeanors, punishable with up to one year in prison or a fine of up to $1,000, according to the state's penal code.\n Jamie White, an attorney for Croft, said he took the misdemeanor charges as a sign of weak evidence against his client.\n \"You don't go to a grand jury to ask for a misdemeanor,\" said White. \"Whatever evidence they presented to the grand jury, they weren't buying it.\"\n Among the others who face charges is Nicholas Lyon, the former director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, who faces nine counts of involuntary manslaughter -- each a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison -- and one count of willful neglect of duty.\n Eden Wells, the state's former chief medical executive, faces nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, one count of willful neglect of duty and two counts of misconduct in office, each punishable by up to 5 years in prison.\n Jarrod Agen, former director of communications and chief of staff for Snyder, faces one count of perjury.\n Former City of Flint Emergency Manager Gerald Ambrose was charged with four counts of misconduct in office, each count punishable by up to 5 years in prison.\n Richard Baird, a former senior adviser in Snyder's office, faces a slew of charges, including perjury, misconduct in officer, obstruction of justice and extortion.\n Darnell Earley, former state-appointed emergency manager for the city of Flint, faces three counts of misconduct in office.\n Nancy Peeler, the current Early Childhood Health Section Manager at the MDHHS, faces two counts of misconduct in office and one count of willful neglect of duty.\n CNN is reaching out to each of them for comment.\n All nine of those charged turned themselves in, prosecutors said Thursday, and have been arraigned.\n Chip Chamberlain, an attorney for Lyon, told CNN in a statement that his client was innocent, and that everything he did as MDHHS director \"he did based on the advice of highly trained epidemiologists and public health scientists and experts who themselves were looking at the science and following the data.\"\n An attorney for Ambrose said he would \"aggressively contest\" the allegations. William Swor said the accusations against his client were \"untrue, and the charges are unwarranted.\"\n Snyder, who served from 2010 to 2018, apologized in 2016 for the state's role in the crisis.\n \"I'm sorry most of all that I let you down. You deserve better. You deserve accountability. You deserve to know that the buck stops here with me,\" he said.\n Court documents for Snyder, a Republican, show the offense date as April 25, 2014, the same day Flint switched its water source.\n Lennon, an attorney for Snyder, said earlier Wednesday that his client was being made into a scapegoat by a politically driven special counsel. Lennon called reports that his client would be charged \"meritless\" and part of a \"political escapade.\"\n In a statement, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel praised Worthy and Hammoud's records as prosecutors and said, \"I trust today's announcement reflects their professional responsibilities and ethical obligations as the prosecuting authorities in this matter, and that their decisions are based solely on the facts, the law and the evidence.\"\n Flint residents had been complaining about the poor quality of their water when the Environmental Protection Agency tested water going into homes there in 2015, finding dangerous levels of lead, which can cause serious health issues.\n More than a dozen lawsuits, including several class-action suits, were filed against the state, the city of Flint and some state and city employees involved in the decision to switch the source of the drinking water and those responsible for monitoring water quality.\n The investigation that led to the latest round of charges also involved a group of infectious disease experts, Worthy said Thursday, each of whom reviewed the deaths in Flint and determined the causes of death before coming together as a panel to come to final conclusions.\n Last year, the state reached a $600 million settlement with victims, and a court-monitored compensation fund was established.\n The Legionnaires' outbreak led to criminal charges against state officials, including Nick Lyon, then-director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in 2017.\n Prosecutors dropped all criminal charges in 2019 and said the investigation would begin again from scratch, citing concerns about how the special counsel had conducted its probe.\n CNN's Theresa Waldrop and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 14 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\nJust 10 Republicans voted not to defend the indefensible.\n Donald Trump has become the first and only President to be impeached twice, but most of his enabling party refused to make him pay for inciting violent insurrection. The few GOP House members who did vote to impeach braved personal abuse and attacks from colleagues, and they risk losing top party posts and stirring primary campaigns the next time they seek reelection.\n The House debate before Wednesday's vote was a festival of hypocrisy, false moral equivalence and open lying as Trump's supporters denied reality in his defense. Some who had spent months pretending that Joe Biden hadn't won a free and fair election accused Democrats of fracturing national unity. Others warned that impeachment could spark violence, effectively validating the intimidation tactics of last week's mob.\n Several Republicans allowed that Trump was at fault but argued the impeachment was too rushed on principle; more painted the process as the act of left-wing Trump-haters desperate to \"cancel\" him in a fit of political corrrectness.\n Now Trump's fate is in the hands of the Senate \u2014 and more directly in those of another longtime enabler, Mitch McConnell. The Republican majority leader has finally broken with Trump by signaling he might vote to convict in an eventual Senate trial. If he does, other Republicans might join him to construct the two-thirds majority needed to convict. By then, Trump would be an ex-president -- but he could be barred from running for office ever again.\n It's a long shot. But Wednesday's unique second impeachment vote already ensures that for as long as the American republic survives, Trump's name will be accompanied by a historic stain.\n While the impeachment vote was going on, one senior Trump adviser told CNN's Jim Acosta that the outgoing President had yet to grasp the magnitude of the damage being done to his standing in American history and the nation's place on the world stage. The President is \"clueless what any of this means internationally or historically,\" the adviser said. But he does worry about the potential effect on his business and \"long-term brand.\"\n Nice work, Mr. Putin.\n According to a US intelligence community report, Russia's chief goal in interfering in the 2016 election in support of Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton was to \"undermine public faith in the US democratic process.\" Four years on, there have been two impeachments and an insurrection against the US legislature. Millions believe Trump's lies that he was illegally ejected from power, and doubt Biden's legitimacy.\n Conspiracy theorists have seats in Congress. There are serious questions about whether one of the country's great political parties is now anti-democratic. The Covid-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in a federal system that grants vast power to the states. And America's self-appointed role as an exceptional nation and beacon of democracy is in the gutter.\n Most of the disorienting events of the last few years can be blamed directly on Trump and his particular skill at tearing at the social, racial and political divides that are just below the nation's surface. So the ex-KGB man in the Kremlin hardly deserves all the credit. But Russia, China and other autocratic nations are gaining much from Washington's agony. They're already using it to promote their own closed and totalitarian societies as models of comparative order and efficiency -- and to beat back brave local voices calling for democracy and human rights.\n In an effective declaration of victory for Russia's espionage offensive against the US more than four years ago, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian Parliament, slid home the knife. \"Following the events that unfolded after the presidential elections, it is meaningless to refer to America as the example of democracy,\" he said.\n \"We are on the verge of reevaluating the standards that are being promoted by the United States of America, that is exporting its vision of democracy and political systems around the world. Those in our country who love to cite their example as leading will also have to reconsider their views.\"\n On the eve of Uganda's elections, longtime President Yoweri Museveni told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he had every right to a sixth term -- and that protesters supporting rival candidate Bobi Wine were equivalent to the anti-democratic rioters seen in Washington last week.",

        "body_text": "Siegfried Fischbacher, an illusionist known for working with exotic cats as one half of Siegfried & Roy, has died from pancreatic cancer, according to his publicist Dave Kirvin.\n He was 81.\n Fischbacher's longtime professional partner and friend, Roy Horn, died in May from complications caused by Covid-19 at the age of 75.\n The pair rose from war-torn Germany to become stars of stage, film and television by combining their spectacular illusions with rare animals.\n For Fischbacher, it all began with a child's curiosity.\n Born in Rosenheim, Germany, on June 13, 1939, he was drawn as an 8-year-old to a magic book he saw in a shop.\n \"My eye caught something in the window; it was a book on magic,\" he said in his bio on the their site. \"I knew I had to have it. I can't explain, even now, why that was. All that stood in the way was five marks -- for me a fortune, a fortune for any little boy in Germany in 1947.\"\n As he walked away, he said, he found five marks on the sidewalk and immediately returned to purchase the book.\n He met Horn in 1957 aboard the TS Bremen cruise ship, where Siegfried was working as a steward and entertainer. He enlisted Horn, the captain's bellboy, to assist during his nightly magic show.\n According to a press release about Fischbacher, Roy asked a question after the show which would change their lives.\n \"Siegfried, disappearing rabbits is ordinary, but can you make a cheetah disappear?\" Horn said.\n After a pause to consider, Fischbacher replied, \"In magic, anything is possible.\"\n Unbeknown to him -- and the ship's captain -- Horn had smuggled his pet cheetah aboard the cruise to join the act.\n What followed was a five-decade partnership.\n \"We did what we did out of love, not for success or money,\"  Fischbacher once said. \"We had a deep respect for each other. We literally raised each other: I created Roy and Roy created Siegfried.\"\n They began in Las Vegas in 1967 as a featured act in notable Las Vegas revues \"Follies Berg\u00e8re,\" \"Hallelujah Hollywood\" and \"Lido de Paris\" before becoming headliners in \"Beyond Belief\" at the New Frontier in 1981.\n In 1990, the duo became a Las Vegas \"destination\" when their precedent-setting, 14-year run at The Mirage began.\n The $30 million production -- an unheard of amount at the time -- regularly sold out the then-largest theater in Las Vegas history.\n Their revue ended in 2003 after Horn's spine was severed in an incident on stage with a white tiger named Mantecore.\n Fischbacher paid tribute to his longtime friend and collaborator after his death.\n \"Roy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days,\" he said in a statement. \"I give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy's life.\"\n Funeral services will be private with plans for a public memorial for Fischbacher to be held in the future.\n In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health.",

        "body_text": "Incoming first lady Jill Biden continues to round out her East Wing staff, announcing Thursday key hires in both her press office as well as a new executive director of her Joining Forces initiative.\n Biden has tapped Rory Brosius to lead the re-launch of Joining Forces, which provides assistance to service members and their families and veterans. The announcement signals the return of the military support platform Biden co-founded as second lady with Michelle Obama, and indicates Biden intends to put focus on the military and military families. Brosius currently serves as the military families lead on the Biden-Harris Transition Team, and she was deputy director of Joining Forces under Obama.\n Biden also named Michael La Rosa as her press secretary. La Rosa most recently served as her press secretary on the campaign and transition, acting as chief spokesperson for Biden. With a background as a cable news producer and stints on Capitol Hill, La Rosa previously was communications director for the House Democratic Policy Communications Committee.\n In a statement, Biden noted the \"varied and diverse backgrounds\" of the incoming staff, saying, \"These dedicated and accomplished public servants bring a shared commitment to building an administration that lifts up all Americans.\"\n Biden also adds to the White House social office, bringing on Liz Hart, who will serve as deputy White House social secretary. Hart will work under incoming social secretary Carlos Elizondo, whose role was announced by the Biden team in November. Hart was part of the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention team, acting as a coordinating producer before transitioning to executive producer of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' virtual event studios on the Biden-Harris campaign and transition.\n Other staff announcements include Gina Lee, currently deputy director of of Jill Biden's inauguration committee office. Lee will transition to director of scheduling and advance in the first lady's office. Jordan Montoya will fill the role of director of advance and trip director, a position she held in addition to senior aide for Dr. Biden on the Biden-Harris campaign. Garima Verma will serve as digital director on the incoming first lady's team, a job that did not exist under Melania Trump. Verma was a digital strategist on the campaign, focused on audience development and content strategy. Biden also adds deputy policy director Vanessa Lion, who was previously briefings director for both the campaign and the transition.\n Biden touted her desire to expand the scope of the first lady's initiatives.\n \"We will work to open the White House in new, inclusive and innovative ways, reflecting more fully the distinct beauty of all our communities, cultures and traditions,\" Biden said.",

        "body_text": "Ugandans headed to the polls on Thursday, following a tense presidential campaign marred by violence and deaths in the lead-up to the election.\n There was calm on election day itself, however, with a heavy military presence in Uganda's capital, Kampala, as long lines of people waited patiently to cast their votes when polls opened at 7 a.m.\n Long-standing ruler President Yoweri Museveni, 76, is seeking a sixth term in office and is being challenged by 10 opposition candidates, including the hugely popular singer-turned politician Bobi Wine.\n Wine, 38, was spotted among a line of voters in the town of Magere, north of Kampala, earlier on Thursday.\n Before casting his ballot, Wine addressed the media and complained that the majority of his polling agents across the country have been prevented from observing the election by police.\n Ugandan law guarantees that every candidate is allowed representation at polling locations.\n \"Everybody was scared, they thought I would not cast my vote,\" Wine said in a phone interview with local news station NTV.\n \"Here I am coming from the polling station. Having survived and overcome and surmounting all these challenges and odds I want to assure Ugandans that we can and indeed will win.\"\n Many polling stations were forced to use manual voting and checks after the biometric machines failed to register ballots because of the internet shutdown ordered by the government.\n \"We are getting reports of massive failure of biometric voter identification kits due to internet blockade (over 3,400 polling stations),\" the Forum For Democratic Change opposition party wrote on Twitter.\n There were also reports of late delivery of voting material and insufficient material at numerous polling locations.\n On Tuesday, two days ahead of the polls, internet service providers were ordered to block access to social media platforms. In an address to the nation on the same day, Museveni confirmed that Facebook and other social media were blocked, accusing them of \"arrogance.\"\n Ugandans woke up to news of a total internet shutdown on election day as MTN, one of the country's largest communication providers, ran radio spots informing listeners of the indefinite suspension by the government.\n Wine, who regularly wears a helmet and flak jacket on the campaign trail, is seen as the most prominent challenger, \u200band his message has struck a chord with Uganda's young people, who have turned out in droves across the country to vote.\n World Bank data shows three-quarters of Ugandans are under the age of 30 and have never known another president apart from Museveni.\n Winnie Nantamu, a 26-year-old mother of three, said she lost her brother in November when security forces killed at least 45 people in protests that rocked Kampala and other parts of Uganda.\n The demonstrations were sparked by the arrest of Wine for contravening Covid-19 regulations at a campaign rally. As the news of Wine's arrest broke, protesters took to the streets of Kampala, clashing with police and military who responded with tear gas.\n Nantamu told CNN: \"I came out to vote to have change in Uganda, change that is democratic and governed by the constitution.\n \"I believe change will come this time around, but of course we fear that change will be robbed.\"\n Abdul Kyeyune said his friends were arrested during a Wine rally, and they are still detained.\n \"This is what caused me to come and vote. I hope change will come and my friends will be released,\" Kyeyune told CNN.\n One Museveni supporter, Livingstone Hamara, 63, said: \"I worry with so many young voters that it is very unlikely for a sixth term.\"\n Museveni does not appear eager to let a fair and free democratic election unfold after more than three decades in power.\n In 2017, he changed the constitution to remove the age limit to allow him to extend his iron grip on power.\n However, he said in a CNN interview that he would \"accept the results\" if he lost.\n \"Uganda is not my house... if the people of Uganda don't want me to help them with their issues, I go and deal with my personal issues very happily,\" he told Christiane Amanpour.\n Uganda's Electoral Commission has said it will declare the winner within 48 hours after polls closed at 4 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET).",

In a manner consistent with our history, with our traditions, in a way that gives honor to the American people and the United States,\" Pence added.\n Pence will attend the inauguration, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n Biden said last week that he was glad Pence would be coming.\n \"He's welcome.

And so Mike, the vice president, is welcome to come. We'd be honored to have him there, and to move forward in the transition,\" Biden said.\n Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration.",

        "title": "Is it too late to impeach and convict Donald Trump?",
        "body_text": "The Senate vote on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office will not happen until he is no longer in office.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made that reality plain soon after the House voted to impeach Trump on Wednesday. \"Even if the Senate process were to begin this week and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office,\" he said. \"This is not a decision I am making; it is a fact.\"\n Which raises two obvious questions:\n 1) Can you impeach (and remove) a former president from office?\n 2) What, exactly, is the point of doing it -- even if you can?\n The first question is, interestingly, something on which there is considerable debate among Constitutional scholars.\n The Constitution itself is somewhat vague on the matter. Article II, Section 4 reads this way: \"The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n But what if the impeachment process starts when the president is, well, president, and ends when he isn't? It's not clear!\n J. Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, wrote this in The Washington Post on Tuesday:\n \"Once Trump's term ends on Jan. 20, Congress loses its constitutional authority to continue impeachment proceedings against him \u2014 even if the House has already approved articles of impeachment.\n \"Therefore, if the House of Representatives were to impeach the president before he leaves office, the Senate could not thereafter convict the former president and disqualify him under the Constitution from future public office.\n Makes sense! Except that Laurence Tribe, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, wrote this Wednesday in response to Luttig's argument:\n \"To be sure, a former officer may no longer be 'removed' even upon conviction by a two-thirds vote. But that has no bearing on whether such an ex-officer may be barred permanently from office upon being convicted. That separate judgment would require no more than a simple majority vote.\n \"Concluding otherwise would all but erase the disqualification power from the Constitution's text: If an impeachable officer became immune from trial and conviction upon leaving office, any official seeing conviction as imminent could easily remove the prospect of disqualification simply by resigning moments before the Senate's anticipated verdict.\"\n So, the short answer is we don't really know if you can impeach a former president. The Constitution leaves it open to interpretation and it's never been tested in the real world before.\n But there's a piece of Tribe's argument that helps us get close to an answer on the second question I posed above: Even if you can impeach a former president, why do it?\n On its face, it doesn't make a ton of sense. Holding a trial to decide whether a former president is guilty of impeachable offenses and should be removed from office when that person has already left office is sort of odd -- and seemingly counterproductive.\n Except that voting to remove Trump from office isn't all Senate Republicans could do. See, if 67 senators vote to convict and remove Trump, then another vote could be held on whether to ban Trump from seeking any future public office. And that vote would only require a simple majority (50+1) of senators to pass.\n Which would be a  BIG deal -- especially because a) Trump has made no secret of his interest in running for president in 2024 and b) (obviously) early polls on that race suggest he would be a clear frontrunner to be the Republican nominee.\n It would be a major play by McConnell who has made clear, privately, that he is done with Trump and that impeachment is actually a good thing for the party because it allows the GOP to put Trump behind them. (I don't think leaving Trump behind will be that easy, but it would be a start.)\n Banning Trump from ever seeking public office again, which would be a virtual certainty in a 50-50 Senate where Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties. And would not only make the 2024 Republican primary a wide open affair but also ensure it is free of the toxic presence of Trump. (Side note: Even if Trump is banned from running for office again, there's nothing to stop Donald Trump Jr. or Ivanka Trump from running.)\n There's motivation, then, for McConnell to support the attempt to impeach, remove and ban Trump -- even after January 20. That doesn't mean McConnell will throw his support behind the move -- or, even if he did, that it would happen.\n But is does suggest that there is some logic behind trying to impeach even a former president.",

        "title": "US debt surged by $7 trillion under Trump. It will go much higher under Biden",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump certainly lived up to his self-proclaimed status as the King of Debt during his term in office. The national debt spiked by $7 trillion during Trump's tenure -- and it's about to soar much higher under his successor.\n Armed with a slim majority in the US Senate, President-elect Joe Biden is expected to make the case Thursday for a $2 trillion fiscal package to repair and rebuild the economy. That would be on top of the $900 billion relief package launched last month.\n The proposal, made up of $2,000 stimulus checks, state and local aid, and unemployment insurance, aims to shore up a recovery that looks increasingly fragile. The Biden team's package is a \"shoot for the moon\" approach, one lawmaker told CNN.\n Adding to America's $27 trillion mountain of debt may be painful, but it's the wise move given the scale of the problems and dirt-cheap borrowing costs.\n \"This is not the time to tighten the belt. The economy is in no condition for austerity,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\n Another 965,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, up sharply from 784,000 the previous week. Jobless claims remain well above the worst levels of the Great Recession. The United States lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline since the spring.\n \"This is the time to hit the fiscal accelerator to get the animal spirits moving and get the economy back on track,\" Brusuelas added. \"It's a no-brainer.\"\n At this point, there are no tax hikes in the works to offset the cost. The goal of pursuing even more deficit-spending, so soon after the last package, would be to limit the scarring caused by the health crisis and address worsening inequality.\n Despite the record stock market highs, parts of the economy are reeling. Movie theaters, airlines, hotels and other sectors are hemorrhaging losses. The Back-to-Normal Index, created by CNN Business and Moody's Analytics, shows that the US economy is operating at just 74% of where it was in early March.\n \"We're still in a very deep hole. We could do tremendous long-run damage to the economy if we don't get things done quickly,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.\n Faucher added that failing to repair the economy now will make it harder to fix the budget later and address structural challenges posed by Medicare and Social Security.\n \"If we don't get stimulus and we limp along, you'll be fighting over a smaller pie,\" he said.\n Others argue the Biden team should wait a few months to assess the impact of last month's $900 billion package, which provided more small business loans and prevented unemployment benefits from expiring.\n \"It seems quite premature to say we need another $2 trillion now given what we just passed,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan fiscal watchdog group.\n Still, she acknowledged \"we probably need to do more borrowing before it's time to pivot away.\"\n In early January, CRFB projected the US budget deficit would total $2.3 trillion for fiscal 2021, down from $3.1 trillion last fiscal year. But at 10.4%, debt-to-GDP would be higher than any other time in US history outside of World War II.\n Given that Democrats now control the US Senate, MacGuineas said the budget deficit is likely to go even higher than previously estimated.\n The US balance sheet was in tatters long before the pandemic erupted, as lawmakers have continually avoided making painful reforms to Social Security and Medicare. The deficit exploded during the Trump era amid bipartisan spending surges and GOP tax cuts, which failed to pay for themselves. The United States entered the pandemic with a $1 trillion deficit.\n \"The Trump administration was one of the most fiscally reckless of recent times,\" said MacGuineas. \"On every chance to make the fiscal situation better, this administration chose to make it worse.\"\n The Biden administration may have a difficult time convincing lawmakers to support $2,000 stimulus checks -- a popular idea advocated by both Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n Led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, many Republicans have opposed $2,000 stimulus checks. Last week, moderate Democrat Senator Joe Manchin initially told the Washington Post he was \"absolutely\" against $2,000 stimulus checks. He later clarified he could  support more checks if they were narrow in scope and targeted for those who need them.\n The $2,000 stimulus checks are needed right now.\n Nearly 8 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since June, according to researchers from the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame. And about 27 million adults were in households where there was sometimes or often not enough to eat in the last seven days, according to a Census Household Pulse Survey late last year.\n Yet the red-hot stock and housing markets suggest other families are doing better than a year ago.\n Brusuelas said the next round of stimulus checks should be limited to unemployed Americans and those who can document income loss. \"We can't be putting forward money in an undisciplined way,\" he said.\n But if borrowing costs rise significantly, that mountain of debt will become that much heavier.\n That's why Peter Orszag, Robert Rubin and Joseph Stiglitz argue in a paper published Thursday that Washington needs to take a totally different approach. Their article, in the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a plan to reduce the budget's exposure to interest rate swings by extending debt maturities, while at the same time automatically adjust spending in response to economic conditions.\n \"While low interest rates change the contours of the fiscal debate,\" the trio wrote, \"they should not be assumed to persist forever.\"",

        "title": "'American Skin' explores race, policing and loss through a provocative lens",
        "body_text": "\"American Skin\" touches on raw nerves in the midst of a chaotic historical moment, which is ultimately the whole point. Following his 2016 feature debut \"The Birth of a Nation,\" writer-director-star Nate Parker seeks to bore into the issues surrounding policing and Black America, through a provocative but flawed dramatic vehicle that strains against its confining central device.\n That device involves presenting the movie through the lens of a student filmmaker, Jordin (Shane Paul McGhie), who is following up on the police killing of a 14-year-old African-American boy during a traffic stop a year earlier. Jordin has come to interview the boy's father, Lincoln Jefferson (Parker), a Marine veteran grieving his son's loss.\n Linc decides to take matters into his own hands and seek justice, with the camera crew there to document what transpires. A hostage situation ensues, trying to force the police to confront what happened.\n Parker fleshes out the you-are-there approach with things like dash-cam video of the original encounter and surveillance footage, but it's clearly a challenge to construct the drama around this format. On the plus side, the verit\u00e9 style contributes to the sense of realism the film wants to convey, tapping into the audience's awareness of too many real-life videos depicting similar tragedies.\n The main problems reside in Parker's script, which saddles certain characters -- most notably the police officers involved -- with stilted, heavy-handed dialogue. Given its structure the film wisely runs a brisk 90 minutes, but a byproduct of that is crunching complex issues to fit in that package.\n \"American Skin\" fares better in capturing Lincoln's pain, having lost his son despite all his warnings and admonitions reflecting the fears that Black parents harbor. When someone seeks to express sympathy by noting that they have children, Lincoln replies quietly, \"Are they breathing?\"\n The cast includes Omari Hardwick (\"Power\") as a fellow veteran, Beau Knapp as the cop who pulled the trigger and Theo Rossi (\"Sons of Anarchy\") as a fellow officer. The primary emotional journey, meanwhile, involves Jordin, who goes from passive observer to grappling with his own feelings about what happened and whether violence is ever the answer.\n In some respects \"American Skin\" plays like a more urgent modern-day companion to \"Birth of a Nation,\" which chronicled Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion. Among recent movies it also recalls \"American Son,\" a Netflix adaptation of the stage play about a Black mother in a police station waiting for an update about her child.\n \"American Skin\" has waited a long time to see the light of day, having premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2019. The delay has not made the movie any less timely -- while adding distance to a personal controversy involving Parker that drew attention when \"Birth of a Nation\" was released.\n Presented by Spike Lee, the film doesn't sugarcoat its message about systemic injustice, or the anger and desperation that fuels. Parker's stated goal in the production notes is to \"challenge systems of oppression by promoting a much-needed dialogue between law enforcement and community members of color.\"\n Trying to spur such conversations can be a messy way to make a movie, and it's not easy unwinding the film's ambition from its merits. \"American Skin\" is worth seeing, for the issues Parker seeks to address, even if it only partially works in leaving a mark.\n \"American Skin\" premieres on demand on Jan. 15. It's rated R.",

It was revealed in a new report from the BBC and IPVM, an independent group which monitors video surveillance technology.\n A Huawei spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business that the company would \"amend\" its patent, adding that the ethnicity identification feature should \"never have become part of the application.\"\n \"Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are continuously working to ensure new and evolving technology is developed and applied with the utmost care and integrity.\"\n The use of facial recognition technology in policing and domestic security is widespread across China but especially in the western region of Xinjiang, where up to 2 million people from Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minorities have allegedly been put into internment camps, according to the US State Department.\n Beijing maintains that the camps are vocational training centers that help to deradicalize citizens. But Uyghur exiles have described the crackdown as \"cultural genocide,\" with former detainees saying they were indoctrinated and abused.\n IPVM political director Conor Healy said that Huawei needed to explain why the feature had been part of the patent application in the first place.\n \"What possible reason could there be that they would go file patents and develop a facial recognition system that literally involves hours and hours of training a computer to detect what race somebody is?\" he told CNN Business.\n \"There are very few uses for that kind of technology that benefit humanity.\"\n Huawei wasn't the only company that IPVM said had filed this kind of patent.\n According to IPVM, Chinese tech startup Megvii submitted a patent application in June 2019 for a system which mentioned an \"ethnicity classification\" that would include \"Han, Uyghur, non-Han, non-Uyghur and unknown.\"\n In a statement to CNN Business, Megvii said that it would \"withdraw\" the 2019 patent application, which it said was \"open to misunderstanding.\" \"Megvii has not developed and will not develop or sell racial or ethnic labelling solutions,\" the statement said.\n IPVM also found another Chinese tech startup, Sensetime, mentioned in a patent application in July 2019 that it could identify people by ethnicity, specifically singling out \"Uyghur\" as a possibility.\n Sensetime told CNN Business that the reference to Uyghurs was \"regrettable,\" adding that it was \"one of the examples within the application intended to illustrate the attributes the algorithm recognizes.\"\n \"It was neither designed nor intended in any way to discriminate, which is against our values,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"We will update the patent at the next available opportunity.\"\n IPVM's report is the latest in a series of revelations about the questionable facial recognition practices of Chinese technology giants.\n In December, Alibaba (BABA) said that it would no longer try to identify faces by ethnicity after IPVM reported that a division of the company had shown clients how their facial recognition system could detect Uyghurs.\n In the same month, the Washington Post alleged that Huawei had tested facial recognition software capable of sending automatic \"Uyghur alarms\" to government authorities if a member of the ethnic minority was detected by its camera systems.\n At the time, Huawei had denied that it would \"develop or sell systems that identify people by their ethnic group.\"\n \"We do not condone the use of our technologies to discriminate against or oppress members of any community,\" the company said in a statement posted to its website.\n The latest report comes as governments around the world are increasingly pressuring companies whose products may be linked to alleged forced labor camps in Xinjiang.\n On Wednesday, the US government announced that it would ban all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang. One day earlier the UK government declared that it would fine companies that hid economic connections to Xinjiang, as the government attempted to crack down on products of forced labor entering the country.\n In analysis written for its latest report, IPVM said that the inclusion of Uyghur tracking in the patent applications for top China tech companies showed \"how prevalent this racist technology is\" in the country.\n \"This is a clear example of People's Republic of China's human rights abuse against Uyghur people, and also represents a long-term risk for the broader video surveillance industry's reputation,\" IPVM said.\n -- Michelle Toh contributed to this report.",

        "title": "New rule could make it harder for banks to cut ties with oil and coal companies",
        "body_text": "Big banks, climate activists and banking reform advocates don't agree on much, but they joined forces to denounce a proposed Trump administration rule that would make it harder for banks to cut ties with the fossil fuel industry.\n The rule, adopted Thursday by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, requires large banks to make a documented and individualized assessment of pending customers before denying loan applications. That means banks can't simply decide to reject loan requests from fossil fuel companies, gunmakers or other industries simply because those companies don't align with a lenders' corporate values.\n The OCC faced a backlash when it first proposed the rule in November. The agency received about 31,000 comments opposing the rule and far fewer in favor of it. In response, the OCC softened the regulation by removing a section that would have created new restrictions on banks by explicitly prohibiting them from denying loans in certain instances.\n Patricia McCoy, a Boston College Law School professor, said the change \"gives significantly more leeway\" than when it was first proposed.\n The rule, impacting banks with more than $100 billion in assets, is the final regulation of the eight-month tenure of Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, who is stepping down Thursday.\n \"Brian Brooks did something I never thought possible: He united the banking industry and reform advocates,\" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, said of the proposed rule. \"They were united in opposition to a rule that is convoluted, ill-conceived and operationally problematic.\"\n The American Bankers Association, a powerful lobbying group whose banks hold $17 trillion in deposits, slammed the OCC for deciding to \"rush through this ill-advised rulemaking\" on Brooks' last day in office and said the rule should not take effect.\n \"In addition to short-circuiting the traditional rulemaking process and failing to take into account thoughtful comments from thousands of stakeholders, we believe it is a mistake for the OCC to mandate which businesses banks must service,\" Hugh Carney, ABA's senior vice president of prudential regulation, said in a statement.\n Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the incoming chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, echoed the ABA's sentiment.\n \"Forcing banks to take on dangerous investments is a bad idea,\" Brown told CNN Business in an interview last week. \"Ultimately, it doesn't serve the financial system or the country.\"\n Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, added that Brooks, the OCC regulator, is \"joining a long line of Trump nominees looking out for their own past and future business interests.\"\n Brooks said in a statement Thursday that banks \"need to show their work\" when cutting off lending access.\n \"Banks should not terminate services to entire categories of customers without conducting individual risk assessments,\" he said, adding that \"elected officials should determine what is legal and illegal in our country.\"\n The rule is set to take effect in April, but it's not clear if that will happen.\n It's possible that lawmakers could undo it through the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to roll back regulations imposed by the executive branch. For example, President-elect Joe Biden has promised to address the climate crisis, including by rejoining the Paris climate accord.\n Boltansky said he's \"confident\" the Biden administration will work to reverse the rule.\n Environmental groups feared adopting the rule would short-circuit growing momentum among big banks to distance themselves from oil and coal companies whose long-term fortunes are threatened by the climate crisis.\n \"This proposed rule is an outrageous last-ditch attempt to obstruct progress to address climate change as a systemic financial risk,\" Steven Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, said in a statement last week.\n With the climate crisis intensifying, some big banks have recently ruled out making certain loans in the hope of easing both their reputational and credit risks.\n In 2019, Goldman Sachs (GS) became the first big US bank to pledge not to write loans for Arctic drilling. Many other big banks followed suit.\n And last fall, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it would refuse lending, capital market and other services to companies that make most of their revenue from coal extraction. JPMorgan also pledged to push clients to align their business practices with the Paris climate agreement.\n The OCC is charged with making sure lenders provide fair access to financial services and treat customers fairly. The goal is to make sure banks don't repeat the mistakes of redlining, the systematic refusal to lend to poor and minority communities.\n But the OCC's stated mission is also to ensure national banks \"operate in a safe and sound manner.\"\n McCoy, a former regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, points out that climate change risk \"poses long-term safety and soundness concerns to national banks that lend to the fossil fuel industry.\"\n That's because the worsening climate crisis is darkening the outlook for fossil fuel firms. Coal companies have gone bankrupt. Investors have sharply marked down the value of oil and gas companies and made it harder for them to raise capital. A climate crackdown from lawmakers in Washington would pose more problems for the fossil fuel industry.\n \"Banks have begun taking steps to protect against that [climate] risk,\" Ceres said in the statement. \"The OCC should help them down that path, not throw hurdles in the way.\"",

        "body_text": "Delta Air Lines closed the books on the worst year in its history.\n Thursday, Delta reported a record $6.8 billion loss for 2020, excluding special items. Including those items, its net loss for the year was $12.4 billion. A year earlier, Delta had reported record revenue and operating profits.\n Delta, the first major air carrier to report fourth-quarter results, has been hammered along with the rest of the industry with the near halt in air travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic earlier in the year. It will not be alone in reporting record losses.\n Although air travel picked up in the fourth quarter as people traveled for the holiday season, it was still only at a fraction of year-earlier levels. Delta's revenue plunged $7.5 billion, or 65%, during the quarter, leaving it down $29.9 billion for the full year. That resulted in a fourth quarter loss of $1.6 billion, excluding special items.\n \"We are thrilled to close the books on 2020 and put the year behind us,\" said CEO Ed Bastain in an interview on CNBC early Thursday. \"It's been by far the most difficult year in our industry's history and our company's history.\"\n Bastain said he's still optimistic that Delta can return to profitability in the second half of 2021, pointing to slow and steady gains in air travel. But he said that everything depends progress containing the pandemic.\n \"I think by the time the spring comes, more of the world will have confidence in getting back out, not just to travel but in public life in general,\" he said. \"It's totally dependent on the deployment of the vaccines and confidence being restored.\"\n In 2019, Delta recorded a full-year operating profit of $4.8 billion, leading it to pay employees a record $1.6 billion in profit sharing bonuses. Delta did not have any profit sharing for 2020 -- only buyouts to encourage employees to leave the company voluntarily, as Delta and other airlines scrambled to cut staff and other costs. The buyouts and employees agreeing to take temporary unpaid leave during the year resulted in the total amount spent on employee pay and other benefits falling $2.5 billion, or 22% for the full year. Fourth quarter employee pay was down 34%.\n Delta's 2020 loss was far more than its previous record: the annual losses it posted in 2006 during its bankruptcy reorganization. But $50 billion in grants and loans from the federal government and the ability to borrow money -- and in some cases sell addition shares of stock -- has left US airlines with enough cash. None are believed close to a bankruptcy filing.\n Delta ended the year with $10.1 billion in cash on hand, compared with $3.7 billion a year earlier, even after it burned through $8.3 billion in cash in the fourth quarter. That's $12 million a day.\n US airlines have reported combined losses of $24.2 billion, excluding special items, during the first nine months of 2020. All the major airlines are forecast to report losses in the fourth quarter. Southwest (LUV) will be reporting the first annual loss in its history when it reports results later this month.\n Despite all the red ink shares of Delta (DAL) were slightly higher in premarket trading on the report.",

        "title": "Impeachment ramifications are just beginning to unfold",
        "body_text": "The historic and rapid second impeachment of President Donald Trump came and went in a week. But the larger ramifications of the House's decision to impeach the President in his final days in office are just beginning to unfold.\n In the upcoming days, the Senate -- mainly the incoming Majority Leader Chuck Schumer -- will have to grapple with how best to handle an impeachment trial. The questions about how long the trial will be, when it will be held, how it will be structured? We don't have those answers right now and that's because those decisions haven't been made.\n The House and Senate are gone.\n But be on the lookout for any signals that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are having conversations about impeachment. One of the key dynamics that will govern whether senators push forward with an impeachment trial at the beginning of President-elect Joe Biden's presidency or whether they wait is going to be whether Republicans agree to allow some of Biden's nominees to move quickly through their confirmation processes in the mornings before the trial. Multiple sources have told CNN that there isn't a clear signal yet whether Republicans would allow the kind of dual-tracking Senate trial that Biden has suggested he'd like to see.\n Also, keep your eye on the statements coming from Republican senators: Over the next several days, some Republicans senators will make it very clear where they stand on impeachment. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, both Republicans from South Carolina, have done that. Last night, Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, did it too. Cotton said that after Trump leaves office, \"the Senate lacks constitutional authority to conduct impeachment proceedings against a former President.\"\n Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio who is up for reelection in 2022, said his decision with be based off of not only the evidence he hears, but \"among my considerations will be what is best to help heal our country rather than deepen our divisions.\"\n A reminder that Republicans must have 17 members vote \"yes\" to convict Trump in the Senate. All eyes have been on what McConnell decides. Multiple GOP aides have told CNN that McConnell's decision will certainly have an impact on the conference. But, it's also important to remember that while McConnell has a lot of influence, he's not going to be whipping members on a vote like this. And, for members in states where Trump is popular, McConnell's vote may not sway them at all.\n That doesn't mean members are not obsessing about where McConnell falls on this. In fact, multiple Republican members and aides CNN has spoken to in recent days have wondered why McConnell has stayed as quiet as he has. Members are asking each other what their leader is thinking. CNN asked a series of Republican senators if they'd heard from McConnell in recent days on this topic and aside from the conference-wide note he sent on Wednesday, all of the members and aides said McConnell has been giving members their space to think through this on their own.\n A Senate impeachment trial is not going to start until January 20 at the earliest.\n McConnell is not bringing the Senate back. In his note to colleagues Wednesday, McConnell said \"while the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote, and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\"\n This list is a long one. We don't know when the trial will start. We don't know how long it is going to be.\n As CNN reported last night, House managers met with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday night to begin laying out the way the trial could go, but no decisions have been made about whether they would collect evidence or bring witnesses: two things that could extend when a trial would begin in the Senate. In other words, the next few days are going to be about trying to get clarity on those two questions.\n While Democrats pushed hard to impeach Trump in the House, the reality of what a trial could mean for the opening days of Biden's Presidency is just sinking in. Senate Democrats are still all over the map, according to several members and aides. And, Biden isn't talking much to rank-and-file members about what he wants to see. So much of the timing of the trial will be based on whether McConnell and Schumer can work out an agreement that gives Biden time in the mornings to get some of his nominees. Again, anything in the Senate can move swiftly with agreement. Without it, the Senate is an excessively deliberate body.",

        "title": "Trump's bipartisan impeachment is historic",
        "body_text": "The House voted on Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time. This impeachment, unlike his first, was bipartisan. All told, 10 Republican representatives cast their vote to impeach Trump.\n This vote makes Wednesday's impeachment the most bipartisan impeachment of all time.\n To be clear, 197 Republicans still voted against impeaching Trump. That shouldn't be too surprising, as only about 15% of Republicans nationally want Trump to leave office before his term is up next week.\n Still, the fact that so many Republicans got behind removing Trump from office is historic.\n Only three other impeachments have ever taken place. They all tell a similar story: impeachments are almost always down the party-line affairs.\n During the impeachment of Democrat Andrew Johnson in 1868, no Democrats voted to impeach him.\n Just five House Democrats voted to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton in 1998.\n And finally, no Republicans voted to impeach Trump in 2019.\n What makes the Trump vote even more amazing is that we're at a very high level of polarization right now. The Democrats who abandoned Clinton were all moderate Democrats. Two (Virgil Goode and Ralph Hall) would eventually switch parties and serve as Republicans.\n There are very few moderate House Republicans right now. Rep. Liz Cheney and Rep. Tom Rice, who voted for impeachment, are certainly not what most objective observers would consider moderate.\n The relatively high number of Republican defectors comes at a time when Trump's job approval rating with Republicans has dropped below 80% (though it is still well above 70%).\n From a statistical angle, it would have been unexpected if more Republicans went against Trump. Trump may be in a valley of Republican support, but he's still got a lot of it.\n Most Republicans hail from safe districts where there is a far greater chance of losing a primary than a general election. Two of the Republicans who voted yes (Rep. Don Newhouse and Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler) hail from Washington state, where there is the untraditional top-two primary system in which all the candidates regardless of party run against each other.\n The only historical parallel to what happened on Wednesday is the abandoned impeachment of Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974. Nixon stepped down before the House could impeach him.\n Although no formal impeachment vote took place involving the entire House, seven of the 17 House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted for at least one article of impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. Keep in mind, there were a lot more moderate Republicans in the House in 1974.\n Perhaps as interesting as the divide within the Republican ranks is the uniformity within the Democratic ranks.\n Not a single Democrat voted against impeaching Trump. That's a record for an impeachment.\n In 1868, an Independent Republican and Conservative Republican voted against impeaching Johnson.\n In 1998, four Republicans voted against all the articles to impeach Clinton.\n And when it came to Trump's last impeachment, two Democrats voted against both articles and one voted present for both.\n The fact that Democrats are unified makes a lot of sense. Neither of the Democrats who voted against impeaching Trump last time are still sitting Democratic members of Congress. One of those Democrats is now a Republican (Rep. Jeff Van Drew) and the other (Collin Peterson) lost re-election last fall. The member who voted present (Tulsi Gabbard) is no longer in Congress.\n Further, the Democratic caucus is smaller than it was last go around with fewer moderate members overall.\n Of course, impeachment is just the first step in a two-step process.\n The big question going forward is whether the Senate partisan divide mirrors that of the House. If it does, there will be a lot of votes against Trump -- but still not enough to convict.",

        "body_text": "Two members of a World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic have been blocked from flying to China after failing a coronavirus antibody test.\n An international team of 13 scientists was due to land in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where cases of the coronavirus were first recorded in late 2019, on Thursday. But two members of that team remain in Singapore, the WHO said in a series of tweets, after they \"tested positive for IgM antibodies.\"\n IgM antibodies are among the earliest potential signs of a coronavirus infection, but could also appear in someone who has been vaccinated or previously infected (but is no longer a carrier) of the virus. False positives are also possible with such tests.\n Since November 2020, travelers flying into China have to show negative results for an IgM antibody test, and a PCR test, before they will be allowed to enter.\n The scientists in question are being retested, and had previously been tested and found negative for coronavirus multiple times, the organization said, adding that those scientists who have been able to travel to China, \"will begin their work immediately during the 2 weeks quarantine protocol for international travelers.\"\n At a regular press conference Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the country \"will strictly follow the relevant epidemic prevention regulations and requirements, and provide corresponding support and facilities for WHO experts who come to China to carry out international cooperation on tracing the origin of the virus.\"\n Asked about the two scientists denied entry, Zhao would not comment, instructing reports to ask \"the relevant authorities.\"\n State broadcaster CGTN reported Thursday that the WHO team \"underwent both throat swabs and serum antibody tests at the airport\" upon arrival to the country.\n This is the second delay for the WHO team, which was due to arrive in China earlier this month, but was blocked from flying there by the authorities, sparking a rare rebuke from the United Nations agency.\n \"I am very disappointed with this news,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials and I have once again made clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team.\"\n Tedros added the WHO was \"eager to get the mission underway as soon as possible\" and that he had been given assurances that Beijing was speeding up the internal procedure for \"the earliest possible deployment.\"\n That deployment began this week, as the majority of the team arrived in Wuhan, though they will be limited in what they can do as they finish a mandatory two-week quarantine.\n Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who heads the Erasmus Medical Centre's Department of Viroscience in Rotterdam and is part of the investigation team heading to China, said earlier this month that they were \"ready to go.\"\n Koopmans said that they have been told nothing is off limits while in China and said the team will be working in collaboration with their Chinese colleagues \"looking at the data, talking to people with expertise, and concluding from what's been done, and what can be built on.\"\n She said it was important to understand the origins of how the virus made the leap to humans because there is \"no country that doesn't have risk of disease emergence. It's something we need to understand, so the whole world can prepare.\"\n \"We really need to have patience and not judge. It's meticulous work, it will take time,\" Koopmans said.\n The United States and Australia have led the charge in criticizing China's handling of the initial stages of the pandemic, accusing Beijing of downplaying its severity and preventing an effective response until too late.\n Outgoing US President Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the global pandemic and announced that the US would terminate its relationship with WHO, saying that China had not properly reported information it had about the coronavirus and had pressured WHO to \"mislead the world.\"\n The US has demanded transparency in WHO operations in China. In November, Garrett Grigsby with the US Department of Health and Human Services told WHO's assembly that the terms of the investigation to China were \"not negotiated in a transparent way\" and \"the investigation itself appears to be inconsistent\" with its mandate.\n A trove of confidential documents obtained by CNN last year from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Hubei province -- where the virus was first detected in 2019 --  showed how Chinese officials gave the world more optimistic data than they had access to internally, by initially underreporting case numbers during the early stages of the outbreak.\n As countries around the world struggle with new infection surges and outbreaks, China appears to be rebounding. Last month, the country posted positive economic growth for the second quarter in a row.\n Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised China's anti-pandemic efforts at home and abroad, saying that the country \"launched an emergency global humanitarian campaign\" and \"helped build consensus on a global response to Covid-19.\"\n As the WHO team prepared to embark, Chinese officials and state media have questioned the virus' origins, with Wang himself claiming \"more and more research suggests that the pandemic was likely to have been caused by separate outbreaks in multiple places in the world.\"\n CNN's Beijing bureau contributed reporting.",

        "body_text": "(KHN)For Heather Suri, a registered nurse in Virginia, the race to vaccinate Americans against Covid-19 has thrown up some unprecedented obstacles.\n The vaccines themselves are delicate and require a fair bit of focus over time. Consider Moderna's instructions for preparing its doses: Thaw the vials for 2.5 hours in a refrigerator set between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Then rest them at room temperature for 15 minutes. Do not refreeze. Swirl the vial gently between each withdrawal. Do not shake. Inspect each vial for particulate matter or discoloration.\n And then there's this: Once open, a vial is good for only six hours. As vaccines go, that's not very long. Some flu vaccine keeps almost a month.\n \"This is very different, administering this vaccine. The process, it takes a whole lot longer than any mass vaccination event that I've been involved with,\" said Suri, a member of the Loudoun Medical Reserve Corps, who joined her first clinic on December 28 to vaccinate first responders.\n Of the first two Covid vaccines on the market, Moderna's is considered more user-friendly. Pfizer-BioNTech's shot must be stored in specialized freezers at 94 degrees below zero. Once out of deep freeze, it lasts just five days under refrigeration, compared with 30 days for Moderna's vaccine.\n One thing the shots have in common: They last a paltry six hours once the first dose is removed from a vial. That short shelf life raises the stakes for the largest vaccination effort in US history by forcing clinicians to anticipate the exact number of doses they'll need each day. If they don't get it right, precious stores of vaccine may go to waste.\n During one recent clinic over several hours, Suri estimated she gave \"maybe 25\" shots, many fewer than the number of flu shots she's given during similar clinics over the years.\n With Covid-19, she said, \"the vaccine itself slows things down.\"\n Public health officials say many factors are at play, including a shortage of workers trained to administer shots, Covid-19 protocols that require physical distancing at clinics and vaccine allocation numbers from the federal government that fluctuate by the week.\n And then there are the logistics of the first Covid-19 vaccines, which are complex and make hyper-vigilant practitioners wary of opening too many vials over the course of each day, for fear that anything unused will have to be tossed. Vaccine providers also report wasted or spoiled doses to public health authorities.\n \"If you get to the end of your clinic, and every nurse has half a vial left, what are you going to do with that vaccine?\" Suri said. \"The clock is ticking. You don't want to waste those doses.\"\n That impulse has led some health personnel to make dramatic decisions at the end of a day: calling non-front-line health workers or offering shots to whoever is at hand in, say, a grocery store, instead of scrambling to find the health workers and residents of nursing homes in the government's first tier for injections.\n \"We jumped and ran and got the vaccine,\" said Dr. Mark Hathaway, an OB-GYN in the District of Columbia, who received the first dose of a Moderna vaccine on December 26 along with his wife, a registered nurse specializing in nutrition. Both clinicians received vaccines faster than anticipated at a Unity Health Care clinic when there were extra doses because fewer front-line health care workers than expected showed up.\n \"Health care workers have been priority 1a, so our first attempt has always been our staff,\" said Dr. Jessica Boyd, Unity Health Care's chief medical officer. Since then, the community health center network has broadened its criteria for extra doses to include staff members or high-risk patients visiting a clinic, she said.\n Health officials encourage using the doses to get as many Americans vaccinated as quickly as possible. Public health experts say the need to vaccinate people is especially urgent as a new and more contagious variant of the virus first detected in the United Kingdom is showing up in multiple states.\n Some states, including New York and California, have loosened their guidelines on who can get vaccinated after an outcry over health care providers throwing away doses that didn't meet officials' strict criteria.\n The tiers \"are simply recommendations, and they should never stand in the way of getting shots in arms instead of keeping vaccine in the freezer or wasting vaccine in the vial,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said January 6, referring to CDC guidelines saying health care workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities should be first in line, then people at least 75 years old.\n The Trump administration this week also said it would make more shots available by releasing second doses and urged states to broaden rules to allow anyone 65 or older and any resident with a serious medical condition to get a shot.\n Pfizer-BioNTech's ultra-cold storage requirements have made it less ideal for local public health departments and rural areas.\n Both of the available vaccines arrive in multidose vials \u2014 Pfizer-BioNTech's contains about five doses, Moderna's 10. They are viable for only six months frozen. By contrast, during the H1N1 pandemic roughly a decade ago, the swine flu vaccines lasted 18 weeks to 18 months, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote in a May 2010 letter to then-HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n \"We can't get the vaccine out fast enough; we have people dying. But, at the same time, we have to get it right,\" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.\n The added risk of losing doses due to quick expiration is another thing \"causing angst,\" Hannan said. \"You can't just draw it up and let it sit. It can't just sit out like that.\"\n The Trump administration fell significantly short of its promise that 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of December, partly the result of a disjointed and underfunded public health system that has received limited guidance from federal officials. As of January 13, 29.4 million vaccine doses had been distributed nationwide but only 10.3 million administered, according to the CDC.\n Federal officials have released sparse data about who is getting vaccinated, but state information has shown significant variation in vaccination rates depending on the facility. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on January 4 said New York City's public hospital system had used only 31% of its allocated vaccines, while private health systems NewYork-Presbyterian and Northwell Health had used 99% and 62%, respectively.\n \"When you target a priority group, it's inefficient. When you open it up to a larger group, it's efficient ... but you're not going to have enough supply,\" Hannan said. \"You still have the challenge of getting those health care workers vaccinated and no matter any way you slice it, you still have limited supply. You can't please everyone.\"\n While Pfizer's vaccine has largely been earmarked for large institutions like hospitals and nursing homes, Moderna's has been more widely distributed to smaller sites like public health departments and clinics run by volunteers. State and local officials have begun or will soon vaccinate other priority populations, including police officers, teachers and other K-12 school employees, and seniors overall.\n Unlike the Covid-19 vaccines, many flu vaccines come in prefilled syringes \u2014 each syringe's cap is removed only when a shot is given, which speeds the process and eases some concerns about storage. However, relying on prefilled syringes during a pandemic has its own complications, according to Michael Watson, former president of Valera, a Moderna subsidiary: They take up more fridge space. They're more expensive. And they can't be used for frozen products, he said.\n \"For all these reasons, a vial was the best and only option,\" he said.\n In Ohio, Eric Zgodzinski, health commissioner for Toledo-Lucas County, said two-thirds of first responders the county surveyed said they would get the vaccine. Still, he said, his department has encountered situations in which a Covid vaccine dose is left over in an open vial and officials have turned to a waiting list to find someone who can arrive within minutes to get the vaccine.\n His department also has an internal running list of potential vaccine takers, including health department staffers, people in congregate care settings or those who had scheduled vaccination appointments for later on.\n \"We're not going to open up a vial for one individual and figure out nine other people right away,\" said Zgodzinski, whose department planned to distribute 2,200 doses of the Moderna vaccine the week of January 4.\n \"If I have one dose left, who can I give it to?\" he added. \"A shot in the arm for anybody is better than it being wasted.\"\n San Francisco editor Arthur Allen and senior correspondent JoNel Aleccia contributed to this report.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

        "body_text": "Over 40 million Americans in parts of at least a dozen states are under a combination of wind and winter weather alerts as a powerful storm pushes east Thursday into the Northern Plains through the Upper Midwest.\n Winds are expected to gust up to 65 and 75 mph across the Plains, combining with snow to create blizzard conditions for nearly 2 million people in the Upper Midwest.\n The storm already left some 700,000 customers in the Pacific Northwest without power. Parts of eastern Montana and the Dakotas on Wednesday reported near hurricane-force winds amid springlike warmth.\n \"The strong winds will usher in more seasonal conditions with temperatures generally in the 30s to low 40s on Thursday,\" CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward said.\n As the storm surges toward the Midwest, cold air behind the system will be greeted by enough moisture to unleash persistent snowfall, gusty winds and periods of blizzard-like conditions in parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and the Eastern Dakotas.\n \"Travel may become impossible due to winds and zero visibility with the blizzard conditions,\" CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers warns.\n The system is in no rush to move through the region, however, as the impacts could linger well into Friday for millions across the Great Lakes.\n Prolonged snowfall, accompanied by periods of heavy lake-effect snow on the south shores of Lake Superior, will lead to widespread coverage of 3 to 6 inches of snow in the Upper Midwest, with the highest totals likely ranging between 6 and 10 inches across Minnesota and northern Wisconsin.\n As the system advances eastward Thursday night into Friday, periods of snow, rain and a wintry mix will impact parts Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.\n A secondary low pressure system will form along the cold front as the system reaches the East Coast by Friday night into Saturday morning.\n While it promises to bring a soggy start to the weekend for the Northeast, the majority of the area will see rain, not snow, thanks to relatively mild January temperatures.\n Places like New York City and Boston will be in the mid- to upper 40s Saturday, with a half inch to an inch of rain, as opposed to the several inches of snow they would see if temperatures were colder.\n Snowfall Friday night and Saturday will be limited to Upstate New York and northern New England. For the most part, even those locations are only expected to see about 2 to 5 inches, though a few of the favored, higher elevation spots could see over a half a foot of snow.\n The storm earlier in the week gave several cities in the Pacific Northwest the wettest start to any year on record. And as of early Thursday morning, there were nearly 245,000 customers still without power in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, according to data from PowerOutages.US.\n Generating the storm's powerful winds has been the difference in air pressure between a strong high-pressure zone in the Southwest and the incoming low from the Northwest.",

She has familial ties to the university; her brother, DJ, is a sophomore on Washington State's men's basketball team.\n She said because of the pandemic, the timing worked out for her to turn toward her professional career. She added, \"Right now I think it's the perfect time to get in there and learn and become a better player.\"\n Rodman's selection Wednesday made league history, being the youngest woman ever selected in the NWSL draft. She is a standout forward for the US U-20 women's national team. In the CONCACAF championship game last March against Mexico, she scored two goals en route to a team victory and berth in the U-20 Women's World Cup.\n The Spirit, based in Washington, DC, finished third in an abbreviated fall 2020 season. The 2021 NWSL season is slated to begin in April.\n Defender Emily Fox, who has played for the US women's national team, was selected by expansion team Racing Louisville FC as the first overall pick in the draft.

        "body_text": "A businessman and a fringe internet activist who each played key roles in the conspiracy theory about Seth Rich, the slain Democratic National Committee staffer whose death was used by right-wing activists as a vehicle to help exonerate Russia from its 2016 election meddling, retracted and apologized for their statements this week.\n \"I take full responsibility for my comments and I apologize for any pain I have caused,\" the businessman, Ed Butowsky, said in a statement retracting his previous comments. \"I sincerely hope the Rich family is able to find out who murdered their son and bring this tragic chapter in their lives to a close.\"\n \"Today we retract and disavow our statements and we offer our apology to Mr. Rich and his family,\" said the fringe internet activist, Matt Couch, in a separate video posted online. \"I take full responsibility for my actions ... and would like to apologize to Mr. Rich and his family.\"\n The retractions came as part of a settlement Aaron Rich, Seth Rich's brother, reached with Butowsky and Couch over a lawsuit he filed against them in March 2018. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The Washington Times, a conservative news outlet that was also sued, also retracted its claims and settled with Aaron Rich in October 2018.\n In a statement, Aaron Rich said he was \"gratified\" at the fact the two have \"taken responsibility for the statements they have made.\"\n \"In the more than four years since we lost Seth, the accusations made against our family have only served to prolong our grief without bringing us any closer to finding Seth's murderer,\" Aaron Rich added. \"Although we will never be at peace until we obtain justice for Seth's murder, I hope that these events may encourage others to pause and consider the impact of accusing strangers of wrongdoing, give law enforcement space to do their jobs, and let us remember Seth in peace and with privacy.\"\n In November of last year Fox News settled a separate lawsuit with the parents of Seth Rich, who had sued the network for developing what the suit called a \"sham\" story about their son's death that caused them \"mental anguish and emotional distress, emotional pain and suffering, and any other physical and mental injuries.\"\n Seth Rich was fatally shot in Washington, DC, in July 2016. Police have said evidence indicates he was the victim of a botched robbery, but in the wake of his death, far-right activists and media organizations suggested something far more sinister.\n Without real evidence, these far-right activists peddled a conspiracy theory that posited Seth Rich leaked a trove of DNC emails to Wikileaks and was killed in retribution for the supposed leak. The theory was convenient for some on the right as they disputed allegations Russia hacked the DNC, something President Donald Trump had disputed.\n But the 2019 report from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russia's role meddling in the 2016 election, discredited the entire conspiracy theory. That report noted that WikiLeaks was communicating with the Russian military intelligence officers about the stolen DNC documents before and after Rich's death.",

        "body_text": "President Donald Trump has been impeached (again). In less than a week, he won't be President of the United States.\n But the collateral damage strewn in the wake of his presidency -- particularly in his wildly erratic last few months in office following his defeat by Joe Biden -- remains. And the political world just keeps turning.\n Which brings me to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who went from Trump acolyte to Trump scapegoat when he refused to overturn Biden's win in the Peach State, and his pending 2022 reelection race.\n Trump has made no secret of his desire to oust Kemp in next year's Republican primary. He's openly encouraged outgoing Rep. Doug Collins to take on Kemp and released a torrent of tweets (back when he could tweet) bashing the governor.\n \"Governor Kemp (@BrianKempGA) is down 18 points in a recent poll,\" tweeted Trump in December. \"Don't believe it, must be more!\"\n Kemp, who took the incoming from Trump without a word, sat down with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Greg Bluestein recently -- and talked about what his post-Trump world will look like.\n \"I plan on running in 2022. I'm not worried about any kind of primary fight,\" said Kemp, adding: \"I think when people really start thinking about this and realize what's at stake here, we've seen what a divisive primary does to our chances of winning.\"\n Maybe! (A poll released earlier this month showed Kemp with a wide lead over Collins, who has made no decisions about his future.)\n But even if Kemp survives the primary, he's almost certain to face a strengthened Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost to him in 2018.\n Abrams was widely credited with helping Democrats win both US Senate runoffs in Georgia earlier this month -- including when her hand-selected candidate, Raphael Warnock, beat Kemp-appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler.\n Combine Biden's win in November with the two Senate runoffs earlier this month and it's now beyond debate that Georgia is a swing state -- and one where the Republican brand, especially in the Atlanta suburbs, has been significantly tarnished by Trump.\n The uncertainty surrounding Kemp's 2022 prospects speaks to how even after Trump is no longer President, the chaos he wreaked will continue to shape American politics.",

        "body_text": "When Chobani started selling Greek yogurt in 2007, it upended the market. Now, it wants to do the same for iced coffee.\n This week, Chobani is launching a new line of refrigerated, ready-to-drink coffees. The new product comes in four flavors: one black cold brew option, one with oat milk, one with sweet creamer, and another with vanilla. The drinks, which come in 32-ounce packages, are now starting to arrive at retailers including ShopRite, HyVee and Publix. Chobani is suggesting the price of $4.49 per carton.\n The new line builds on Chobani's previous investments. About a year ago, the company started making oat milk and creamers, an undertaking that required major changes to Chobani's infrastructure: To make oat milk themselves, \"we basically built a factory within a factory,\" said Peter McGuinness, the company's president and chief operating officer.\n Coffee was a next logical step, he said.\n Because of the changes Chobani has made for creamers and oat milk, it didn't have to do that much more to be able to manufacture the ready-to-drink products, he explained.\n Chobani has good reason to get into coffee. Ready-to-drink coffee \"has been one of the fastest growing segments of the entire non-alcoholic beverage industry,\" said Caleb Bryant, associate director of food & drink at Mintel. According to Mintel's estimate, the US market is expected hit about $4 billion in 2020, up 7.6% from the previous year.\n But it's also a crowded market, and in launching its new product, Chobani will take on new, bigger competitors.\n Among the options on the grocery store shelf: Starbucks (SBUX) sells ready-to-drink iced coffee, cold brew, Frappuccinos and espresso drinks. Dunkin' sells its milky iced coffee. Beloved smaller brands like La Colombe have their own offerings.\n And others are vying for customers with their own spin on ready-to-drink coffee: Rise brews with nitrogen, Kitu Super Coffee is optimized for a keto diet, and Java Monster is a coffee/energy drink mashup.\n To develop an expertise in coffee, Chobani drew from what it learned at its Chobani Cafe in New York City, which sells cold brew coffee. It's been iterating the product and testing it out with consumers as well, said McGuinness. The coffee is made with premium, medium roast Arabica beans.\n The company is confident that its products will gain traction with customers, even though they have so many choices already.\n \"We love going against big legacy [consumer packaged goods] companies,\" McGuinness said. \"We did it in yogurt,\" he pointed out. \"We're a challenger brand. We like to disrupt and give consumers better choices. So that doesn't deter us, it excites us.\"",

        "body_text": "House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is standing by Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, as their conference has devolved into a bitter feud following President Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol riot and the Democratic push to impeach him, which Cheney voted for on Wednesday.\n A spokesman for McCarthy told CNN that the California Republican, who voted against impeachment, does not support efforts to remove Cheney as House Republican conference chair following a backlash over her vote.\n At the same time, several Republicans are focusing on the role of conservatives like Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama in riling up the crowd at a rally last week before the deadly riot, with some urging that he be censured or removed from his committee spots.\n The historic impeachment of the President -- the first to be impeached twice by the House during his time in office -- and the deadly riots at the Capitol have left congressional Republicans deeply divided. Many have argued that Trump bears responsibility for the mob violence seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, but just 10 House Republicans voted for impeachment.\n The vast majority of the House Republican conference, including McCarthy, voted against impeachment and several House Republicans have been hammering Cheney for her vote, which she announced the night before.\n Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally on Capitol Hill, told reporters he thinks Cheney should be ousted from her leadership position after the Wyoming Republican came out for impeachment.\n \"I think she's totally wrong,\" he said. \"I think there should be a conference and have a second vote on that,\" he added.\n And some House conservatives are circulating a petition to oust Cheney from her leadership spot.\n Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, said \"yes\" when asked by CNN if Cheney should step down as conference chair.\n GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York said of Cheney and her decision to impeach, \"It is extremely difficult for someone to be in a position of speaking for the conference with those thoughts.\"\n Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who voted for impeachment, voiced his support for Cheney on Wednesday night, tweeting, \"Liz has more support now than she did two days ago. She has gained immeasurable respect. Since the discussion is opened though, we may have to also have a discussion about who in our party fomented this, and their roles as ranking members.\"\n Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, on Wednesday dismissed pressure for her to step down after coming out in support of impeaching Trump.\n \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Cheney told reporters at the Capitol before the vote. \"This is a vote of conscience. It's one where there are different views in our conference,\" she added. \"But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis. That's what we need to be focused on. That's where our efforts and attention need to be.\"\n Cheney, who has broken with Trump on policy before and had become increasingly outspoken in criticizing the President as his time in office drew to a close, has defended her impeachment vote by saying that certain matters transcend partisanship.\n According to the Casper Star-Tribune, Cheney explained her decision in an interview with the Wyoming press corps by saying, \"There are some things that must never be partisan. And the defense of our Constitution, the defense of this republic, the defense of the peaceful transfer of power, ensuring that the Constitution and the constitutional duties we all have are carried out must never be partisan.\"\n While some Republicans are going after Cheney for her defiance of Trump, others want there to be consequences for members who they believe went too far in supporting the President's push to overturn the election results.\n Brooks has come under scrutiny for addressing the January 6 'Stop the Steal\" rally in Washington shortly before supporters of the President stormed the Capitol.\n He defended his remarks to CNN, saying, \"I said no violence. That's always been number one.\" He argued that his remarks were meant to reassure supporters of the President \"to ensure their freedom, to make sure that their voices are heard. They're the governed. We listen to them,\" and that he did not regret his role addressing the crowd.\n The congressman, a staunch conservative and one of Trump's closest congressional allies, was one of the first speakers at the rally, and his fiery language helped set the tone for what came next.\n \"Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass!\" the six-term Republican shouted to the assembled protesters. \"Our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives. ... Are you willing to do the same?\"\n The congressman expressed little concern at the prospect of a censure from his colleagues for his role in inciting the crowd, slamming \"socialist Democrats\" and saying, \"I don't know what they're going to do. But I'm going to stand my ground.\"\n CNN's Casey Tolan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "He spent his stimulus money on 30,000 masks for the homeless and others in need",
        "body_text": "The federal government has sent out direct payments to bring much-needed relief to millions of Americans reeling from the financial impact of the pandemic.\n Anyone below a certain income level -- $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples -- received a check for $1,200 last spring, and another round of $600 checks are being sent out now.\n But one criticism of the payments is that they are not targeting those who need help most. And not everyone needs the money.\n CNN Business heard from many readers who say that since they remain financially stable, they have chosen to use their stimulus payments to help those in need. And some, regardless of their own financial situation, say they feel a moral obligation to help others. Here's how they're paying it forward.\n Jeff Suchon of Highland Park, New Jersey, lives on a low fixed income and isn't working due to health concerns. While the stimulus money could allow him to live with greater ease for a short while, he decided last spring he wanted to use it instead to buy masks for the homeless and indigent.\n To date, he says, he's purchased more than 30,000 masks with his economic relief payments and some of his income.\n He's gotten help distributing the masks through the soup kitchen Elijah's Promise, homeless shelters, churches and food pantries.\n \"I live on fumes after buying the masks, but I feel good about it,\" Suchon said. His reasoning: By providing one person with a mask he's not only helping that person stay healthy, but also the people that person comes in contact with.\n \"We're all in this together. I just want other people to replicate it. If I can do it, you can do it,\" Suchon said. \"Good begets good.\"\n \"I've been donating money because I'm still working,\" Woods-McKinney said. \"Being able to help those in need has mentally helped me.\"\n One of Woods-McKinney's charities of choice is 100 Suits for 100 Men. In normal times it provides business attire for underprivileged men and women searching for work. But during the pandemic the group has been, among other things, distributing food to seniors in homeless shelters, according to the group's web site.\n Sheldon Joseph, who works at a credit union in the Seattle area, decided to take advantage of his employer's three-for-one match when he donated his stimulus checks to a local food bank and the Lavender Rights Project, which provides legal and other services for low-income people in the LGBTQ community.\n Working at a credit union, Joseph says, has made him all too aware of the fact that a large number of people don't have enough in emergency savings.\n Since he feels financially stable right now, he said, he felt his stimulus money should be put to good use. \"It's my responsibility to donate it and get it out into the community to those who need it,\" Joseph said.\n Carolyn Alonzo, who owns a Fetch! Pet Care franchise in Chicago, has seen her business take a huge hit during the pandemic. And to make matters worse, two of her dogs died.\n To counter her feelings of grief on both counts, Alonzo decided to create the nonprofit Obi's Pet Pantry to help people who are having a hard time financially providing for their pets.\n She keeps it stocked with food, blankets, collars, shampoo and other pet supplies in part with her stimulus money and with the donations the pantry receives.\n \"It's available for people in need, no questions asked, and all of the items are free,\" Alonzo said. \"I feel like I'm serving a purpose and if it wasn't for this, I don't know what I'd be doing right now.\"\n Bryan Kendall and his wife, Sally, live in Waterloo, Illinois, not far from St. Louis. They're both retired and volunteer at a local animal shelter. They used their last stimulus check and will use their current one largely to give money to the hourly workers at the shelter.\n Kendall, who worked as an electrician, is happy to have a secure retirement thanks to a pension and having always lived within their means. But he said he and his wife both \"came from nothing\" and know what it's like to struggle.\n \"My whole career was working by the hour. If I didn't work, I didn't get paid. And the minimum wage doesn't go very far,\" Kendall said.\n Matthew Pierce grew up in a low-income household and knows what it's like to not have enough money for the basics.\n That's why Pierce chose to use his stimulus payments to buy Uber Eats gift cards for many students and their families.\n \"This one is personal for me. Having been in need ... I know what would solve one day's worth of problems,\" he said.\n And as every good teacher knows, it's important to set a good example for kids.\n \"We have to model good civics. It's not something we're born with,\" Pierce said. \"We need to give back in times of need.\"",

        "body_text": "Most Hispanic adults in the United States want to receive a Covid-19 vaccine eventually, but Hispanic adults under 50 are twice as likely to say they will \"definitely not get the vaccine,\" according to an analysis of Kaiser Family Foundation's Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor Survey.\n Hispanic adults under 50 are also less likely to say that they will \"get the vaccine as soon as possible\" once one is approved and available, the analysis found.\n The surveys were completed by December 8, when coronavirus vaccines were not yet available to the general public.\n Only 20% of Hispanic adults under 50 reported that they would get the vaccine as soon as possible, compared to 38% of Hispanic adults over age 50.\n Almost one-fifth of Hispanic essential workers reported that they would \"definitely not\" get a vaccine under the circumstances.\n This vaccine hesitancy reflects gaps in vaccine confidence in Hispanic age groups. Older Hispanic adults are more likely to express confidence in a vaccine and to say that getting vaccinated is part of the \"responsibility to protect the health of others.\"\n These numbers suggest a need to increase vaccine trust in younger Hispanic Americans through public health outreach in these communities, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.\n Another recent analysis, also by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 35% of Black Americans would probably or definitely not get the vaccine, even if it was determined to be safe by scientists and widely available for free.\n Health and community leaders fear that vaccine hesitancy could result in some Black and Latino Americans not being vaccinated, even as Covid-19 continues to batter their communities at disproportionate rates.\n CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "He turns on everyone eventually.\n The \"he\" is, of course President Donald Trump. And the everyone is, well, everyone -- but in this case Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who has risen to infamy in recent years as the President's personal lawyer.\n In the wake of his second impeachment at the hands of the House on Wednesday, Trump told people around him to stop paying Giuliani's legal fees. As CNN reported on Thursday morning:\n \"Trump has been blaming his longtime personal attorney and many others for the predicament he now finds himself in, though he has not accepted any responsibility in public or in private, people familiar with his reaction told CNN. Giuliani is still expected to play a role in Trump's impeachment defense but has been left out of most conversations thus far.\"\n Seeking to do a bit of damage control Donald Trump Trump aide Jason Miller tweeted this out: \"Just spoke with President Trump, and he told me that @RudyGiuliani is a great guy and a Patriot who devoted his services to the country! We all love America's Mayor!\"\n (It may be worth noting here that Trump has been de-platformed from Twitter.)\n Trump's Miller's denial aside, the withholding of money from people performing a service for him is a long-standing Trump tactic. It's, well, sort of his thing.\n As USA Today wrote in 2016:\n \"Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades \u2014 and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n \"At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.\"\n What's 60 lawsuits between friends people you owe money and refuse to pay!\n Trump's attempts to penalize -- in a pecuniary fashion -- Giuliani is simply one of the latest examples of how, in the end, Trump casts out everyone who has ever been loyal to him.\n Giuliani, who two decades ago was among the most popular politicians in the country and who, had he never gotten wrapped up with Trump, would have had a legacy as \"America's Mayor\" following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, has forever tarnished how he will be remembered by the public.\n Rather than the face of America's resolve in the face of terrorism, Giuliani is now known as the steady presence at Trump's side -- sweating and spouting increasingly wild conspiracy theories while his hair dye runs down his temple.\n And for what? To be cast aside and blamed by Trump for something -- impeachment for inciting a riot -- that Giuliani could not have prevented had he wanted to?\n Trump, you see, is incapable of self-reflection. Or of accepting blame. Therefore he is endlessly in search of scapegoats for any \"wrong\" that befalls him. Nothing is ever his fault. It is always the fault of those who have somehow betrayed him. And everyone -- with the notable exception of those to whom he is related by blood and marriage -- eventually betrays him.\n The rise and fall of Giuliani would be tragic if the former mayor hadn't had so much agency in his demise.\n Giuliani, having spent decades in the same New York City orbit as Trump, knew exactly who the President was -- and is. Why then would Giuliani subject himself to the whims of Trump, knowing that, eventually, he would be the one to be pushed in front of the bus? Relevance, mostly. Giuliani's moment in the national spotlight had largely passed after his failed 2008 presidential bid. He had become the thing he feared most: A has-been.\n Enter Trump, who a) Giuliani had long known and b) needed all the help he could get. And so, Giuliani made the deal -- relevance (and some form of power and influence) in exchange for spending the years he was close to Trump in a defensive crouch -- waiting until it was his day to be the scapegoat.\n That day has now come. But none of us -- least of all Giuliani -- should be surprised. This is who Trump is. This is what he does.",

        "body_text": "Georgia Republicans have reassigned three fellow GOP lawmakers who backed baseless allegations of voter fraud related to the November presidential election.\n Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan on Tuesday changed state senate committee assignments for Sens. Matt Brass, Brandon Beach and Burt Jones, all of whom joined President Donald Trump's efforts to undermine the results in Georgia.\n Beach was stripped of his chairmanship of the Transportation committee and Jones was removed as chairman of the Insurance and Labor Committee. Brass was re-assigned to the Banking and Financial Institutions Committee, instead of remaining as head of the politically influential Reapportionment and Redistricting committee, according to Macy McFall, deputy chief of staff and director of communications for Duncan's office.\n The Atlanta Journal Constitution first reported the changes.\n The demotion was expected by Jones, who told CNN that \"he had a difference of opinion\" from Duncan, who has vehemently pushed back against allegations of voter fraud in the Peach State.\n \"It didn't bother me, other than it was an effort to try and just embarrass us and that really bothers me,\" Jones said Thursday. \"It was really unnecessary and pretty petty.\"\n He noted that this is the first time since his freshman year in office in 2013 that he has not held a chairmanship. Jones also said he and the other two senators weren't looking to overturn the election results but wanted a deeper investigation into potential issues in the state's voting process.\n \"We weren't trying to overturn an election,\" he told CNN. \"You have to have evidence to overturn an election but in order to have evidence you've got to investigate things.\"\n He added that his goal was to \"call out\" Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, who has consistently rejected Trump's claims of voter fraud.\n Brass and Beach did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n Republicans hold a majority in the Georgia Senate, with more than 30 seats out of the 56 total in the chamber.\n Jones, along with Beach, applauded the Texas federal lawsuit seeking to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's win in key battleground states including Georgia. The lawmakers at the time had alleged \"misconduct, fraud, and irregularities throughout the voting process.\" The lawsuit that was ultimately denied.\n \"We are the trustees of the people, and we must secure their vote against all those, both foreign and domestic, who would defraud them of their collective decision at the ballot box,\" read the December statement.\n McFall said that the new state Senate committee assignments are effective immediately.\n \"These committee chairs are uniquely qualified to develop real and lasting solutions aimed at building a better Georgia,\" Duncan said in a Tuesday statement. \"The Senate will continue to prioritize diligent committee work and sound public policy, and I look forward to working closely with each one of our chairs, and their committee members, as we work to enact policies that advance both the lives and livelihoods of all Georgians.\"",

        "body_text": "Since President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration won't be a heavily attended in-person event, his team is working on turning it into something different: A prime-time TV special.\n (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n President Trump has been impeached for a second time. Ten House Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" for his role in last week's violence at the Capitol. The final House vote was 232 to 197. Now, you remember what comes next: The article moves to the Senate, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said Trump won't face his trial until after Biden is sworn in next week. So, no, this impeachment won't force Trump out of office. Biden and his team are looking to keep the Senate trial swift, as Congress will be dealing with other important tasks, like Covid-19 relief and confirmation of Cabinet nominees.\n Investigators are now looking into the possibility that the Capitol riot was more than just a protest that spiraled out of control. Evidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests the breach may have been planned. Questions also have been raised about whether rioters had \"insider\" help. At least one protest organizer said he coordinated with three House Republicans. The Department of Justice is using tactics it typically employs in counterterrorism investigations to apprehend and charge suspects.\u00a0With a slew of new charges, including for Olympic medalist Klete Keller and a man seen on video wearing a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt, the number of new federal criminal cases is up to 32, with possibly hundreds more expected.\n Pharmacies are offering their help as the US struggles with its Covid-19 rollout. Pharmacists nationwide would have the capacity to administer 100 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine once supply is available, the CEO of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores said, giving important backup to overwhelmed health care systems. The World Health Organization is also asking wealthier countries to share vaccines with lower-income countries, urging kindness and global solidarity. In the 36 days since countries started vaccinating, 28 million vaccine doses have been administered in 46 countries. Only one of these countries is low-income, a WHO official said. There have been 5 million new Covid-19 cases and 85,000 deaths across the globe in the past week alone.\n Former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and ex-Flint Public Works Director Howard Croft have been charged in the Flint water crisis that left 12 people dead and sickened at least 80. Each faces two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty. Flint has been exposed to extremely high levels of lead since 2014, when city and state officials switched the city's water supply from the Detroit Water System to the contaminated Flint River in an effort to cut costs. The Environmental Protection Agency detected the lead in 2015 after residents complained. Snyder apologized in 2016 for the Michigan government's role in the crisis. Last year, the state reached a $600 million settlement with victims. Criminal charges against other officials were dropped in 2019.\n Afghanistan's intelligence agency says it has foiled an ISIS attempt to assassinate a US diplomat in Kabul. The country's National Directorate of Security reported that four ISIS members were planning to attack the US Charge d'Affaires in Kabul, Ross Wilson, along with Afghan senior officials on Monday. Public details on how they planned to carry out the killings are scarce, but all four would-be attackers have been arrested. The US State Department called the reports \"deeply troubling\" and reiterated the US commitment to peace in the region.\n It's always nice to know our vast, unexplored universe is just slightly less populated than assumed.\n \"Take me out to the Covid-19 vaccine site, take me out to the safe and socially distanced crowd!\"\n Ohhh, the trouble this machine could cause in a household.\n Space wine? That's a new status symbol, unlocked.\n Wait, direwolves were REAL?\n That's roughly the expected price tag of the major Covid-19 relief package Biden is expected to reveal today. And yes, it's expected to include $2,000 stimulus checks.\n \"Our relationship with technology has fundamentally changed. The pandemic has elevated technology to become an essential part of how we live, work, play and communicate.\"\n Sometimes you just need to look at something shiny.

        "title": "The US box office just had a horrible year. 2021 may not be much better",
        "body_text": "With the coronavirus pandemic shuttering theaters for months on end and major blockbusters delayed into an unforeseeable future, 2020 was one of the worst years in domestic box office history.\n The domestic box office, which includes the United States and Canada, ended 2020 with $2.2 billion in revenue, according to Comscore (SCOR). That's a massive 80% drop from 2019's nearly $11.4 billion North America box office.\n Now, with vaccines being implemented, there's hope that marquees could be lit up and theaters might once again be packed with people eager to watch films from someplace other than their couches.\n However, 2021 remains a big question mark in Hollywood. Things could still get a lot worse before they get better.\n \"What will eventually be great about 2021 is that our society will inch closer to stamping out the virus. That will inevitably bring stability to the film industry, which should rebound in a big way theatrically,\" Jeff Bock, senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations, told CNN Business. \"The difficult part is nailing down exactly when that will occur.\"\n The World Health Organization said Tuesday that herd immunity probably won't be achieved in 2021. That's terrible news for an industry that's been virtually destroyed by the outbreak, Bock said.\n \"That means wearing masks and staying out of confined spaces may end up lasting all year, which would likely force studios to pull a 'Warner Bros.,' he said. \"That's the worst-case scenario for the box office.\"\n \"Pulling a Warner Bros.\" means releasing movies to streaming platforms at the same time they're released to theaters, a strategy that shocked Hollywood when Warner Bros. announced it in December. (Warner Bros. and CNN share the same parent company, WarnerMedia.)\n Without new films to bring in moviegoers, sales will continue to plummet, which could lead to an extinction-level event for theaters.\n \"It depends on how long the big chains can keep creditors at bay. Rent will certainly be due,\" Bock said. \"Now, AMC (AMC), Regal and Cinemark (CNK) may end up throwing in the towel regardless. And if that happens, we all know there will be suitors swooping in to purchase those cinemas at bargain-basement prices. I mean, there's still a lot to like about the theatrical experience \u2014 especially for a company with deep pockets that is diversified.\"\n 2020 was also a big step forward for streaming, and the shift of movies to at-home viewing is unlikely to slow down. For example, Netflix (NFLX), the king of streaming, announced on Tuesday that it would release a new film \"every week\" this year \u2014 a major symbol of the changing dynamics of Hollywood as well as another hurdle for struggling theaters.\n \"Streaming will continue to be a factor no doubt,\" Paul Degarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN Business. \"But if 2020 showed us anything, it's that even with unlimited options at home, movie fans found a way to see films on the big screen whether at the drive-in, or in brick-and-mortar theaters.\"\n But hope isn't completely lost for theaters. Many blockbusters delayed last year, like Marvel's \"Black Widow,\" Paramount's \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and Universal's \"F9,\" the next installment in the Fast & Furious series, are set to open this year.\n That said, \"set to open\" is the key phrase here.\n \"It's all about the movies and the availability of theaters,\" Degarabedian said. \"Many of the issues that impacted the theatrical marketplace in 2020 will carry over into 2021. But thankfully a vaccine is here and once it is more widely distributed, the fortunes of the business will rise. But it will take some time and require a lot of patience.\"\n As the pandemic rages on, studios will have to ask themselves if they want to keep delaying major films or release the films directly in the home.\n These shifts are already taking place with Sony announcing Monday that it's pushing its supervillain film, \"Moribus,\" starring Jared Leto, from March to October. And according to Deadline, there are rumors that \"No Time to Die,\" the next James Bond film set for April, could be delayed again. (For those of you keeping score at home, this would be the third time the film has been moved since its originally planned April 2020 release.)\n It's tough to say what will happen, and even the smartest people in Hollywood aren't really sure, but Bock is cautionsly optimistic that the pandemic will be vanquished before the credits roll on 2021.\n \"Hopefully, the virus will be eradicated, the film floodgates will open up over the holiday season and audiences will once again experience the power of blockbuster filmmaking on the big screen,\" he said.",

        "title": "Watch out, Chewy. This 55-year-old pet store is coming for you",
        "body_text": "Petco is hoping the third time is the charm.\n The 55-year-old pet retailer launched its third IPO in company history Thursday \u2014 and this time it's taking aim at fast-growing online rivals like Chewy.\n The red-hot IPO market welcomed Petco back to the public markets with open arms. After raising $817 million, Petco's shares surged 56%, giving the company and its \"WOOF\" ticker a market valuation of about $6.2 billion.\n Petco has had a makeover since it went private in early 2016 through a leveraged buyout. The company, now known as Petco Health and Wellness, invested heavily in e-commerce and building veterinary and other on-site services aimed at making it a one-stop shop for pet owners.\n \"We are the only retailer that offers all the pet parents' needs in one place,\" Petco CEO Ron Coughlin told CNN Business.\n \"Whether you want to get your pet vaccinated, a check-up, groomed, trained, or buy human-grade food \u2014 we're the only ones who can do it all under one roof,\" he said.\n Like other brick-and-mortar retailers, Petco is leveraging its physical presence. The company is using its stores for not just grooming salons but as micro distribution centers with curbside pickup and ship-from-store.\n \"These things that people thought were albatrosses have become an advantage,\" Coughlin said, referring to Petco's stores.\n But Petco faces heavy competition from the likes of Chewy, which has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the pandemic.\n Chewy (CHWY) shares have skyrocketed 273% over the past year, including 27% in 2021 alone\n Coughlin, who joined Petco in June 2018 after stints at HP (HPE) and Pepsi (PEP), noted that Petco added about 1 million new customers in the third quarter, not far from the 1.2 million that Chewy added.\n \"They are considered a customer acquisition juggernaut. We feel very good about competitiveness,\" he said.\n Chewy is growing much faster, however. It surged 45% in the third quarter as Americans continued to buy pet food and supplies online. Petco, by comparison, reported slower but  solid quarterly sales growth of 16.3%.\n Both companies are benefiting from an increase in pet adoption during the pandemic, which has left many people with more time on their hands.\n \"People are at home. They're a little down. They're looking for bundles of joy,\" said Coughlin.\n Kathleen Smith, chairman and co-founder of Renaissance Capital, said there is a reason to believe these tailwinds in the pet business will persist even after the pandemic.\n \"The pet industry won't fall off a cliff. We'll keep our pets when we go back to work,\" said Smith, whose firm manages ETFs of recent IPOs.\n Unlike Chewy, Petco is profitable right now. The company's operating income rose by 84% during the first three quarters of 2020 to $127 million. \"We turned around the company faster than we expected,\" Coughlin said.\n But Petco is also saddled with $3.2 billion of debt, a legacy of its 2000 and 2016 leveraged buyouts.\n The company warned in its S-1 filing that its \"substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flows and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under existing debt agreements.\"\n Coughlin said Petco plans to use all of the proceeds from its IPO to repay debt. That would cut its debt and interest payments in half, he said.\n The Petco deal is yet more evidence of the strong IPO market.\n US-listed companies have raised a stunning $14.2 billion through 49 IPOs so far this year, according to Dealogic. That is by far the highest for this point of the year in stats going back to 1995. By comparison, no companies had gone public at this point in 2019 or 2020. And just four IPOs took place at this point in 2018, raising $1.3 billion.\n \"This IPO market is just on fire,\" said Smith of Renaissance Capital. The firm's ETF, with the ticker \"IPO,\" more than doubled in 2020.\n Besides Petco, this week also marked strong debuts for online lending startup Affirm and online clothing reseller Poshmark, which spiked more than 130%.\n \"With returns like that,\" Smith said, \"companies are just piling in to go public right now.\"",

As members of the Secret Service, each of us is expected to remain civil and professional at all times,\" Murray wrote in the memo, reviewed by CNN. \"When carrying out our duties and representing the agency, we are expected to behave in a nonpartisan manner.\"\n The Secret Service officially took charge of security for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday after the Department of Homeland Security extended the duration of the National Special Security Event in the wake of the violent attack on the US Capitol last week.\n \"This straight forward adjustment is in response to the heightened security environment in the wake of the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, January 6, and will simply provide additional time for the full resources of all participating agencies to be employed,\" Murray wrote.\n A Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment on the memo.\n According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is supporting government partners across the region for the inauguration, events may be designated National Special Security Events when they warrant \"the full protection, incident management and counterterrorism capabilities of the federal government.\"\n CNN reported on Tuesday that thousands of armed pro-Donald Trump extremists are plotting to surround the US Capitol ahead of Biden's inauguration, according to a member of Congress who was among those briefed late Monday.\n But the Secret Service is prepared to secure the inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security's second in command, Ken Cuccinelli, told CNN, while acknowledging there are always \"problem players\" who show up.\n \"There's always problem players that talk before an inauguration, and there are always some that show up,\" Cuccinelli, the DHS senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary, said when asked about threats to the event. Cuccinelli also said the Secret Service is preparing for the possibility of a bigger security problem than the events of January 6 but added that the agency is \"thoroughly prepared to contend with it.\"\n Several officials told CNN there is a much better feeling that things are organized and being put into place correctly because the Secret Service is in charge, with one official simply saying: \"They don't mess around.\"\n Murray told Secret Service employees they must \"remain above the fray\" as they carry out their \"zero-fail mission.\"\n \"Our mission remains clear and our focus must be sharp as we execute the Presidential Inauguration operational security plan many of us have worked hard to develop and even more of our people will directly support over the next week.

        "title": "Trump's environmental swan song sheds light on climate future ",
        "body_text": "An auction to lease the drilling rights along Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) attracted only three bidders, one of which was the state of Alaska.\n Half of the available leases attracted no bids at all, leaving a small percentage of the revenue drilling advocates had projected they could generate.\n Big oil companies such as Exxon, Shell and BP didn't bid on the tracts of land because of the \"reputational, legal and political\" risks, according to Ed Crooks, vice chair of the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.\n What was supposed to be part of the Trump administration's final push of environmental rollbacks seemingly provided very little interest from these important bidders.\n Drilling rights along the 1.6 million-acre coastal plain of the ANWR have been highly sought after for decades because of their \"high prospective for oil and gas resources,\" according to the Bureau of Land Management.\n The effort gained momentum when a mandate from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was signed into law in 2017, indicating a deadline for the first sale of the leases before the end of 2021. With President-elect Joe Biden's commitment to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Trump administration appeared to rush the lease sale for arctic refuge drilling before the end of his term.\n Part of the hesitation from the oil industry likely comes from the anticipation of regulations from the incoming Biden administration, which has included protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in its climate plan. A similar scenario played out with the auto industry. Manufacturers did not lower fuel-economy standards -- despite the Trump administration easing regulations -- in anticipation of tougher rules down the road.\n The lack of interest for drilling rights along a coastline estimated to hold up to 11.8 billion gallons of oil, paints a picture of how the United States -- and the world -- is expected to predominantly source its energy.\n Major oil companies are making investments in low-carbon businesses, such as solar, wind and hydrogen power. As costs continue to fall and climate change concerns rise, investments in renewable energy are expected to be even more attractive to the oil industry as they transition to a green energy future.\n The lukewarm response to ANWR drilling rights is another example of market forces overshadowing the recent rollbacks of environmental policy. Take coal, for example. Despite the Trump administration efforts to prop up the industry by rolling back climate regulations, the nation consumed more energy in 2019 from renewable sources while coal use fell sharply.\n Originally touted as a way to create jobs and offset tax cuts, the drilling of the ANWR poses a high degree of risk for financial backing as banks refuse to finance Arctic drilling projects. \"Every major American bank has stated unequivocally that they will not finance this destructive activity,\" Ben Cushing, a senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club, said in a statement.\n The Arctic Refuge's coastal plain is a sensitive ecosystem comprised of indigenous people, migratory birds and the calving ground for the Porcupine Caribou herd, to name a few. Disruption of this sensitive habitat could have direct impacts on the immediate environmental surroundings but also the larger planetary climate. The Arctic is already a literal hotbed for climate change, warming twice as fast as the global average, according to the most recent Arctic report card released by NOAA.\n The \"almost non-existent bidding for oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were not surprising. It confirms what we already know to be true: the era of drilling for oil at any cost is over,\" says Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, an environmental non-profit.\n Politicians and supporters of this project disagree, arguing that drilling in the ANWR would support America's energy independence and provide revenue to local and state communities.\n Even after the three highest bids were established at a fraction of their anticipated price, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy tweeted that it was \"historic for Alaska and tremendous for America.\"\n CNN reached out to Dunleavy's office for a comment on the seemingly low bids received for ANWR drilling, but they have not responded.\n Even though the bid results weren't as robust as projected, Kara Moriarty, president of Alaska Oil and Gas Association, is confident that the market still supports future access to oil drilling across the coastal plain of northeast Alaska.\n \"Today's sale reflects the brutal economic realities the oil and gas industry continues to face after the unprecedented events of 2020, coupled with ongoing regulatory uncertainty,\" she said in a statement.\n CNN's Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Germany's economy held up better in the pandemic than it did during the global financial crisis, despite a second wave of lockdowns in the fourth quarter and the reversal of more than a decade's growth in employment and trade.\n The country's Federal Statistics Office on Thursday forecast a 5% contraction in the economy in 2020 compared to the previous year, based on provisional GDP estimates. By comparison, Europe's biggest economy shrank 5.7% in 2009 during the recession that followed the financial crisis, it said in a statement.\n Nearly all major sectors with the exception of construction suffered a decline last year.\n Spending by households tumbled and business investment shrank the most since the financial crisis. Exports and imports of goods and services decreased for the first time since 2009, shrinking 9.9% and 8.6% respectively.\n \"Apparently, strength in the export-oriented manufacturing sector offset the effects of the lockdown,\" Commerzbank chief economist J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\n The German government shut restaurants, bars and clubs for the second time from the beginning of November in an attempt to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Non-essential shops, services and schools were shuttered in the middle of December and remain closed.\n \"Germany's outperformance reflects its comparatively light lockdown during the first wave of Covid-19, low share of tourism and hospitality in the economy, strong export sector, and generous fiscal support,\" added Capital Economics chief economist, Andrew Kenningham.\n The pandemic brought job creation to an abrupt end after 14 years of uninterrupted growth, according to the statistics agency. Germany shed 477,000 jobs out of 44.8 million in 2020, lifting the unemployment rate to 4%. That's a far cry from the United States, where millions of workers remain unemployed and the unemployment rate was at 6.7% in December.\n The near term outlook for Germany's economy is less encouraging, however.\n Lockdown restrictions remain in place and German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned this week that they may not be eased for several weeks.\n \"While it currently looks as if the German economy avoided a black eye in the final quarter of 2020, it is hard to see how it can perform the same magic again in the first quarter,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro economic research at ING, wrote in a note.\n \"Economic activity is likely to decline again in the first quarter,\" added Kenningham. \"While manufacturers should continue to benefit from strong external demand, the scope for catch-up growth will decline as output gets closer to its pre-pandemic level.\"\n Still, economists expect GDP to pick up strongly once vaccines are more widespread and warmer weather means people spend more time outdoors, where the virus is less easily spread.\n Lockdowns have also boosted domestic savings, which could juice the economy further if households spend some of the extra money, said Commerzbank's Kr\u00e4mer.\n That should allow German GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level by the final quarter of 2021, six to nine months before the wider European economy, Kenningham added.",

        "title": "Bitcoin prices roar back towards $40,000",
        "body_text": "The bitcoin roller coaster continues.\n The price of the top cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of nearly $42,000 less than a week ago before quickly falling back to around $30,000 -- more than a 20% plunge. But it has roared back in recent days and is once again trading just shy of $40,000.\n The drastic shifts illustrate just how volatile bitcoin has become, and suggests that bitcoin (XBT) investors hold on tight for what could be a bumpy, if ultimately profitable, rise.\n The cryptocurrency is clearly benefiting from recent weakness in the dollar and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero for several more years. That confidence is bolstered by the fact that more mainstream financial institutions like BlackRock (BLK) are declaring bitcoin a 21st century version of gold.\n Bulls also point to the fact that PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) are allowing customers buy and sell bitcoin and that top investors such as Mike Novogratz, Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller all back the cryptocurrency.\n The interest on the part of well-known investors and blue chip companies is one reason why bitcoin fans think the current rally differs from late 2017 -- when prices rose to nearly $20,000 before crashing to around $3,500 just a year later.\n \"In 2017, the surge was mainly driven by retail investors aiming to earn a quick buck. Now, we can largely attribute recent growth to large scale institutional involvement,\" Jai Bifulco, chief commercial officer with Kinesis, a gold and cryptocurrency firm, said in an email to CNN Business.\n But \"cryptoassets are infamously volatile,\" he added.\n That is certainly the case. Some experts think bitcoin prices may have more room to run due to the Covid-19 crisis.\n \"Economic uncertainty from the pandemic has led to an influx of investors looking to safeguard assets from traditional market downfalls,\" Don Guo, CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, a cryptocurrency exchange consulting firm, said in an email to CNN Business.\n \"As governments provide relief through monetary stimulus, investors are turning towards bitcoin to hedge against expected inflation,\" Guo added.\n Not everyone is convinced that the price can keep climbing.\n \"In the early days bitcoin was easily defined as an online cash system, today it is much more ambiguous,\" Alex Pickard, a vice president at Research Affiliates and a former bitcoin miner, wrote in a recent report. \"Bitcoin, like gold, is a vehicle for speculation. It is not a vehicle for investment.\"\n Pickard added that \"perhaps [bitcoin] is just a bubble driven by a frenzy of retail, and some institutional, money eager to get a piece of the action.\"\n Both can be true.\n Bitcoin's recent price surge may be a classic case of an asset running up too far too fast. But as with the big dot coms such as Amazon (AMZN) in the late 1990s, long-term investors who hold on may ultimately be rewarded -- assuming they can weather big dips along the way.",

        "title": "Before Substack, there was Medium \u2014 and its network is about to get bigger",
        "body_text": "Substack has become synonymous with writers looking to go independent. But for many years prior, there was a different go-to place for self-publishing: Medium.\n Medium, launched in 2012 by Twitter (TWTR) cofounder Ev Williams, has been the platform of choice for public figures to air newsworthy moments: Hillary Clinton used it to endorse President-elect Joe Biden and Chrissy Teigen wrote a moving essay on Medium about losing her son that went viral last fall. Its network of publications broke news on the controversial practices of facial recognition company Clearview AI and shared important investigations on domestic violence in Puerto Rico. Colin Kaepernick joined Medium's board in June. Throughout the year, Williams and his team of engineers refined the company's products, including newsletters.\n \"What we really think about is: How do we engage people, pull them in, and get them feeling that reward, that feedback cycle for spending time on reading, writing and thoughtful content?\" Williams told CNN Business in a recent interview.\n Now through a new acquisition, Medium has another way to entice people to read its content and write for its network. Medium is acquiring Glose, a digital platform for buying, reading and discussing books. Glose's 20 employees, most of whom are based in Paris, will join Medium. Glose CEO Nicolas Princen will become vice president of books at Medium. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n \"The vision is to create an experience where you can go from one to the next,\" Princen told CNN Business. \"You can read an article and then just one-click purchase a book that connects to that content if you want to go deeper.\"\n Glose is Medium's tenth acquisition. But the deal is arguably Medium's boldest step in expanding to new formats \u2014 in this case, books \u2014 while still focusing on its mission to make publishing and reading easier and more rewarding through its minimalistic website and social sharing abilities. Both companies have similar missions: Encourage people to read more and to pay for content.\n Medium has been recruiting more writers to regularly contribute to the platform. That investment comes amid the rise of Substack. Last year, a string of notable journalists with strong followings left their corporate jobs to focus on their own paid newsletters on Substack. One of Medium's selling points is a built-in audience, a feature absent on Substack, where the onus is on writers to solicit subscribers.\n \"Medium is really about working together to create more value,\" Williams said. \"If there's already millions of readers and hundreds of thousands of subscribers on the platform, you can tap into that. It's much easier, especially for new writers, to build a following and get paid.\"\n Both Medium and Substack support subscription businesses. Medium changed its focus from advertising to subscriptions in 2017, a move that resulted in cutting one-third of its staff at the time. But whereas Substack requires consumers to pay for individual authors or publications, Medium is betting on a bundle of content, more like a traditional magazine or newspaper.\n Medium charges $5 per month or $50 per year for access to all of its content, from both contributors and its own publications. Medium said it distributed $11 million to writers last year in its Partner Program. Books, however, won't be covered by a Medium subscription.\n Susan Orlean, an author and staff writer for The New Yorker, told CNN Business that she was approached last year to be a regular contributor by a Medium editor who pitched her by comparing the experience of writing on the platform to using Twitter, except \"going a little bit longer\" and making money from it.\n Medium \"feels conversational, almost as if I can begin picturing people who are reading it,\" Orlean said. \"It's nice to have a way to write that is really fun.\"\n Orlean said she was not interested in launching her own newsletter on Substack \u2014 at least not at the moment.\n \"I think that there is more responsibility if you are promoting a subscription-based newsletter. That comes with a different kind of pressure,\" Orlean said. \"But they both go to the notion that it's an opportunity to monetize a certain kind of writing that we've all been doing on social media for free to some degree.\"\n Williams and Princen met by email introduction in 2014 through a mutual friend who thought the two shared a vision. Princen said the inspiration for Glose came from his time working for former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.\n \"My job was to have a very high level view on how technology was going to impact basically everything, at the time of the huge rise of social media,\" Princen told CNN Business. \"Reading seemed to be one of the places where there were holes on the internet that could be filled... that there were actually ways to make reading better.\"\n The company name is a reference to the Latin word for \"annotation.\" Like Medium, Glose features a social component to reading. One feature, available on both platforms, allows readers to highlight and share passages of text.\n Glose also sells ebooks and audiobooks, offering more than 1 million books through partnerships with more than a thousand publishers including Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Hachette, and Simon & Schuster. The service boasts one million readers globally and serves as the ebook provider of choice for over a dozen colleges including Stanford University and Columbia University.\n Six years into building the product, Princen said his team had planned on raising money to start marketing the company \u2014 until Williams reached out. The email exchange eventually led to the acquisition.\n Williams said he envisions Medium users blogging more easily about the books they read and starting discussions about them. He also thinks connecting Glose and Medium will help readers discover authors and writers.\n \"If I'm reading a book and some particular passage speaks to me, I can very seamlessly take that to my blog, maybe write about it, maybe have a discussion about it,\" Williams said. \"If that's all an integrated, seamless experience, it checks so many boxes in terms of adding value for me, the reader.\"",

Now, the stretch of South Lamar Street between Interstate 30 and South Central Expressway will be known as \"Botham Jean Boulevard.\"\n The stretch includes the South Side Flats apartment complex where Jean lived and was killed, and Dallas Police Department headquarters, according to CNN affiliate KTVT.\n \"Renaming the street in honor of Botham Jean would show the citizens of Dallas that his death was not in vain and show the world his life mattered,\" the proposal for the name change states.\n Amber Guyger, then a Dallas police officer, fatally shot the 26-year-old Jean in his apartment on September 6, 2018.\n Guyger testified at her trial that she went to the apartment thinking it was hers, when she in fact lived directly below. Jean was inside, watching TV, and Guyger testified she thought he was an intruder. She fired her service weapon and killed him.\n In October 2019, Guyger was convicted of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

        "title": "Capitol riot denialism is already here",
        "body_text": "Law enforcement agencies are rounding up suspected rioters, combing through social media evidence, and uncovering the true depth of the plot to overtake the Capitol and stop the certification of Joe Biden's election.\n The story is getting bigger every day. But there is also a concerted effort underway, all across the pro-Trump media landscape, to make it smaller.\n Far-right personalities are trying to minimize the Capitol attack and divert blame away from President Trump. There are even some strands of full-fledged 1/6 denialism, something akin to the 9/11 \"truther\" movement that has festered on the internet for nearly 20 years.\n CNN's Ed Lavandera interviewed pro-Trump protesters in Texas six days after the domestic terror attack and reported that \"the conspiracy theories are running rampant.\"\n One of the Trump supporters, Ryan Wolfe, told Lavandera, \"I believe that either foreign intelligence officers or local militant groups incited the conflict.\"\n Another Trump fan, Darrell Fliflet, said \"I feel it was people like Antifa, Black Lives Matter, who infilitrated the crowd, that caused the problems.\"\n The Antifa narrative, designed to exculpate the Trump supporters who ransacked the Capitol -- and also exonerate Trump for encouraging them -- has been debunked, yet it persists. Another denialist narrative aims to downplay the severity of the attack, even as new evidence to the contrary emerges every day.\n One America News, a cable channel led by Robert Herring, who says Trump is the best president of his lifetime, has sanitized the violence by referring to the riot as \"the Capitol Hill incident\" more than fifteen times this week.\n One of the most laughable narratives has to do with the timeline of the attack. Raheem Kassam, a former Breitbart editor who now leads a far-right website called The National Pulse, has advanced an argument that the rioters couldn't have possibly attended or heard Trump's speech earlier in the afternoon.\n The argument is full of holes, but Kassam was given airtime on both Newsmax and One America News to promote it anyway. One America News re-aired his claims at least sixteen times, according to a search of the media monitoring service TVEyes.\n \"Without a teleportation device, it is impossible for somebody to have been at the president's speech and then at the Capitol,\" Kassam claimed on OAN. His so-called evidence: Some protesters were already at the Capitol while Trump was still speaking about a mile and a half away.\n But many reporters said they saw some rallygoers leave early to walk to the Capitol, and others listened to portions of the speech on their phones.\n Some initial security barricades were overrun while Trump was still speaking, but a much bigger crowd descended on the Capitol after he urged rallygoers to \"walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\n Trump's speech ended at 1:11 p.m. and the doors to the Capitol were breached shortly after 2 p.m., according to timelines compiled by news outlets. That's more than enough time to walk a mile and a half.\n Furthermore, Trump had been spreading lies about the election for more than two months, so his lies at the rally were only one factor in the insurrection. But Kassam argued that \"what we have to do is treat these two events as completely separate events.\"\n The timeline theory has been picked up by Trump aides like Jason Miller, who said on Fox News Wednesday night, \"the bad actors started going into the violence and destruction even before President Trump finished speaking.\"\n While that is technically true, it does not let Trump off the hook. It's all part of a propaganda strategy to divert attention and culpability away from Trump and his supporters.\n Greg Kelly, the highest-rated host on Newsmax, pushed the same notion on Wednesday night. He said there is \"overwhelming\" evidence that Trump \"did nothing wrong\" on the day of the attack.\n Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College who studies political misinformation and conspiracy theories, said these are instances of \"motivated interpretations\" by Republicans.\n \"Antifa blaming is relatively rare outside the extreme fringe,\" he said. \"What I've seen much more of is an effort to minimize the severity of what happened and/or the role of Trump and other elite conservatives.\"\n In other words, when the facts are hard to deny, partisans choose to downplay them instead.\n On One America News, for example, Kassam was billed as an \"eyewitness\" to the riot. He said \"it was nothing like\" a war zone and described just a \"very small crowd\" of troublemakers, which is belied by the video evidence.\n Video evidence contradicts the Antifa narrative, too. Numerous staunch supporters of Trump have been identified in videos of the riot. Yet recent headlines on Gateway Pundit, a resolutely pro-Trump website, have included multiple references to Antifa.\n One article quoted a Trump-aligned journalist saying that \"Antifa clearly led the attack. That was utterly obvious.\"\n The article also said matter-of-factly that \"Trump supporters do not hate cops.\"\n There is ample demand for this supply of denialist content. A host on OAN who has also worked with the Trump campaign's legal team posted a video of people pouring into the Capitol and blamed the police: \"Capitol police open doors for the protestors. They stand aside and invite them inside.\"\n The officers were grossly outnumbered, but the host's tweet gained nearly 50,000 retweets and 75,000 likes.\n The Antifa blame game started within hours of the riot and gained significant traction on Fox News, with host Laura Ingraham saying \"they were likely not all Trump supporters\" and her guests speculating about Antifa's role.\n During Wednesday's impeachment debate, the House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy urged a stop to the conspiracy theorizing about left-wing infiltrators.\n \"Some say the riots were caused by Antifa,\" McCarthy said. \"There is absolutely no evidence of that, and conservatives should be the first to say so.\"\n Yet the false idea keeps spreading and spreading, like a new lie layered on top of the old lies about the election.\n \"I have to admit I'm kinda shocked by the people reaching out to me epistemically convinced that last week was an Antifa operation,\" conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted Thursday morning. \"They have found Rumble videos to confirm for them exactly what they want to hear and do not trust the FBI or even the GOP to tell them the truth.\"",

        "title": "Silent Melania Trump plods toward end of her husband's tumultuous term",
        "body_text": "Two days after his supporters rioted on Capitol Hill last week, President Donald Trump informed the world he would not be attending President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n \"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" tweeted Trump via his official account, which no longer exists.\n Many inside the White House were hearing the President's thoughts on this important and historic issue definitively for the first time -- including his wife, according to a senior White House staffer.\n First lady Melania Trump has spent the last several weeks operating inside a gray area of what might happen, with many big decisions such as this one made at the whim of the man to whom she is married.\n Until that tweet, the White House staffer said, Melania Trump was not 100% sure she would be going to Biden's inauguration, or wouldn't be.\n \"It's not the first time she has learned what he was doing because he tweeted it before he told her,\" said the source, who downplayed the significance of the first lady being delivered news about what is ostensibly her schedule too, based on Trump's mood that particular day.\n The staffer, like many, was clear that the event with the tweet did not solicit their sympathy for the first lady.\n \"She's part of this. She can be silent, but she's part of this,\" the source said.\n \"This\" being the recent activities of the President, the denial of his loss, the complicity of inciting inflamed supporters with lies and conspiracy theories, and the abject abdication of an official role. The outgoing first lady hasn't done anything of significance as the weeks of her tenure come to a close. She hasn't established an office for continuing her platform in the post-White House years, according to a source familiar with her activities. Nor has she helped with the onboarding of incoming first lady Jill Biden -- with whom she has still not made contact, the source said.\n The only thing Trump has done, besides pack the White House, work on photo albums of her time as first lady and oversee photo shoots of a rug and decorative items, is make a convoluted statement about the events of last Wednesday, five days after they occurred.\n \"There's never been any first lady as stubborn and defiant as Melania Trump,\" says Kate Andersen Brower, author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\" \"I think she's digging in. I think she has channeled her husband's fury and is obviously not interested in playing the traditional role of a first lady who, in times of crisis, seeks to unite and soothe the country.\"\n Instead, she has stood by the President, something she hasn't always done before in times of turmoil. In her Monday morning statement, Trump did not mention her husband's name, nor did she indicate he should receive an iota of responsibility for the insurrection.\n Instead, she appeared to lift parts of old statements and speeches into this new one, and added in a paragraph painting herself as a victim of a former staff member's continued criticism. Trump's reclusive manner has, at times, churned up public curiosity about just how aligned she is with the President, particularly when he's being criticized. Her hand swats, steely eyed visage and frequent outbursts of independent opinion crafted a possible scenario for critics of her husband that perhaps she was not like him, or even, did not like him.\n But if the last few weeks have proven anything, it is that she is more aligned with the President than most would assume.\n \"She understands her husband and what he stands for, and it simply does not bother her,\" said Brower. \"She is not a victim and she will not leave the White House apologizing for her husband's behavior.\"\n As the President publicly railed against the election, fraudulently claiming it was rigged and clinging to the false hope of staying in the White House, his wife was packing up their things to move out, say multiple sources who have observed Trump's activities since late November.\n The first lady is now more than halfway done with the job of shipping belongings either to Mar-a-Lago or to storage, having bit-by-bit overseen the moveout for weeks. The residence staff has had to help with the semi-clandestine operation, facilitating packing logistics without raising the ire of the President, who truly believed he would be staying put.\n The residence staff stay on in their roles, many through several administrations. It does not matter who the President is, it matters only they represent the American presidency.\n \"They are the most patriotic people I've ever met,\" said Brower, whose first book was \"The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\" \"They have been going ahead with the move, but they had to do some of it undercover because they do not want to upset (President) Trump.\"\n Melania Trump's expediency in getting packed and ready to go also signals her desire to be done with Washington and the last four years of dramatic highs and lows.\n \"(Melania Trump) is not sad to be leaving,\" said one White House official with knowledge of Trump's mood.\n That's one place she differs from her husband -- he wants desperately to stay, she's cool with going.\n \"Pat Nixon is the most recent example I can think of of a first lady who compares at all to Melania Trump,\" said Brower, but perhaps only in circumstance, not action.\n \"As Watergate raged on, Pat Nixon spent lots of time sequestered in her room alone in the Residence. Butlers brought her breakfast and often she would only drink the coffee. People around her grew concerned about her health because it was obvious that Watergate was taking a toll and she was losing weight,\" the author said.\n Those who have been around Trump in the last two weeks have not noted a demeanor shift to isolation and sadness, in fact it was Trump's lack of emotional connectivity to the terrifying riots that unfolded live on television, and her lack of desire to issue an immediate response or condemn the violence in real time, that prompted two of her longest staffers to submit their resignations effective immediately, sources said.\n \"Usually the first lady of a one-term president comes to his side publicly. President Ford served less than a full term and Betty Ford actually stepped in to read his concession letter to Carter when he lost in 1976,\" Brower said.\n On Wednesday, an announcement was made that Blair House, the historic official guest house of the White House where several Presidents (including Trump) have stayed overnight before their swearing-in, would welcome Biden to stay as well. CNN has previously reported Biden, without an invitation yet extended to him by the President and first lady for Blair House, intended to stay at a hotel on Inauguration eve.\n But the invitation was not sent at Melania Trump's insistence.\n \"She had nothing to do with it,\" said the staffer. The invitation may have read \"White House,\" but it was issued via the State Department, whose Office of the Chief of Protocol oversees Blair House's management.",

        "body_text": "The African Union has secured an additional 270 million Covid vaccines doses for African countries, but it still may not be enough to meet demand for the region, the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) announced Wednesday.\n At least 50 million doses will be available from April to June 2021 from Pfizer, AstraZeneca (through the Serum Institute of India) and Johnson & Johnson, according to an AVATT press release.\n African Union Chair President Cyril Ramaphosa said \"From the onset of this pandemic, our focus as a continent has been on collaboration and collective effort. We have held steadfastly to the principle that no country should be left behind.\n All 270 million vaccine doses will be made available this year with at least 50 million being available for the crucial period of April to June 2021.\"\n These vaccines have been secured alongside a vaccine program from COVAX- a World Health Organization and Gavi Vaccine Alliance initiative to bring more vaccines to Africa on a fair basis.\n The WHO Regional Director for Africa praised the move during an online media briefing on Thursday.\"Covax can only cover 20% of the African population, so it is really wonderful to see the African Union's efforts to secure a provisional 270 million doses by the end of 2021...\" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti.\n However, President Ramaphosa cautioned that while the initiative was 'vital' it may \"not extend beyond the needs of frontline health care workers, and may thus not be enough to contain the ever-increasing toll of the pandemic in Africa.\"\n Africa is experiencing a second wave which is \"higher than the peak experienced last July,\" with an average daily new case count of more than 25,000 in the last 14 days,\" Dr. Moeti added.\n The African Export--Import Bank will support the strategy by providing advancements of up to $2 billion to the manufacturers on behalf of member states, South Africa Presidency said in a statement on Wednesday.\n The African Union and the World Bank are also working together to to allow member states access to $5 billion to purchase more vaccines.\n AVATT was formed in August to ensure the continent could secure enough vaccine doses to achieve herd immunity.\n The announcement is welcome news for Ramaphosa as South Africa extended coronavirus restrictions on Monday, citing a \"massive increase\" in Covid-19 cases driven by a variant discovered last year.\n Meanwhile, countries have been on a vaccine shopping spree for months.\n The People's Vaccine Alliance, an international vaccine watchdog that includes Amnesty International and Oxfam, said in December that rich countries had bought enough Covid-19 vaccine doses to immunize their populations three times over.",

The book approval official Bolton worked with has backed up his retelling of the process, saying through her lawyer that Trump allies sought to protect the President.\n Judge Royce Lamberth of the DC District Court decided on Thursday Bolton's evidence-gathering will be heavily controlled in his court. He will be able to seek some evidence from junior government officials at first and must get the judge's approval before continuing.\n \"Bolton may conduct discovery only on his allegations that President Trump or senior White House officials acted in bad faith by intentionally delaying prepublication review and by attempting to attempting unduly influence classification decisions,\" Lamberth wrote.\n The Bolton book -- a major damaging moment for Trump politically during an election year -- is one of the episodes that also garnered significant criticism of the Trump administration's politicization of the intelligence community and Justice Department.\n Former Attorney General William Barr had signed off on a White House request to sue to stop the publication of Bolton's book, an extraordinary move days before its release.\n In line with his hands-off approach outside of his political circle, Barr sent now-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to discuss with department attorneys how they must file the lawsuit against Bolton, according to a person familiar with the handling of the case. The lawyers advised that an attempt to stop Bolton's book publication was ill-fated. Their concerns were ignored and Barr signed off on the lawsuit, the person said. That part of the lawsuit, seeking to stop the publication, failed because the book was already in booksellers' hands.",

        "body_text": "Taco Bell knows you're upset about losing potatoes. It's sorry it hurt you. And it's bringing them back.\n Last year, Taco Bell cut a number of items from its menu, including two dishes that featured its seasoned potato bites: Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes and the Spicy Potato Soft Taco. Those two items will be back in restaurants on March 11, the chain announced on Thursday.\n Rumors of potatoes getting axed started to swirl last summer after a Reddit user, identified as a verified employee, said potatoes were leaving the menu. Taco Bell soon confirmed the news, leading to a stream of dismay online.\n \"Taco bell getting rid of potatoes is worse than my parents divorce,\" one person tweeted in July. \"I don't think I can forgive Taco Bell for taking potatoes off their menu,\" wrote another. People posted cry-face emojis, and heartbreak emojis. A Change.org \"petition for Taco Bell to NOT remove all potato items,\" among other items, garnered over 5,000 signatures.\n The potatoes were booted from Taco Bell's menu in August.\n \"I feel like I've almost heard from everybody in the country on the potato bites,\" said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell's global chief food innovation officer. \"This was the one that really hit home for people,\" she said, noting that Taco Bell got more feedback on this particular decision than it expected.\n Taco Bell doesn't usually up and pull a beloved menu item. Typically, the brand runs tests and talks to consumers before making such a decision, Matthews said.\n But after the pandemic-related shutdowns in March, Taco Bell found itself having to direct all customer traffic to its off-premise channels, including the drive thru. In order to alleviate the pressure on its operations and help get customers through the drive-thru quickly, it made some menu cuts.\n It takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the potato bites, Matthews said, so they had to go. Ditching potatoes \"was painful,\" she said, noting that it was the right thing to do at the time.\n The loss was particularly difficult for vegetarians, who already have limited choices in fast food. For some of them, Taco Bell has been a reliable go-to. In 2019, the chain debuted a vegetarian section on its menu board to help guide customers to its veggie items. It also makes it easy to modify orders to remove meat.\n Once an item is off the menu, it takes time to bring it back. Taco Bell has been discussing the potato comeback over the past three months or so, Matthews said. It's planning to debut more potato items eventually, she added.\n The chain is also teaming up with Beyond Meat (BYND) to test out a new product next year, it said Thursday.",

        "body_text": "Investigators have identified more than 200 suspects in their probe of the January 6 attack at the US Capitol and arrested more than 100 individuals, FBI Director Chris Wray said Thursday in his first public appearance since the riot.\n \"We know who you are if you're out there, and FBI agents are coming to find you,\" he said during an inauguration security briefing at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington with Vice President Mike Pence.\n Wray's comments come as federal investigators are chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in last week's attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington and around the country.\n The challenge, FBI and Justice Department officials say, is \"unprecedented\" and Wray addressed the duality of the current situation in his comments Thursday by speaking directly to those who may be considering taking part in violent acts going forward.\n \"My advice to people who might be inclined to follow in the footsteps of those who engaged in the kind of activity we saw last week is stay home,\" he said. \"Look at what's happening now to the people who were involved in the Capitol siege.\"\n Yet, while federal law enforcement officials have sought to reassure the American public in recent days that they are up to the task on both fronts, their public remarks also lay bare the enormity of the challenge they face in tracking potential threats to not only the nation's capital, but across the country.\n Even as the FBI and its law enforcement partners continue to track down suspects from last week's attack, Thursday's briefing from Wray offered yet another indication that officials are increasingly worried about more violence in the days ahead.\n CNN previously reported that federal law enforcement officials are warning that domestic extremists are likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on President-elect Joe Biden's upcoming inauguration and throughout 2021 after seeing the success of last week's siege on the US Capitol.\n In a series of bulletins and calls with local partners this week, federal law enforcement agencies issued an urgent call for assistance in securing the nation's capital as the inauguration nears, and painted a dire picture of potential threats leading up to January 20.\n State officials around the country are also ramping up security. In Oklahoma, House members were told not to come to the state capitol this weekend due to concerns about possible protests. Fencing has been erected around the Arizona state capitol \"out of an abundance of caution\" and Oregon State Police will be assisted by the National Guard as they deal with possible demonstrations.\n On Thursday, Wray reiterated that the FBI has \"confidence\" in its preparation and security surrounding the inauguration next week.\n \"Our posture is aggressive. It's going to stay that way though the inauguration. So in that vein, we and our partners have already arrested more than 100 individuals for their criminal activities in last week's siege of the Capitol and continue to pursue countless other related investigations.\"\n But Wray also acknowledged that the FBI has been seeing \"extensive\" chatter surrounding the inauguration and said \"one of the real challenges in this space is trying to distinguish what is aspirational and what is potential.\"\n \"We're monitoring all incoming leads -- whether calls for armed protests, potential threats that grow out of the January 6th breach of the Capitol or other kinds of potential threats leading up to Inaugural events and various other targets,\" he said.\n \"Right now we're tracking calls for potential armed protest,\" Wray added.",

        "body_text": "The record stock market run is great news for BlackRock: The owner of the super popular iShares family of exchange-traded funds reported earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter Thursday that easily topped forecasts.\n BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest money management firm, ended the year with nearly $8.7 trillion in total assets -- an increase of 17% from a year ago.\n Roughly $2.7 trillion of BlackRock's assets under management are in the company's iShares ETFs. That's up 19% from the end of 2019. Investors plowed nearly $79 billion of new money into iShares funds during the fourth quarter alone.\n BlackRock held up much better than other big financial stocks in 2020 -- a year of turmoil and volatility due to the global Covid--19 crisis and resulting recession. The firm has benefited from the stock market's quick rebound, even as many big banks saw their profits hit by lower interest rates and weaker demand for loans.\n Shares of BlackRock have surged nearly 50% in the past 12 months while the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), an ETF that holds most of America's top banks, is up just 1%. BlackRock stock fell more than 2% on Thursday despite the strong results.\n \"The world faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 -- many of which continue today. Through it all, BlackRock remained steadfast in meeting the needs of all our stakeholders,\" said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in the earnings press release.\n Fink added during a conference call with investors and analysts Thursday that \"the hardships experienced by people globally in 2020 and inequality further exasperated by the pandemic have only strengthened BlackRock's sense of savings, to make savings easier and more affordable.\"\n He stressed that the firm would continue to promote sustainable investing trends as a major economic theme and expressed hope that the eventual economic rebound will lead to a more resilient economy going forward.\n \"The pandemic has taken a dramatic toll on all our lives, disrupting the way we work, the way we live. At the same time, it has led to a profound shift in economies and how societies even operate, creating opportunities to redesign our society,\" he added during the conference call.\n Fink said that concerns about rising economic inequality, along with low interest rates and increased inflation expectations, need to be a big picture theme for any investor saving for retirement or other long-term goals.\n He did not address the changing political or regulatory landscape during the call, however. No mention was made of the fact that Joe Biden is about to take over as president and that Democrats are going to control both the House and Senate.\n But Fink sounded bullish about the future, arguing that even as long-term bond yields start to rise, \"the demand for equities will persist\" and that higher yields are going to push \"the banking system to be much stronger.\" He said the increase in bond yields is \"a positive sign for the economy.\"\n He concluded the conference call with a public safety message: \"Everyone please feel safe. Everyone please stay healthy, and everyone please get a vaccination. Thank you.\"",

And it certainly was not a breach of medical trust to tell somebody they take Propecia to grow their hair.

        "body_text": "Republican Charlie Dent is a former US congressman from Pennsylvania who served as chairman of the House Ethics Committee from 2015 until 2016 and chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies from 2015 until 2018. He is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nDonald John Trump will be remembered as the only president in American history to be impeached on two separate occasions.  He incited an insurrection that was in effect a frontal and physical assault on the constitutional order, the peaceful transfer of power, the vice president and the Congress itself. On top of an already shameful record, the events of January 6, 2021, will define Trump's legacy forever and stain the pages of American history.\n Under Trump, the GOP lost the House of Representatives in 2018 and the White House and the Senate in 2020. Even worse, the GOP may have lost its soul. It is now fractured between Trump supporters and those who want a clean break from him. While many House Republicans reportedly supported impeachment, only 10 courageous GOP members actually voted for it. If the Senate were to convict Trump and prohibit him from ever seeking high office again, many House Republicans would be most grateful and relieved. It's called \"hope yes, vote no.\"\n The GOP representatives who voted in favor of impeachment represent geographically diverse areas. They rejected the procedural arguments of many of their Republican colleagues and directly addressed in their arguments the substance of what occurred last week. These members are to be commended for their exemplary leadership. Explaining his vote in support of impeachment, Don Newhouse (R-Washington), with simple eloquence, said it best: \"I will not use process as an excuse. There is no excuse for President Trump's actions.\"\n Michigan GOP freshman Congressman Peter Meijer, a US Army veteran who fought in Iraq  and part of a family that founded a highly successful retail chain, demonstrated real courage and genuine leadership with his affirmative impeachment vote on his eleventh day in the House. He was joined by my friends Fred Upton, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Tom Rice and David Valadao, with whom I spent time as part of the Tuesday Group, a coalition of roughly 40 pragmatic, center-right Republicans I co-chaired for 12 years while serving in the House.\n In fact, eight of the 10 affirmative GOP impeachment votes were Tuesday Group members. These members represent the governing wing of the Republican Party.  Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) also voted for impeachment.\n Cheney, the third-highest ranking House Republican, released a powerful statement in support of her principled position. Consequently, a movement has been initiated by a few angry colleagues who want her removed from her leadership position.\n No doubt an enraged and unhinged Trump will incite his supporters to challenge Cheney and the others who put loyalty to country and Constitution above party in future primaries. But the group does have influential backers. Defending Democracy Together, an organization led by Bill Kristol, has pledged to raise and spend $50 million to defend Republicans who hold President Trump accountable for inciting an attack on the US Capitol.\n \"We want to say to any Republican who votes to impeach or remove Trump: You will not be left alone,\" said Kristol. We will help you against your primary challenges. And before the challenges emerge, we will help explain your vote to your constituents. So do the right thing. We will have your back.'\"\n The actions of these 10 brave congressmen should give greater confidence to seething, bitter GOP senators who justifiably blame Trump for the loss of the Georgia Senate seats, which delivered them to minority status in the upper chamber. The GOP senators are manifestly more hostile to the President than their GOP House counterparts.\n A reckoning within the GOP has arrived. Will this fractured party brought to ruin continue to follow a twice-impeached former President who abused his office and violated Congress in such a hideous way?  Or will it follow Sen. Mitch McConnell who has signaled he wants a clean break from the dark curse of Trump?\n The lines are drawn. Let the battle begin.",

        "body_text": "The American jobs crisis is escalating again. States have ratcheted up their virus-prevention measures to combat rising infection rates, and the job market has taken it on the chin.\n Another 965,000 people filed for first-time unemployment benefits on a seasonally adjusted basis in the United States last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n That was substantially higher than the previous week, when 784,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits, and far worse than economists had expected.\n Weekly first-time jobless claims are stuck at an uncomfortably high level. In late August, the figure dropped below 1 million, but since then, significant improvements have been hard to come by -- and last week represented a huge step in the wrong direction. Without seasonal adjustments, initial claims are back up above a million, which is a terrifyingly high number and more than three times more than in the same period last year.\n On top of regular claims, 284,470 workers filed claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, about 100,000 more than in the prior week. The program provides aid to people like the self-employed or gig workers, who aren't covered under regular benefits. After the new stimulus deal extended the program, it is now slated to end in March.\n Added together, initial benefit claims totaled 1.4 million last week, excluding seasonal adjustments, the highest total since mid-September.\n The passage of the second pandemic stimulus bill at the end of December likely added to the jump in benefit applications, said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in a note to clients.\n Continued claims, which count workers who have claimed aid for at least two weeks in a row, stood at 5.3 million in the week ended January 2, more than economists had predicted.\n With the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden less than a week away, Thursday's report again hammers home that the new administration's first priority has got to be more stimulus.\n The government's jobs report released last week showed 140,000 American jobs were lost in December -- the first loss since April, when the economy was in freefall.\n \"The fact that benefits claims are increasing suggests that the economy may lose jobs again in January, as the number of coronavirus cases continues to surge, weighing heavily on businesses,\" said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, in emailed comments.\n Biden plans to create millions of jobs, including in the infrastructure and clean energy industries. Experts hope that Democratic control across the White House and Congress means a more stimulus quickly. But the turmoil on Capitol Hill, including the second impeachment of President Donald Trump by the House of Representatives, could derail bipartisan cooperation.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nSurviving Covid-19 may give you immunity for at least five months, but it won't stop you transmitting the virus to others.\n A new study led by Public Health England, a government agency, found that people who have been infected by Covid-19 may have immunity to the virus for at least five months. The findings are preliminary and have not yet been peer reviewed, but they offer some reassurance to frontline health care workers.\n The researchers monitored\u00a0almost 21,000\u00a0healthcare workers from across the United Kingdom\u00a0between June and November\u00a0and regularly tested them to see if they had been infected with Covid-19. Of those monitored, 6,614 people were found to have had the virus before and among them, 44 developed possible new infections.\n The study concluded that past infection reduces the chances of catching the virus again by 83% for at least five months, Zamira Rahim writes.\n There are some important caveats to note. The researchers warned that the protection was not absolute and that it was unclear how long any immunity lasts. It is also possible that those who have a degree of immunity against the virus may still be able to transmit it to others. Early insight from the next stage of the study shows that some people with existing immunity carry high levels of virus.\n The science might sound complicated, but the implications for real life are not. You might be immune to the virus once you've recovered from Covid-19, but you should still wear a mask and practice social distancing in order to protect those around you.\n The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use a new technology. The vaccines deliver messenger RNA, or mRNA, which is a genetic recipe for making the spikes that sit atop the coronavirus.\n AstraZeneca's vaccine, developed with a team at Britain's Oxford University, is called a vector vaccine. It uses a common cold virus called an adenovirus to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cells. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V use a similar approach.\n Read more about how some of the other vaccines work here.\n Send your questions here.

They are set to investigate the origins of the pandemic, but two members of that team remain in Singapore after they \"tested positive for IgM antibodies,\" the World Health Organization said. This is the second delay for the WHO team. IgM antibodies are among the earliest potential signs of a coronavirus infection, but could also appear in someone who has been vaccinated or previously infected.\n The news came just as China reported its first Covid-19 related death in 242 days and its daily new infections reached the highest levels since July.\n Early stage trials of Johnson & Johnson's experimental coronavirus vaccine show it generated an immune response in nearly all volunteers, with minimal side-effects, after a single dose. The company expects to report details of more advanced trials later this month and is hoping to apply for authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after.\n The vaccine would be the first single dose vaccine to be approved in the US. It uses a weakened version of a common cold virus to carry genetic material from the virus into the body, prompting human cells to produce pieces of the virus that are then recognized by the immune system.\n A report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Covid-19 cases among younger children remained low even after schools restarted for in-person learning. To safely reopen schools, however, transmission in communities must be kept in check.\n CNN correspondent Sara Sidner was unable to hold her tears while reporting live on the coronavirus crisis in Los Angeles. Looking back at the moment, she writes: \"I felt raw and exposed and embarrassed all at once. I have long been taught as a woman 'never let them see you cry' -- not in public and especially not at work.\n \"What moved me to tears was, at first, simply rage. Rage at those who won't take our ills seriously and those who are actively fighting against the truth. They are putting people's lives in danger.\"\n The African Union has secured 270 million vaccine doses for African countries, with at least 50 million shots available from April to June.Biden aides told congressional allies to expect Covid relief package with a roughly $2 trillion price tag.Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden administration, a source with knowledge of the events tells CNN.Turkey has authorized emergency use of China's Sinovac vaccine, with mass rollout to begin today.California hospital fined more than $40,000 after Santa Clara County says it delayed reporting Covid-19 outbreak. Yes, Martha Stewart received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine near a facility named for her, but rest assured, she says she didn't jump the line.England's soccer Premier League tells teams that handshakes, high fives and hugs must be avoided and that swapping of shirts after the game is now prohibited.A nurse who works with Covid patients just won a $1 million lottery jackpot.\n New Year's resolutions often wither and die, unless you can turn them into habits. So we asked behavioral science expert BJ Fogg how to make your good intentions stick.\n One of his tips: If someone wants to exercise or feels they should, the key is to find an exercise that makes them feel successful or they find enjoyable -- one or the other.\n What teenagers really like is for us to be around and asked to be available, but not to have an agenda, but when they're ready to talk to know where to find us. -- Lisa Damour, clinical psychologist",

        "body_text": "The FBI has arrested Kevin Seefried, seen carrying a Confederate flag inside Capitol Hill, according to a federal criminal complaint.\n Seefried had been a focus of the FBI's efforts to get the public to help them identify riot participants. The complaint identifies him as the man seen in the photos, widely circulated online, carrying a large Confederate flag inside the US Capitol during the January 6 siege.\n Kevin Seefried told the FBI he had brought the Confederate flag with him to Washington from his home in Delaware, where he normally displays it outside.\n Seefried was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n Seefried's son, Hunter, was also arrested and charged with the same offenses, according to the complaint.\n The FBI learned of the men's names after a coworker of Hunter Seefried reported he had bragged about being inside the Capitol building with his father on January 6.\n It was not immediately clear if the two men had an attorney.\n The New York Times was the first to identify Kevin Seefried as the individual carrying the flag.\n Some people who stormed the Capitol have already come forward or have been identified by CNN and other news organizations. Many face criminal charges, and some have lost or left their jobs because of their participation.\n Anyone with information about people who participated in the Capitol siege can contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

        "body_text": "Christopher & Banks is joining the long list of retailers filing for bankruptcy and disappearing from America's malls.\n The womenswear company filed for Chapter 11 on Thursday, a result of \"financial distress resulting from the pandemic and its ongoing impact,\" it said. Christopher & Banks, which has approximately 400 locations in 44 states, said it will close a \"significant portion\" of stores and is in an \"active discussion\" to sell its website.\n The bankruptcy was foreshadowed last year when the company announced it hired an investment banker to refinance its debt and \"explore other strategic alternatives.\" In May, the company took a loan between $5 million to $10 million from the Paycheck Protection Program according to CNN Business' database.\n Christopher & Banks admitted in its most recent earnings release that Covid-19 has particularly disrupted shopping habits for women who shop at stores that offer more formal attire. They have become more pragmatic shoppers, the company said, opting for leisure wear instead of outfits for social engagements.\n It's certainly not alone. Other retailers have cited similar reasons in their bankruptcy filings last year. Ascena Retail Group, the owner of Ann Taylor, Loft and Lane Bryant, said its business had been \"severely disrupted\" by the pandemic and closed hundreds of stores. RTW Retailwinds, owner of New York & Co., also closed most of its stores.\n With the shift toward working from home, buying work clothes has fallen out of fashion, jeopardizing the futures of companies that depend on office attire. New data from Coresight Research reveals that more than 8,700 stores closed in 2020 and another 1,400 shuttered just this year.",

        "body_text": "California adults 65 and older are now eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine, state officials announced Wednesday in a bid to boost the number of people who receive a shot, even as demand \"continues to far exceed supply.\"\n \"We are significantly increasing our efforts to get these vaccines administered, get them out of freezers and get them into people's arms,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a video message posted to his Twitter account.\n But in Los Angeles County, seniors won't be allowed to receive shots until the county's health care workers are vaccinated -- a process that's expected to stretch into February -- said Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer, citing supply shortages.\n \"Neither the state nor us is wanting to divert the strategy to get health care workers vaccinated,\" Ferrer said Wednesday during a virtual briefing. \"That is the priority.\"\n In Santa Clara County, short supply meant the county's health system was open Wednesday for vaccinations only for people 75 and older, in addition to health care workers and long-term care facility residents, officials there said.\n Los Angeles County has in recent weeks been the epicenter of the state's battle against Covid-19. About 1 in 3 residents have been infected since the pandemic's start, according to new county data.\n Infections are so widespread, officials this week warned essential workers to wear masks inside their own homes. Hospitals have reached the breaking point. And last week, county officials said a person was dying of Covid-19 every eight minutes.\n County health officials reported more than 194,000 first doses of the vaccine had been administered to people in Phase 1A -- health care workers and long-term care facility residents -- and they were preparing to ramp up vaccine capacity for 500,000 frontline health care workers.\n To speed up the vaccination process, a new registration system is now open, and five mass vaccination sites will soon be operating across the county, Ferrer said. Those sites \"are only open to healthcare workers in Phase 1A,\" health officials said in a news release.\n \"As the County completes Phase 1A, we can look to starting vaccinations for groups within next phase -- 1B, starting with those who are 65 and older as noted by the Governor today,\" the release said. \"We are working with the State to identify additional vaccine doses so that we can start to schedule appointments once the doses arrive.\"\n In Santa Clara County, the health system was open Wednesday for vaccinations for people 75 and older, in addition to people in Phase 1A, officials there said.\n \"We are constrained by the vaccine supply that we have available here locally,\" County Counsel James Williams said during a news conference. \"As we continue to get more vaccine, we'll continue to move as quickly as we can through eligible tiers.\"\n \"But this is where we are at right now,\" Williams added.\n County officials hope to be able to vaccinate residents 65 and older \"as soon as we get more vaccine supply here locally,\"  Williams added.\n The county requested 100,000 more vaccine doses, but the state only authorized an additional 6,000, he said.\n CNN's Sarah Moon contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Jacob Blake says he 'didn't want to be the next George Floyd' in first interview since he was shot by police",
        "body_text": "In his first interview on national television, Jacob Blake said he \"wasn't thinking clearly\" when he picked up a knife that he had dropped during an encounter with police, moments before a Kenosha, Wisconsin, officer shot him seven times last summer.\n Blake talked about the Aug. 23 shooting that left him paralyzed from the waist down in a portion of an interview that aired Thursday on \"Good Morning America.\"\n \"My babies are right here, my babies. So after he stopped shooting me, I said, 'Daddy love you, no matter what,'\" he said. \"I thought it was going to be the last thing I say to them. Thank God it wasn't.\"\n The shooting, caught on video, fueled protests this past summer over racial injustice and police brutality initially sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n \"I didn't want to be the next George Floyd,\" Blake told ABC's Michael Strahan. \"I didn't want to die.\"\n That Sheskey and two other officers were on a domestic disturbance call was \"urgently important,\" Graveley wrote in his investigative report on the shooting. Police also had a warrant for Blake's arrest from a prior domestic incident, Graveley said.\n Blake's attorneys maintain their client did not pose a threat to police and the decision to not charge the officer fueled the community's longstanding distrust of the justice system.\n Blake said he was attempting to leave his son's birthday party with his kids after an argument broke out between Laquisha Booker, the mother of three of his children, and a neighbor.\n \"I wanted to leave. My son is inside, tears coming out of his eyes and he said, 'Daddy, you sure? It's my birthday.'\" Blake told ABC. \"I'm taking them to the store again, make them forget about all this.\"\n As he got ready to leave, Booker called police, telling a dispatcher he had taken the keys to an SUV she rented and she was afraid he would crash it.\n According to the investigative report, Booker said Blake was \"not supposed to be here,\" but she'd allowed him a couple hours to spend with his son on his birthday.\n When police arrived, Blake said they did not explain why they were there and did not say they had a warrant for his arrest -- a statement disputed by the officers' statement to investigators.\n \"At that time I'm walking out,\" he said. \"I hadn't done anything, so I didn't feel like they were there for me.\"\n Blake had just put one of his sons in the SUV when he felt one of the officers grab his arm.\n A physical altercation broke out between Blake and the officers, who have said they believed he was reaching for a weapon. Blake told investigators he had a knife that dropped to the ground when Sheskey first grabbed him, but denied he was going to use it as a weapon against the officers. Sheskey discharged his Taser, but Blake broke the wires with his hand.\n \"I shouldn't have picked it up,\" he said, adding, \"I wasn't thinking clearly.\" Blake said he intended to put the knife in the SUV and then lay on the ground to submit to the police officers.\n \"If they did it there and they killed me there, everybody would see it.\"\n Blake told ABC he \"couldn't hear\" the officers telling him to stop. \"All I heard was screaming, screaming. My ears was ringing, so it was all muffled.\"\n In video captured from a second-floor apartment across the street, Blake is seen walking around the front of the SUV with a knife in his hand. The officers have their guns drawn, and a male voice is heard yelling, \"Drop the knife!\"\n Moments later, after the officer grabbed Blake's shirt, seven shots are heard. Blake had four entrance wounds to the back, and three to his left side.\n \"Officer Sheskey was presented with a difficult and dangerous situation and he acted appropriately and in accordance with his training,\" Kenosha Professional Police Association attorney Brendan Matthews said in a statement last week.\n \"The video remains difficult to view but that does not change what actually occurred. False and misleading narratives to the contrary need to stop. Kenosha can and will move forward from this. That process begins now.\"\n Blake family attorneys in a statement last week expressed disappointment in the decision not to charge Sheskey, saying the decision \"failed not only Jacob and his family, but the community that protested and demanded justice.\"\n Speaking to \"Good Morning America,\" attorney Ben Crump said Blake's past actions did not justify the shooting.\n \"If you're a Black person in America, and you're not perfect, then they say, 'Oh it was justified,'\" he said. \"It's like our children have to be angels.\"\n According to ABC, Blake is going to physical rehab four days a week and is preparing for his 37th surgery since the shooting.\n As for his children who witnessed the shooting, Blake said he's explained, \"Daddy can die, but for some reason I didn't that day.\"\n CNN's Melissa Alonso and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.",

I have continued to be tested regularly, wear my mask and follow the recommended guidelines.\"\n Espaillat said in his tweets he received the second dose of his Covid-19 vaccine last week.

They have been shown to prevent symptoms and severe disease.\n Espaillat participated in the floor debate while wearing a face mask for the Article of Impeachment on Wednesday. His office did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\n His announcement comes after House Democrats set up a system to fine members who don't wear masks on the House floor after three Democrats said they tested positive for Covid-19 after sheltering in place with other members of Congress who did not wear masks during the violent attack on the US Capitol last week.\n According to a notice from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House plans to move with a rule change imposing fines on members who don't wear face masks. According to a statement from Pelosi, the fine for the first offense will be $5,000 and $10,000 for the second offense and will be deducted directly from their salaries by the Chief Administrative Officer.",

        "title": "3 ways to turn that failing New Year's resolution into a habit",
        "body_text": "I have a bad relationship with New Year's resolutions. I start strong and then peter out by mid-January as work deadlines, home chores and the latest Netflix binge takes precedence over my good intentions. I even thought this year would be different due to being homebound. (Laughable!)\n Long have I wanted to train myself to drink more water. But I'm a bit like W.C. Fields: I hate the stuff. It's got to be ice cold -- which is why suggestions to have a glass of water by my bedside to drink before my toes have touched the ground in the morning haven't worked.\n No longer. Today, I started my first \"tiny habit,\" a term coined by behavioral science expert B.J. Fogg, who founded and directs research and innovation at Stanford University's Behavior Design Lab.\n Applause, please: I downed a 20-ounce glass of water before I even had my first cup of coffee. Easy peasy, and I'm convinced I'm going to do it again tomorrow and for most 'morrows to come.\n As Fogg explains in his best-selling book \"Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change Everything,\" the key to building a better habit is tying each action to something you already do -- while also matching location, frequency and theme.\n I make coffee every morning. The ice maker/water dispenser is two steps to the left of the coffee maker. So while my coffee was brewing, I filled up a huge glass with ice and water. Before I could even pour my first cuppa and finish feeding the cats, the water was gone and I had started on my second glass.\n I repeated my actions when I went back for a second (and yes, even a third) cup of joe.\n I nearly broke my hand patting myself on the back! It was instant emotional gratification -- another key to building a successful habit, according to Fogg.\n Fogg's tips are based, he said, on mountains of research on human behavior modification and the many people he has coached over some 40 years.\n Want to learn more? Here's a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.\n What doesn't work is trying to get somebody to do something they don't want to do. You can nag them into compliance, maybe -- but that's not a habit.\n What also doesn't work is picking a habit that's painful, or causes you to feel awkward or causes you to feel negative. You want to do the opposite -- you want the habit to help you feel successful or give you joy or pleasure or satisfaction in some way.\n The third approach is to redesign your environment so the only way you can get to work is walking or biking, so you must do it. That's an environmental change -- sell your car. Then the only way you can do something is by walking or biking so you'll get exercise. That's not really practical for most people.\n In reality, the only habits that wire in readily are behaviors you already want to do, and you feel successful doing them.\n Number one: It needs to be effective. Take meditation as stress reduction. For a lot of people meditation is not effective for reducing stress because all they do is become aware of how scattered their mind is, so that's a bad idea for those people.\n For me, what's effective is going out into nature. Even a short little walk to the ocean or a short walk into the garden is very effective.\n Number two: It needs to be behavior people want to do. If you don't want to do that behavior, maybe you can manipulate yourself into it a few times but it won't become a habit.\n Number three: It needs to be a behavior you can do. So I talked about walking out and looking at the ocean or looking at tadpoles. Well, I live in a place I can do that.\n If someone can't do that, they've got to pick something else, like hanging out with their dog.\n After I start the coffee maker, after I feed the dog, then I will drink a glass of water. if you can design it into your routine, if you know what this habit comes after, then your chances of succeeding go way up.\n I call that an anchor. You want the anchor and the new habit to happen in the same location. If the new habit can be associated with the kitchen, then find a kitchen anchor for it. What doesn't work is like, \"Oh, I start the coffee maker then I have to go out to the garage to do the new habit.\" That does not work. Location matters.\n Next is frequency. If you want the habit to happen once a day, then you want an anchor routine that happens once a day. Like, in my life I want to do push-ups throughout the day. So I attached that behavior to when I have to pee. So after I go to the bathroom, I do two push-ups because then I get to do push-ups throughout the day.\n The next thing that matters is the theme. Now this matters the least -- the first two matter more -- but if I see feeding the dog as a nurturing ritual, a good habit to follow would be a way that I nurture myself.\n You're looking for same location, same frequency, and if you can, the same theme. And if you get those lined up, then the habit can just click into place.\n The whole thing about repetition is misguided. It's the emotion that wires the habit in -- if you repeat it and you hate it, it does not wire in as a habit. It will never become a habit.\n Or people say only work on one habit at a time. No, that's not true at all. You have to have an accountability partner is another recommendation. You don't have to.\n There are all these myths out there around habits and change. My work is saying, \"No, people. Here's how to do it quickly and easily, and all those other old things are either wrong or optional.\"\n A prompt is something that reminds you, and you use an existing routine to prompt you. Feeding the dog is going to be my prompt. It's not going to be a Post-It note; it's not going to be an alarm; it's not going to be just trying to remember.\n You're hacking the prompt by using an existing routine to remind yourself.\n Along the top are various categories you might want to choose from, such as nutrition, fitness, brain health, productivity. Those aren't random, those are informed by my research at Stanford that finds these are the things that people want most. There is a lot of data and research behind it, but we keep the tool itself really simple.\n Under each category, you can swipe through the top cards to look at the new habits you might choose. I'm only including habits that I think are effective. And once you settle on one that you like, you go to the cards below and say, \"When am I going to do this? When is it going to fit into my routine?'\n The tool can be used without signing up for emails, but if you want to hear more from me about that habit, you can enter your email.\n The ultimate goal is anybody in the world can benefit from this without installing anything, without giving up your email. It's a tool to help me with my life's mission to help people to be happier and healthier.",

        "body_text": "Prosecutors are asking the Kenosha County Circuit Court to modify the bond conditions of Kyle Rittenhouse, who is facing homicide charges in the death of two men during protests last August, according to a motion filed by the Kenosha County District Attorney's Office on Wednesday.\n The office is requesting that Rittenhouse be prohibited from possessing or consuming alcohol or being in any establishment that serves it; be prohibited from making any public display of any \"white power\" or \"white supremacy\" signs, symbols, or hand gestures; and not have any contact with any known militia members or members of any violent white power/white supremacist groups including the group identified as the \"Proud Boys.\"\n Mark Richards, the attorney representing Rittenhouse, said his client does not object to the modified bond conditions proposed, according to court documents filed Thursday.\n \"As Mr. Rittenhouse has no membership, affiliation, or affinity for any of the identified groups, the defense has no objection to a bond modification prohibiting Kyle Rittenhouse from having any knowing contact with any known hate groups or their members,\" he wrote.\n He also did not object to a bond condition prohibiting the possession or consumption of alcohol.\n The Kenosha County Circuit Court has not issued a decision on the filings.\n The 18-year-old is out on a $2 million bail after being arrested in connection with a fatal shooting in Kenosha. Rittenhouse is alleged to have been in the midst of protests that had broken out in the Wisconsin city over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, and authorities allege he fired at protesters.\n Rittenhouse was arraigned January 5 on two felony charges of homicide in the deaths of two men and a felony attempted homicide charge in the wounding of another man.\n According to prosecutors, Rittenhouse was seen at a local bar with his mother about 90 minutes after the arraignment, and his presence and behavior were confirmed by surveillance video.\n Rittenhouse was seen with other individuals flashing \"the 'OK' sign, which has been co-opted as a sign of 'white power' by known white supremacist groups,\" and was \"directly served a beer by the bartender,\" the motion said.\n The document also states that Rittenhouse turned 18 this month and lives in Illinois. \"Under Illinois law, it is a Class A Misdemeanor for anyone under the age of 21 to possess or consume alcohol in a public place,\" the motion states.\n In Wisconsin, however, it is legal for someone under the age of 21 to possess and consume alcohol if a parent is present.\n Prosecutors are also asking the court to \"prohibit the defendant from publicly displaying symbols and gestures that are associated with violent white supremacist groups and from associating with known members of those groups, particularly the Proud Boys\" -- as they believe it could result in potential witness intimidation.\n Richards said in his filing that Rittenhouse has never been a member of any of the organizations listed in the motion from prosecutors.\n \"The State's bond motion is a not-so-thinly veiled attempt to interject the issue of race into a case that is about a person's right to self-defense,\" he wrote.\n Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to the charges for which he was arraigned.\n Rittenhouse's attorneys have maintained that Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense when he opened fire.\n In a hearing last month, Richards accused prosecutors of presenting \"a one-sided, stilted view\" of events that night.\n Richards introduced screenshots of surveillance video that he said showed his client acted in self-defense while being chased by a gun-toting protester. In another image, Rittenhouse appeared to be struck with a skateboard while on the ground.\n Anthony M. Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum were killed in the incident, and Gaige Grosskreutz was wounded.\n Correction: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong age for Kyle Rittenhouse. He is now 18.",

        "title": "Capitol rioters made a mockery of Christian values",
        "body_text": "Gregory E. Sterling is Dean of Yale Divinity School. The views expressed here are the author's. Read more opinion on CNN.\nAs someone who has devoted his entire life to understanding, exploring and teaching the truth about Christianity, I saw the use of Christian symbols and rhetoric as part of the violent assault on the US Capitol as a desecration of democracy's chapel and a blaspheme of my faith.\n Watching the events unfold, I was deeply ashamed as an American and horrified as a Christian that these perpetrators were associating Christianity with their misguided efforts. I wonder how these self-declared patriots and Christians -- rioters, in reality -- could square their racism-fueled attempt of a forceful takeover of our government, a cause emboldened by evil lies (and longstanding support of the Christian right's leadership), with the Bibles many of them carried.\n Christians believe that we demonstrate our faith by our actions and how we treat others. In words from a final message of Jesus in the Gospel of John, \"By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\"\n What the world witnessed at the Capitol was instead a warped and dishonest portrayal of Christianity, a mob hijacking an entire faith in the same way the 9/11 terrorists hijacked Islam. While the latter was an attempt to bring America to its knees economically, this was an attempt to bring the nation to its knees politically. While one was committed by an avowed enemy of the United States, the insurrection in our capital city was committed by individuals who demonstrated no regard for the will of the majority of the American people, much less for Christian living.\n Carrying signs like \"Jesus 2020\" or \"Jesus or Hellfire,\" Bibles, and a massive cross and marauding around our nation's capital in a \"Jericho march\" -- in imitation of the biblical story of the fall of Jericho -- the rioters imitated quite well the President, who held up a Bible during his egregious summer photo-op in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC, amid protests over racial injustices.\n The mob that stormed the Capitol and the President who sees my faith as a cynical and convenient political tool both show an utter disregard for the highest values contained in Scripture. Where was the value of non-violence celebrated in the Sermon on the Mount? Where was the value of \"putting away falsehood\" and speaking the truth? Where was the spirit of doing justice, loving mercy and walking humbly with God? They made a mockery of Christianity.\n The attack was an assault on American identity, too. My father and uncle served during the Korean War. The names of some of my boyhood friends are engraved on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a short walk down the National Mall from the Capitol.  My son-in-law served in Iraq. Those gleefully parading around Washington were spitting on the graves of the fallen and dishonoring those who wore a US armed forces uniform. Wielding the weapon of faith, they attacked the country they profess to love.\n The thousands who gathered and chanted and stormed and, yes, killed heeded the words of their political deity -- President Donald Trump, a man without a moral compass. \"You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\" These were the President's words at the \"Save America March\" just hours before his eager audience would take him up on his request. I have never understood how Christians could support him in the name of Christianity. How do you align lying, bragging about immorality, the egging on of violence and cruelty, and the violation of a sacred oath (to \"protect and defend the Constitution\") with Christianity? It is as far from the principles of Christianity -- or any faith that I know -- as a person can get.\n Those Christians who continue to be Trump supporters are models of cognitive dissonance. They are a puzzle for the ages. The dissonance exists between their claim to be loyal Americans and Christians, on the one hand, and their trampling upon the principles of democracy and Christianity, equality before God and non-violence on the other. Efforts to resolve these irreconcilable tensions have resulted in wild conspiracy theories that strike sober-minded people as bouts of delusion. I can only hope that as they ponder their next move -- with rumblings of  more violence in Washington around the inauguration -- there will be some soul-searching among the throngs. God help us if there is not.\n To show how far our country as fallen, I only need to look back at my own childhood. I grew up in a conservative American home. My parents were committed Republicans who held traditional values. My father was a minister for 46 years. Twice in my boyhood during the tumultuous year of 1968, my mother woke me with the news that an American leader had been slain. The first was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and the second was Sen. Robert Kennedy during his run for the White House.\n Both times our household was devastated. When I told a friend the story of how my mother was visibly shaken as she told me about Kennedy, he wondered why she was so upset if she would not have voted for him? My answer was an easy one: She was a better American than she was a Republican. And she was a better Christian.\n It is time for us to be Americans, whatever our party affiliation or views on specific issues. It is also time for those of us who are Christians to speak out against the misuse of Christianity as a legitimating force for evil. Democracy is a treasured value and quite fragile. We need to protect it, and given last week's events, we need to pray for it.",

        "title": "Justice Department was unprepared for family separations but Jeff Sessions pushed it anyway, watchdog says",
        "body_text": "Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions knew early on migrant families would be separated when the Trump administration implemented its controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy and still proceeded to push for the policy, according to a scathing report from the Justice Department inspector general released Thursday.\n At one point, Sessions emphasized to US attorneys that \"we need to take away children,\" according to notes from the call cited in Thursday's report.\n \"[T]he Department's single-minded focus on increasing prosecutions came at the expense of careful and appropriate consideration of the impact that prosecution of family unit adults and family separations would have on children traveling with them and the government's ability to later reunite the children with their parents,\" the inspector general wrote.\n Lawyers are still unable to reach the parents of 611 children who had been split from their families by US border officials between 2017 and 2018, according to a Wednesday court filing.\n In 2018, the Trump administration announced the so-called \"zero tolerance\" policy, in which the Justice Department criminally prosecuted every adult accused of illegally crossing the border. Doing so resulted in the separation of families, including those with infants, some only a few months old, because children can't be kept in federal jail with their parents.\n This week, Trump visited his signature border wall on the US-Mexico border, bookending his administration's focus on immigration. During a brief speech near the wall, Trump listed off a series of those policies, citing them as accomplishments and calling them \"historic.\" He did not mention family separation.\n But the \"zero tolerance\" policy has come to encapsulate the lengths the Trump administration is willing to go to in order to deter migrants from coming to the US, regardless of their circumstances, and the disarray that ensues when agencies are unprepared.\n \"The barbaric family separation practice was immoral and illegal. At a minimum, Justice Department lawyers should have known the latter. This new report shows just how far the Trump administration was willing to go to destroy these families,\" said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the family separation lawsuit, in a statement Thursday.\n One draft talking point prepared for Sessions ahead of a May 2018 White House meeting read: \"An illegal alien should not get a free pass just because he or she crosses the border illegally with a child.\" The talking points also cited an initiative that led to the separation of approximately 280 families, saying that it \"worked,\" even though it had generated concerns from prosecutors, judges and officials.\n More than 5,000 families had already been separated at the US-Mexico border between 2017, when a pilot initiative kicked off, and 2018, when the policy was announced, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n Sessions declined to be interviewed by the inspector general.\n Thursday's report provides a thorough accounting of US attorneys caught unaware -- and unprepared -- for the policy change, and underscores the push by top Trump officials, citing migrant caravans, to press forward despite known concerns over the prosecution of families.\n In August 2017, during the pilot initiative in El Paso, Texas, the deputy criminal chief emailed acting US Attorney Richard Durbin, expressing concerns raised by defendants and a judge, including situations where breastfeeding moms were taken away from their infants.\n \"We have now heard of us taking breast feeding defendant moms away from their infants, I did not believe this until I looked at the duty log and saw the fact we had accepted prosecution on moms with one and two year olds,\" the deputy criminal chief wrote.\n \"The next issue is that these parents are asking for the whereabouts of their children and they can't get a response, the courts are turning to us for help with providing contact information to defense counsel,\" he added.\n In 2018, the Trump administration moved forward with the so-called \"zero tolerance\" policy, but US attorneys charged with prosecuting individuals referred by the Department of Homeland Security for illegally crossing the southern border had not received guidance about the policy change from DOJ headquarters until after it was made.\n The primary concern held by the attorneys, according to an email obtained by the inspector general: What was happening with the children?\n On May 11, 2018, days after the policy had taken effect, Sessions held a conference call with the attorneys. During that call, Sessions told US attorneys \"we need to take away children,\" according to notes from the call cited in Thursday's report.\n Sessions also led attorneys to believe that prosecutions would be swift and followed by reunification. That was not the case. The Justice Department inspector general found that department leaders were notified, during implementation of the policy, that the average time a defendant remained in DOJ custody was three to seven days.\n Rod Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general, told the IG he also reached out to US attorneys and \"that the focus of these calls was to ensure that the U.S. Attorneys were fully engaged on immigration prosecutions\" and that they understood how significant the policy was to Sessions.\n According to a summary of a call Rosenstein held with US attorneys, Rosenstein, \"instructed that, per the [Attorney General's] policy, we should NOT be categorically declining immigration prosecutions of adults in family units because of the age of a child.\"\n Rosenstein rejected that characterization. \"Since leaving the Department, I have often asked myself what we should have done differently, and no issue has dominated my thinking more than the zero tolerance immigration policy. It was a failed policy that never should have been proposed or implemented,\" he said in a statement to CNN.\n Beyond a lack of planning between agencies involved in the apprehension and care of migrants, DOJ also didn't plan for the operational, resource, and management impacts associated with an increase in immigration prosecutions, according to Thursday's report.\n The US Marshals Service, for example, didn't have the opportunity to address housing needs for an increased number of defendants until after Session's April 2018 announcement.\n The inspector general report cites an email to staff in mid-May from a USMS supervisor in the Southern District of California that reads: \"Our manpower has been completely depleted...we are in 'crisis mode,' 'critical mass' 'DEFCON 1' or however you want to phrase it.\"\n Since the Trump administration backtracked its \"zero tolerance\" policy, migrants have faced insurmountable challenges to claim asylum, have been required to stay in Mexico in deplorable conditions for their immigration hearing in the United States and have been swiftly returned after being encountered at the southern border as a result of a public health order linked to the coronavirus pandemic -- to name a few.\n President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to undo Trump's policies and form a task force that will focus on reuniting separated families. Immigrant advocacy groups, who for years scrambled to identify and reunite families separated at the US-Mexico border, have met with the Joe Biden transition team on family separation and next steps.\n Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, has also met with immigration leaders. Speaking virtually at an American Business Immigration Coalition summit last month, Mayorkas nodded to the restrictionist policies of the Trump administration, saying that \"we must stop vilifying these communities,\" and he cited the family separation policy.\n \"There is no more powerful and heartbreaking example of that inhumanity than the separation of children from their parents,\" he said.",

        "body_text": "South Korea's highest court has upheld former President Park Geun-hye's 20-year prison sentence for her 2018 bribery conviction, ending a corruption scandal that has gripped the country for years.\n Park was initially sentenced to 24 years in prison after she was found guilty on multiple counts of abuse of power, bribery and coercion. Those charges related to a massive influence-peddling case that prompted widespread protests, implicated some of the country's most powerful figures and saw her removed from office in 2017.\n Park's 2018 sentence was reduced to 20 years last July following a retrial. Prosecutors appealed that sentence and requested a heavier penalty, but on Thursday, South Korea's Supreme Court upheld Park's 20-year jail term, according to a news release from the court.\n The Supreme Court is South Korea's highest court, meaning that Thursday's decision is expected to be the end of Park's legal avenues to appeal her sentence.\n Park will have to serve 22 years behind bars -- she faces an additional two-year prison term for a 2018 conviction for meddling in the nomination of candidates for Saenuri Party, a conservative political party previously led by her.\n \"This is the conclusion of a state corruption affair which follows the people's candlelight revolution, impeachment by the Assembly, and a judicial ruling. It is a manifestation of our democratic republic's constitutional spirit and signifies advancement and maturity of Korean democracy,\" South Korea's presidential Blue House said in a statement Thursday. \"We must make sure to take this unfortunate event -- the imprisonment of the former President -- as a historical lesson and avoid repeating it.\"\n The daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, Park Geun-hye became South Korea's first female President when she came to power in 2013.\n But her term was marred by controversy and in 2017, she became the country's first democratically elected leader to be forcibly removed from office after the country's Constitutional Court upheld a parliamentary vote to impeach her.\n That vote came after millions of South Koreans took to the streets over a period of several months to demand Park's ouster, after revelations emerged about the undue influence wielded by her adviser and confidant, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a cult leader.\n Shortly after Park was stripped of her office, she was arrested and put on trial for soliciting bribes from major conglomerates in the country, including Samsung. In 2018, she went on trial over separate accusations that she received illicit funds from the National Intelligence Service.\n Several others were also implicated in the scandal. In 2018, Park's confidant Choi was sentenced to 20 years in jail on 18 charges including abuse of power, coercion, fraud and bribe, and was fined $16.6 million.\n In 2017, Samsung chief Lee Jae-yong was found guilty of bribery and other corruption charges and sentenced to five years in prison. In 2018 a higher court reduced his sentence and suspended it for four years although he has since undergone a retrial of that charge and a verdict is expected next week. In a related case, he was last year indicted over a controversial 2015 merger that helped him tighten control over the company.\n CNN's Paula Hancocks, Yoonjung Seo and James Griffiths contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Gad Levanon is head of The Conference Board's Labor Market Institute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n The US economy and labor market, still far from fully recovered, are now bracing for a terrible, virus-spreading winter. It is hard to feel optimistic, but help is on the way. A strong recovery in the second half of 2021 may lead the unemployment rate to return to its natural rate of about 4.2 to 4.5% in 2022.\n As a result of the far-reaching and rapid spread of Covid-19, state and local governments' pandemic-mitigation policies are becoming more restrictive and consumers are again limiting their consumption of in-person services. The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Stringency Index, which accounts for measures like school and workplace closures and travel bans, increased for the United States during the first half of November and has remained at elevated levels since then. The added restrictions limited the ability of households to go out and spend.\n Consumption, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, was already down 0.4% in November, after six straight months of increases: Spending on restaurants and bars was down 4%, for example. The winter decline could be even worse.\n The economic weakness is filtering into the labor market. The number of initial claims for unemployment has been trending upward. And in December, for the first time since April, the number of jobs in the US economy declined. Shrinking employment may continue over the rest of the winter, especially for the industries that suffered the most from the pandemic thus far, like restaurants, travel, accommodation, out-of-home entertainment and personal services.\n But while the outlook for the winter is bleak, the US labor market should get much stronger in the second half of 2021, mostly because of the impact of the vaccination campaign. According to some estimates, by August or September, the United States could reach herd immunity, preceded by very low rates of new infections in late spring. Herd immunity means that a large enough percentage of a population, 70% to 90%, has become immune to Covid-19, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for people who lack immunity. This would allow local governments' social distancing policies to become less stringent and the economy to recover as consumers feel more comfortable engaging in in-person services.\n And many US consumers will be ready and able to spend. Since March, households' average saving rates have been historically high, and their housing and stocks portfolios have been rapidly growing. Overall, many will likely emerge from the pandemic with stronger personal finances than they had before. It should be noted that within this aggregate positive financial outlook, many households have been financially ruined by business closures and layoffs caused by the pandemic.\n As a result, in the second half of 2021, a strong US economic recovery is likely to take place. Economic activity is likely to be about 5% above the first half of the year, according to The Conference Board. The recovery will be especially strong in the hardest-hit industries, where employment levels are still very depressed compared with pre-pandemic levels.\n We cannot expect a full employment recovery in early 2022, because automation and corporate reorganizations permanently eliminated many jobs. But barring a major slowdown in the vaccination campaign, I project that 3.5 to 5 million new jobs should be created in the United States by the first quarter of 2022.\n When the unemployment rate almost reached 15% in April 2020, few expected it to return to its natural rate of about 4.2% to 4.5% in the foreseeable future. But the unemployment rate should dip below 5% in the first quarter of 2022 and perhaps even reach 4.5% by year's end.\n This is partly due to the strong employment growth, but also due to very weak growth in the labor force, driven by the massive number of Baby Boomers reaching retirement age. For the first time in US history, the population of working-age people (those between the ages of 16 and 64) is declining. This trend is likely to continue in the coming years. The unemployment rate will also be held down by the disappointing trend of declining labor force participation of other populations, especially men without a college degree.\n Growing demand for and a stagnant supply of workers will lead to a tight labor market within two to three years, and in some blue-collar occupations, maybe even sooner.\n So as dark as these days are, hold on -- a much better labor market is around the corner.",

        "title": "'Less lethal' police weapons tied to serious injuries during George Floyd protests, researchers say",
        "body_text": "Many people suffered \"projectile injuries,\" \"eye trauma\" and other serious wounds from weapons police used on crowds during protests over the summer sparked by the death of George Floyd, researchers say.\n According to a letter to the editor published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, a wide array of serious injuries can be connected to law enforcements' use of what are called \"less-lethal weapons,\" such as tear gas or rubber bullets.\n \"Although less-lethal weapons are designed as an alternative to lethal weapons, we found a substantial number of patients with serious injuries, including many injuries to the head, neck, and face,\" researchers at the University of Minnesota Medical School wrote.\n Demonstrations broke out all over the nation following the death of George Floyd in police custody and in the wake of many other accusations of police brutality. Though the demonstrations were largely peaceful, police and protesters clashed at times, raising criticism over officers' use of tear gas and rubber bullets.\n The researchers scanned thousands of records for patients who were seen at clinics and emergency departments in two medical systems in Minnesota from May 26 to June 15. The researchers took a close look at those whose records included the words \"riot,\" \"tear gas,\" or other terms related to the protests.\n The researchers found 89 records that met that criteria -- and among them, 51% were for injuries from projectiles, such as rubber bullets or beanbags; 36% injuries from chemical irritants, such as tear gas; and 13% injuries from both types of weapons.\n The researchers noted that seven patients underwent surgery for their injuries and 16 patients had traumatic brain injuries. Among the patients, 87% had mild injuries, 9% moderate and 4% severe, according to the letter. But the researchers added that their findings only represent the injuries for which people sought treatment.\n \"United Nations guidelines state that these weapons should only be aimed directly at the extremities and that hits to the head, neck, and face are potentially unlawful,\" they wrote.\n \"Although the results represent only a single region in a worldwide protest, these findings reveal that under current practices, projectiles are not appropriate for crowd control.\"",
