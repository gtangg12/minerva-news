        "body_text": "Among the mob of extremists and Trump supporters that invaded the US Capitol last week in a deadly riot were former members of the very institution that is supposed to protect America from invasion: the US military.\n They included 35-year-old Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who'd become infatuated with the QAnon conspiracy theory and on Wednesday was fatally shot by US Capitol Police as the mob tried to force its way toward the House chamber.\n They included Larry Rendell Brock -- a 53-year-old retired Air Force Reserve officer from Texas -- who could be seen roaming the Senate chamber sporting a military helmet, green tactical vest and black-and-camo jacket while clutching a white flex cuff, which is used by law enforcement to restrain or detain subjects. He's been charged with knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct, according to the Justice Department.\n And attending the demonstrations that day was Joshua Macias, 42, a six-year Navy veteran from Virginia and co-founder of the group Vets for Trump who had recently been released from jail. On January 5 -- the day before the siege -- Macias appeared in a Facebook live video with a Virginia state senator; he says he did not enter the building the next day.\n \"The enemy is here, it's not just at the gate,\" Macias said in the now-removed video, according to The Washington Post. \"It's within, we see it everywhere.\"\n The radicalization of military veterans has long worried experts who monitor extremism online and elsewhere. And though it isn't known whether soldiers and veterans are disproportionately vulnerable to radicalization, their association with extremist groups has been enough of a concern over the years for hate-group watchers to study the matter and lobby Congress to take action to counter it.\n In February, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups urged the US House Armed Services Committee ensure the military branches vet enlistees for signs of white nationalistic beliefs, such as by reviewing their social media accounts, creating a tattoo database and performing psychological screenings.\n \"It was well-received, but nothing really changed,\" Lecia Brooks, chief of staff at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told CNN.\n The US Army is now taking steps to detect extremism in its ranks ahead of the January 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. In a written statement to CNN on Tuesday, an Army spokesperson said the branch is working with the Secret Service to determine whether there are soldiers who will be part of the National Guard contingent providing security at the inauguration who require additional background screening.\n \"The D.C. National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in D.C. that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command,\" according to the statement.\n From their tactical and organizational skills to their wide networks of friends with whom they served, veterans are an appealing group for extremists to recruit, experts say.\n \"The military is so beloved -- the American public polls at something close to 75 percent confidence in the armed forces,\" said Jim Golby, a University of Texas at Austin researcher who studies military and civilian relations. \"And consider the way special ops are portrayed in popular culture, in movies. There is an identity that [extremist] groups want to have. They want to emulate the way military members dress, the way they carry weapons because that portrays an image of confidence and credibility.\"\n Indeed, mixed in with the motley crew of protesters and rioters on Wednesday was a body-armored band of Oath Keepers, an anti-government militia group intent on stoking civil war that claims to include many law enforcement members and military veterans.\n Extremist groups play on veterans and service members' deeply felt sense of patriotism to recruit them, said retired Army Lt. General David Barno, former head of Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan.\n \"For some of these groups, they clearly portray an idea of super patriotism -- waving the American flag, saying we believe in the flag,\" he said.\n The groups, he said, also provide a sense of camaraderie and shared viewpoints.\n \"This connection ... that's one thing I know almost all veterans miss when they leave the military,\" Barno said.\n And veterans and service members follow leaders. When they see members of Congress -- such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has embraced QAnon conspiracies, or Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley raising doubts about the legitimacy of the election -- they can be swayed, he said.\n \"The military services will have to take a hard look at this,\" said Barno, who is currently a visiting professor of strategic studies and senior fellow at the Merrill Center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. \"The fact that there were officers and enlisted and retirees [at the Capitol siege] is jarring and shocking and appalling. And even if that was a small number of people, the question [for top brass] is how much a tip of the iceberg is that? How prevalent is this kind of extremist activity among members and veterans?\"\n There is scant data available on why, how and how often veterans are radicalized to believe extreme views, Golby said. There are several reasons for that, he explained.\n It's generally a challenge for researchers outside the military system to be allowed to survey active members. Active-duty members are always being surveyed about quality of life, their commanders and so on. \"They [the Department of Defense] rightfully try to protect members from being overly surveyed,\" Golby said.\n And there's also hesitation from active-duty members and veterans to be completely honest in surveys -- just as it sometimes is when they are polled about suicide. If a service member or veteran admits to subscribing or leaning toward extremist ideology, will that disclosure hurt their military career or legacy?\n And determining whom to poll in a population of 1.3 million active-duty personnel and approximately 18 million veterans is also tricky. Do you target Gulf War veterans? Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans? \"But there's no question that it should be done,\" Golby said.\n While the scale of radicalization in the military remains unclear, there is at least one decorated general who has embraced extremist views: Michael T. Flynn.\n In July, the retired general and former national security adviser posted a short video of himself taking an oath and uttering a phrase -- \"Where we go one, we go all!\"\u2014 associated with QAnon, an online movement that subscribes to the delusional belief that Trump is battling a cabal of Democrats and elitists who are pedophiles and worship Satan.\n In December, Flynn -- who was pardoned by Trump in November after his conviction of lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat -- tweeted a press release from an Ohio organization calling on Trump to \"immediately declare a limited form of martial law, and temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections, for the sole purpose of having the military oversee a re-vote.\"\n Martial law, which has been invoked only a handful of times in US history, essentially puts the military in charge of the government after a breakdown of civil order following a foreign attack or natural disaster.\n On January 5 -- a day before the insurrection at the US Capitol -- Flynn gave a pep talk to Trump supporters laden with lies about a stolen election and violent imagery associated with war.\n \"In some of these states, we have more dead voters than are buried on the battlefields of Gettysburg,\" he said. \"Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don't have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here, and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie.\"\n Last week, Twitter permanently banned Flynn and other high-profile Trump allies who have promoted QAnon.\n Brock -- the man in the green military helmet seen wandering the Senate floor clutching the zip-tie cuffs -- was arrested Sunday and charged with knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority, according to the Justice Department.\n Family members told the New Yorker his views had grown more extreme over the years, and more informed by white supremacy. Brock denied he holds racist views in an interview with the magazine, and repeated Trump's groundless assertions of election fraud.\n Macias -- the veteran who shot the Facebook video -- had been arrested on November 5 along with another man on suspicion of carrying unpermitted handguns in Philadelphia, where authorities say the men had traveled due to their concerns about \"fake ballots.\" Macias was released on November 26 after posting $75,000 of his $750,000 bail. Philadelphia prosecutors accused Macias of trying \"to interfere with the counting of lawfully cast votes.\"\n Prosecutors now want Macias' bail revoked.\n \"My office is prepared to argue that this defendant's participation in the seditious, outrageous, and deadly invasion of the U.S. Capitol on [January 6] in order to help a criminal president remain in office unlawfully meets the definition of violating terms of bail,\" said Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner in a statement.\n Macias, who says he has left the Vets for Trump group he co-founded, maintains that he did not enter the Capitol building, and so did not violate bail, his attorney, William J. Brennan, told the Washington Post.\n Macias has a personal website that thanks supporters for raising $160,000 for his legal defense.\n Another veteran, Emily Rainey, a former Army officer assigned to Fort Bragg in North Carolina, is under investigation by the US Army for her involvement in last week's events.\n Rainey led about 100 people from North Carolina to the demonstration, though she told the Associated Press she did not breach the building. Rainey, who resigned her post before the siege for unrelated reasons, posted a video in May of herself ripping down caution tape at a playground that was closed because of North Carolina's coronavirus restrictions, according to CNN affiliate WRAL in Raleigh.\n Brock, Macias and Rainey and their attorneys could not be reached for comment.\n Some experts caution that it is critical not to paint a broad brush when trying to learn why some veterans are drawn to Trump, extremist views or nationalist movements.\n \"I would challenge the premise that veterans are any more susceptible to propaganda than anyone else,\" said Paul Rieckhoff, the founder and former CEO of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \"We are a slice of the population.\"\n He added: \"Remember that the Capitol Hill cop who died was a veteran,\" referring to Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to injuries he suffered in the riot.\n Consider the lawmakers who are veterans, trying to make their way to safety: Rep. Ruben Gallego, a former Marine; Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger; Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who suffered severe wounds in Iraq.\n When it comes to the attack on the Capitol, those who perpetrated the siege who happen to be veterans are going to make more headlines because of their past service. It's a quick -- and sometimes too easy -- way to qualify them, Rieckhoff said.\n \"Ashli Babbitt was a veteran, but she was a lot of other things. There are a million factors in someone's life that leads them down the path she took,\" he said.\n \"It's dangerous waters right now because we (veterans) are fighting stereotypes,\" he noted. \"When we talk about recruitment of veterans to these groups, I think what that says simply is that veterans are powerful, period.\"\n Thomas Speciale, an Army Reservist who served in Afghanistan, was at the Capitol on Wednesday, but said he stayed outside.\n Speciale, who made an unsuccessful run for the Senate and has served as the national spokesman for Vets for Trump, told CNN that he doubted Trump supporters started the assault on the building -- breaking windows and charging inside. That explanation is too simple for him. There must be something more sinister at work, he asserted.\n \"I believe there were professional instigators, professional agitators,\" he claimed. \"The enemies of the Trump movement want us to fight with the cops.\"\n Vlad Lemets, a US veteran from Florida and the director of Vets for Trump, said it had members of the organization at the Capitol. He stressed that he wasn't there.\n The group has what he estimates are over a million members and its communication is run mostly through Facebook. Lemets had trouble a few years ago when Macedonian trolls hijacked the group's page and spread information intended to rile up posters. But, still, today, back in their American hands, the page includes posts that have been flagged by Facebook for falsehoods.\n Lemets disagreed that Trump has been lying about the election results or anything else. Rather, he insisted, Trump has delivered on vows he made to Americans when he launched his campaign for the White House.\n \"Promises made, promises kept,\" said Lemets, a Florida sometime-real estate agent who was born in Russia and said he served in the Iraq War. He asserted that one of the big reasons his organization's followers like Trump is because Trump focused on border security.\n \"A lot of veterans retired from service -- we find ourselves in government jobs, police, and border patrol,\" he said. \"In border patrol, they say they went to fight [in Iraq and Afghanistan] in what were civil wars. We were stuck in the middle of other people's civil war. They find that the same people they are trying to kill over there are coming across the border to kill them.\"\n Lemets, echoing false claims from Trump in 2018, believes that Middle Easterners are sneaking across the border to commit violence.\n Trump claimed that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" were coming into the US from Central America in a migrant caravan.\n Pressed by CNN's Jim Acosta for proof of that, Trump answered, \"there's no proof of anything, but they could very well be.\"\n Kristofer Goldsmith, the former chief investigator for the Vietnam Veterans of America, spent years researching how disinformation -- including Pro-Trump propaganda -- has targeted veterans.\n That project began when he noticed a fake Facebook page for the VVA had been set up -- he would later learn by digital trolls in Bulgaria and other countries -- to post fake information targeting veterans with anti-democracy propaganda. The messages were intended, Goldsmith said, to provoke anger.\n Goldsmith wrote a 200-page paper about his findings, including that foreign admins at one point controlled the Facebook page Vets for Trump\n One of the most powerful and popular memes shared among veterans online during the last several years, Goldsmith said, was a doctored image of four female Democratic representatives -- known as the Squad -- posing in front of an ISIS flag, an \"impeach Trump\" sign and portrait of Osama bin Laden.\n \"I was shocked to see -- if you look at comments -- just how many people believed that was real,\" he said.\n The Vets for Trump page is today filled with disinformation and falsehoods about the presidential election.\n In 2018, Goldsmith tried to call national attention to the problem in a Wired op-ed and said the VVA asked the US Department of Veterans Affairs to take a more proactive role in helping veterans disseminate fact from fiction.\n The VA has not done that, Goldsmith said.\n Asked whether the VA has taken action to help veterans decipher propaganda online or to improve their media literacy, spokesperson Christina Noel emailed, \"Policing or regulating online content is not part of the department's mission.\"\n Goldsmith understands firsthand how easy it is to believe in what others might see as crazy.\n When Goldsmith came home from fighting in Iraq, he was lost. He was 16 when 9/11 happened, inspiring him to enlist the first chance he got. He was soon deployed to Iraq.\n \"I turned 20 sitting on top of the Sheraton hotel in Baghdad watching car bombs,\" he said.\n The trauma he experienced at war, especially one itself started by the misinformation floated by the US government about Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction, made him want to find the \"real\" truth. Goldsmith was drawn in by a trilogy of films that present a myriad of government conspiracy theories. He spent what little money he had burning CDs of the films and putting them in random people's mailboxes.\n \"Next thing I know I'm out spray painting on my town's train station 'Ron Paul Revolution,'\" he said, inspired by Paul's libertarian takes and the former politician's rejection of the Iraq war.\n \"I thought it was my duty to spread the truth and fight for what was right and just,\" Goldsmith said. \"But I didn't have great media literacy. I didn't know how to weigh evidence. When I realized that the war I was fighting wasn't popularly supported, it made me feel like I'd lost my belief system.\"\n Deeply concerned, his mother intervened and pushed him toward the VA, where he underwent helpful therapy sessions and was eventually able to direct his drive and intellectual curiosity toward becoming an investigator at the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n \"I was given access to mental health care that helped me let go of anger and regret,\" he said, \"the emotions that can drive some of what we saw Wednesday.\"",

        "title": "For the mob that stormed the US Capitol, a lesson from Charlottesville",
        "body_text": "What happened to the alt-right after Charlottesville could be a guide for what happens to QAnon and the mob that stormed the US Capitol last week.\n The alt-right was a version of white supremacy that attracted a much younger crowd through the internet, and it aimed to work within mainstream politics to advance racism. And for a moment, it seemed like it was working -- that the movement was moving from the internet to real life.\n But after the Unite the Right rally in 2017, their efforts were slowly crushed. By mid-2018, its leaders told me they could no longer hold public rallies that were announced in advance. Many groups disbanded because of infighting, or because their internal communications were infiltrated by anti-fascists, or because their leader was humiliated in scandal. A longtime troll told me last month that talking about current events in that world was considered \"cringe,\" meaning embarrassing.\n White nationalism still exists. The Department of Homeland Security says it is the greatest terror threat in the United States. But it is not spreading through the movement that called itself the alt-right.\n This happened because the alt-right was hammered on three fronts -- social, financial and legal. It's important to understand how these three elements worked together, because there are early signs the same pattern is happening with the Trump movement and the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n It's hard to remember now, but before Charlottesville, the term \"alt-right\" was in flux, claimed by both neo-Nazis and not-explicitly-racist conservatives. To take one prominent example, in 2016, when he was running the Trump campaign, Steve Bannon infamously said his Breitbart News website was \"the platform for the alt-right.\"\n After Charlottesville, the term \"alt-right\" was poison. Only days later, Bannon said, \"Ethno-nationalism -- it's losers,\" and, \"We gotta help crush it.\"\n The blowback came in three parts.\n First, the social. Many attendees who showed their faces in Charlottesville were doxxed, meaning that identifying information such as the protesters' names, locations and employers were posted online. They were shamed in local media and many were fired from their jobs.\n Those in the alt-right who weren't doxxed lived in paralyzing fear of it, they've told me. Life became very difficult for the movement's footsoldiers.\n As their faces circulated on social media, they lost their own accounts. White power advocates were kicked of Twitter, Facebook, etc. Alternative social media sites like Gab popped up. But some complained to me that using Gab was pointless. Elliot Kline, then head of the now-defunct group Identity Evropa, told me there were no journalists on Gab. They couldn't use it to spread their message outside the echo chamber.\n This was the aftereffect of Charlottesville that most Americans could see best, but it wasn't the most important.\n The second part was the money. They lost the power to raise it. Fundraising sites such as Patreon and GoFundMe kicked them off. White power programmers tried to make their own versions -- Hatreon, GoyFundMe -- but that didn't work, because then payment processors dropped them.\n The civil rights advocacy group Color of Change had been pressuring financial services companies to stop processing the payments of White nationalists well before Charlottesville. Color of Change president Rashad Robinson told CNN that at the time, he thought it was absurd that it was so easy to give White nationalists money.\n \"We started going to the credit card companies and processors, and they'd say you have to go to the banks. The banks would say you have to go to the credit card companies,\" Robinson said.\n \"A lot of enabling happens because people in powerful positions are not seeing this as a threat against them and their families,\" Robinson said. \"They could make intellectual arguments about slippery slopes, but what they were doing was creating an out so they didn't have to make hard decisions -- decisions that should not have been hard in the first place.\"\n PayPal was the only company that worked well with Color of Change to cut off White power groups, Robinson said. \"And then Charlottesville happened.\"\n \"Magically they could do something they couldn't do before -- and no law had changed.\"\n In the fall of 2018, Chris Cantwell, who I'd interviewed in the Vice documentary about Charlottesville, told me he'd been dropped by nearly every payment processor. He complained he could still get money through Bitcoin -- but few people used it, and it had no mechanism for recurring payments. At one point, alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer told me he could get money only through paper checks.\n Matthew Heimbach, who ran the now-disbanded Traditionalist Worker Party, has quit the White power movement. But this summer he told me that non-profit groups that transition people out of extremism didn't have much to offer him. He said they told him they could pay for his extremist tattoo to be removed, and get him on cable TV. He didn't need that, he said. What he needed was a good job -- to support his family, and to pay for a lawyer. His past limited his options.\n The social and the financial repercussions combined to worsen the effects of the third piece of the backlash: the legal. Those who committed crimes on camera were often prosecuted. James Alex Fields Jr., who drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville, killing Heather Heyer, was sentenced to life in prison. Cantwell was prosecuted for macing people in a confrontation with anti-fascists at the end of a torch march. He pleaded guilty to two assault charges involving pepper spray and was required to leave the state of Virginia.\n (In a sign of how the pressure has caused the White power movement to eat itself, in September, Cantwell was found guilty of extortion. Cantwell had threatened a White supremacist that he'd rape his wife unless the man gave Cantwell the personal information of a third White supremacist whom Cantwell was angry with.)\n Perhaps most devastating, many of Charlottesville's major White power figures were named in a federal civil lawsuit, Sines v. Kessler, filed in October 2017. The plaintiffs' legal team is headed by Roberta Kaplan, who successfully argued at the Supreme Court to end the ban on gay marriage.\n The alt-right defendants have not been able to find legal representation with a comparable resume.\n In fact, they've struggled to find lawyers at all. Six of the remaining 18 defendants, including Richard Spencer, are now representing themselves in court. In a hearing this spring, Spencer's lawyer asked to withdraw from the case because Spencer hadn't paid him. Spencer told the judge the case had been \"financially crippling.\" The judge allowed the lawyer to quit.\n The trial is scheduled for April, but it may be pushed to October because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Will QAnon and the pro-Trump mob face something similar? There are early signs the answer is yes. Activists and law enforcement are working together to find the identities of people pictured inside the Capitol.\n As photos of their faces circulate on social media, rioters are facing consequences at home. A Maryland man seen entering the Capitol wearing his work ID on a lanyard has been fired. Many of his comrades have also lost their jobs.\n The FBI has posted photos of rioters, seeking information. One of them is a man who described fighting with police in an interview with CNN in which he shouted, \"What are we supposed to do?\"\n Thousands of QAnon accounts have been removed from social media. They've tried migrating to Parler, but Amazon stopped providing services to Parler, effectively kicking it off the public internet. Apple and Google removed it from their app stores. On eBay, sellers are trying to take advantage of less tech-savvy Trump fans, offering mobile phones with Parler already installed for more than $1,000.\n President Donald Trump has been kicked off Twitter and Facebook. Sunday night, the payment processor Stripe booted the Trump campaign. Monday, Signature Bank said it would close Trump's personal accounts. Deutsche Bank, which has been a major source of loans to Trump's businesses, announced it will no longer do business with him.\n A wave of other businesses are dropping the President. Major companies are suspending political donations to Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election results.\n Trump is certainly in a stronger position, in terms of power and money, than even the most affluent marchers in Charlottesville. But that also means he has more to lose. Especially legally.",

One, who said he was a founder of a local militia group, spoke against business shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic and praised \"patriots that stand up for our constitutional rights.\"\n He also said \"what happened in DC was unacceptable,\" but \"if that's not a wake-up call to how pissed off Americans are, I don't know what is.\"\n At least one person on the grounds had a rifle, which is legal under Texas law.\n Texas GOP Chairman Allen West, standing outside the Capitol, said he hopes people on both sides of the ideological aisle remain calm.\n \"Yesterday I put out a piece on the RPT (Republican Party of Texas) website, my chairman's Monday message,\" West said. \"It said cool hands always prevail, because I've been in combat, and you have to temper emotions, you have to stay focused, you have to stay resolute.

        "body_text": "Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the party's third-ranking House leader, announced on Tuesday that she will vote to impeach President Donald Trump, becoming the highest-ranking official from her party to support charging and removing him from office following the Trump-incited riot at the Capitol last week.\n In a statement, Cheney, a staunch conservative, said Trump was responsible for the death and destruction that day.\n LIVE UPDATES: House pushes for Trump's removal after deadly Capitol riot\n \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President,\" said Cheney. \"The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not.\"\n \"There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\" she added. \"I will vote to impeach the President.\"\n The House plans to vote on one article of impeachment Wednesday charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection,\" as it races toward making him the first President in history to be impeached twice. Cheney has said that the vote should be driven by one's conscience.\n Unlike the other two top leaders in her conference -- House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Republican Whip Steve Scalise -- Cheney opposed Trump's efforts to overturn the election, and voted to certify the results last week.\n The Republican Party has been torn by Trump's reluctance to concede the election and take responsibility for his role in inciting the attack on the Capitol.\n Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, the chair of the fiercely pro-Trump Freedom Caucus, said Cheney should resign from her leadership position as conference chair for coming out in support of impeaching Trump.\n But other Republicans looking toward the future of the party after Trump are infuriated by McCarthy's decision to go along with the President's deluded and dangerous effort to stay in power. Both McCarthy and Scalise oppose impeaching Trump, saying it would further divide the country.\n McCarthy's staff asked for a call Tuesday with McCarthy to ask him to explain his actions, \"and he couldn't be bothered to join the call,\" according to a person close to the matter. Senior advisers to McCarthy, who are paying careful attention to his potential 2022 run for Speaker if the GOP wins back the House, released details of a recent call with House Republicans in which he insisted that Trump supporters, rather than Antifa, stormed the Capitol.\n But that has done little to quell their concern that McCarthy has been tarnished by his defense of the President. On the eve of the impeachment vote, senior advisers are trying to keep some staff from quitting.\n A McCarthy spokesman responded, \"This is completely inaccurate.\" The spokesman said that that McCarthy's office held a staff call while the House GOP leader \"was on the road\" and he \"was never intended\" to participate on the call.\n \"It's been a tough week but today's call reaffirmed the bonds and commitment we have to our important work,\" said the spokesman.\n The House GOP leader ignored questions Tuesday evening on whether Trump was responsible for the riot, walking into the chamber in silence.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he believes impeaching Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. McConnell has made no commitments on whether he will vote to convict Trump during a Senate impeachment trial.\n Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has broken with Trump in the past, including on various foreign policy issues and by supporting Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, during the coronavirus pandemic.\n When asked about Cheney's decision to impeach the President, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded, \"Good for her to be honoring the oath of office.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Phil Mattingly and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Garry Kasparov is the chairman of the Renew Democracy Initiative and the Human Rights Foundation and a former world chess champion. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nAs terrible as the events of Jan. 6 were -- and I'm on the record warning of \"the unimaginable\" -- I'm going to repeat what I said after Election Day: It's not over.\n This battle against anti-democratic extremism didn't end when a right-wing mob invaded the United States Capitol and five people died, including one police officer. It didn't end when Twitter and other social media platforms finally muzzled President Donald Trump -- although that was a heavier blow in this fight than most. And it won't end when Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20.\n Beating Trump was an essential step, of course. Four years of his thuggery and demagoguery were enough to bring American democracy to its knees. Four more might have finished it off. Had fewer than 45,000 votes across three key states gone the other way on Election Day, we'd be plunging toward authoritarian rule, and discussing which of Trump's children would take over in 2024.\n Narrowly dodging that metaphorical bullet was no protection against the threat of real bullets, as the attack on the Capitol proved. And there will be more violence, especially if the Capitol perpetrators and those who incited them -- starting with the President -- are not held accountable.\n The correct response is the dispassionate application of the law. Not political persecution, but nor politically motivated leniency, either. We don't have to choose between unity and justice.  Avoiding doing the right thing will only prolong the crisis and give aid and comfort to enemies of the state and of the peace. Our Founding Fathers failed to resolve the historical challenge of slavery, passing a bloody Civil War on to future generations. Despite Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Reconstruction allowed the South a \"defeat with honor,\" decades of Jim Crow, and the pernicious Lost Cause mythology that persists today.\n Consider the repugnant image of a Trumpist Capitol invader carrying a Confederate flag in a building that Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson only dreamed of conquering. No new mythology should be allowed to sprout from this vile transgression. The worst result would be letting the mutineers off the hook -- and this includes the elected officials who encouraged them, like Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and especially President Trump. That they, and scores of other Republicans, continued to attack the integrity of the election even now is beyond the pale.\n The perpetrators won't become heroes or martyrs if the process of justice is not unduly politicized. It would be a blunder for the left to turn a clear case of criminal justice into a battleground for racial justice, which would help the Trumpist Republicans twist their illegal insurrection into the culture war they crave. White supremacy is a terrible evil of American history, and Trump and his followers' traffic in it is repugnant, but we should not overburden a clear-cut criminal proceeding with the cleansing of sins.\n History teaches us the cost of well-meaning but shortsighted attempts to sacrifice justice for unity. Russians learned this in the hardest possible way after the fall of the Soviet Union. As I discussed at length in my book, Winter Is Coming, they declined to root out the KGB security state in the interest of national harmony. It would be too traumatic, our leaders said, to expose the countless atrocities the Soviet security forces committed and to punish their authors.\n A feeble truth commission was quickly abandoned by President Boris Yeltsin, and soon even the Soviet archives were closed, although not before researchers like Vladimir Bukovsky revealed some of the KGB's atrocities. The KGB's name was changed to the FSB and its members quietly stayed in touch and intact. The result? A mere nine years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia elected a former KGB lieutenant colonel, Vladimir Putin, to the presidency. It was the last meaningful election we ever had. We chose unity and we got dictatorship.\n America should not make a similar mistake. The truth may hurt, but lies will do far greater damage in the end. Americans should be prepared for a long fight against these anti-democratic forces. The attack on the Capitol has opened every eye; there can be no more feigned ignorance of the crisis.\n Many Americans were shocked by how many of their compatriots, including nearly all GOP officials, have been willing to go along with Trump's open assault on the pillars of their open society, from the free press to fair elections. As I warned early on, demagogues don't find radicals to lead, they steadily radicalize their followers one outrage at a time. The culmination, so far, was January 6.\n Hemingway wrote in \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\": \"There are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.\" The time has come, and we are finding them out. Fortuitously, they are inclined to boast of their transgressions on Instagram and from the Senate floor, which makes them easy to find.\n The question is if the will exists to apply the justice they deserve. Failing to do so will not mollify them. They are living in an alternate universe, where 70% of Republican voters say that Republican lawmakers who tried to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election were \"protecting democracy,\" according to a Quinnipiac poll taken AFTER the assault on the Capitol Trump incited. Seventy-three percent told pollsters they thought Trump, too, was \"protecting\" democracy.\n Perhaps the most ominous number is the 24% of Republican voters who don't accept the results of the election, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey last month, leaving the question of whether they will accept the results of any election ever again.\n Coups aside, this was always the greatest threat of Trump's rhetoric, and a result that will delight dictators like Putin, who are always eager to denigrate democracy and its champions. At its core, democracy is an act of faith, a shared belief that the people can fairly act in the common good by choosing their leaders. Destroying the faith in the system will destroy the American experiment.\n This is precisely what we are trying to counter at the Renew Democracy Initiative. We are launching a campaign dedicated to the simple phrase, \"what democracy means to me,\" in the hopes of reminding everyone what a luxury it is for every citizen to have a say in the course of their lives and of their nation.\n Democracy isn't liberal or conservative, not left or right -- at least it isn't supposed to be. Millions of Americans currently believe that democracy isn't working, or even that it isn't worth saving. The battle to prove them wrong isn't over, it's just begun.",

Parler had alleged Amazon was engaged in a conspiracy to eliminate a competitor from the marketplace; Amazon said Parler's suit fails to define a relevant market or specify how competition was harmed.\n Amazon also leans on Section 230, the law that has been heavily criticized by President Donald Trump and that grants tech platforms immunity for their content moderation efforts.\n \"That is precisely what AWS did here: removed access to content it considered 'excessively violent' and 'harassing,'\" the brief said.\n The litigation could thus become a high-profile test of the law that has come under scrutiny by both Democrats and Republicans.",

        "title": "Investigation into Capitol attack is unprecedented in scope, Justice Department says",
        "body_text": "Federal investigators are chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in last week's attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington and around the country.\n But while the FBI has opened more than 160 case files in the six days since pro-Donald Trump rioters breached the US Capitol building, officials acknowledged Tuesday that the evidence gathered so far \"is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n \"People are going to be shocked by some of the egregious contact that happened in the Capitol,\" acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in reference to assaults on federal and DC police officers.\n \"So the picture is going to build. I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what happened within the Capitol, and it's going to come into laser focus I think over the next weeks and days,\" he added.\n At the same time, officials from the FBI and Department of Justice sought to reassure the American public Tuesday that they are up to the task on both fronts during a news conference that also laid bare the enormity of the challenge currently facing law enforcement agencies involved in both efforts.\n \"The FBI is quite familiar with large-scale, complex investigations ... we are up to the challenge,\" FBI Washington DC field office assistant director Steven D'Antuono said.\n Sherwin echoed that point, telling reporters, \"The scope and the scale of this investigation into these cases are really unprecedented not only in FBI history but probably DOJ history in which essentially the Capitol grounds outside and inside are essentially a crime scene.\"\n \"It is not going to be solved in the coming months,\" he added.\n FBI Director Christopher Wray did not attend the news conference, the first held by law enforcement officials since the attack took place nearly one week ago.\n His absence has fueled questions about whether the Trump administration is treating the incident with the seriousness it requires, particularly after the President said earlier Tuesday that he believes he bears no responsibility for the attack carried out by his supporters.\n Still, the officials who were present Tuesday vowed to leave no stone unturned as they treat the investigation of Capitol rioters similar to terrorism.\n They also emphasized the fact that investigators have already charged 70 cases, and Sherwin said he believes that number will grow into the hundreds, and already arrested individuals may face more serious crimes.\n \"The numbers are going to geometrically increase,\" Sherwin said.\n Sherwin said he gave his prosecutors \"marching orders\" to pursue significant sedition and conspiracy cases as well related to the insurrection.\n The FBI is also tracking money, travel records, movements of people and communications in addition to following tips from the public and footage and photos from the scene last Wednesday.\n After Tuesday's presser, the Democratic chairs of five House oversight committee issued a joint statement to express their \"grave concerns about ongoing and violent threats to our democracy.\"\n \"It is clear that more must be done to preempt, penetrate, and prevent deadly and seditious assaults by domestic violent extremists in the days ahead.\"\n Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said \"Trump bears some responsibility for what happened on January 6.\"\n \"If our nation experiences additional violence and destruction at the hands of his supporters in Washington DC and state capitols around the country, and he does not directly and unambiguously speak out now when threats are known, he will bear responsibility,\" Portman added.\n Portman's comments reflect a growing concern among law enforcement officials in recent days that violent mobs' success in breaching the Capitol has increased the potential for attacks because people may be emboldened to carry out violence.\n \"The chatter is off the charts right now,\" one official said.\n The sprawling probe spanning all 50 states in some ways is unprecedented, even in comparison to the investigations after the 9/11 attacks. That's because federal investigators are grappling with a domestic radicalization problem, that presents complications due to First Amendment protections of political speech, different from radicalization tied to foreign terrorist groups.\n Some of the intelligence the FBI, ATF and other agencies shared before last week's attack has taken new importance, and has prompted federal investigators to conduct visits with people already on their radar and who have raised concerns about violence. Much of the online threats found in social media and other forums is thought to be aspirational, but the FBI and other agencies now are treating them more seriously, officials said.\n Some of that occurred before the January 6 Trump rally, federal officials have said. The FBI worked with Washington's Metropolitan Police to arrest a leader of the Proud Boys in the days before the Trump rally on a relatively minor charge, and then added charges when they found him carrying extended ammunition magazines that are illegal in the city. Prosecutors monitored hotels where some attendees were staying.\n But there were efforts by some of the groups of concern to try to evade detection. On the day of the rally, members of the Proud Boys ditched their normal yellow and black attire and donned orange hats, and they were seen gathering near the Capitol grounds to coordinate their march to the building, according to a federal law enforcement official and video from the day.\n D'Antuono also said agents are still investigating whether participants in the January 6 riot were looking to take members of Congress as hostages.\n He noted the FBI is pursuing information about a person or people who helped to plant pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic headquarters last week.\n He said the bombs were real and had timers. \"We don't know exactly why they didn't go off,\" he added.\n Meanwhile, Sherwin said national security and public corruption prosecutors on Monday organized into a \"strike force\" in the DC US Attorney's Office to build sedition and conspiracy cases. Prosecutors had also spent all of Monday working with a federal grand jury to prepare indictments as well.\n \"Just yesterday our office organized a strike force of very senior national security prosecutors and public corruption prosecutors. Their only marching orders from me are to build seditious and conspiracy charges related to the most heinous acts that occurred in the Capitol, and these are significant charges that have felonies with a prison terms of up to 20 years,\" Sherwin said.\n He said the grand jury in Washington was \"up and booked throughout the day\" so prosecutors could present significant cases for indictment.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "A Category 5 atmospheric river - stretching 2,700 miles across the Pacific -- is drenching the Northwest US",
        "body_text": "The Pacific Northwest is known for rain, but not this much.\n So far this year, Seattle has seen nearly 6.5\" of rain. With an additional 2-4 inches forecast, the city could receive roughly 25% of its annual rainfall by January 15 from the atmospheric river that's drenching the region.\n \"This soggy start could propel Seattle to its single wettest start of any year on record. The previous wettest Jan 1-15 period occurred in January 1956, when nearly 7 inches fell in the first half the month,\" says CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.\n Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere -- like rivers in the sky -- that transport water vapor, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n This atmospheric river event is being classified as a Category 5 -- the highest level -- from the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. The flooding potential is huge, with roughly 15 million people under some sort of watch or advisory. Parts of western Washington could see 300% of normal rainfall, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n There's also plenty of warmth in the mid-levels of the atmosphere during this particular atmospheric river event. This will raise snow levels on elevations above 6,000 feet across much of the Cascades, with rain falling below that level.\n \"This will further exacerbate flooding concerns as heavy rain falls atop abundant snow. The threat for rapid melting, increased runoff and downstream river flooding is something everyone in western Oregon and Washington should be on alert for,\" says Javaheri.\n Higher elevations in Washington could see 2 inches to 4 inches of rain during the next 24 hours, increasing the flooding and landslide risk.\n Rainfall at lower elevations should be between 1 and 2 inches during that time.\n In Portland, Oregon, the National Weather Service Office has forecast up to 7 inches of rain in the higher terrain and up to 2 inches for the lowlands through Wednesday morning. Along with that, there's a high-wind warning in effect.\n Wind warnings extend along the whole Oregon coastline, where gusts could reach up to 75 mph.  This raises concerns for downed trees, power outages and possible hazards along Interstate 5.\n The impacts from the record-setting wildfires are also raising the threats of flooding for Oregon.  According to the Oregon Department of Forestry, more than 1 million acres burned. These burn scars that remain make the flood threat even greater, due to charred ground with no vegetation to soak up the rainwater.  This enhances the possibility of flash flooding and landslides due to the loose terrain.\n The weather phenomenon causing all of this rain is called an atmospheric river. They basically are rivers of moisture high in the atmosphere. They carry abundant moisture from tropical regions and release it in other areas in the form of rain or snow.\n According to NOAA: \"These columns of vapor move with the weather, carrying an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River.\"\n Not all atmospheric rivers are bad. Many times, they carry very beneficial rain to areas that need it. Many areas along the West Coast will get 30%-50% of their annual rainfall in just a few such events.\n However, with a stronger event, it can lead to dangerous flooding and life-threatening landslides. The atmospheric river that stretches from Hawaii to the West Coast has been coined the \"Pineapple Express\" and is one of the most well-known atmospheric rivers.\n A December 2019 study published by researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography suggests that during the last 40 years, atmospheric rivers have posed a $1.1 billion flood hazard for each of those years along the West Coast.\n This particular atmospheric river has a 2,700-mile span with a bull's-eye on the Northwest. That is equivalent to the distance from Seattle to Miami as the crow flies, and the moisture it's carrying could possibly put January 2021 in the record books.\n This atmospheric river event is so significant that hurricane hunters will be flying through it, dropping buoys.\n \"In order to really understand how significant an atmospheric river event will be, you need to get close to it. Hurricane hunters fly inside of them and collect valuable data that forecasters then use to determine how a particular atmospheric river will affect the pacific coast region,\" says CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar.\n This is their second flight of the season and something they do regularly.\n \"The Hurricane Hunters began flying in atmospheric rivers for the first time in February 2016 and have been sending out 6-12 flights each January through March ever since. In of itself, it's not that unusual that they are flying this event, though it's a popular misconception that once the hurricane season winds die, so does their role,\" says Javaheri.",

        "body_text": "The US set a record Tuesday for the most Covid-19 deaths reported in one day since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n As of Tuesday evening, 4,197 deaths were reported, according to JHU. This is not the complete total for Tuesday, though, because final numbers come in overnight.\n After widespread concerns about delays in vaccinations, the Trump administration will now release reserved second doses immediately, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.\n Such a plan had already been announced by President-elect Joe Biden.\n More than 9 million people have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and more than 27 million doses have been distributed, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means one-third of vaccines that have been delivered have been given to people.\n Six states -- North Dakota, West Virginia, Connecticut, South Dakota, Montana and Tennessee -- have administered enough first doses to account for more than half of the doses they've received.\n Meanwhile, seven states -- Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, Hawaii, Virginia, Idaho and California -- have administered less than a quarter of the doses they've received.\n Officials with Operation Warp Speed defended the slow rollout of vaccines Tuesday, saying states were sticking too rigidly to guidance designating health care workers and nursing home residents to be vaccinated first. They said the rollout would speed up soon, and asked states to open up vaccination to everyone 65 and older and to younger people with chronic conditions.\n Over the past week, an average of 248,650 new Covid-19 infections have been reported every day.\n The massive surge of Covid-19 nationwide has been fueled by holiday travels and casual at-home gatherings that experts had warned against.\n \"This is what we were afraid of -- people letting their guard down over Christmas and New Year's,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.\n The federal government has been holding back about half the available doses from vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer to make sure everyone who gets a first dose gets their second needed dose on time.\n The Pfizer vaccine doses should be spaced 21 days apart, and the Moderna doses should be 28 days apart.\n But on Tuesday, Azar said, \"We do not need to hold back reserve doses\" anymore.\n \"Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse without going into an arm could mean one more life lost or another hospital bed occupied,\" Azar said.\n If any glitches happen with vaccine production, any new doses would be designated as second doses.\n In addition to releasing reserved doses immediately, HHS announced vaccines will be distributed to states based on which jurisdictions are getting the most doses into arms and where the most older adults live.\n That new strategy will begin in two weeks, Azar said Tuesday.\n \"We will be allocating them based on the pace of administration as reported by states and by the size of the 65 and over population in each state. We're giving states two weeks' notice of this shift to give them the time necessary to plan and to improve their reporting if they think their data is faulty,\" Azar said.\n \"This new system gives states a strong incentive to ensure that all vaccinations are being properly reported, which it currently is not, and it gives states a strong incentive to ensure doses are going to work,\" he said.\n \"We need doses going to where they'll be administered quickly and to where they'll protect the most vulnerable.\"\n About 9 million people have now received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and more than 25.4 million doses have been distributed across the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Amid a rollout that has been far slower than some officials hoped, more states are abandoning guidelines from the CDC and taking their own approach to administering the vaccine, a new analysis found.\n Timelines vary across the country and \"access to Covid-19 vaccines in these first months of the US vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report issued Monday.\n The report found 40 states are still in Phase 1a -- when the CDC recommends vaccinating health care workers and long-term care facility residents -- either fully or partly. Ten states and Washington DC were in Phase 1b. Only Michigan has moved to at least part of Phase 1c, the report said.\n For Phase 1b, CDC recommends vaccinating people age 75 and older and frontline essential workers and for Phase 1c, the agency recommends the vaccinations of people 65 and older, younger people with high-risk conditions and other essential workers.\n States are \"making the decision to just get as many people vaccinated as they can,\" and bypassing recommendations for vaccine prioritization, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee on Monday.\n \"I think where people are right now is they have the vaccine and they just want to get it out there,\" Offit said.\n Without the \"public health infrastructure for mass vaccination\" in place, states are having to learn how to manage mass vaccinations in real time, and some are learning quicker than others, he added.\n In at least 10 states, National Guard members are helping administer vaccines. Other states have asked dentists, retirees and students to aid in the process.\n In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott toured a mass Covid-19 vaccination site Monday and said the state plans to open about 28 similar sites across 18 counties.\n \"These vaccination hubs will expedite vaccine distribution and ensure efficiency in communities across the state,\" the governor said.\n In California, 1 million health care workers, nursing home residents and staff will receive the vaccine by week's end, the governor promised Monday, as part of an \"all hands on deck\" push to serve the more vulnerable residents.\n Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, meanwhile, sent a letter to Azar requesting permission to buy up to 100,000 doses of vaccines for the state.\n \"We remain ready to accelerate distribution to get doses into arms,\" the governor said.\n The letter comes after Whitmer and other state leaders urged government officials to distribute the vaccine doses that are currently being held back by the Trump administration.\n The CDC announced Tuesday an order requiring all airline passengers entering the United States to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights to the US.\n \"Testing does not eliminate all risk,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement. \"But when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations.\"\n This order will go into effect on January 26, the CDC said.\n The rule is similar to one put in place last month for passengers from the United Kingdom to the US, which requires that passengers have a negative test within three days of boarding their flight.\n For the UK requirement that went through last month, airlines can be subject to criminal penalties if they fail to comply, and passengers can be subject to criminal penalties if they willfully give false or misleading information.\n CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Deidre McPhillips, Michael Nedelman, Kristen Holmes, Maggie Fox, Jacqueline Howard, Amanda Watts, Artemis Moshtaghian, Maggie Fox, Samira Said, Jamie Gumbrecht, Lauren Mascarenhas and Evan Simko-Bednarski contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Republicans begin backing impeachment in 'vote of conscience'",
        "body_text": "Multiple House Republicans announced Tuesday evening they would support the impeachment of President Donald Trump for his role inciting last week's riot as congressional Republicans made their clearest break with Trump to date after he showed no remorse for the US Capitol mob.\n While the vast majority of House Republicans are expected to oppose the article of impeachment on Wednesday, there are predictions ranging anywhere from as many as 10 to even 20 or more Republicans who could vote to impeach, according to Republican sources, with some estimates trending upward after the first Republicans came out in favor of impeachment Tuesday.\n The first impeachment backers included the House's No. 3 Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, in a remarkable rebuke with a President who has been unassailable in the House GOP conference throughout his four-year term. While House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is opposed to impeachment, House Republican leaders are not lobbying their members to oppose it, and Cheney told the conference Monday it was a \"vote of conscience.\"\n In another potentially significant blow to Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he believes that impeaching Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.\n The scurrying away from Trump in the hours before the House will vote to impeach him Wednesday is the fiercest pushback the President has faced from Republicans since he was a GOP primary candidate who party leaders believed would fade away.\n The GOP strategy on impeachment is a marked departure from the approach in 2019 when Republican leaders pushed their members to fall in line and no GOP House lawmakers defected. It shows the splintering of the GOP and how the party is deeply divided over how to respond to Trump after he incited last week's deadly Capitol riot.\n LIVE UPDATES: House pushes for Trump's removal after deadly Capitol riot\n Rep. John Katko of New York was the first Republican to publicly state he would vote to impeach Trump, saying in a statement Tuesday he supported impeachment because the President needed to be held accountable for his actions.\n \"To allow the President of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy. For that reason, I cannot sit idly by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this President,\" Katko said on Twitter.\n Cheney quickly followed with a statement of her own, offering some of the harshest criticism of Trump for his role inciting the rioters.\n \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" Cheney said. \"Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\"\n Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, another rare Trump critic in the House GOP conference, also announced Tuesday evening that he would support impeachment, along with Michigan Rep. Fred Upton and Washington Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler.\n Democrats are nearly united in their belief that the President deserves to be impeached and removed in the fallout of the pro-Trump rioters that breached the Capitol and put the lives of lawmakers -- and Vice President Mike Pence -- in danger on January 6. The House will first vote on a measure Tuesday evening urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power, which could signal how many Republicans will back impeachment.\n Then on Wednesday, the House will take up a resolution and vote to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n Trump's impeachment for the second time in 13 months -- which would make him the first President in history to be impeached twice -- appears to be a foregone conclusion. The only question is how many House members vote in favor of removing the President from office eight days before President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in.\n Republicans tried to offer an alternative to impeachment, such as a censure vote, arguing it could win more bipartisan support than an impeachment occurring just one week after the riots. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her caucus Monday that censure was a nonstarter, and Democrats are not considering any off ramps to avoid a second impeachment.\n In the Senate, which would hold a trial if Trump is impeached, McConnell has been silent since the events of January 6, a deliberate decision that leaves open the option of supporting impeachment. The New York Times first reported McConnell's thinking.\n Another person with direct knowledge said there's a reason McConnell has been silent on impeachment as other Republicans have pushed back: He's furious about what happened January 6, even more so that Trump has shown no contrition.\n Should McConnell back impeachment, several GOP sources predicted it would lead to conviction.\n Trump made his first comments on the looming impeachment vote and the Capitol riots on Tuesday, railing against impeachment as a continued \"witch hunt\" and taking no responsibility for his comments leading up to the riots.\n \"On the impeachment, it's really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics. It's ridiculous, it's absolutely ridiculous,\" Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn Tuesday on his way to Alamo, Texas. \"This impeachment is causing tremendous anger, and you're doing it and it's really a terrible thing that they're doing.\"\n Trump took no ownership for inciting the riots last week, and a source close to Trump said late Tuesday he had no consideration of resigning.\n \"It's been analyzed,\" Trump said of his remarks. \"People thought what I said was totally appropriate.\"\n Democrats, furious over the events of January 6, have coalesced around impeachment quickly as the only proper response to the President's repeated lies about the election being stolen from him that whipped up his supporters -- to the point where that they tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power by invading the Capitol while the Electoral College votes were being counted.\n \"This was a brutal and violent attack on our democracy, and Donald Trump incited this by promoting the big lie that he, in fact, won the election by millions of votes but it was stolen from him,\" Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and one of the authors of the impeachment resolution, said on CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday. \"We'll demonstrate unequivocally that the President's language, the statements he made, the promotion of the big lie made violence at the Capitol inevitable. He's responsible for it. He needs to be removed from office immediately. he's a clear and present danger to the United States.\"\n The procedural steps ahead of the impeachment vote began Tuesday in the House Rules Committee, which debated the 25th Amendment resolution sponsored by Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland that was voted on Tuesday evening.\n The Rules Committee meeting was the first chance for Democrats and Republicans to engage on the riots since they occurred last week, and Democrats alternated between telling personal stories about the danger they faced and clashing with the Republican lawmaker opposing the resolution, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern repeatedly called on Jordan to say that Biden won the election fairly, but Jordan would not do so, saying only that Biden won while urging Congress to investigate questions about election irregularities.\n Similar to other impeachment proceedings, the House Judiciary Committee released a report Tuesday evening detailing the argument for Trump's impeachment, even though in this case the House Judiciary Committee did not take any official action related to impeachment.\n \"President Trump committed a high Crime and Misdemeanor against the Nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election,\" the report says. \"The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump.\"\n The House voted late Tuesday evening on Raskin's resolution, before taking up the impeachment resolution at 9 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n House and Senate Democrats have still not finalized plans for what to do after the House impeaches Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will become majority leader on January 20 when Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are sworn in, giving Democrats the tiebreaking vote in a 50-50 Senate, is trying to use a rare procedural tactic to bring the Senate back before January 20 -- a 2004 resolution allows Schumer and McConnell to avoid the requirement for unanimous consent during an emergency. But that would require cooperation from McConnell, who said the Senate will not return before January 19.\n \"We could come back ASAP and vote to convict Donald Trump, and get him out of office now before any further damage is done,\" Schumer said at a news conference in New York.\n \"The bottom line is that Leader McConnell has the ability to call us back into session,\" added Schumer. \"And we can then move to convict Donald Trump in the impeachment trial and try him. And that's what we hope McConnell will do.\"\n McConnell's office did not comment on Schumer's demand. If McConnell does not agree, Schumer and the incoming Biden team are preparing to split the Senate's days for an impeachment trial: Working to confirm Biden's Cabinet and pass legislation in the morning, and conducting the trial beginning at 1 p.m. ET each day, as the Constitution requires, in the opening days of Biden's presidency.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Alex Rogers and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Why messaging app Signal is surging in popularity right now ",
        "body_text": "Users have flocked to encrypted messaging app Signal by the millions in recent days \u2014 bringing it to the No. 1 spot on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store's top free apps lists this week.\n Signal had about 7.5 million installations globally from the App Store and Google Play between Thursday and Sunday, more than 43 times the installations it received during the previous week, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n Encrypted messaging services like Signal have gained popularity in recent years, as people are increasingly concerned with safeguarding their private information. However, this particular bump in Signal's usership comes in the wake of confusion over an updated terms of service notification from Facebook-owned encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.\n The jump in new Signal downloads also followed the riots in Washington D.C. and moves by Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) to cut ties with Parler, the social networking service favored by members of the far-right. Telegram, another encrypted messaging app on Tuesday said it had attracted 25 million new users from around the world in the previous 72 hours, bringing its total active user base to 500 million.\n \"We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world,\" Signal staff said in a Reddit post Friday.\n WhatsApp began notifying users last month of its updated terms of service and privacy policy, which people must agree to in order to keep using the app beyond February 8.\n Many users expressed concerns about a section of WhatsApp's privacy policy that details what user data is collected and shared with parent company Facebook, which has a troubled reputation when it comes to protecting user data.\n All private messages between individuals and most businesses on WhatsApp are protected by end-to-end encryption, meaning the app can't see them or share them with Facebook (users will be notified before chatting with a business where messages are not end-to-end encrypted). But WhatsApp does collect other user information, such has how and when someone uses the app, and user device information like IP addresses.\n WhatsApp's privacy policy states that user information it collects may be shared with other Facebook companies \"to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.\"\n However, these data sharing practices are not new, according to the company.\n Here's what has changed: WhatsApp's privacy was last updated globally in 2016. At the time, it offered WhatsApp users the ability to opt-out of sharing data with Facebook, an option that was available for only a short time. In this latest update, the reference to that now-expired opt-out option has been removed.\n \"The update does not change WhatsApp's data sharing practices with Facebook and does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company remains \"deeply committed to protecting people's privacy.\"\n In short: No additional WhatsApp user data will be shared with Facebook after accepting the new terms than was shared before. That is, unless you took advantage of the opt-out in 2016.\n WhatsApp has been trying to disspell confusion over the updated policy, including by publishing an FAQ on its privacy practices.\n While the policy isn't new, the dustup has drawn attention to WhatsApp's data sharing practices with Facebook which many people might not have read before clicking \"agree.\" That may be encouraging users to jump ship, with Signal proving to be the most popular alternative.\n Signal is another free app that provides encrypted messaging, calling and video chat. \"Encrypted\" means that the contents of messages are scrambled until they reach the recipient, and no intermediary can view them. The app is run by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which launched in 2018 with the help of WhatsApp Co-Founder Brian Acton, who left WhatsApp and Facebook the prior year.\n Acton said in a 2018 statement announcing the launch of the foundation that Signal aims to build \"sustainable technology that respects users and does not rely on the commoditization of personal data.\"\n Amid the rush of new sign-ups, Signal is rolling out new features similar to those on WhatsApp, such as wallpaper backgrounds for chats and an \"about\" section for user profiles. And a new Apple (AAPL) policy requiring that apps provide a label detailing their privacy practices on the App Store may make it easier for users to compare various messaging apps' policies.\n Signal did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the rush of new sign-ups.\n The app has received some high profile endorsements. Tesla (TSLA)'s Musk on January 7 tweeted: \"Use Signal.\" Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey retweeted it, and later posted an image of Signal at the top of the App Store chart, captioning it with a heart.\n Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden also retweeted Musk's post, adding the message: \"That's @signalapp, for those who don't speak Elon.\"\n Though their tweets didn't mention Facebook or WhatsApp, both Musk and Dorsey have previously criticized the social media giant.\n Some people were apparently confused about Musk's advice, though. Shares of Signal Advance (SIGL) \u2014 a small, Texas-based technology company unrelated to the messaging app \u2014 rose more than 6,000% in the days following Musk's tweet, before tempering on Tuesday.",

        "title": "McConnell believes impeachment push will help rid Trump from the GOP, but has not said if he will vote to convict",
        "body_text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he believes that impeaching President Donald Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.\n Another person with direct knowledge told CNN there's a reason McConnell has been silent on impeachment as other Republicans have pushed back: he's furious about last week's attack on the US Capitol by the President's supporters, even more so that Trump has shown no contrition. His silence has been deliberate as he leaves open the option of supporting impeachment.\n McConnell has made no commitments on voting to convict Trump, and wants to see the article itself before voting. It's a stark contrast to the President's first impeachment, when McConnell repeatedly spoke out against Democratic intentions to hold Trump accountable for a pressure campaign on the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his family.\n McConnell has been steadily moving his conference away from Trump for weeks. While he knows they all aren't there with him, the Kentucky Republican believes the party needs to turn the page.\n Several GOP sources said on Tuesday that if McConnell supports conviction, Trump almost certainly will be convicted by 67 senators in the impeachment trial.\n \"If Mitch is a yes, he's done,\" said one Senate GOP source who asked not to be named.\n Many Republican senators are staying quiet about whether they'll back conviction -- a sign that they, too, could support conviction in an effort to rid Trump from their party.\n The New York Times was first to report on McConnell's thoughts about impeachment.\n The President is not going to resign even if his party abandons him, sources told CNN.\n After four House Republicans said they would vote to impeach the President, a source close to Trump said there is \"no consideration of him resigning.\"\n Another senior White House adviser said, \"Resignation means admitting failure. So, no.\" This adviser said the current thinking is the Senate does not have enough time to convict Trump before he leaves office, so the President can make it to the end of his term without that kind of humiliation.\n \"We will get through the 20th and move on,\" the adviser said.\n The relationship between the Senate majority leader and the President -- the two most powerful men in the Republican Party -- has essentially collapsed, multiple sources told CNN.\n A source familiar with the relationship between the two men told CNN that McConnell is furious with Trump. The source said McConnell \"hates\" Trump for what he did last week following the attacks on the Capitol that left at least five people dead including a Capitol Hill police officer.\n Trump and McConnell still have not spoken since last Wednesday's riot, a separate source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. Another source said the two men haven't spoken since McConnell's floor speech acknowledging Biden as President-elect in December.\n McConnell couldn't get Trump on the phone when he refused to sign the stimulus bill over the Christmas week, a third source told CNN. McConnell has since told others in the wake of the stimulus circus he won't talk to Trump again.\n McConnell is also speaking with the President-elect about how the chamber should handle an impeachment trial against Trump.\n Biden is not trying to stop the impeachment proceedings, but he is trying to keep them from consuming his agenda and overshadowing the early days of his presidency. CNN has learned Biden called McConnell on Monday to discuss the possibility of \"bifurcation\" -- doing impeachment proceedings alongside confirming his nominees and approving a sweeping Covid relief package.\n The two men spoke frankly about a potential impeachment trial for Trump, people familiar with the call said, as both of them noted it would be far different from the trial they sat through in 1999 for then-President Bill Clinton.\n McConnell told Biden that the Senate parliamentarian would have to rule whether the Senate could work on legislative business other than impeachment, people familiar with the call said, adding that McConnell did not offer his own view.\n Biden raised this idea publicly on Monday as he received his second Covid-19 vaccine, saying he had been speaking with lawmakers. He did not reveal that McConnell was among them.\n The New York Times first reported the Biden-McConnell call.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Pamela Brown and Devan Cole contributed to this story.",

        "title": "It's easy for big business to dump the GOP now. Tax hikes will be the real test",
        "body_text": "The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a reckoning in the business world.\n Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and other companies announced Monday they have suspended political donations. Airbnb, Amazon (AMZN), Verizon and CNN owner AT&T vowed not to give money to the 147 Republicans who tried, unsuccessfully, to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n The steps underscore just how toxic the Trump brand has become after last week's storming of the US Capitol. Democracy is literally under attack -- and that's not good for business.\n But the real test will come when Democrats, suddenly backed by a narrow majority in the US Senate, push raising corporate tax rates and introduce new regulation.\n Companies that have raced to the sidelines may feel compelled to turn the spigots back on to influence major legislation that impacts their bottom lines. And that may include donating to some Republicans who objected to the Electoral College votes but also object to higher taxes and more red tape.\n \"Corporate executives are genuinely appalled. Last week changed everything,\" said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments. \"Many business leaders felt a need to shame the Republicans who refused to accept the election results.\"\n Valliere predicted that Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, who led the Senate effort to overturn the election, will be \"pariahs for the rest of their careers.\"\n However, the debate is likely to shift later this year to how to pay for the trillions of dollars of new spending Biden is proposing to repair the US economy. And that may include a modest increase in the corporate tax rate -- a step that would eat into corporate profits and share prices.\n \"Republicans for decades have been anti-tax and anti-regulation,\" said Valliere. \"Corporate America will be very reluctant to give money to Cruz and Hawley, but other Republicans who are not identified with this will do okay.\"\n The 147 Republican lawmakers who objected to the Electoral College results have raised millions from Political Action Committees (PACs) directed by major companies and business groups.\n For example, during the 2020 election cycle the American Bankers Association and the National Association of Realtors donated about $1.3 million apiece to those Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.\n In a statement, the ABA called the riot on Capitol Hill \"nothing short of an assault on our democracy.\" The ABA said it regularly reviews its political activities after elections and the review this time will \"certainly\" consider the \"troubling events of the last week.\" A spokesman said the ABA will not make any political contributions until its review takes place.\n Other major donors to the 147 Republicans include Koch Industries, AT&T, Comcast and UPS, according to OpenSecrets.\n AT&T (T) said in a statement on Monday that its federal PAC board decided to suspend contributions to lawmakers who voted to object to the certification of the Electoral College votes.\n NBC owner Comcast (CMCSA) said it is doing the same and called the rioting at the US Capitol \"appalling.\"\n UPS (UPS) said it has suspended all campaign contributions \"for now,\" suggesting that it will start spending again at some point.\n \"It is incredibly difficult to envision the nation's largest corporations maintaining a campaign contribution hiatus once Congress begins advancing structural reform packages relating to taxes, infrastructure, and beyond,\" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, told CNN Business in an email.\n Boltansky predicted that the 147 Republicans \"will struggle with corporate fundraising for the foreseeable future,\" but added that the \"campaign finance machine will back into gear later this year for everyone else.\"\n Beyond campaign donations, some major banks are severing their ties with Trump.\n Deutsche Bank (DB) will no longer do business with Trump, a step that will cut off his business from a major source of loans. Signature Bank said Monday it had started closing Trump's personal accounts -- and called for the president to resign. The lender also said it \"will not do business in the future with any member of Congress who voted to disregard the Electoral College.\"\n In many ways, the business world's divorce from President Donald Trump -- and his allies -- is an example of CEOs providing moral leadership.\n Even though companies want to keep tax rates low and regulation light, they are clearly uncomfortable with Trump's attacks on democracy.\n \"This is not the capital gains tax. People died,\" said Valliere of AGF Investments.\n Corporate America didn't back Trump when he ran for office in 2016. But business groups enthusiastically embraced the Trump agenda after he won the White House. They were especially excited about Trump's tax cuts, deregulation and appointments of pro-business judges.\n But the tenuous relationship broke down because of Trump's stances on climate, immigration and race. CEOs scrambled to quit Trump's advisory councils in August 2017 after Trump initially failed to condemn white supremacists at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n Yet critics say the decision to dump Trump is politically convenient now -- and only comes after years of enabling him. Big business already got the deregulation, tax cuts and pro-business judges it wanted. And the public is outraged over the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of the Value Alliance, a firm that advises boards on corporate governance practices, said it's critical that companies institute policies and practices to make sure they don't \"fall into the same trap again.\"\n That means companies and business groups must ensure that their political spending matches up with their publicly stated values -- and that those values are reflective of the ones held by their employees and customers.\n Bloxham said it remains an open question whether the insurrection at the Capitol delivered a lasting lesson to corporate America, or merely a fleeting one.\n \"We're a nation that forgets too easily sometimes,\" she said.",

        "title": "Mississippi ratifies and raises its new state flag over the state Capitol for the first time",
        "body_text": "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves on Monday ratified the new state flag, and Mississippi flew its new banner over the state Capitol for the first time, months after the state retired its decades-old flag that displayed a Confederate battle emblem.\n The moment was historic for the southern state that had been the last in the nation whose flag featured the Confederate battle insignia, and emotional for advocates who fought for years to change it.\n The new \"In God We Trust\" state flag, featuring a magnolia flower and stars, was approved by 73% of Mississippi voters in the November election.\n \"Today, we turn the page. We commit our former flag to history, and we commit ourselves to the business of the future. It is one small effort to unify, but it is done in good faith,\" Reeves, a Republican, said in remarks prior to ratifying the new state flag.\n \"In Mississippi, there has been a prominent roadblock to unity. When many look at our former flag, they just saw a symbol of the state and heritage they loved. But many felt dismissed because of that flag. That is not a firm foundation for our state.\"\n Reeves and other Mississippi leaders later gathered on the steps of the state Capitol to watch their new state flag be hoisted ceremoniously above the seat of the state's government.\n It was a contrasting moment just days after a Confederate flag, a divisive symbol of slavery and white supremacy, had been carried in the halls of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, for the first time during last week's insurrection.\n In prayer Monday after the flag was raised, Reeves noted that it's \"a time of divisiveness in our country,\" but added that \"we are united in our state on a path forward.\"\n This past summer, the sentiment toward the old Mississippi flag appeared to shift amid racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minneapolis police custody. Protests over Floyd's death reignited the debate over the nation's remaining Confederate monuments and symbols, including Mississippi's state flag.\n Amid the protests, Mississippi state lawmakers passed a historic referendum to retire and replace the flag with a new design that \"shall honor the past while embracing the promise of the future.\" The bill established a commission to select a new design that would exclude the Confederate battle emblem and include the phrase \"In God We Trust.\"\n In September, the commission selected the magnolia flag as the design Mississippi voters would consider on the November ballot.\n During the flag raising ceremony Monday, state House Speaker Philip Gunn, a Republican, spoke of what motivated some hesitant lawmakers to ultimately vote to change the flag.\n \"It was their families. It was knowing that history was going to record what they did and they did not want their spouses, or their children, or their grandchildren to be disappointed in them. They wanted their children and grandchildren to be proud of them, the future generations of this state to be proud of what they did,\" he said.\n The old Mississippi state flag, adopted in 1894, flew for the last time on July 1, before it was officially retired and brought to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.\n The new state flag features a magnolia flower, a symbol of hospitality, surrounded by 20 stars, signifying Mississippi's status as the 20th state in the union, and a gold five-point star to reflect Mississippi's indigenous Native American tribes.\n CNN's Kelly Mena and Kay Jones contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Hong Kong's new chief justice has vowed to uphold the city's judicial independence. Can he?",
        "body_text": "The ceremonial beginning to Hong Kong's new legal year took place, as everything does these days, over video.\n Sat in the city's Court of Final Appeal, wearing a black robe, ruffed white collar and white face mask, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung acknowledged the strangeness of the circumstances as he addressed a small audience of judicial officials and others watching online.\n \"The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a great toll everywhere,\" Cheung said. \"The judiciary and its operations have also been affected, and thanks must be extended to our judiciary staff who have worked so hard in such difficult circumstances to keep the courts functioning.\"\n But Cheung, who was sworn in as Hong Kong's new top judge on Monday, will face far more challenges than just the coronavirus. He takes office amid an unprecedented challenge to the city's rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, in the wake of anti-government protests in 2019 and the subsequent national security law imposed on the city by Beijing last year.\n That law criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, and carries with it a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\n Such vague parameters have provided authorities with sweeping powers to crack down on government opponents as Beijing continues to tighten its control over the purportedly semi-autonomous city. Hong Kong officials had previously promised that the law would be limited in effect, and only target a small number of fringe activists. However, critics allege that since its introduction, the law has been used to forcefully stamp out the city's formerly vibrant pro-democracy movement.\n Last week, 53 opposition activists, many of them former lawmakers, were arrested under the law, accused of subversion for taking part in a primary poll designed to choose candidate for legislative elections last year -- elections that were subsequently postponed due to the pandemic.\n All but one of those arrested have since been bailed. But their cases, along with the other dozen or so people arrested under the law, will consume much of the courts' focus in the coming year. Close attention will be paid to how the courts apply the sweeping and so far largely untested law, which was directly imposed by Beijing, bypassing Hong Kong's semi-democratic legislature, and contains clauses which may conflict with existing constitutional and treaty protections for speech and assembly.\n With both the legislature and the administration in lockstep with Beijing, the courts are the one branch of government which retains some degree of autonomy -- but one which may be sorely tested by the blunt instrument of the security law.\n In his speech, and in a press conference afterward, Cheung avoided discussing the specifics of the law, arguing that to do so was inappropriate, given it will soon be discussed in court. But he came back to one key point again and again.\n \"It is my mission to do my utmost to uphold the independence and impartiality of the Hong Kong judiciary,\" Cheung told reporters. \"That is my mission, and I will do my best to fulfill that mission.\"\n Such independence may be sorely tested in the coming year, and if lost could have great costs for Hong Kong's legal system and fundamental freedoms. In a speech following Cheung's, Philip Dykes, head of the city's Bar Association, noted that \"without judicial independence, a pearl of great price, we might as well pack up our bags and steal away, for Hong Kong is nothing without it.\"\n Throughout its century-and-a-half as a British colony, the rule of law -- equality before the courts, due process, and the presumption of innocence -- came to be seen as the city's \"defining ideology,\" one that helped Hong Kong become a global financial capital, a safe harbor for businesses to choose as their Asian headquarters confident that their rights would be protected, in contrast to the often arbitrary exercise of justice elsewhere in the region.\n When Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the city's new rulers, keen not to disrupt their economic dynamo, were careful to pay lip service to the importance of the rule of law and independent judiciary to Hong Kong's continued success under the principle known as \"one country, two systems.\"\n Hong Kong's legal system did not always have the stellar reputation it now boasts. When the British established their colony on the newly seized territory in 1842, they gave little thought to how the crown's new Chinese subjects would access justice.\n \"In colonial Hong Kong, racial bigotry and prejudice added to the social injustice inherent in the strong class division in Victorian Britain, and they were reflected in the working of the courts,\" writes Steve Tsang in \"A Modern History of Hong Kong: 1841-1997.\" The language of the courts was English, and interpreters were rarely provided -- meaning many Chinese defendants were unaware of what was going on as they were railroaded by an unfamiliar legal system and unsympathetic judges.\n However, Tsang notes that even in the early years, when discrimination was rife, the \"rule of law determined the structure and procedures of the legal system, restrained some governors from pursuing certain policies harmful to the local community and helped to secure the acquittal of many wrongly accused.\"\n Post-1997, the rule of law also helped limit the city's new rulers. Thanks to its strong protections for speech and assembly, Hong Kong retained a vibrant political and media scene unlike anything seen in China, with annual demonstrations -- such as the June 4 memorial for the Tiananmen Square massacre -- iconic of these freedoms.\n But the conflict between the country and the two systems it contains has grown over time, reaching breaking point in recent years.\n China's legal system stands in stark contrast to Hong Kong's, being highly politicized and almost completely controlled by the ruling Communist Party. In criminal cases, some 99% of prosecutions end in a guilty verdict, and sentences can often be wildly inconsistent, depending on political circumstances, even when the facts of the case are similar. In civil matters, companies and defendants cannot be confident the courts will protect their rights if they conflict with the wider political or economic goals of the Chinese state.\n The prospect of being subject to Chinese justice, through an extradition bill with the mainland, sparked the anti-government unrest that rocked Hong Kong in 2019. Yet while the protests were successful in defeating the proposed legislation, they also prompted the eventual imposition of the national security law last year, creating a number of political crimes and undermining protections contained within Basic Law, Hong Kong's de facto constitution, while also creating the possibility for defendants to be transferred to China for trial in some circumstances.\n Such a broad and sweeping law would pose a challenge for the courts to interpret in the best of times, but the security legislation has been accompanied by a climate of immense pressure on the judiciary to deliver harsh sentences to protesters and other dissidents, similar to how cases are handled in China.\n Judges seen as overly lenient or sympathetic toward protesters have been attacked in Chinese state media and pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong. Writing in the state-run China Daily late last year, one commentator said that \"in theory, judges must not take political sides in a court of law, but in Hong Kong many members of the public now see some judges as 'yellow judges' who practice political favoritism for offenders from the opposition camp.\"\n In November, Zhang Xiaoming, one of the top Chinese officials in Hong Kong, said \"reforms\" were needed for the city's judiciary, and \"the word 'patriotism' should be added before the core values \u200b\u200bof democracy, freedom and human rights advocated by Hong Kong society.\"\n \"We must defend the city's rule of law, but we must also safeguard the national constitutional order,\" Zhang said, adding that many \"problems\" had been exposed in Basic Law that needed to be addressed.\n In his comments this week, Cheung, the new chief justice, appeared to address these controversies, noting that in certain cases, judges have \"come under intense scrutiny\" and been subject to \"partisan criticisms.\"\n \"Whilst the freedom of speech of everyone in society must be fully respected, there must not be any attempt to exert improper pressure on the judges in the discharge of their judicial functions,\" Cheung said. \"Judges must be fearless and be prepared to make decisions in accordance with the law, regardless of whether the outcomes are popular or unpopular, or whether the outcomes would render themselves popular or unpopular.\"\n But what exactly the law means may be a moving target as Beijing takes a more hands-on approach to Hong Kong's legal system.\n Under the Basic Law, while Hong Kong has a \"Court of Final Appeal,\" the true arbiter of the city's constitution is China's National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, which can issue \"interpretations\" of various articles of the Basic Law -- essentially rewriting it on the fly.\n In the past, this power was rarely used, but it has been exercised more and more in recent years. Observers have expressed concern that, should Hong Kong courts apply the national security law more leniently than Beijing would want, the national government may step in to force them to do otherwise.\n \"Respect for autonomy and Hong Kong's authority to discharge its duties under the new law requires the (National People's Congress) to exercise restraint in its power of interpretation,\" wrote Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, when the law was first promulgated. \"Excessive intervention will destroy the separate systems model and cause great legal instability.\"\n But comments made by Zhang and other officials, such as declaring that there exists no \"separation of powers\" in Hong Kong, suggest a central government unwilling to sit by and let the city's courts decide as they please.\n And responding to a question about such interventions by the central government, Cheung acknowledged there was little Hong Kong judges could do. \"When there is an interpretation, the court must follow,\" he said.\n In an interview this week, Young noted that the \"central and local governments have full confidence in the new Chief Justice,\" which could preclude a barrage of interventions in the near future.\n \"The first batch of (security law) cases to proceed to the courts will be seen by all as test cases to see the true width and limits of the law,\" he said. \"My prediction is that there will not be any direct interference from (Beijing) to influence or change the results of these cases.\"\n Tsang, the Hong Kong historian and director the SOAS China Institute in London, disagreed, however, predicting the Chief Justice \"will come under enormous pressure\" in coming years.\n \"(This) will be extremely difficult for the Chief Justice to resist over the long term, which means that the erosion of judicial independence is unfolding, and unless there is a change of government in Beijing unlikely to relent,\" he said.\n In his final address this month, Cheung's predecessor, Geoffrey Ma, urged him \"always to be guided by your principles, for it is these principles that will see you and the community through all seasons.\"\n But Tsang said Cheung, in accepting this role, may have put himself in an impossible position.\n \"The efforts to protect Hong Kong's judicial independence is now a rearguard operation, and the determination of the Chief Justice to stand fast or not will only determine the pace of this process,\" Tsang said. \"He is unlikely to be able to hold the line beyond the short-term however determined he may be.\"\n CNN's Eric Cheung contributed reporting.",

        "body_text": "Government officials balked when the Census Bureau set a last-minute deadline to assemble data on non-citizens as part of an apparent anti-immigration push by the Trump administration before leaving office, according to a new watchdog report.\n The Commerce Department's inspector general, overseeing the 2020 Census, revealed on Tuesday that Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham told employees that a non-citizen tally is \"a number one priority\" and is due to him this Friday.\n The memorandum from Inspector General Peggy Gustafson outlines the claims made to her by whistleblowers and says Census employees raised internal objections to the plan.\n \"Career employees informed us that they are under significant pressure to produce this technical report,\" the memorandum says. \"Bureau officials are concerned that incomplete data could be misinterpreted, misused, or otherwise tarnish the Bureau's reputation.\"\n In light of the complaints, she said, it is unclear whether Dillingham may have backed down from the urgent timeline and that the \"deadline may no longer be in effect.\"\n The request is a surprise because Census officials have signaled the population numbers used to divide seats in Congress between the states will not be finalized until after Trump leaves office.\n That means the numbers will include undocumented immigrants, because incoming President-elect Joe Biden has rejected Trump's push to exclude them.\n But the directive may be an attempt to force the Biden administration to do it anyway.\n The Supreme Court has blocked lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's plan to exclude non-citizens, but there is a long-simmering lawsuit in an Alabama federal courthouse arguing it is unjust to include non-citizens when apportioning political power in Congress and the Electoral College. If the Trump administration compiles a non-citizen tally before leaving office, that lawsuit could find new life and challenge the Biden policy of including undocumented immigrants in the final count.\n The IG memorandum asks Dillingham to explain his reasoning for compiling the data.\n CNN has asked the Census Bureau for comment on the memo and its timeline for producing the population figures.\n Dillingham, a Trump appointee, is scheduled to serve into the Biden administration. His term ends December 31, 2021, but it is possible the incoming President could ask him to step down earlier.\n Trump visited the border region on Tuesday and in late December, extended restrictions on immigration.",

        "title": "How key states plan to secure their capitol buildings ahead of possible armed pro-Trump protests",
        "body_text": "States across the country are increasing security at their capitol buildings ahead of what the FBI has warned are \"armed protests\" being planned at all 50 state capitols.\n An internal FBI bulletin obtained by CNN warns that armed protests are being planned at state capitols from Saturday through at least Inauguration Day next Wednesday. The bulletin suggests there are threats of an \"uprising\" if President Donald Trump is removed before then.\n Complicating the concern is that the FBI's bulletin was not publicly released but was leaked to reporters. Until Tuesday, federal law enforcement had yet to hold a press conference detailing the Capitol attack since the day it happened.\n And the purge of Twitter and Facebook accounts promoting violent protests has made it difficult for the public to understand the extent of the issue.\n The startling warning, just days after a pro-Trump mob forcibly took over the US Capitol, is pushing states to increase security in case of a similar such attack at their capitols. Although many are closed due to coronavirus restrictions, the warnings are particularly fraught in states that allow people to openly carry firearms or those where Trump has falsely claimed fraud.\n Here's a look at how a number of states are preparing:\n In Michigan, the state's Capitol Commission banned the open carry of firearms inside the Capitol building in Lansing starting Monday.\n The move was a response to the US Capitol riot as well as the spring incidents in which heavily armed demonstrators jammed inside the state Capitol to protest pandemic-related lockdowns. In addition, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, was the target in an alleged domestic terror plot by members of right wing militia groups.\n However, the policy change only affects public areas inside the building and does not change policy on the Capitol grounds, nor does it prohibit licensed concealed pistol carry that follows state laws, according to the commission policy.\n \"The Capitol Commission's action to ban open carry guns at the Capitol is a good start, but more action is needed,\" Whitmer said in a statement Monday.\n Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel warned that the commission's rule does not mean the Capitol is safe.\n \"My job is not to provide state employees & residents or other visitors to our Capitol with a false sense of security, especially given the current state of affairs in Michigan and around the nation,\" she said in a tweet. \"I repeat-the Michigan Capitol is not safe.\"\n Nessel told CNN's Erin Burnett that lawmakers are \"sitting ducks.\"\n \"I'm exceedingly worried,\" she told CNN. \"I think you could certainly say that Michigan is ground zero for those who are wishing to take over a state government.\n Shanon Banner, spokesperson for Michigan State Police, said they are aware of the march on state capitols being promoted online, and they will continue watching for security threats.\n \"Our security planning is fluid and adjustments are made as needed, from day-to-day,\" Banner said. \"Security enhancements that can be put in place include both seen and unseen measures. In general, we don't discuss security measures, but I can confirm that out of an abundance of caution, we are increasing our visible presence at the Capitol for the next couple of weeks starting today.\"\n Lansing Mayor Andy Schor also asked Gov. Whitmer to activate the Michigan National Guard to provide additional security and crowd control measures around the state Capitol on Sunday and on Inauguration Day.\n \"Last week's horrific scene on Capitol Hill was an attack on our democracy and shows that we need to be adequately prepared for acts of violence as President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in as our 46th President of the United States.\"\n Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has authorized the state National Guard to support Capitol Police in Madison, the governor's office said in a news release Monday.\n \"Members of the Wisconsin National Guard will mobilize to state active duty to support safety and security efforts at the State Capitol in Madison,\" read the release. \"The Wisconsin National Guard will serve in a support role to local authorities and conduct a site security mission.\"\n According to the release, the troops are trained to respond to requests for assistance on short notice and are part of the Wisconsin National Guard Reaction Force.\n \"The mobilized troops will serve in a State Active Duty status in support of the Capitol Police. To protect operational security, the Wisconsin National Guard will not discuss troop numbers, movements, timelines, equipment, tactics, or procedures.\"\n In addition, first-floor windows at the Capitol in Madison were boarded up on Monday ahead of potential protests.\n A spokeswoman for Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said they were aware of the planned protests but noted that the state's Capitol Complex in Harrisburg has been closed to the public since December because of the pandemic.\n \"The Capitol Police will continue to work with state and local law enforcement to maintain peace at the Capitol Complex in Harrisburg,\" press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger said.\n Wolf said Thursday that about 1,000 Pennsylvania National Guard members have been activated to support the DC National Guard in support of civilian authorities in Washington, DC. The Pennsylvania National Guard has about 19,000 members in all.\n \"Pennsylvania Guard members are well-trained and well-prepared to assist our communities, commonwealth and country in any way they can,\" said acting Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Mark Schindler. \"We are also very fortunate that our Guard members have extensive experience working alongside the DC National Guard as part of past training events and presidential inaugurations.\"\n On Tuesday, Wolf said they \"have not heard anything specifically\" about protests but are \"ready for anything that might happen.\"\n Georgia's state Capitol in Atlanta has already seen protests that raised security concerns. Last week, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was helped out of the Capitol as a precaution as a small group of pro-Trump protesters gathered outside, according to CNN affiliate WXIA.\n The state began its 2021 legislative session on Monday with heightened security around the building, including a new fence and armed guards.\n The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said it is aware of the reports of possible armed protests in the coming days.\n \"We are in communication with our partners and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure safety and security,\" GBI Public Affairs Director Nelly Miles said.\n Atlanta Police said they, too, are working with their partners on security.\n \"The City of Atlanta Police Department (APD) continues to coordinate with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to respond should protests or illegal activity occur. If activity begins to occur, APD is prepared to respond quickly. We do not share operational or security plans. However, the safety and security of our city and citizens is our priority,\" police said.\n Richmond, Virginia, is expecting a large gathering Monday for \"Lobby Day,\" an annual protest event that last year brought thousands of gun rights advocates to the Capitol. That gathering had spurred fears of violence and led to a significant police presence, and the protest was ultimately peaceful.\n This year, in anticipation of protests over the next week, a state of emergency was declared in Richmond. The Richmond City Council voted Monday evening to adopt a resolution that allows Mayor Levar Stoney to use a state law that lets him tap into state resources to help with security.\n Virginia's Capitol Square in Richmond will be closed for at least a week starting Thursday, in preparation for possible \"civil unrest\" around the city, the Department of General Services (DGS) said in a statement.\n The \"precautionary measures\" include closing the Capitol Square, installing fencing and fortifying buildings in and adjacent to the square, the department said. Access to DGS-controlled buildings will be restricted from Saturday through Thursday, they added.\n In Florida, President of the Senate Wilton Simpson asked Capitol staff and lawmakers to work remotely on Sunday because it is \"very likely\" there will be protesters in Tallahassee that day.\n The letter, sent to Florida senators and obtained by CNN, says law enforcement has made \"significant enhancements\" to the Senate's physical security that will remain confidential.\n \"I want you all to know that security, as it relates to both the health and safety of our professional staff, our Senators, and visitors is my top priority,\" Simpson wrote.\n \"At this time, it is our understanding that our Capitol remains secure and there have been no threats to our safety,\" he added.\n Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state will respond quickly to any issues but declined to provide specific security plans.\n \"If anything is disorderly, we are going to act very quickly. Don't worry about that,\" DeSantis said.\n CNN's Amanda Watts, Zachary Cohen, Whitney Wild, Lauren del Valle, Caroline Kelly, Rob Frehse, Taylor Romine, Raja Razek, Alec Snyder, Jason Morris, Elizabeth Hartfield, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "We're two days into this year's virtual Consumer Electronics Show, and we've already seen big tech announcements from companies like LG, Razer, and even Yves Saint-Laurent and L'Oreal. From a \"rollable\" smartphone and transparent TVs to a $299 lipstick mixer, here are the highlights from the tech trade show so far.\n If you missed it, we covered Day One of pandemic-proof tech gadgets here, and what to expect at this year's unusual tech trade show here.\n Increasingly, we're seeing the category of home entertainment intersect with work-from-home technology.\n Also getting buzz in the home-office space: phones, TVs, desktops and watches.\n Even though we're still years away from 8K resolution being mainstream, TV manufacturers are doubling down on the ultra-high-resolution technology.\n TCL, known for value products, announced a full lineup of smart Roku TVs that support 8K. There's no word on pricing yet, but if TCL can make its new lineup more affordable than the $2,000 to $50,000 that 8K TVs have so far gone for, that could help push content creators and game makers to adopt 8K as well.\n TVs are also going see-through in 2021. LG revealed a transparent 55-inch TV on Monday that resembles a sheet of glass. It's a trend that's picking up among TV makers like Xiaomi and Panasonic, though early products are still expensive and rare. LG did not announce pricing and didn't say if the product will be commercially available.\n Samsung will release more phone news later this week, when it announces its Galaxy S21 lineup.\n Sony also announced a new drone brand called Airpeak, aimed at professional photographers and videographers. It's coming this spring.\n Some of the best parts of CES each year are its kooky gadgets for lifestyle and beauty. This year, ColdSnap has a product that serves up ice cream in a pod, and L'Oreal has a $299 lipstick mixer called Perso that uses artificial intelligence to identify color and mixes it at home for you.\n Perso uses three lipstick cartridges (purchased separately for an additional $100) and works with an iOS and Android app. It previously debuted at CES in 2020 but the news this year is that it's launching this quarter, and instead of the skincare solution it was supposed to be, Perso pivoted to lipstick, a less saturated market.\n L'Oreal is also touting a showerhead that it says saves 80% more water at the hair salon by by shrinking the droplets to be more efficient. Salons can attach this showerhead to their pre-existing systems and use it to save water and to produce \"cloud foam\" out of their shampoo, conditioner and powder products.\n Of course, not everyone is wearing lipstick and going to the salon amid the pandemic. \"We are also building solutions at home, with a goal to create sustainable tech anywhere consumers use our haircare products,\" said L'Oreal Tech Incubator global vice president Guive Balooch. \"People are celebrating more milestones and occasions at home, and wearing lipstick remains to be a beauty ritual that makes them feel good.\"\n What is pandemic-friendly is a new face mask from Razer.\n Razer, known for its colorful gaming accessories, announced a concept design on Tuesday for an N95 face mask, which caught attention on social media for its glowing lighting effects -- it can flash different colors and vent air out. It also includes a disinfecting UV-light. The company also debuted a gaming chair concept.\n For now, the two products are just ideas that Razer is considering for community feedback, and it hasn't announced any plans to bring them to market.",

In December 2019, also in North Carolina, a live grenade was found inside a donated dresser at the Habitat ReStore in Durham.\n The volunteer who found it removed it from the building and law enforcement was called.

        "body_text": "The Voice of America has effectively demoted a reporter who tried to ask questions of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after he delivered a speech praising American freedoms and condemning repressive regimes such as China and Iran.\n Patsy Widakuswara, who covers the White House, was reassigned on Monday hours after trying to engage with Pompeo, who also stayed for a Q&A with VOA Director Robert Reilly in which no audience questions were permitted and the Secretary was allowed to tout administration policies unchecked. When Pompeo refused to respond to her, Widakuswara turned to Reilly and asked why he hadn't presented the Secretary with any VOA reporters' questions, according to people present who spoke to CNN.\n \"Who are you,\" Reilly asked, according to people present in the crowd around them and a contemporaneous audio recording. \"I'm the White House correspondent for VOA,\" Widakuswara answered. Reilly responded with a reprimand: \"You obviously don't know how to behave.\"\n The White House Correspondents Association condemned Widakuswara's reassignment, which sources at VOA say was made without explanation just hours after Pompeo's speech and comes amid an assault on US democracy by supporters of President Donald Trump who besieged the Capitol on January 6, leaving five dead. On Wednesday, she was reassigned for a second time, again without explanation and this time, without direct notification.\n \"At a moment when the world already has watched an assault on our democratic institutions, the Trump administration has chosen to send another message -- with an assault on the First Amendment,\" said Zeke Miller, president of the WHCA, who spoke on behalf of the organization's board.\n \"It did so at the Voice of America, a taxpayer-supported service tasked by Congress with broadcasting uncensored journalism to the world to demonstrate freedoms -- particularly freedom of the press -- that the United States hopes all nations will emulate,\" Miller continued. \"VOA's reassignment of Patsy Widakuswara for doing her job, asking questions, is an affront to the very ideals Secretary of State Pompeo discussed in his speech Monday.\"\n The top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a joint statement that they \"were incredibly frustrated to hear the Voice of America White House senior correspondent Patsy Widakuswara was demoted from her position after questioning Secretary Pompeo about last week's attack on the Capitol.\"\n \"Absent a legitimate reason for this move, which has not been provided, we believe she should be reinstated,\" said Chairman Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat, and ranking member Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican.\n \"This is the United States of America -- we do not punish our journalists for seeking answers to their questions. A free and fair press is at the core of our Constitution and our democracy,\" the lawmakers said.\n According to a statement, the committee reached out to VOA and its parent agency, the US Agency for Global Media about the news, \"but has received no information as to why Widakuswara was demoted.\"\n Widakuswara declined to comment for this story. A VOA spokesperson told CNN they do not comment on internal personnel matters. Asked whether Pompeo had comment on Widakuswara's reassignment or had requested it, the State Department referred questions to VOA and USAGM.\n In contrast, last year Pompeo berated China for seeking to silence US journalists in Hong Kong.\n \"It has recently come to my attention that the Chinese government has threatened to interfere with the work of American journalists in Hong Kong,\" Pompeo said at the time. \"These journalists are members of a free press, not propaganda cadres, and their valuable reporting informs Chinese citizens and the world.\"\n The controversy is just the latest clash between members of the press and the Secretary, who is known to berate reporters, and particularly women, for asking questions he dislikes, sometimes using expletives, as he did with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly.\n Widakuswara's effective demotion and Pompeo's use of VOA airwaves to broadcast his speech worldwide in 40 languages are just the latest signs of trouble at VOA and USAGM, where the Trump appointed director Michael Pack has made sweeping charges of bias against employees and conducted what some call a pro-Trump \"purge.\"\n The Government Accountability Project said in a January 8 letter that the speech contravened the statutory firewall that protects VOA journalists and editors from outside political meddling, describing it as \"a violation of law, rule and policy.\"\n VOA staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity told CNN they are angry, saying that in their view, Pompeo and VOA leadership violated the agency's journalistic integrity. More than one expressed disgust for the Secretary's use of VOA and the reporters in the audience \"as a propaganda prop\" for the speech and Q&A.\n One source at VOA said their biggest disappointment was Reilly's failure to defend the institution after Pompeo's diminished it in his speech, describing VOA as \"demeaning America\" in the past and now suffering from a culture of \"censorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction -- authoritarianism, cloaked as moral righteousness.\"\n \"VOA did not fail yesterday; our director failed,\" this source said.\n Pompeo asserted that it was \"morally wrong\" for the VOA staff to object to his speech, which staffers say was arranged by Elizabeth Robbins, a recent transplant from the State Department who was named VOA deputy director in late December despite having no journalism experience.\n Pack, a documentary filmmaker who took charge as CEO in June and is under criminal investigation by the DC attorney general for self-dealing and self-enrichment, appointed Reilly, a former VOA director and conservative writer, to lead the VOA in December.\n After Reilly told his White House reporter she didn't know how to behave, sources in the crowd in front of VOA's auditorium said Widakuswara told him that, \"there are so many questions that we want to know, and you didn't ask them.\"\n Reilly told her, \"you are not authorized,\" to which Widakuswara responded that, \"I am a journalist and I'm paid to ask questions, and none of those questions you asked.\"\n \"You're out of order!\" Reilly said, before Robbins stepped in, saying, \"OK we're done. Thank you.\"\n Since Pack's arrival at USAGM, he \"has attempted to whitewash the primacy of the journalistic mission: both figurative and literally,\" said David Kligerman, the former general counsel at VOA until he was allegedly forced out by Pack last month. \"On his first day, he painted over an epigraph (by his predecessor John Lansing) celebrating the First Amendment and the sacred duty of journalists to hold public officials accountable.\"\n Kligerman said on the record what many others at VOA echo privately -- that Pack has since \"waged war against the Agency's journalists and editorial independence,\" including by firing all the network heads and rescinding the agency's firewall regulation meant to insulate it from political meddling, refusing \"to renew J1 visas for our journalists for purely nativist reasons, forcing them out of the country; and pretextually firing journalists for covering stories perceived to be harmful to the administration.\"",

Within minutes, lawmakers were being evacuated out of the chambers as rioters advanced through the heart of American democracy -- spurred by the same rhetoric Gosar and some of his fellow Republicans had espoused.\n The first part of Gosar's prediction, at least, had come true: Capitol Hill had been conquered.\n The insurrection last week that left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer, has spurred a new move to impeach President Donald Trump and a wave of criticism for the most prominent senators who voted to block President-elect Joe Biden's victory. But Gosar and several other of his GOP colleagues in the House are also facing new scrutiny for their incendiary language in the hours, days and weeks before the siege.\n One of the top organizers of the movement that aimed to overturn the election results has claimed he worked closely with Republican congressmen. Ali Alexander, a leader of the \"Stop the Steal\" group, said in several Periscope livestream videos last month that he planned the rally that preceded the riot in conjunction with Gosar and two other congressional Republicans, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona, as CNN first reported last week.\n \"We're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event,\" Alexander said in one video in December. \"It was to build momentum and pressure and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congress peoples who weren't yet decided or saw everyone outside and said, 'I can't be on the other side of that mob.'\"\n Brooks, a staunch conservative and one of Trump's closest congressional allies, was one of the first speakers at the National Mall rally that preceded the riot, and his fiery language helped set the tone for what came next.\n \"Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass!\" the six-term Republican shouted to the assembled protesters. \"Our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives... Are you willing to do the same?\"\n Hours later, when some of the same people Brooks had spoken to were smashing windows at the US Capitol, the lawmaker livetweeted as he and his colleagues were being evacuated from the House chambers.\n \"Tear gas dispersed in Capitol Rotunda,\" Brooks wrote in a tweet posted from his iPad. \"Congressmen ordered to grab gas masks under chairs in case have to leave in haste!\"\n Brooks was the first member of Congress to say publicly that he would object to the certification of the electoral votes for Biden. The day before the Jan. 6 rally, he tweeted that Trump had \"asked me personally to speak & tell the American people about the election system weaknesses that the Socialist Democrats exploited to steal this election.\"\n After the insurrection, while Brooks condemned rioters and called for them to be \"prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" he has also repeatedly suggested on social media and in interviews that at least some of the people who stormed the Capitol were members of the left-wing group Antifa -- a baseless claim that has been widely debunked.\n Like Trump, who said Tuesday that his remarks at the rally, when he urged supporters to \"fight like hell,\" were \"totally appropriate,\" Brooks has denied responsibility for the riot, telling a radio show host the day after the attack that he \"absolutely\" had no regrets.\n He later argued in a statement Tuesday that his remarks could not have been the cause of the violence. \"No one at the rally interpreted my remarks to be anything other than what they were: A pep talk after the derriere kicking conservatives suffered in the dismal 2020 elections,\" Brooks wrote.\n Gosar has closely associated himself with the Stop the Steal movement for months. He tagged or replied to Alexander in more than two dozen tweets since Election Day, sharing false rumors about mysteriously appearing ballots and deleted vote counts, and spoke at the December 19 rally at the Arizona state capitol that Alexander organized. He penned an online open letter last month titled \"Are We Witnessing a Coup d'etat?\"\n \"Biden should concede,\" Gosar tweeted on the morning of last week's congressional vote, sharing a photo of the pro-Trump protesters gathered in front of the Washington Monument. \"I want his concession on my desk tomorrow morning. Don't make me come over there.\"\n As the insurrection was still going on, Gosar shared divergent messages about the rioters. In one tweet with a photo of people scaling the walls of the Capitol, Gosar wrote \"let's not get carried away here,\" adding that \"if anyone on the ground reads this and is beyond the line come back.\" But on the right-wing social media network Parler, which has since gone offline, Gosar posted the same image with a different caption: \"Americans are upset.\"\n Even Gosar's family members say his language has gone too far. Several of his siblings -- who recorded a viral campaign ad for one of his opponents in 2018 -- have argued he should resign or be removed.\n \"My brother swore an oath to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic,\" the congressman's younger brother Tim Gosar, a private investigator in Fort Collins, Colorado, told CNN this week. \"And he has blatantly broken that oath.\"\n Gosar's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n At the Arizona Stop the Steal rally with Gosar, Alexander played a video that he said Biggs, the chair of the conservative Freedom Caucus, had sent for the crowd.\n \"Andy Biggs here,\" the Arizona congressman said in the recording. \"I wish I could be with you. I'm in the DC swamp fighting on behalf of Arizona's residents and freedom fighters all over the country.\" The crowd responded with a chant of \"Biggs! Biggs! Biggs!\" The Arizona Republic first reported the video on Monday.\n A Biggs spokesperson told CNN that the congressman recorded the video at the request of Gosar's staff, and had never worked with Alexander.\n \"Congressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point -- let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest,\" the spokesperson said. \"He did not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests.\"\n Biggs was one of several Republican members of Congress who refused to wear masks in a secure room where lawmakers were staying during the riot, according to a video posted by the congressional news site Punchbowl. Several Democratic members have said in recent days that they tested positive for Covid after being in the room.\n Other congressional Republicans also painted their efforts to oppose Biden's victory in sweeping, historic terms. In the days before the riot, Freshman Reps. Laura Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia both called the Wednesday electoral vote certification a \"1776 moment.\"\n And speaking at the same rally as Brooks and Trump, Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, another newly elected member, told the crowd that \"the Republicans are hiding and not fighting\" and \"they are trying to silence your voice.\"\n \"I want you to chant with me so loud that the cowards in Washington DC that I serve with can hear you,\" he declared.\n A Cawthorn spokesperson said the congressman condemned the violence during the riot and has criticized Trump for \"directing protestors toward the Capitol.\"\n Two Democrats have introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for his comments at the rally, and others have argued for expelling Gosar and other congressional Republicans who backed efforts to overturn the election. Democratic leaders have not made plans yet to vote on a censure resolution, but the subject has been discussed repeatedly during private conference calls, Democratic sources say.\n \"Mo Brooks and others like him should resign,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on CNN Monday. \"They should have the decency to resign. They don't belong in this institution. They have demonstrated a contempt for democracy and for freedom.\"\n Denver Riggleman, a moderate Republican who lost his primary nomination last year to a more conservative challenger, said that he thought GOP leaders needed to have a \"come to Jesus\" moment and hold the congressmen who fanned the flames of insurrection accountable. But he said he doubted that the GOP base would punish members like Gosar or Brooks when they were back on the ballot.\n \"Those elected officials probably will get reelected, and that's that's the issue that we have right now,\" Riggleman said. \"I think that's what scares me the most.\"\n CNN's Nelli Black, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Ben Naughton, Bob Ortega contributed to this report.",

But now, in 2021, you can also see right through them.\n While 8k TVs may be the next true big bump in screen resolution, many TV manufacturers use CES as a testing ground to tease new innovations. In recent years, we've seen TVs that roll and bend, modular ones that are 292 inches, models that double as artwork and even chatty TVs.\n \"The major use case is going to be commercial for now,\" said James McQuivey, an analyst at market research firm Forrester. \"Environments like shopping malls, art museums and high-end restaurants will want display technology that can be unobtrusive when it's not supposed to be the center of attention.\"\n Manufacturers say businesses can use transparent TVs to display information or menus in a creative way; LG even said it can act as a health partition between workers and guests. And while a sports bar may have many TVs on different channels, an upscale eatery may want displays that look more like moving art.\n \"At some point in the distant future, transparent displays will be useful for a variety of applications, certainly commercial displays and perhaps even in limited cases in the home, especially as price points fall and the technology improves,\" he added.\n It's not unusual for companies to release technologies without a clear market for them. Doing so is a way to gauge people's initial response and interest, similar to the early days of OLED display technologies.",

        "title": "India puts three contentious farm laws on hold following nationwide protests",
        "body_text": "India's Supreme Court has put three contentious farm laws on hold until further notice, after months of massive nationwide protests by farmers who say their livelihoods are at stake.\n In an order issued Tuesday, the court said that the decision to suspend the laws \"may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.\"\n The laws were first passed in September. For decades, the Indian government has offered guaranteed prices to farmers for certain crops, providing long-term certainty that allows them to make investments for the next crop cycle. The new laws, initiated by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, instead allowed farmers to sell their goods to anyone for any price -- giving them more freedom to do things such as sell directly to buyers and sell to other states.\n But farmers argued that the new rules would leave them worse off by making it easier for corporations to exploit agricultural workers, and help big companies drive down prices. While farmers could sell crops at elevated prices if the demand is there, conversely, they could struggle to meet the minimum price in years when there is too much supply in the market.\n More than 100,000 people have been protesting the laws since late November.\n There have been sit-ins lasting days along each of New Delhi's three borders. Farmers have blocked roads and set up makeshift camps, some sleeping on the road or in their tractors. They arrived from numerous different states to participate in the mass protests,  at times clashing with police.\n All the while, the government has held eight rounds of talks with leaders of more than 30 farmers' unions that are opposed to the laws -- but the talks went nowhere.\n The stalemate prompted the Supreme Court to suspend the laws on Tuesday and order the formation of a four-member mediation committee to help the parties negotiate in a \"congenial atmosphere.\" The mediation committee must meet within 10 days and submit its first report within two months of that meeting, according to the order.\n The court also said on Tuesday that the minimum support price protection would be maintained until further orders -- one of the primary points of friction between the government and farmers. Under the court order, \"no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the Farm Laws.\"\n However, the umbrella group representing farmers' unions, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, has repeatedly said it would not participate in any court-appointed mediation -- and reiterated this point after the new order was issued.\n \"This is the mischief of the government that they want to relieve pressure from their shoulders so they have asked for this Supreme Court committee, to which we are opposed,\" farmers' leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said at a news conference on Tuesday, adding that the committee members are all pro-government.\n The attorney general representing the government in the matter also criticized the Supreme Court order, saying they \"opposed vehemently\" any interim stay.\n The laws have been so contentious because agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India's 1.3 billion population, and farmers have been arguing for years to get the minimum guaranteed prices increased. They are the biggest voter block in the country -- making farming a central political issue.",

        "body_text": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo canceled a trip to Europe this week after being snubbed by officials in Luxembourg in the wake of the deadly assault on the US Capitol, according to two State Department officials familiar with the planning.\n The intended stop in Luxembourg had not been publicly disclosed by the State Department, which announced Monday that the top US diplomat would make his final trip abroad to Brussels. Less than 24 hours later, they said the trip was off.\n In an interview with the Atlantic published Wednesday, Luxembourg's Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Jean Asselborn said he did not cancel the visit but also said \"maybe it's not a bad thing\" that the US pulled the plug on a stop in the small European country.\n \"The US ambassador in Luxembourg told us that Pompeo has a meeting with [NATO Secretary General] Jens Stoltenberg on the 14th, and that he would like to stop by Luxembourg too. We were waiting to hear details. And then Sunday evening we were told Pompeo will not come,\" he told the magazine.\"\n I am willing to meet with any foreign minister, from anywhere. But maybe it's not a bad thing that he won't be in Belgium and Luxembourg,\" said Asselborn, who was highly critical of President Donald Trump in the wake of last week's riot.\n However, State Department sources told CNN Tuesday that officials in Luxembourg canceled planned meetings with Pompeo prior to Monday's trip announcement, but that the trip in its entirety was not turning out the way that Pompeo and his team had envisioned, particularly given the criticism that Trump has faced from world leaders after the Capitol invasion.\n Luxembourg's Foreign Ministry declined to comment. Reuters was first to report that officials in Luxembourg had canceled planned meetings with Pompeo.\n According to Monday's announcement, Pompeo was slated to meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, both of whom also condemned the deadly attack.\n \"Shocking scenes in Washington, D.C. The outcome of this democratic election must be respected,\" Stoltenberg said on Twitter the day of the riot.\n A NATO spokesperson told CNN that Pompeo called Stoltenberg earlier Tuesday to inform him of the trip's cancellation.\n Wilm\u00e8s said in a BBC interview last week she was \"saddened\" that Trump took so much time to calm people down as the situation devolved and that he continued to claim the election was fraudulent.\n Asselborn said he wasn't given a reason for the trip cancellation but posited it was because of his scathing words for the US President in the wake of the attack he and his allies incited.\n In an interview with RTL last Thursday, he called Trump \"a political pyromaniac who must be put before a criminal court\" and an instigator of a \"9/11 against democracy.\"\n He told the Atlantic he stood by those comments, \"(f)rom my side, this is correct, and I will not correct this,\" adding that \"Pompeo is really one of the last pillars of Trump.\"\n \"In a week, it will be better,\" Asselborn said.\n One State Department official familiar with the planning and cancellation of the trip said \"there is not a whole lot you can do as the secretary of state when there are just days left, the President is being impeached and the world is watching in horror.\"\n A former top State Department official said they were glad the trip was canceled after Trump encouraged the protests last week, and that they expect the US relationships with European nations will swiftly be picked up by the incoming Biden team.\n \"They are in the dying days of the Trump administration. I am glad they did it,\" said John Heffern, the former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, of the canceled meetings. \"I do not think it is a long-term problem at all. Hopefully we will never have a secretary of state like this, or a president like this or a relationship like this with Europe again.\"\n State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement Tuesday that the trip was being canceled due to the need to work on the Biden transition.\n \"We are expecting shortly a plan from the incoming administration identifying the career officials who will remain in positions of responsibility on an acting basis until the Senate confirmation process is complete for incoming officials,\" Ortagus said. \"As a result, we are cancelling all planned travel this week, including the Secretary's trip to Europe.\"\n However, two officials familiar with the transition said there was no need to cancel the trip for the sake of facilitating a smooth transition.\n As part of the cancellation of \"all planned travel,\" US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft's trip to Taiwan was also canceled.\n Craft had planned to visit Taiwan from Wednesday to Friday, with the US official scheduled to meet Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday, according to the island's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.\n It would have been the first visit to Taiwan of a sitting US UN ambassador since 1968, before the normalization of relations between Washington and Beijing.\n The proposed visit, the latest in a series of high-level official trips to Taiwan under the Trump administration, had followed an announcement by Pompeo last week that the US would be lifting its decades-old restrictions on interactions between American and Taiwanese officials.\n The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned Pompeo's removal of restrictions on Monday, as well as his broader move to strengthen relations with Taiwan, but experts said that the Chinese government was avoiding any major confrontations ahead of the swearing in of President-elect Joe Biden on January 20.\n \"Beijing appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach with the Biden administration and will resist showing its hand in the final days of Trump,\" said Natasha Russem, research fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute foreign policy think tank.\n This story has been updated with comments from Jean Asselborn.\n CNN's Ben Westcott contributed to this article.",

        "body_text": "President Donald Trump has discussed issuing pardons for himself and his children with new urgency since the attack on the US Capitol, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n One source familiar with the conversations says there is a belief that a Trump \"pardon of family and kids, is more likely and more urgent because a pardon could stave off prosecution.\"\n However aides and allies are concerned over the public perception of a pardon following the January 6 riot, which led to the deaths of five people.\n Sources tell CNN there is dissent inside the West Wing from those appalled by the attack, many of whom are pushing up against a President whose main concern is protecting himself and his family.\n The riot at the Capitol raises the potential of new legal exposure for the President, his allies and family members who participated in the rally should investigators pursue whether their words and actions could be subject to criminal prosecution.\n On Tuesday, Trump defended his remarks from January 6, saying they were \"appropriate.\"\n The White House did not provide a comment.\n The source familiar with White House conversations said that Trump might issue a blanket pardon to cover himself and his children up until the time he leaves office, adding, from Trump's point of view, \"it makes sense to just cover it all.\"\n Even before last week, the President had told advisers he thinks that he and his family have been unfairly targeted and that he's concerned legal pursuits could continue under the Biden Justice Department, according to a source close to Trump.\n Since his first year in office, Trump has discussed pardoning himself and his children, but the attack on the Capitol creates a new dynamic surrounding the messaging and \"public relations\" of such pardons, according to the person familiar with White House conversations.\n \"Before the justification was, they haven't done anything wrong,\" the source said. But the attack on the Capitol potentially changes that. Trump's \"hard core base might not care, but some Republicans and former supporters wouldn't like it,\" the source added. \"There is blood on their hands after January 6th.\"\n One of Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., doesn't want a pardon, a source with knowledge told CNN. \"His father has never raised the issue with him but Don has told friends he doesn't want a pardon, as he doesn't believe it's necessary,\" the source said.\n Inside the White House many officials are disgusted by the attacks and don't want to be involved with pardoning anyone who could have played a role, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n One source said that Trump intends to issue pardons beyond just his family members. \"More people than you would expect. Rudy is an obvious one,\" the person said, referring to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. \"And lots of discussions about current staff.\"\n The White House had planned to release a group of pardons last week, but it was delayed because of the riots, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n CNN reported Monday that Trump's White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and former Attorney General Bill Barr warned him against pardoning himself, but advisors say Trump may still do it, even though it would almost certainly be met with lawsuits.\n Presidential pardon power is untested and sources say both Barr and Cipollone thought it would be a bad idea for Trump to try to pardon himself. Barr believes a 1974 Justice Department legal memo finding that the president cannot pardon himself should stand, and Cipollone has not asked the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel for a re-examination of the issue, according to two sources.\n The memo clearly states that under \"the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself.\"\n On breaking with the Justice Department memo on self-pardon, a former senior administration official told CNN, \"Trump could care less about the OLC memo. He will do whatever he wants and then fight it out in court if he has to.\"",

        "title": "Scientists fear the 'escape mutant' in coronavirus variant from South Africa ",
        "body_text": "Scientists have identified an \"escape mutant\" that may decrease the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines.\n The mutation -- called E484K -- has been found in a variant of the coronavirus first spotted in South Africa two months ago. That variant has now spread to 12 other countries.\n Penny Moore, associate professor at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, called the mutation \"alarming.\"\n \"We fear this mutation might have an impact, and what we don't know is the extent of the impact,\" she said.\n E484K is called an \"escape mutant\" because it's been shown it might be able to escape some of the antibodies produced by the vaccine.\n \"I'm worried,\" said Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute.\n Sigal, Moore, and other scientists who are studying the E484K mutation still have to complete their work in the lab to see if the vaccine is less effective against this new variant.\n Based on what they've seen so far, they say they highly doubt E484K will render the coronavirus vaccines useless. Rather, they think there's a possibility the mutation -- on its own or in combination with other mutations -- could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine against the variant.\n They also worry E484K might be an indication the novel coronavirus is showing its ability to change before our eyes. If this mutation happened in a matter of months, other problematic mutations could follow.\n \"This virus may be taking the first steps down a fairly lengthy road towards vaccine resistance,\" said Andrew Ward, a structural virologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.\n \"It's the beginning of a long haul,\" Moore said. \"That's what's really shaken me up about this. It's a sobering wake up call.\"\n To understand the potential danger posed by the E484K mutation, picture a teacher in front of a classroom full of rowdy first graders.\n After months of trying to get her class under control, the teacher finally nails it. She gets them to sit still in their chairs.\n But after a while, one child leaves the class, and another takes his place. This new child -- this new little rascal -- won't sit down. The teacher's technique for calming the children doesn't work with him.\n The teacher here is the vaccine, and the rascally student is the E484K mutation.\n When the vaccines being used in the US were put to the test this summer and fall, they nailed it, virtually conquering the virus into submission. But since then, parts of the virus have sometimes swapped themselves out for new bits and sometimes those new bits don't behave.\n To test out these new bits, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle and elsewhere have looked at plasma from patients who recovered from Covid-19 to see if their antibodies can fight off E484K and other mutations.\n What they found is that E484K challenges the ability of some antibodies to neutralize the virus.\n While the attention has been focused on E484K, scientists are also keeping an eye on other mutations in the variant.\n The next step is to test these mutations against antibodies created by vaccines -- that's the work scientists are doing now and hope to announce in the next few weeks.\n E484K isn't only in the variant first found in South Africa -- it's recently been found in a variant in Brazil as well.\n That variant hasn't been reported in other countries. But according to GISAID, an independent data sharing initiative, the one first spotted in South Africa (its scientific name is 501Y.V2), has now been tracked in 12 other countries: the UK; Botswana; France; Australia; Germany; Switzerland; Japan; Sweden; South Korea; Finland; Ireland and the Netherlands.\n But even if E484K -- alone or in combination with other mutations in the variant -- ends up being a problem, the variant likely won't escape all the antibodies produced by vaccines, considering that the vaccines produce many antibodies.\n The concern is more for what happens as the virus mutates over and over.\n It's not that the coronavirus is such a speedy mutator -- in fact Sigal, one of the South African researchers, called it \"a real slowpoke.\" It's that the virus is spreading so quickly around the world, and each time it goes from person to person, it gets another chance to mutate.\n \"It creates more opportunities for the virus to learn how to be resistant to the vaccine,\" said Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at the Rockefeller University. \"It's going to be, over time, likely chipping away at vaccine efficacy, but we're not going to fall of a cliff tomorrow.\"\n Such misbehavior wasn't expected from a coronavirus, which has always been thought of as relatively stable, Sigal said.\n \"This virus really showed us it can adapt, and could be able to escape,\" he said. \"It just goes back to the first rule of virology: don't underestimate your virus.\"",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nWe're looking at a second impeachment of President Donald Trump. The process will be different this time, both for the lawmakers sitting in judgment of Trump and for the man himself. One thing we know: He'll stay in office and likely finish out his term, because it takes a Senate conviction to remove him.\n Get the latest impeachment coverage here.\n More from CNN's Manu Raju, Phil Mattingly, Jim Acosta and Kaitlan Collins: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he believes that impeaching President Donald Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.\n Another person with direct knowledge told CNN there's a reason McConnell has been silent on impeachment as other Republicans have pushed back: he's furious about last week's attack on the US Capitol by the President's supporters, even more so that Trump has shown no contrition. His silence has been deliberate as he leaves open the option of supporting impeachment.\n 86 days separated Trump's phone call to Ukraine's President and his impeachment by Democrats in December of 2019. There was a closed-door investigation, a public inquiry and a written report.\n 7 days separate Trump's incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol and his likely impeachment Wednesday. There's no need for a drawn-out investigation. Trump did what he did live on TV. And then the riot happened.\n Back then the party circled around its President, who was up for reelection and had a year left in office.\n House GOP leaders are treating the vote as a matter of conscience, as Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican, put it. Cheney said late Tuesday that she will vote to impeach. Her statement is here. It's possible 10 or more Republicans could join Democrats and vote for impeachment.\n After he's impeached, Trump will face a Senate trial, though it's not clear how quickly that will move along. But while the Ukraine trial was an all-consuming affair, now Democrats want to split the days, hoping to conduct a trial part of the day and work on business -- confirming Biden Cabinet members and addressing Covid during the other part.\n Utah's Sen. Mitt Romney was pilloried by fellow Republicans for standing up against Trump in his Ukraine impeachment trial. He could have company this year, when the Senate holds its trial.\n Read more about the process and how this accelerated one will set its own special precedent.\n \"The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the U.S.A., especially at this tender time.\"\n So that's not going to quiet any of the unrest.\n The grassroots militia movement beneath Trump, which Republicans often tap into, appears to be entrenched and frighteningly beyond anyone's control.",

        "body_text": "YouTube is suspending President Donald Trump's channel for at least one week, and potentially longer, after his channel earned a strike under the platform's policies, the company said Tuesday evening.\n A recent video on Trump's channel had incited violence, YouTube told CNN Business. That video has now been removed.\n YouTube initially declined to share details of the video that earned Trump the strike but said that after the one-week timeout, it will revisit the decision. YouTube also removed content from the White House's channel for violating policy, the company told CNN Business, but the channel itself has not been suspended or been given a strike -- just a warning.\n Until now, YouTube had been the only remaining major social media platform not to have suspended Trump in some fashion. Facebook has suspended Trump's account \"indefinitely,\" while Twitter has banned Trump completely.\n \"After careful review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel and issued a strike for violating our policies for inciting violence,\" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. \"As a result, in accordance with our long-standing strikes system, the channel is now prevented from uploading new videos or livestreams for a minimum of seven days\u2014which may be extended.\"\n YouTube also said it will be taking the extra step of disabling comments underneath videos on Trump's channel.\n Under YouTube's policies, earning a second strike will result in a two-week suspension and three strikes will result in a permanent ban.\n On Wednesday morning, YouTube told CNN Business its temporary suspension of Trump's channel stemmed from remarks that he made to the press the previous day.\n YouTube did not respond to a request to identify the specific remarks that may have triggered the enforcement. But a look at YouTube and what is currently live on the platform suggests the final straw may have been a video of comments Trump made just before he departed for an event at the southern border.\n Trump delivered remarks to the press twice on Tuesday morning -- once on the south lawn of the White House, and once at Joint Base Andrews.\n YouTube said it had removed some content from the White House account similar to what it had removed from Trump's own channel. As of Wednesday morning, Trump's south lawn remarks were still available on the official White House YouTube channel -- but a YouTube link that purported to show Trump's comments at Joint Base Andrews, when clicked on Wednesday morning, led to a warning message from YouTube indicating that the video had been removed \"for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines.\"\n Speaking to reporters at the base, Trump said Tuesday that \"Big Tech is doing a horrible thing for our country and to our country, and I believe it's going to be a catastrophic mistake for them.\"\n Trump continued: \"It causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger ... there's always a counter-move when they do that, I've never seen such anger.\"\n The remarks could be interpreted as a signal of coming retaliation for Trump's suspension from Twitter and Facebook.",

        "body_text": "A New York man who allegedly gave a video interview while in the US Capitol was released on bond after being charged with crimes related to Wednesday's riot.\n Aaron Mostofsky, the 34-year-old son of a state Supreme Court judge, appeared remotely for the Brooklyn federal court proceeding. US prosecutors in Washington, DC, have charged him with felony theft of government property.\n He also faces charges of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, knowingly -- with intent to impede government business or official functions -- engaging in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.\n He was not asked to enter a plea at his initial court appearance and was granted $100,000 bail by US Magistrate Judge Sanket Bulsara.\n Mostofsky's father is Kings County Supreme Court Judge Steven \"Shlomo\" Mostofsky. A representative for the judge declined to comment on the charges.\n Defense attorney Jeffrey Schwartz said Mostofsky was not a rioter.\n \"I believe the evidence will show that he was not part of the mob, that he was not rampaging,\" Schwartz said at the hearing.\n The judge approved a joint package that allows for Mostofsky's release and limits his travel to New York City, prohibits him from communicating with co-defendants or co-conspirators in the case, and prohibits him from attending political rallies or entering state capitols.\n \"These are of particular importance given what is already widely reported, as expected potential for social gatherings and violence and threats associated with those,\" Assistant US Attorney Josh Hafetz said at the hearing. \"It's important Mr. Mostofsky not engage in the behavior he engaged in last week.\"\n Schwartz said his client will have nothing to do with protest events.\n \"He understands how the whole thing in Washington got totally out of hand,\" Schwartz said. He will stay far away from Washington, any political rallies.\"\n Schwartz said Mostofsky's only interest now is to address these charges and to get a resolution that is \"just.\"\n The FBI New York tweeted out a warning Tuesday to people considering violating federal law.\n \"For those in this area considering participating in future activity similar to Mr. Mostofsky's alleged behavior, let me be clear: The FBI will find you, arrest you, and do our part to ensure you face the full force of the federal criminal justice system,\" Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said in a statement.\n Sweeney also thanked members of the community who provided information and tips related to the Capitol attack, adding, \"We are stronger when we are united.\"\n The FBI has opened more than 160 case files in the six days since pro-Donald Trump rioters breached the US Capitol building. Prosecutors have already charged more than 70 cases.\n The criminal complaint cites a video interview Mostofsky gave to the New York Post while inside the Capitol building six days ago, where he says he believed \"the election was stolen\" and that he traveled from his home in Brooklyn to Washington, DC.\n The complaint shared an image from the interview, allegedly showing Mostofsky wearing a Capitol Police vest and carrying a US Capitol Police riot shield, which, according to the complaint, he told the interviewer he found on the floor.\n The complaint states that authorities issued a search warrant to access Mostofsky's now-unavailable Instagram account four days ago, where investigators found additional posts regarding Mostofsky's presence in the Capitol during the riot.\n According to the complaint, an Instagram message sent to Mostofsky said, \"Your (sic) famous,\" to which he allegedly replied. \"IK (I know) unfortunately.\"\n \"But it was like I'm here now how did I get there,\" Mostofsky allegedly says in a reply to the unidentified person.\n Another post uncovered by investigators allegedly from Mostofsky indicated he was on a bus just after 6 a.m. last Wednesday headed to the Washington, DC, and that he tried to coordinate meeting up with a friend, instructing the friend to \"look for a guy looking like a cave man,\" according to the complaint.\n Mostofsky's older brother, Neil Mostofsky, agreed to be a third-party custodian to ensure his brother attends court hearings and abides by terms of his release during the hearing. The elder Mostofsky described himself as part of an organization that \"educates members of Congress\" but is currently \"monetarily defunct\" due to the pandemic, and said his family is \"extremely close.\"\n Mostofsky could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of the top charge, according to federal prosecutors.\n He is expected to appear on a video hearing in the District of Columbia on January 25.",

Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n \"Because the Biden administration is eight days away, the odds that this FDA rule is on the books that much longer seems pretty slim,\" Vladeck said. \"The much bigger import of tonight's ruling is the harbinger it seems to provide of how the new conservative majority is going to approach abortion cases.\"\n In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, quoted an earlier opinion by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a staunch defender of abortion rights who Barrett replaced on the court.\n \"Because the FDA's policy imposes an unnecessary, unjustifiable, irrational, and undue burden on women seeking an abortion during the current pandemic, and because the Government has not demonstrated irreparable harm from the injunction, I dissent,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n Sotomayor and Kagan signaled their hope that the Biden administration will \"exhibit greater care and empathy for women seeking some measure of control over their health and reproductive lives in these unsettling times.\"\n Medication abortion, a nonsurgical procedure effective until about 10 weeks into a pregnancy, typically entails taking two drugs several days apart. The contested regulation concerns mifepristone, the first drug, which works to block the hormone progesterone, necessary for a pregnancy to continue.\n After the lower court blocked the rule last summer, the administration asked the Supreme Court to step in, but an eight-member court declined to do so in October and sent the case back to the lower court.\n In December, the lower court upheld its own injunction and the Trump administration came back to the Supreme Court, resulting in Tuesday's ruling.\n Tuesday's order marks the second major abortion case the court has ruled on over the past several months after Roberts sided with the court's then-four liberals to block a Louisiana abortion restriction in June. A slew of cases challenging abortion restrictions are in the pipeline for the court's consideration. Though it has been rescheduled at least six times, the justices are slated to consider Friday whether to hear a case that could directly challenge Roe.\n That case pertains to Mississippi's ban on abortions later than 15 weeks into pregnancy, which Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law in 2018. The law made exceptions only for medical emergencies or cases in which there's a \"severe fetal abnormality,\" but not for incidents of rape or incest. A federal judge in Mississippi struck down the law in November 2018, and the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling late last year.\n CNN's Joan Biskupic contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Pandemic travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders have made it difficult to access cultural experiences. But a virtual tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City could help ease some of those stuck-at-home blues.\n Verizon (VZ) and The Met are launching a platform that lets viewers visit the museum and see many of its famous works of art from home, an experience that can be enhanced through 5G and augmented reality technology. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg announced the partnership during a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday.\n The tool, called \"The Met Unframed,\" is one way for Verizon to show off some of the uses for 5G \u2014 which boasts higher bandwidth, faster speeds and lower lag time than 4G LTE networks. The free platform won't net material returns for Verizon, but it could highlight benefits for customers and businesses if they upgrade. Carriers are eager to demonstrate 5G uses after spending several years and billions of dollars building out the new network.\n Art fans can access The Met Unframed via a smartphone for the next five weeks. It works on both 4G and 5G devices, though 5G users can access a special feature.\n The tour begins in The Great Hall, the entrance to The Met. Users can then navigate through various galleries. Moving the phone around allows viewers to see 3D renderings of pieces of art on each wall. By clicking to enter a new room, the platform plays sounds of footsteps walking through a hushed museum. Some works of art, ranging from the ancient Egyptian Temple of Dendur to paintings by C\u00e9zanne and van Gogh, can be clicked on to zoom in and learn more.\n Users can unlock pieces of art to \"borrow\" and display in their home using AR, making it look as if the artwork is hanging on the user's wall when viewed through the phone's camera lens. And people whose phones work on Verizon's super-fast \"wideband\" 5G can access a special feature: for four pieces, the artwork will \"come to life\" while being projected in their home with AR \u2014 for example, figures shown in a boat appear to actually be rowing.\n This type of AR rendering is \"something that's just not possible without 5G,\" Vestberg said. Verizon's wideband 5G service is available in just over 60 cities and most wireless consumers (from all carriers) have yet to upgrade to devices that work on the new network.\n The digital galleries were designed to \"evoke or nearly replicate\" spaces within the actual museum and were created with the help of Met experts, 3D artists and the museum's staff photographers, according to Verizon.\n \"Our mission since The Met's founding 150 years ago has been to connect people to art and ideas, and to one another \u2014 something we've found to be more powerful than ever over these last months of isolation and uncertainty,\" Max Hollein, director of The Met, said in a statement. \"The Met Unframed expands the ways in which we can understand, experience and appreciate art.\"\n Verizon is working on a similar partnership with the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C., to create 3D, augmented reality experiences allowing users to engage with its collection of historical artifacts.\n The other 5G applications Vestburg discussed during his CES keynote included drone package delivery, and somewhat more niche entertainment services such as virtual concerts that let fans feel like they're watching from the stage. The Met Unframed is one of many tech innovations designed to make pandemic life more bearable that have been unveiled during this year's CES.\n Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly explained the AR feature of The Met Unframed that allows users to virtually \"display\" art in their homes.",

In part because someone on Twitter -- not the person who actually recorded the video -- added a caption that suggested that the man had been put on a no-fly list for being part of the insurrection at the US Capitol.\n \"People who broke into the Capitol Wednesday are now learning they are on No-Fly lists pending the full investigation. They are not happy about this,\" the tweeter, who goes by the handle @RayRedacted, said in the caption.\n \"On Friday, Jan. 8, a customer was asked to deplane flight 1754 at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) for refusing to comply with our mandatory face covering policy. The customer complied with requests to deplane, and the flight departed at 7:42 p.m. EST for Denver International Airport (DEN),\" Blessing said in an email.\n After the mask incident, Blessing said, the man was put on American Airlines' own refusal list, essentially a no-fly list specific to that one airline, pending further investigation. But there is no basis for the suggestion he was ever on a government no-fly list -- in which case it would have been highly unlikely that he would have been able to board a plane at all -- or prohibited from flying for any reason connected to the Capitol insurrection.\n The video was originally posted on the social media app TikTok by Tania Dom\u00ednguez, who told CNN she was in the Charlotte airport awaiting a different flight. Her own caption said: \"Homeboy had a full toddler level meltdown bc he was told to wear a mask.\" (She later said in the  TikTok comments thread attached to her video that she wasn't certain that the incident was about masks. But her initial instinct was proved correct.)\n The video shows the man walking in the terminal with a face covering over his chin, rather than over his nose and mouth. He sounds emotional as he yells about having been kicked off a plane and having supposedly been victimized by unnamed people he claimed wanted to ruin his life.\n CNN could not get in touch with the man, whose name has not been made public.\n After CNN reported on Twitter on Tuesday that the @RayRedacted tweet incorrectly suggested the incident was about the Capitol insurrection, @RayRedacted tweeted a correction and said, \"I was initially given incorrect information.\" As of 3:50 p.m. on Tuesday, the correction tweet had 20 retweets -- versus more than 107,000 retweets on the inaccurate initial tweet, which remained online.\n This Charlotte video was not the only airport video to go viral with a false caption in the wake of the Capitol insurrection. Videos of an arrest incident at Florida's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, for example, were widely shared with labels claiming that they too were related to the insurrection and a \"#NoFlyList\" -- but as the Tampa Bay Times pointed out, the videos were actually filmed two months ago.\n Congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called for participants in the Capitol insurrection to be put on the government no-fly list. But it is unclear what, if any, action is being taken. The office of House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who last week asked for the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration to add all identified Capitol rioters to the federal no-fly list, said Monday that it had received no update on whether the agencies have done so.\n TSA said in a statement Monday that it is on \"high alert\" following the Capitol incident and \"travelers will notice additional law enforcement and canine presence at the three Washington, D.C.-area airports.\"\n CNN's Pete Muntean contributed to this article.",

        "body_text": "America's most senior military leaders condemned the violent invasion of the US Capitol last week and reminded service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism in a statement that underscored the unprecedented challenges facing the country in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection attempt by President Donald Trump's supporters.\n \"We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection,\" said the statement, released Tuesday and signed by America's most senior general, Mark Milley, and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is comprised of the heads of each military branch.\n The extraordinary statement underscores the scale of the challenge and the depth of the uncertainty and concern in Washington, where officials across the US security establishment scramble to deal with the aftermath of the chaos at the Capitol, and around the country, as all 50 states are preparing for possible violence.\n In a grim sign of the military's alarm, CNN has learned the US Army is taking additional steps to screen the National Guard contingent providing security at Biden's inauguration for extremism.\n At the same time, federal officials are determining how best to protect lawmakers in the seat of American democracy, as more information comes to light about Trump supporters' plans to stage another attack and disrupt the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.\n These efforts are underway across security agencies at federal and local levels as Washington's political drama continues to unfold. The House is expected to vote Wednesday on Trump's second impeachment, as significant cracks began appearing in GOP support for the President.\n The President, meanwhile, insisted on Tuesday that he bears no responsibility for the insurrection carried out by his supporters and has yet to explicitly call on them to refrain from launching another assault on the Capitol.\n As Washington readies for any possibility, officials there unveiled security efforts ranging from immediate and concrete steps by the US Capitol Police, which announced indefinite road closures around the Capitol, to a massive forensic effort by the Justice Department to reconstruct the events of January 6 and find the perpetrators behind crimes committed that day.\n Federal investigators told reporters Tuesday the scope and the scale of that wide ranging probe is unprecedented in FBI and Justice Department history and is creating a picture of the insurrection that will \"shock\" people. That work unfolds even as investigators say they are also focused on preventing future attacks.\n Lawmakers, deeply shaken by the hours of violence last week, are discussing steps to protect themselves, citing Republican members who may have cooperated or communicated with the rioters and other Republican colleagues who carry guns into the Capitol against the regulations.\n The Capitol Police set up metal detectors outside the House floor as of Tuesday afternoon and all House members, staffers and aides will have to go through them, an aide and a US Capitol Police source told CNN.\n Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen emerged from an all-senators briefing on inaugural security to tell CNN that the numbers people expected to come to Washington next week and the potential for them to be violent -- particularly the militia extremists among them -- is \"scary.\"\n Van Hollen told CNN he's \"confident\" that \"everybody will be fully prepared\" and that the security arrangements put in place for the event amount to \"an all-of-government approach. They are throwing everything we got to make sure we have a successful inauguration at the point.\"\n Administration officials from across government were scheduled to convene for a major interagency \"requirements\" meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss in depth security requirements for the inauguration and the concerns that some events in Washington, DC, could turn violent, multiple senior defense officials told CNN.\n The Joint Chief's statement Tuesday reminding troops of their obligation to defend the Constitution is a disturbing indication of their concern -- the chiefs seek, wherever possible, to avoid taking stances that may have political overtones. But the military leaders felt it was important to make a statement given the gravity of events surrounding the inauguration, CNN was told.\n \"As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution.  Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law,\" the statement said.\n The statement referenced Congress' certification of the election and said, \"President-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief.\"\n The statement comes as the military has launched an effort to examine whether some in the ranks may be sympathetic to the aims and extremist beliefs being propagated by some Trump supporters.\n CNN has learned the US Army is working with the Secret Service to determine if there are soldiers in the National Guard contingent providing security at Biden's inauguration who require additional background screening for extremist sympathies.\n The DC National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in Washington to stress that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command, an Army spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN.\n \"There is no place for extremism in the military and we will investigate each report individually and take appropriate action,\" the spokesperson said.\n Current Defense Department policy requires all service members be trained annually under a program that requires department personnel to report \"any information regarding known or suspected extremist behavior that could be a threat to the department or the United States,\" the statement said.\n \"The Army is committed to working closely with the F.B.I. as they identify people who participated in the violent attack on the Capitol to determine if the individuals have any connection to the Army,\" the statement said, while adding that any type of activity that \"involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace,\" may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state and federal law.\n Officials from the FBI and Justice Department compared their investigation of January 6 to terrorism probes.\n \"People are going to be shocked by some of the egregious contact that happened in the Capitol,\" acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said at a press conference Tuesday, in a reference to assaults by rioters on federal and DC police officers.\n \"The picture is going to build. I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what happened within the Capitol, and it's going to come into laser focus I think over the next weeks and days,\" he added.\n Sherwin said that \"the scope and the scale of this investigation into these cases are really unprecedented not only in FBI history but probably DOJ history.\"\n FBI Washington DC field office assistant director Steven D'Antuono said that agency was ready for the challenge. \"The FBI is quite familiar with large-scale, complex investigations ... we are up to the challenge,\" he said.\n \"The Capitol grounds outside and inside are essentially a crime scene,\" he said. \"It is not going to be solved in the coming months,\" he added.\n Sherwin said he has given his prosecutors \"marching orders\" to pursue significant sedition and conspiracy cases related to the insurrection.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Jake Tapper, Daniella Diaz, Manu Raju, Ryan Nobles, Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a change in its Covid-19 vaccine distribution plan, an effort step up the grossly insufficient number of vaccinations that have been administered to date.\n Following an altered distribution protocol that President-elect Joe Biden announced last week, the administration will now release all available doses of the vaccine.\n Of equal importance, the announcement also allows for immediate vaccination of individuals 65 and older and provides assistance to states in setting up administration sites. Although I see these plans as a much-needed step in getting first vaccine doses in arms, we must ask whether and how this will affect the speed and equity of vaccine administration.\n Why should we ask these questions?\n Well, I -- in my personal capacity -- have heard about well-connected friends and community members who have managed to get vaccinated against Covid-19, even though they meet no current criteria to join the front of the line. Meanwhile, many health care workers have yet to be vaccinated.\n Most of us believe that there should be some element of fairness in the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccines. Aligning with guidelines advanced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in December 2020, those at highest risk for getting sick from Covid-19, either because of their job or their underlying health status, should get first dibs.\n These guidelines are supported by bioethical principles about the need to balance \"priorities of minimizing societal disruption and preventing morbidity and mortality.\" Justice and objectivity seem like a no-brainer. But, even with expanded distribution of the vaccine as outlined by the new plan, someone has to go first, second and last. Further complicating matters, individual states and health care facilities are under no legal obligation to follow ACIP's recommendations.\n As a result, the system is open to manipulation and some solutions as to who goes first, versus second, feel a little fairer than others.\n A first distribution option is to treat vaccination like a class list. I have heard from health care workers across the country whose hospitals are offering vaccine slots according to alphabetical order.  This is lovely for those whose last name is \"Aguilar,\" but what if the person named \"Zeal\" is actually at higher occupational and physical risk?\n Using a list avoids any opportunity to game the system, but it also feels like something that Seinfeld's Soup Nazi would have done.\n A second, quintessentially American strategy is to treat vaccination like a Black Friday sale: first come, first served -- unless you know the right people. In some counties in Florida, seniors lined up overnight to get the shot, putting their own health at risk for the chance to avert future infections. In Houston, health department call centers have been paralyzed by calls from those desperate to get protected. In NYC, there are reports of clinicians rushing to the elevator to be first in line for the vaccine.\n Meanwhile, stories are already circulating about the possibility of the wealthy buying access through concierge doctors. This strategy clearly prioritizes those who are in-the-know, who have time to sit on hold, or who are willing (in the case of camping out overnight) to put their health at risk. It may also prioritize those with power and wealth. It feels haphazard and inherently wrong. A vaccine is a public health good, not the season's hottest toy.\n A third, common way to handle prioritization is to create complex algorithms that weigh risk from one's job, underlying health problems, age and other relevant variables in order to provide a perfectly tailored list of who goes first, second and so forth.\n This option sounds fair and scientific. But algorithms can also be dangerous. Predictive algorithms are notorious for being \"garbage in, garbage out.\" If the data that you feed into them is based on racial, gender or age-based biases, the results will simply reinforce existing structural problems.\n And flawed predictive algorithms abound. One need only look at Stanford University hospital's experience, in which, according to CNN affiliate KGO, medical residents and fellows who work in the hospital were given a lower vaccine priority than some doctors who were working from home due to missteps in the design of the algorithm.\n Prioritization algorithms could also slow down distribution to new groups, by being too rigid to account for real-time distribution challenges. We cannot afford to worsen structural inequities during vaccine distribution, nor can the quest for perfection impair our speed.\n Ultimately, of course, it's the conditions of scarcity that make fairness difficult to achieve. But let's be clear: the vaccine does not have to be as scarce as it is. Miscommunication from health officials and an underprepared vaccine distribution system can hinder vaccine administration just as much as slow vaccine production.\n While some places are overwhelmed by demand, other clinics are have thrown out unused doses when individuals did not show up for their injections. As Surgeon General Jerome Adams recently said, \"The problem really is that we need to continue to do a better job of matching up supply and demand at the local level.\"\n Whether it's using the National Guard to assist in setting up vaccination centers, deploying mobile vans to access rural and urban populations, or working with community groups to increase uptake among at-risk populations, better is needed. In my own state of Rhode Island, we've both prioritized those at highest occupational and age-related risk, and have knocked on doors in our hardest-hit community to get vaccines to those who need them most. But there is always room to question our practices and aspire to do better.\n So, what is the next best step for our country to achieve fairness? The new plan announced by HHS -- and after January 20, the Biden administration's plan, which will continue to prioritize using all available doses of the vaccine.\n As these plans stipulate, we must release all the available doses of the Covid-19 vaccines -- but we must go further by expanding the categories of who can get the vaccine to avoid wasting doses and simultaneously increasing both funding and support for getting the shot in people's arms in ways that explicitly address considerations of equity and don't let people use their influence or resources to cut the line. Only then we will have moved closer to our goal.\n To protect our communities, we must not be paralyzed by fairness -- or stop pursuing it.",

        "title": "Millions have a real fear of needles. Overcoming that is critical for the vaccine rollout",
        "body_text": "As a fourth-year medical student at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Amanda Walker knows that vaccinations are both safe and essential.\n Getting one, however, is still an ordeal for Walker, who has needle phobia. \"I'll start to get really clammy, and then get cold sweats,\" she said, describing her reaction to routine injections. \"Then I pass out.\"\n Walker has been living with fear of getting injections for years. She remembers being terrified, at age 12 or 13, when receiving a flu shot at the doctor's office.\n It's a common fear: Walker is one of millions who are frightened of needles, found a 2018 metanalytic study published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Reactions include mild to severe anxiety and full-blown phobias. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, better known as DSM-5, recognized trypanophobia, or the fear of \"a specific phobia of blood/injection/injury type\" in 1994.\n Now, as Covid-19 vaccines roll out across the globe, addressing such fears is essential to public health. To protect the population as a whole, a \"substantial proportion\" of people must be vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. And for individuals considering avoiding a Covid-19 vaccination due to their phobia, seeking treatment could be a life-and-death decision.\n Fortunately, experts say treatments for needle phobia can be highly effective. Leaving the condition untreated, however, can result in a fear that grows even more intense over time.\n \"Phobia is a fear and anxiety about a specific stimulus,\" explained Dr. Jeffrey Geller, president of the American Psychiatric Association and a professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.\n About 30% of people will experience an anxiety disorder in their lifetime, Geller said. Of those, between 7% and 9% of individuals have a specific phobia.\n Anxiety about needles, though, doesn't have to meet the formal definition of a phobia to cause problems. About a quarter of adults are afraid of needles, and an estimated 7% of adults avoid immunizations because of that fear, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the 2018 metanalytic study cited above said that fear of needles was estimated to be 20% to 50% in adolescents and 20% to 30% in young adults.\n Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, fear of needles had a serious impact. Regular vaccinations reduce risk of death, disability and disease, the World Health Organization wrote in a survey of worldwide immunization programs, which have reduced the risk of deadly diseases including measles and diphtheria.\n What's more, a fear of needles goes beyond vaccinations. Individuals with severe phobias may avoid medical care altogether, even if it means deteriorating health.\n For needle-phobic people who get injections despite their fears -- like Walker -- the experience can be unpleasant. Common symptoms include dizziness, feeling faint, insomnia, sweating, muscle tension and increased vigilance.\n Individuals with relatively mild fear of needles might be able to cope with their anxiety by practicing relaxation techniques on their own, Geller explained.\n \"There are many meditation techniques that one can be taught,\" he said, pointing to both meditation and yoga as useful practices.\n Distracting yourself can work, too. Counting things in your surroundings, doodling, numbering your breaths and imagining a safe, comforting place can shift your focus away from the frightening event.\n Or, you could invite a trusted friend or family member to join you, Geller said, even if they can't accompany you all the way to the procedure room. \"Come to the injection with a supportive person,\" he said, adding that practicing relaxation techniques with your support person can help reinforce that coping mechanism.\n Anti-anxiety medications are another option. While most are available only with a prescription, one over-the-counter option is diphenhydramine, an antihistamine that's often referred to by the brand name Benadryl.\n Though the drug is generally used for allergies, it can have a sedative effect that may help reduce anxiety. (Even for nonprescription drugs, it's essential to consult with a primary care provider before use, Geller said.)\n While the above techniques can make a big difference when it comes to calming nerves about needles, full-blown phobias call for professional help.\n Among the most popular approaches is cognitive behavioral therapy, a collaborative process where individuals work with providers to alter their thoughts and behaviors.\n Of all the methods he uses to treat phobias and anxiety at his South Pasadena, California, practice, psychologist Jeff Prater said that CBT is the most common. Over a series of sessions, Prater teaches patients to use relaxation techniques while gradually confronting their fears.\n \"The general approach is to create a hierarchy, starting from something that does not cause them any anxiety whatsoever, and then constructing that hierarchy all the way up to the most fearful situation that they can possibly imagine connected to their needle phobia,\" Prater said.\n At the beginning, he said, that might mean practicing relaxation in a room where a needle is shut away inside a drawer.\n \"Once they can think about that without any anxiety at all, I'll open the drawer,\" he said. \"Then I'll put it on the desk. They'll see it. And then we move progressively closer to the point where they actually pick it up.\"\n Between four and 10 sessions are enough to effectively treat needle phobia for most people, Prater said. With vaccinations for Covid-19 becoming available in the coming months, that means it's important to seek help for needle phobia as soon as possible.\n If you ignore the issue, you could face more years of anxiety. Leaving your phobia untreated can mean symptoms that worsen over time. While many children lose their fear of needles as they move into adulthood, full-blown phobias tend to become more severe with age, Prater said.\n It's a kind of feedback loop. \"What drives anxiety is avoidance,\" Prater said. \"When you avoid that situation, your anxiety goes down temporarily. But then, when you're faced with that situation again, your anxiety rebounds. And it doesn't just rebound to the same level \u2014 it actually increases.\"\n Only by facing anxieties head-on can an individual halt the progression of that feedback loop, Prater said.\n That's what Walker, the fourth-year medical student, has done. When she gets a flu shot each year, she is sure to inform the person administering shots that she may be faint afterward. But she always goes through with it, and has found that deep breathing techniques can help.\n \"Every time, I say 'OK, I'm getting better, I know what to expect, I know how it works.' It's gotten better,\" she said.\n As part of her education, Walker also regularly performs injections, and she said that she thinks of the work as a kind of exposure therapy. Inserting intravenous needles triggers her needle phobia, but she has persevered. In that Walker's education requires that she continually face her phobia, it resembles, in some ways, the therapy that Prater offers his own patients.\n Walker plans to become a pediatrician, and she's already worked with many young patients afraid to get their annual vaccinations. Her own experience of needle phobia, she said, is a source of empathy that she can draw on to better connect with them.\n \"Usually I tell them: 'It's okay, I get really nervous, too. But I still am going to be a doctor. If I can be a doctor, you can get this one injection,'\" she said. \"It's OK to be afraid.\"\n Referrals to mental health services in your area are available \u2014 in Spanish and English \u2014 from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) hotline: 1-800-662-HELP.\n Jen Rose Smith is a writer based in Vermont.

        "title": "Metal detectors installed outside House floor as Democrats express safety concerns about their colleagues",
        "body_text": "Members of Congress and staffers will have to walk through metal detectors in order to get onto the floor of the US House of Representatives, a senior Democratic aide told CNN Tuesday.\n The development comes after multiple House Democrats told CNN they are worried about some of their Republican colleagues and that there have been multiple conversations about the need for every member of Congress and their guests to start going through metal detectors.\n Capitol Police had set up metal detectors outside of the House floor as of Tuesday afternoon and all House members, staffers and aides will have to go through them, the aide said. A US Capitol Police source confirmed the measures are in place.\n Acting House Sergeant-at-Arms Timothy Blodgett said in a memo to all members of Congress and their staffs that the metal detectors were being installed to ensure compliance with police regulations banning guns and incendiary devices from the chamber.\n Members are reminded that pursuant to the firearms regulations that Members received on opening day, firearms are restricted to a Member's Office,\" the memo stated. \"Thank you in advance for your (cooperation) with the United States Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms staff during the screening process.\"\n The House Democrats told CNN that they are worried some lawmakers are ignoring House rules regarding firearms.\n \"There have been increasing tensions with certain incoming freshmen for months, who have been insistent on bringing firearms in violation of law and guidelines,\" one House Democrat said, in a reference to Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina and others.\n Boebert was filmed in a campaign advertisement vowing to carry her Glock handgun around Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. and has said she would carry her gun to Congress. The District has strict gun laws and Washington's police chief has warned the congresswoman that she is subject to the same laws as everyone else in the nation's capital.\n Cawthorn, meanwhile, said in an interview with Smoky Mountain News last week that he was armed when a mob stormed the Capitol.\n \"Fortunately, I was armed, so we would have been able to protect ourselves,\" Cawthorn told the paper.\n Micah Bock, communications director for Cawthorn, said the congressman will follow the guidance of Capitol Police.\n \"Rep. Cawthorn exercises his 2nd Amendment rights, as well as the privileges available to members of Congress,\" Boch said in a statement to CNN. \"Congressman Cawthorn seeks to follow the guidance of Capitol police and is immensely grateful for the work that they do.\"\n Boebert, in a statement to CNN, called the installation of the metal detectors a \"political stunt.\"\n \"It is a shame that Nancy Pelosi is trying to disarm Members of Congress in the very place that needed more protection on January 6th. It is clear metal detectors would not have deterred the violent acts we saw; this political stunt does nothing to improve the safety of Members in the Capitol complex,\" the statement read.\n She added, \"As I have said in previous statements, I will comply with all applicable firearm laws and regulations. I want to again thank the brave men and women of the Capitol Police for their service and for keeping us safe.\"\n When members went to the floor for votes Tuesday night, multiple Republicans were furious at the new measures and some shouted at Capitol Police officers who were at the metal detectors.\n Reps. Markwayne Mullin and Steve Womack erupted at Capitol Police as they were forced to go through, with Womack shouting, \"I was physically restrained,\" and Mullin saying, \"It's my constitutional right\" and \"they cannot stop me.\"\n Boebert set off the metal detectors and initially refused to show police what was in her bag. She was eventually allowed into the chamber.\n There were long lines at the checkpoint and Capitol Police waved approximately eight lawmakers through to the floor without making them go through the metal detectors at one point.\n GOP Rep. Rodney Davis, the ranking member of the House administration committee, told CNN in a statement that the metal detectors are evidence of \"political correctness run amok. The threat is outside, not inside. Every resource used inside is one that can't be used outside.\"\n Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, told CNN that the situation is \"untenable\" because it \"impedes the ability of members to come and vote. This is our job.\"\n According to the US Capitol Police's website, firearms are prohibited on the Capitol grounds even if someone has a carry permit from Washington, DC or another state. Law enforcement officers who are performing their official duties and meet \"certain established criteria\" may be allowed to carry their weapon into the Capitol.\n The Washington Post reported in 2018 that guns are completely banned in the legislative chambers, with an exception for the chambers' sergeants-at-arms.\n A second Democratic member of Congress told CNN that the concern extends to the people those members of Congress may invite to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n \"There are concerns about the gun-toting members, but also we don't know who they're going to bring to the inauguration who can bypass the metal detectors,\" the second House Democrat said. \"Until there's an investigation and until we understand our colleagues' level of complicity in the attack we don't know how involved they really were. Until we have answers I don't think we should trust them -- not all of them of course, but some of them.\"\n The second Democrat noted that some of the House Republicans went onto the chamber's floor after the attack and continued to share election lies. That Democrat added that some refused to wear masks while they were sheltering in place and now at least three Democrats have tested positive for Covid-19.\n This story has been updated with comments from Rep. Cawthorn's office and Rep. Boebert, along with additional color from the Capitol on Tuesday.\n CNN's Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Ontario, Canada's most populous province, issued a stay-at-home order Tuesday, as officials warn there is a \"real and looming threat of the collapse of the province's hospital system\" if Covid-19 case counts do not come down.\n The new order is set to take effect Thursday and will apply to the whole province, including Toronto and Ottawa. It is the second of its kind since the pandemic began.\n \"Last week I stood here and I told you our province is in crisis,\" said Doug Ford, Ontario's premier, in a news conference in Toronto on Tuesday. \"The facts are clear: Cases and deaths are the highest since the start of the pandemic and community spread continues to escalate.\"\n For at least four weeks, the Ontario government will be \"requiring everyone to remain at home with exceptions for essential purposes, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy, accessing health care services, for exercise or for essential work,\" according to a statement provided to CNN.\n All non-essential retail stores and in-person dining have been shut down in Ontario since Christmas Day, and in Toronto since the end of November. Schools in Ontario's hotspots, including Toronto and its suburbs, will not resume in-person learning until at least February 10.\n \"We must change our mobility patterns. Too many people are having too many contacts. Increased contacts result from increased mobility,\" said Christine Elliott, Ontario's health minister. \"So to break this cycle you must stay home as much as possible and that starts with a stay at home order.\"\n Officials promised strict enforcement of the new restrictions and warned people who violate the measures could be fined thousands of dollars and could face up to a year in prison.\n Canada's second wave of Covid-19 is now more widespread and serious than the first, with a seven-day national average of 8,100 new cases per day, a pandemic high, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n Ontario public health officials warned at a Tuesday news conference that one in every four intensive care units in Ontario were already full, and that the hospital system was under threat of being overwhelmed.\n Officials also said the United Kingdom variant of Covid-19 could be become the dominant variant in Ontario in less than two months if left unchecked. The variant is at least 56% more transmissible than earlier variants and if allowed to spread it would mean that vaccines would not have a significant effect on mortality or morbidity, given the current slow rollout of the vaccine.\n Ontario has reported 14 cases of new variants in the province, but officials said what's more troubling is the discovery of three cases this week not linked to travel, which could indicate the variant is already in the community and spreading.\n \"Three of our cases we don't have a travel history,\" said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health. \"If that is confirmed, we have evidence of community transmission and that is a very serious concern that the vaccine will not be able to address quickly enough.\"\n Earlier Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government is buying an additional 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, adding that Canada would have at least 80 million doses of vaccine available by fall. Canada is also currently administering the Moderna vaccine.\n Trudeau repeated his promise that every Canadian who wanted the vaccine would be vaccinated by September.\n \"We're doing everything we can to bring forward more doses, to accelerate the process,\"  Trudeau said in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday. \"Because we know that the sooner we get as many Canadians as possible vaccinated, the sooner we get through this pandemic.\"\n CNN's Paula Newton reported from Ottawa and Amir Vera wrote from Atlanta.

        "body_text": "The US Justice Department detailed for the first time on Tuesday the scale of its investigation into last week's US Capitol breach as officials vowed to hold all participants that broke the law accountable.\n The acting US attorney in Washington, DC, Michael Sherwin, told reporters that the agency is at the onset of \"a long term investigation\" that \"is not going to be solved overnight.\"\n \"This is only the beginning.\"\n Here are the key takeaways from Tuesday's news conference:\n Officials have opened more than 170 subject files -- meaning individuals identified as persons who potentially committed crimes -- on rioters from the Capitol.\n Sherwin said this includes individuals who potentially committed crimes inside or outside the Capitol grounds. He added that he anticipates the number of opened subject files \"to grow to the hundreds in the next coming weeks.\"\n Of the 170 subject files that have been opened so far, Sherwin said the Justice Department has charged over 70 cases. That number too, Sherwin said, is expected \"to grow into the hundreds\" as the investigation unfurls.\n On the types of cases that the Justice Department is charging, Sherwin said, the \"gamut of cases\" and misconduct that they're looking at \"is really mind-blowing.\"\n This includes \"significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy,\" he said. Those charges would carry prison terms of up to 20 years.\n Looking at those charges is a \"strike force\" in the DC US Attorney's Office, Sherwin added.\n \"Their only marching orders,\" he said, are to build sedition and conspiracy charges related to \"the most heinous acts that occurred in the Capitol, and these are significant charges that have felonies with a prison terms of up to 20 years.\"\n Sherwin said Tuesday the Justice Department has put an emphasis on looking into rioters who engaged in \"open-handed combat\" with police officers during the breach.\n A clearer picture of what happened inside the Capitol, Sherwin said, is \"going to come into laser focus I think over the next weeks and days, and I think people are going to be shocked with some of the egregious contact that happened within the Capitol.\"\n FBI assistant director Steven D'Antuono, who spoke alongside Sherwin at Tuesday's news conference, said the FBI is pursuing information about a person or people who helped to plant pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic headquarters last week.\n D'Antuono said the bombs were real -- and had timers.\n \"We don't know exactly why they didn't go off,\" he added.\n D'Antuono also said the agency  is considering keeping those who attacked the Capitol last week from boarding planes by adding them to the federal no-fly list.\n Asked by CNN's Evan P\u00e9rez about the step, D'Antuono said: \"As for the no-fly list, we look at all tools and techniques that we possibly can use within the FBI and that's something we are actively looking at.\"\n Investigators are also looking at attacks from rioters specifically against journalists, Sherwin said.\n \"Some people aren't familiar that some of those rioters specifically targeted members of the media and assaulted them,\" he said. So we have assigned s pecific prosecutors in our office to focus on those cases as well. And I'm naming all these different strike forces to just emphasize regardless of who the victim was, regardless of who the perpetrator was, we're treating all of these cases equally.\"\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Pete Muntean and Greg Wallace contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Local health officials doubt federal pivot on Covid-19 vaccines will help in time",
        "body_text": "The federal government's about-face on vaccine policy may be too little, too late, local health officials told CNN Tuesday.\n City and county health departments are already running at a deficit, and will continue to struggle to get vaccines out to people, the National Association of County and City Health Officials said.\n The US Department of Health and Human Services changed course on Tuesday in its Covid-19 vaccine rollout guidelines for states, which then get passed down to local health departments. Those changes include new plans to release reserved second doses of vaccine and recommendations to vaccinate anyone 65 and older.\n \"The concerns outweigh the benefits here,\" NACCHO CEO Lori Tremmel Freeman told CNN.\n \"The money and the funding support that would allow this to happen successfully are coming after the vaccine has already been distributed -- so already our local health departments are at a deficit,\" she added.\n HHS Secretary Alex Azar framed the changes, which match the approach previously announced by the incoming Biden administration, as something that had been part of the plan all along. A senior administration official told CNN on Tuesday the shift follows two Operation Warp Speed meetings Azar held over the past 48 hours on how to ramp up the lagging rollout process.\n Opening up vaccinations to those 65 and older could help in areas where there have been more doses than people eligible or willing to receive them -- in some cases leading to extra doses going unused, expired and being tossed away. And releasing reserved second doses could benefit areas where there has not been enough vaccine for everyone eligible and willing.\n \"For a portion of our membership that has had issues with needing more dosages because the demand has been high, this will definitely be an asset to them,\" Blaire Bryant, associate legislative director for health at the National Association of Counties, told CNN on Tuesday.\n Local health officials are moving to get health care workers in place for a flood of additional Covid-19 vaccine doses -- but many of those departments are understaffed and under-resourced, NACCHO'S Freeman said.\n \"The release of all of the second doses and removing that hold back is not necessarily seen as a solution to getting the vaccine out faster. We have existing issues still -- logistical issues -- with how to plan and staff this mass vaccination effort,\" she said.\n On both the state and county level, the supply and demand don't always line up for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n Out of the more than 25 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine that have been distributed to hospitals, health centers and pharmacies so far in the United States, only about 9 million people had received their first dose as of Tuesday morning, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n The two vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use in the United States -- Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's -- are administered as two-dose shots, 21 and 28 days apart, respectively.\n With the Trump administration's new rollout guidelines, Freeman said, there are concerns about mixed messaging to the public about how important it is to receive a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine and when.\n \"What message is that going to send around the original guidance that we've been given where you have 21 to 28 days to get your second dose? What if that doesn't happen?\" Freeman said. \"There's a balance that's required between wanting to get as many people as possible immunized and making sure that we are able to successfully do the second doses of vaccine and have enough supply.\"\n Another concern on the local level is tracking of who has received their first and second Covid-19 vaccine.\n During Tuesday's news briefing, Azar said that second doses would still be available to those who need them.\n At the local level, some health departments might decide not to change their plans.\n The city and county of Denver, for instance, has been administering Covid-19 vaccines under Colorado's Phase 1a and 1b prioritization, which means health care workers, first responders and people who are ages 70 and older are the only groups currently eligible to receive the vaccine.\n To make any changes to that phased approach, such as lowering the eligibility age to 65, \"I think it would be a state-level decision,\" Dr. Judith Shlay, associate director of Denver Public Health, told CNN on Tuesday.\n \"Our governor would have to make that decision. I'm not sure we'll do that at the moment, because we really have a lot to do with what we're trying to do at the moment,\" Shlay said.\n Some states have decided to open vaccination to more people.\n Idaho will be opening Covid-19 vaccinations to all residents age 65 and older starting February 1, Gov. Brad Little announced Tuesday afternoon. \"We do not want to create a bubble or backlog,\" Little said. \"Once we get a handle on capacity, we will be able to get to the 65-and-older population.\"\n Meanwhile in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that Mississippians that are 65 and older, or those with pre-existing medical conditions can make appointments for Covid-19 vaccinations.\n But Shlay said the undertaking is huge.\n \"What we have to build is the infrastructure that can then be available consistently for months at a time. This is going to probably be nine months or a year to get this all rolled out,\" she said.\n The American Hospital Association said that simplifying the process and pushing out more vaccines can help speed vaccination.\n However, \"for this initiative to succeed at the speed in which we need it to, there needs to be a robust infrastructure in place across every state and jurisdiction capable of accommodating a high volume of people receiving both their first and second shots in a timely manner,\" Rick Pollack, AHA's president and CEO, said in a statement emailed to CNN on Tuesday.\n While speaking to CNN on Tuesday morning, Freeman said that she was on her way to a meeting with President-elect Joe Biden's transition team to discuss the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.\n She said local health departments have been left out of the federal decision-making.\n \"Throughout this pandemic, our local health departments have not always been front and center,\" she said.\n \"It's disheartening to us that this kind of decision would be made without fully integrating the public health system response to such a decision, especially because our health departments are so under-resourced and understaffed and doing really outstanding work despite that,\" she added.\n \"With every layer of complexity that comes along, the weight on the shoulders of our health departments is just becoming unbearable. They want to do a good job -- they want to protect and immunize their communities and do it efficiently, effectively -- but this doesn't necessarily help them to do that.\"\n CNN's Maggie Fox, Andy Rose, Jamiel Lynch and Nick Neville contributed to this report.",

        "title": "'People can't afford to wait': Biden and allies push for quick confirmations of nominees, citing security threats",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden is on course to lag behind his recent predecessors who had Cabinet nominees confirmed on the day of inauguration, causing concern that Biden's administration could be hampered in its early efforts to face immediate security, health and economic challenges.\n Biden's transition team is beginning a new messaging push to urge Republican senators to swiftly confirm national security nominees -- positions helming the Pentagon and the State, Homeland Security and other key departments -- with Biden set to take office in eight days, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. Politico was the first to report the Biden team's effort.\n Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick for Homeland Security secretary, is a top priority in their push, the source said. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee announced Tuesday afternoon that it would hold a confirmation hearing for Mayorkas on January 19.\n That push is getting a boost from Senate Democrats, including top Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, who told colleagues in a letter Tuesday that the riots at the US Capitol fueled by President Donald Trump last week and the economic costs brought on by the coronavirus pandemic make it particularly important for Biden's Cabinet to be in place quickly.\n \"The violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th showed us we need qualified Senate-confirmed people (not in an acting capacity) in key national security positions on Day One, including Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and others. The economic challenges our nation faces also require having key economic nominees confirmed and on the job ASAP,\" Schumer wrote.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had promised to give Biden's nominees votes, but had not committed to a timetable to do so. Democrats, though, will take the Senate majority as soon as Biden is inaugurated, thanks to wins in two Georgia US Senate runoffs last week and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' position as the tie-breaking vote in a 50-50 Senate. That could allow a Democratic-led Senate to move much faster on Biden's nominees.\n Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, who will soon resign his House seat for a job in Biden's White House, on CNN Tuesday lambasted Senate Republicans for failing to hold hearings for Mayorkas and other national security nominees, as has been done for previous administrations.\n \"Almost every Homeland Security secretary has been confirmed on the first day, and that was in 2009 and 2017,\" Richmond said. \"So the fact that the Senate is not holding a hearing so we can confirm our national security members on day one is irresponsible to the American public.\"\n Biden intends to install acting agency heads at Cabinet departments when he takes office next week, a source familiar with the plans said.\n The source said the President-elect will name career officials to serve as the interim heads at most of the Cabinet departments while the confirmation process plays out. Biden's team, through its agency review teams and other consultations, has identified career officials who have served at these departments to take the helm in an acting manner.\n They are also planning to name chiefs of staff and other senior political appointees not requiring Senate confirmation that can begin working at these departments on the first day of the Biden administration, the source said.\n Last week's deadly insurrection at the Capitol has heightened attention over security issues, leading Biden's team and allies in Congress to start pushing for Cabinet confirmations to ensure there are no gaps when Biden takes office on January 20.\n \"We are in a pandemic, economic crisis, and facing serious security threats -- people can't afford to wait,\" the source familiar with Biden's plans said.\n Other national security top spots the transition is seeking swift confirmation for are Lloyd Austin, whose nomination for defense secretary requires a congressional waiver, and Tony Blinken as secretary of state, along with Janet Yellen as treasury secretary.\n \"It's my expectation and hope that the Senate will move to confirm these nominees promptly and fairly. It's especially the case for the nominees secretary of state, defense, treasury, Homeland Security,\" Biden said as he introduced another round of picks for economic posts last week.\n \"Given what our country's been through the last four years, the last few days, given the threats and the risks of this world, they should be confirmed as close to January 20 as possible,\" he said. \"There should be no vacancies at state, defense, treasury and Homeland Security.\"\n With Congress now focused on a second impeachment of Trump, Biden expressed his hope Monday that the Senate would be able to \"bifurcate\" the process, splitting its time between a possible impeachment trial and confirming his nominees and advancing his agenda.\n So far, the only confirmation hearings scheduled for Biden nominees are for Austin, Mayorkas and Yellen, all on January 19.\n Trump's choices for defense and Homeland Security secretaries were both confirmed on January 20, 2017; many other Cabinet nominees were confirmed within the next month.\n President Barack Obama retained President George W. Bush's defense secretary and saw his nominees for secretary of Homeland Security, education, energy, agriculture, interior and veterans affairs confirmed on his Inauguration Day, with others confirmed shortly afterward.\n Several Bush Cabinet nominees were confirmed on his Inauguration Day, as well, including his nominees for secretary of defense, state and treasury.\n \"Regardless of any developments, with our national security at stake, the pandemic costing thousands of lives every day, and our economy in a historic recession, there is absolutely no justification for Republicans to jeopardize the ability of the United States government to keep the American people safe, distribute vaccines, and put Americans back to work,\" said Andrew Bates, a Biden transition spokesperson.\n \"Many of these respected, qualified, crisis-tested nominees were announced in November, many have been previously confirmed, and their paperwork has been submitted. We look forward to continuing to work with both parties in good faith on timely confirmations,\" Bates said.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting on Biden's plans.\n CNN's Jessica Dean and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The House of Representatives voted Tuesday night to approve a resolution calling for President Donald Trump to be removed from office through the 25th Amendment in the wake of the violent siege of the US Capitol last week.\n The vote amounts to a symbolic rebuke after Vice President Mike Pence made clear earlier in the evening that he has no plans to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the President in a letter released just hours ahead of the House vote.\n It comes as House Democrats are now moving rapidly toward impeaching the President for a second time as a result of the insurrection, which Trump incited after repeatedly making false claims that the election had been stolen from him and calling for his supporters to fight back.\n House Democrats plan to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump, setting up an impeachment vote one week after rioters overran Capitol police and breached some of the most secure areas of the Capitol.\n The 25th Amendment resolution, brought forward by Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, calls on Pence \"to immediately use his powers under section 4 of the 25th Amendment to convene and mobilize the principal officers of the executive departments in the Cabinet to declare what is obvious to a horrified nation: That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties of his office.\"\n It further calls on Pence to assume \"the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\"\n Ahead of the vote, however, Pence's office released a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shutting down the idea.\n \"With just eight days left in the President's term, you and the Democratic caucus are demanding that the Cabinet and I invoke the 25th Amendment. I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our Constitution,\" Pence wrote.\n In a sign that Democrats are moving quickly to impeach, Pelosi on Tuesday announced the names of the Democratic lawmakers who will serve as impeachment managers tasked with presenting a case to the Senate during an impeachment trial. The managers will be: Reps. Raskin, who will be the lead manager, Diana DeGette of Colorado, David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Eric Swalwell of California, Joaquin Castro of Texas, Ted Lieu of California, Stacey Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands, Joe Neguse of Colorado and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania.\n Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, told colleagues on a conference call Monday evening that Wednesday's impeachment vote is a \"vote of conscience,\" a source tells CNN. Cheney, who announced on Tuesday that she will vote to impeach, is one of the handful of outspoken critics of President Donald Trump's disinformation surrounding the November election results and Trump's attempts to overturn the election.\n A senior House Democratic aide told CNN that the rule for the Raskin resolution Tuesday night would include language implementing a fine system -- similar to what Republicans implemented in 2017 for filming on the floor -- for noncompliance with the speaker's mask requirement on the House floor. Fines will be $500 for the first offense and $2,500 for the second offense and will be deducted from members' pay, not campaign funds or members' representational allowance.\n Separately, the House Office Building Commission will immediately consider implementing a similar fine system for non-compliance in the House office buildings and House side of the US Capitol.\n Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Pence a day after the Capitol attack to discuss the 25th Amendment -- but Pence never took the call after they were on hold for 25 minutes.\n \"At least. Of course, I was -- I was at home, so I was running the dishwasher, putting my clothes in the laundry. We're still waiting for him to return the call,\" she told CBS Sunday night.\n In her statement on Monday, Pelosi said that as a \"next step,\" House Democrats \"will move forward with bringing impeachment legislation to the Floor.\"\n Earlier on Monday, Democrats attempted to take up the 25th Amendment resolution by unanimous consent, but it was blocked by Republicans.\n Pelosi accused House Republicans of \"enabling the President's unhinged, unstable and deranged acts of sedition to continue,\" adding, \"Their complicity endangers America, erodes our Democracy, and it must end.\"\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Daniella Diaz and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The founder and Executive Chairman of KIND Snacks, Daniel Lubetzky is a social entrepreneur  who founded and incubated non-profit organizations the OneVoice Movement, Empatico, and Frontline Impact Project to build bridges across lines of difference. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nExtremism has a knack for metastasizing and coming back to wreak havoc upon its hosts. Once a cohort or society builds a hateful mindset, the hatred takes on a life of its own. Extremist ideology not only hurts a society's enemies, but also eventually attacks from within and harms the society from which it originated. I first started observing this phenomenon abroad -- and it saddens but does not surprise me that we are starting to see it haunt American democracy too.\n Consider how the kingdom of Saudi Arabia disseminated the Wahhabi sect's fundamentalist attitudes against Jews and Christians at home and abroad. It helped to fund the madrassas that fostered the extreme perspectives that eventually contributed to the September 11th terror attacks on New York and Washington. Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden did not just seek to destroy Americans -- he wanted to destroy all things Western. The great irony is that his unbridled hatred had also prompted him to attack the Saudi kingdom, too. Bin Laden's extremist hunger was such that even the Saudi Wahhabis who helped inculcate his all-consuming intolerance could no longer prove pious enough in his eyes. His efforts to overthrow the Saudi monarchy launched an opposition movement that got him expelled from the country.\n In Israel too, the government has taken limited action to shut down the behavior of the so-called \"hilltop youth,\" extremist settlers who deem themselves highly religious despite not respecting the rabbis of the settlement. The lack of concerted effort to prevent and stop the group's rock throwing and vandalism of Palestinian villages gave these fired-up youth permission to spiral out of control, eventually leading them to attack the Israeli army, too.\n Or take the Beitar Jerusalem Israeli football club, notorious for its long history of not putting Arab players on the field. The club's most fanatical supporters finally became so extreme in their intolerance that Beitar Jerusalem's 2013 signing of two Russian League players who happened to be Muslim led to protests and anti-Arab chants against the very club that fueled the fans' racist fire. Arsonists set fire to the club's offices two days after the signing. More recently,  some of the fans targeted a Christian player from Niger simply because his name, Ali Mohamed, sounded Muslim.\n I recall a time in Germany, riding in a car with a German woman who was an authentic supporter of the OneVoice Movement I founded to foster Arab-Israeli understanding. She made a point of vehemently -- and sincerely -- condemning racism against Jews, but minutes later cursed out another driver and justified her tirade by casting slurs on Polish immigrants. She had superficially learned that the Holocaust was bad but had not internalized the dangers of bigotry against any group. If Polish people were not immune to her racism, to what other target would her hatred attach next?\n While Germany has done a better job than many other nations to take concerted actions (like making Holocaust denial illegal) to discourage anti-Semitism, it is also experiencing a surge in neo-Nazism, particularly against Turkish immigrants. All nations are challenged to address the intolerant mindset at the root of racism; otherwise that intolerance eventually resurfaces and comes back to haunt us.\n Here in the United States, there are Republican legislators and anchors on Fox News who have willingly participated in race-baiting and birtherism for years, even before President Trump hijacked the Republican Party. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has looked the other way for close to five years as Trump incites violence and sows mistrust in our system. And Wednesday morning, rather than lead with truth, Senator Ted Cruz gave contorted explanations for why he -- along with several other Republican senators and 121 House Representatives -- would indulge Trump's fabricated and fraudulent fantasies by objecting to certify the election results. Then came the insurrection. Mobs of Trump supporters, hopped up on Trump's conspiracy theory of a stolen election and encouraged to go to the Capitol by the President himself, stormed and vandalized our nation's Capitol building.\n It was the disturbing culmination of a months-long series of attempts by Trump to bully state officials into \"finding\" votes that would help him win the 2020 presidential election, as almost all Republican \"leaders\" stood by with stunning silence -- though elections officials in Georgia, headed by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, stood up for truth against pressure from Trump. To his credit, earlier on Wednesday, Mitch McConnell had sought to affirm that \"the voters, the courts, and the States have all spoken\" and that it was time for Trump to concede. But it was too little too late. McConnell himself  stood by while the seeds of extremism were planted, leading to -- in his words -- \"the unhinged crowd,\" or, in other words, the domestic terrorists who came for him and his fellow legislators.\n When thinking turns extreme, there is little room for nuance or aberration from the narrow mindset deemed acceptable. People become programmed to hear what they want to hear and tortured by cognitive dissonance when their own dogma does not stand to reason. When groups become so extreme in their thinking that they fail to realize the merits of an opinion from outside their \"tribe\" or when partisan fealty fuses into one's identity, one's values ultimately suffer.\n Trump and a small subgroup of his most radicalized and violent supporters, who include White supremacists and Neo-Nazis, are responsible for this dark chapter. Nothing can justify their sedition. But beyond this specific situation, it would be simplistic to believe that extreme ways of thinking reside exclusively within the right. All extremes are bound together by their intolerance for \"the other.\" The far-left's tendency to call others out and automatically cast judgment harms all of society by stifling the critical thinking, nuanced debate, and exchange of differing ideas that lead to progress -- the very progress for which progressives advocate. If  people feel \"cancelled\" or too intimidated to speak up, their repressed feelings are more likely to fester under the surface and emerge later in a more extreme form. The gap between both sides grows, leaving a vacuum of misunderstanding and division.\n When terrorists or violent extremists cross the line, the only recourse is to forcefully stop them and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. For society at large, independent thinking and even avoiding partisan fanaticism can be antidotes to unruly tribalism in the future. Embracing the middle space characterized by critical thinking and nuance gives us a pathway for avoiding absolutist and hateful thinking that preys on societies from both the outside and within. While extremists are passionate, moderates overwhelmingly outnumber them. We can seize back the agenda for reason by recognizing our individual power and duty to stand up, particularly against the sort of violent extremism and domestic terrorism we witnessed in our nation's capital.",

        "title": "Parler may be gone for now. That won't stop the calls to violence online ",
        "body_text": "Parler all but vanished from the internet this week. Major tech platforms, including Apple and Amazon, booted the social network popular with the far-right for what the companies said was a failure to moderate incitement and violent rhetoric on its service that contributed to last week's deadly Capitol riots.\n But that hasn't stopped angry Trump supporters from seeking out other digital gathering spaces, in what may now become a game of extremism whack-a-mole. Multiple alternatives have already claimed to have experienced a surge in sign-ups.\n The rush to find substitutes amid Parler's apparent demise at this time shows that deplatforming can succeed at sidelining extremism and driving it further out of the mainstream. Parler was already a tiny fraction of the size of larger platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and the alternatives may be smaller still. Parler didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n But this push to deplatform won't eliminate extremism entirely, according to experts who study extremism and online social movements.\n \"Although these are important actions to have taken, it would be foolish to think this has solved everything,\" said Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina--Chapel Hill who studies the role of social media in politics. That's because, McGregor said, many of Parler's most extreme users are likely to have been connected already on other, similar platforms even before Parler was taken down.\n \"Deplatforming certainly takes some wind out of the sails and makes it harder to organize on the same scale, but there's no reason to suspect this was the only place these people are connected,\" McGregor said.\n Even as Parler sued Amazon in federal court Monday over its decision to cut off service, calls for violence continued on more loosely moderated forums such as 4chan, with at least one thread reviewed by CNN Business floating the idea of physical attacks on tech company data centers. 4chan didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n Meanwhile, other alternative social networks appear to be benefiting from Parler's takedown. One post in a channel affiliated with the Proud Boys \u2014 a group whose members participated in the riot at the Capitol building \u2014 on the messaging app Telegram claimed that Telegram has now received tens of thousands of new users seeking refuge from Parler. Telegram didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but the app has surged to the number-two spot on Apple's own top charts.\n Telegram and Signal, an encrypted messaging app, went from tens of thousands of downloads on Jan. 7 to hundreds of thousands of downloads over the weekend, according to data from the app metrics firm Apptopia. Other apps including MeWe, a social networking app, have also experienced explosive growth over the weekend, Apptopia said. In the first week of 2021, MeWe was being downloaded a little more than 9,000 times a day in the US. But on Jan. 8, the day President Donald Trump was banned from Twitter, that number jumped to more than 13,000 and hit 39,000 by the end of Jan. 9. A similar pattern played out with apps for conservative television networks Newsmax and OANN, according to Apptopia.\n There may be other confounding explanations for the increase in these apps' popularity. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently endorsed the use of Signal, while a WhatsApp notification about how the app handles user data may have also driven some to embrace alternatives. But those events predated Trump's Twitter ban and Parler's deplatforming.\n \"Both apps have been breaking downloads records for themselves since Saturday,\" said Adam Blacker, Apptopia's VP of insights.\n Gab, another platform beloved by some conservatives, said it's added additional capacity after it claimed to have gained more users in a single weekend than in its first two years of existence. Gab itself was banned from platforms including Apple and Google's app stores, as well as various payment processors, after it was reported that the suspected shooter behind 2018's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre had maintained a profile on the app and expressed virulently anti-Semitic views. (At the time, Gab said it had been unfairly \"smeared\" and was \"under attack\" for defending free speech.)\n Gab bills itself as \"the free speech social network.\" It has boasted of having self-built much of the infrastructure it now operates upon, making it theoretically immune from what happened to Parler. In a post on Gab Monday, CEO Andrew Torba said the service is seeing \"roughly the population of Boston joining the site every 24 hours\" and warned those posting \"awful threats\" that Gab cooperates with law enforcement subpoenas.\n \"If abusing our site is your idea of a fun time you should think twice,\" Torba wrote.\n On Monday, Parler's lawsuit claimed that being cut off by Amazon Web Services would spell the nascent platform's \"death knell.\" The service, which launched in 2018 and attracted prominent figures in the Republican party like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, portrayed itself as an alternative to Facebook and Twitter that would be far more expansive in its interpretation of free speech. That same principle, however, appears to be what got the company into hot water with Apple, Google and Amazon.\n In a statement Monday evening, Amazon said the lawsuit has \"no merit\" and that Parler had violated its terms of service because of the violent content and incitement found on its site.\n \"We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening,\" Amazon said.\n Parler claimed in its lawsuit that after Amazon flagged numerous examples of violent content, \"over the last few days Parler had removed everything AWS had brought to its attention and more,\" while alleged hateful posts on other social networks did not result in Amazon sanctions.\n In some ways, the notoriety associated with Parler is a distraction, according to Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Some of the groups that descended on the Capitol last week may have organized to some extent on Parler, but many have long been part of other online communities that predate Parler entirely. Armed militia groups, he said, have for years organized on military forums and chatrooms.\n \"There's no central hub where everyone goes to plan an insurrection,\" he said.\n Brookie added: \"What a lot of this large-scale deplatforming does is limit the ability of these groups to reach new audiences.\"\n But, he warned, there may be a cost: \"Those who are already engaged in these type of online communities are more likely to become more hardened [in their convictions].\"",

        "body_text": "A high-ranking official with the New York Police Department has been suspended without pay and is now the subject of an internal disciplinary process after a string of racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic posts, the NYPD confirmed.\n Late last year, an investigation by the City Council connected Deputy Inspector James Francis Kobel to a user under the name \"Clouseau.\" Under that identity, he routinely posted offensive messages on a public law enforcement message board attacking Black people, Muslims, the Hasidic Jewish community and others with extremely derogatory language, according to a draft report from the New York City Council Oversight and Investigations Division.\n Kobel was the commanding officer of the police department's Office of Equal Employment and Opportunity, which is responsible for investigating employment and harassment claims.\n In November, he was relieved of his command and placed on modified duty after the City Council investigation but will now face a 30-day suspension without pay, the department said. He has also filed for retirement from the police force, the NYPD confirmed to CNN.\n \"Deputy Inspector Kobel has served the City of New York and the NYPD honorably for nearly 29 years,\" Chris Monahan, President of the Captains Endowment Association said in a statement. \"Given the current political climate and anti-police sentiment, DI Kobel did not see it as possible to get a fair administrative trial and decided to avail himself of the opportunity to file for retirement.\"\n Even if he goes through the disciplinary process and is dismissed, Kobel can still be eligible for his pension benefits, according to the NYPD.\n CNN reached out to Kobel for comment.\n \"Clouseau\" posted to \"Law Enforcement Rant,\" a public internet messaging board where police officers often vent their job grievances, between July 2019 and September 2020.\n The user used disparaging language to refer to elected officials, including former President Barack Obama and Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark, who is a Black woman, the report claimed.\n He allegedly used slurs to describe two NYPD officers, who are women of color. And he insulted Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold, along with this mother, the report said.\n He also attacked athletes in the NFL for kneeling in protest of police brutality, and perpetuated stereotypes about the Hasidic Jewish community as Covid-19 cases increased in New York in March.\n Kobel has told The New York Times that he did not post on the \"Rant\" and was unfamiliar with \"Clouseau.\"\n But investigators said they were able to identify him by matching information provided in the posts with publicly available personal information about Kobel.\n Both \"Clouseau\" and Kobel joined the NYPD at the same time, held the rank of captain or higher in 2019 and were on the job in February 2020,\" the report said. The authors also wrote that the two had served in the NYPD Housing Bureau under the same former chief. And details that \"Clouseau\" shared -- such as when his parents died, where his in-laws live, where he proposed to his wife and how many parishioners of his church died in the 9/11 attacks -- corresponded to information about Kobel.\n \"The Rant\" was shutdown last month.\n The disturbing comments Kobel is alleged to have made came to light as law enforcement departments around the nation face scrutiny for explicit and implicit racism within their ranks and grapple with calls to increase accountability.\n City Councilman and Congressman-elect Ritchie Torres, who oversaw the report, called for Kobel to resign in November.\n \"The virulent bigotry of Deputy Inspector James Kobel has no place in the NYPD, much less in the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity,\" Torres said in a statement to CNN. \"The shocking nature of his misconduct calls for nothing less than termination.\"\n Monahan said in a statement to CNN at the time that Kobel is a \"dedicated professional\" who adamantly denies these allegations.\n \"Unfortunately, he has conducted thousands of internal investigations over the last several years,\" Monahan said. \"Clearly, he has angered some people along the way. In any event, he looks forward to being fully exonerated when all the facts come out.\"\n NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said the department interviewed Kobel the day it received the allegation.\n \"Within the two weeks, where we are in the investigation now, we thought it was prudent to relieve the deputy inspector of his current assignment, pending the outcome,\" Shea said. \"That is a drastic step, but we thought it was the appropriate step due to the nature of his assignment, as well as the allegations and what we have learned thus far.\"\n CNN's Brynn Gingras, Sonia Moghe, Harmeet Kaur and Alec Snyder contributed to this report.",

        "title": "This is the right-wing media problem in a microcosm",
        "body_text": "Nicole Hemmer is an associate research scholar at Columbia University with the Obama Presidency Oral History Project and the author of \"Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.\" She co-hosts the history podcast \"Past Present\" and \"This Day in Esoteric Political History.\" The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nShortly after the Capitol attack on January 6, several media companies leapt into action, scrambling to modify the infrastructures of misinformation that had been a source of steady profits throughout the Trump years.\n Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies pulled the plug on President Donald Trump's accounts.  while Google, Apple and Amazon de-platformed Parler, a social media site popular among far-right users.  In its letter to Parler, Amazon Web Services included nearly a hundred examples of posters inciting violence, calling for, among other things, hangings, bombings and targeted assassinations of politicians and journalists.\n But perhaps the most surprising announcement came from Cumulus Media. The talk radio company, which carries popular right wing shows hosted by Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino, circulated an internal memo (first reported by Inside Music Media and later the Washington Post) telling hosts they needed to stop spreading false information about the election.\n \"We need to help induce national calm NOW,\" the memo said. \"The election has been resolved and there are no alternate acceptable 'paths.'\" Saying otherwise on air would lead to immediate termination.\n This announcement stands out because it takes aim at a major sector of right wing media: talk radio. With tens of millions of listeners every week, right wing talk radio has been the backbone of conservative media for 30 years. Stemming the tide of misinformation coming over their airwaves will be a formidable challenge, one that even Cumulus likely will find difficult to achieve. And even if it succeeds, it will have only slowed the supply of conspiracies and misinformation and done little to address the demand.\n The insurrection at the Capitol was fueled by a steady stream of misinformation and disinformation about the election, coming from the President, his legal team and the nonstop propaganda networks of right wing media. And while most eyes were on Fox News and Newsmax in the aftermath of the election, where at least some reporters and hosts dealt in the realities of President-elect Joe Biden's victory, on the right's radio airwaves, there was little dissension about the story they were telling about the election.\n Hosts like Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh detailed false conspiracies involving Dominion voting machines and mass election night fraud. Conspiracist Sidney Powell, part of the president's legal team, may have been relegated to the fringes on Fox News after a lacerating takedown by Tucker Carlson, but she continues to be welcomed with open arms as a guest over on the AM dial.\n The Cumulus directive threatens to put a stop to at least some of this (though some of the biggest hosts, like Beck, Hannity and Limbaugh, are not distributed through Cumulus so not subject to its dictates). In putting access to Cumulus outlets on the line, the company is threatening to hit its hosts where it hurts: their pocketbooks. And profit is a major driver for what appears on right wing radio, part of the calculus, along with ideology and personality, for which stories and arguments appear on a given show.\n Directives from management can have a profound effect on the nature of conservative talk radio. For much of the Trump years, we've seen that work in a pro-Trump direction, as radio companies booted anti-Trump hosts and websites purged writers who were insufficiently enthusiastic about the President. Seemingly shocked into action by the horrific scene unfolding at the US Capitol, Cumulus's leadership reversed course. If other companies follow Cumulus's lead, it could have a real impact on how these shows talk about the election, and how much misinformation they dispense.\n It is, anyway, more likely to have an impact than another idea that is frequently floated by people worried about Trump-era misinformation: the revival of the Fairness Doctrine. A broadcast regulation put in place by the Federal Communications Commission in the late 1940s, the Fairness Doctrine directed stations to cover controversial issues fairly, presenting all sides of the subject. It was abolished in 1987 by Ronald Reagan's FCC.\n But the Fairness Doctrine was the product of another time, a time before cable and satellite opened up the broadcast spectrum to allow more voices. It was also a time when more Americans trusted both journalists and the government to serve as arbiters of what was factual and fair (imagine a Trump FCC dictating the boundaries of debates over climate change or electoral processes if you'd like to see how badly a reinstituted Fairness Doctrine might play out).\n Corporate directives that limit the broadcasting of misinformation can have a real impact on radio, though they certainly don't silence hosts who choose to strike out on their own. Michael Savage, a right wing nationalist broadcaster who has been banned from entering Britain since 2009 for \"unacceptable behavior\" that could \"lead to inter-community violence,\" just left Cumulus at the start of the new year. He is now producing a podcast rather than a radio broadcast. The day after the attack, he praised Ashli Babbitt, the woman shot and killed as she forced her way into the Speaker's Lobby, directly outside the House chamber, and claimed falsely that \"she was executed by one of Pence's security guards.\"\n But the real limit to these corporate media directives, and to the moves by social media sites, is that they only address one side of the problem. Make no mistake: These entities are responsible for amplifying and disseminating massive amounts of misinformation and conspiracies, which has done serious harm to the political culture of the United States, and to our democracy more broadly.\n The conspiracy crisis in US politics, though, is at least as much one of demand as supply. There are millions of Americans marinating in conspiracy and hungry for more. That is a social problem, not a technological or regulatory one. And while the efforts to fix our media systems over the past few days matter, we cannot lose sight of the larger cultural crisis that continues to fuel our crisis of democracy.",

        "title": "Trump visits his border wall on the heels of deadly Capitol Hill riot ",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump bookended his administration's focus on immigration with a trip to his signature border wall on the US-Mexico border, a visit on the heels of a deadly riot on Capitol Hill incited by the President as House Democrats prepare a second impeachment vote.\n On Tuesday, Trump traveled to Alamo, Texas, near the border, to mark the completion of more than 450 miles of wall -- a trip that caters to the supporters who put him in office in 2016 despite heightening tensions nationwide and a raging pandemic.\n The border wall, which Trump repeatedly cited over the last four years as an accomplishment, cost US taxpayers -- not Mexico -- billions and became emblematic of the President's restrictionist immigration policies, which largely sealed the US off from immigrants and refugees.\n During a brief speech near the wall, Trump listed off a series of those policies Tuesday, citing them as accomplishments and calling them \"historic.\" Indeed, many of the policies rolled out over the last four years are unprecedented, including requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their immigration court date in the US and swiftly removing migrants arriving at the southern border under a public health order. Immigrant advocates and lawyers have challenged the policies in court, arguing that they put migrants in harm's way.\n President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to undo Trump's policies and halt construction of the border wall, a move Trump warned against.\n \"We can't let the next administration even think about taking (the border wall) down, if you can believe that,\" Trump said. \"I don't think that will happen. I think when you see what it does and how it's so important to our country nobody's going to be touching it.\"\n He also briefly referred to last week's insurrection, appealing for \"peace and calm\" in a brief scripted portion of his speech.\n \"Now is the time for our nation to heal,\" he said, the sentiment entirely undercut by his attacks on Democrats and tech companies.\n On the eve of the visit, Mayor Jim Darling of neighboring McAllen, Texas, acknowledged that tensions are high. This was to be Trump's first public appearance since speaking on the National Mall last Wednesday, shortly before his supporters forced their way into the US Capitol.\n \"I understand that emotions are high on both sides, for or against, the President, and I hope that if there are demonstrations for or against, that they are peaceful with respect to our law enforcement personnel,\" Darling said.\n Since January 2017, roughly $15 billion has been identified to construct around 738 miles of border wall through different funds, including those made available through Trump's declaration of a national emergency.\n Of the roughly 453 miles, the majority replaces old, dilapidated barriers with a new enhanced wall system, a marked difference from the fencing previously constructed in some regions. Forty-seven miles have gone up where no barriers previously existed, according to Customs and Border Protection.\n In the waning days of Trump's presidency, the White House is continuing to push relevant federal agencies to obligate funds available for the wall regardless of whether land has been obtained for construction, CNN has learned -- a move seemingly intended to tie up funds prior to President-elect Joe Biden taking office.\n Customs and Border Protection said last week that it's pressing forward on awarding border wall contracts, including in areas where private land hasn't been acquired, an unusual move that will complicate Biden's pledge to halt construction.\n Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf repeatedly touted the border wall and the pace of construction. On Monday, Wolf resigned, citing ongoing litigation challenging the validity of his appointment.\n The Trump administration took a series of steps to erect additional barriers along the southern border, including declaring a national emergency to access additional funds, filing dozens of lawsuits to acquire private land, and waiving environmental and contracting laws to expedite construction.\n As construction got underway, leadership at the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly rotated and those at the top were often in the position of placating the President's whims on the border wall, according to a former DHS official, who cited the push to paint the wall black and add spikes despite not having operational value.\n Trump's wall will likely continue to be a point of contention into the new administration.\n \"Building a wall will do little to deter criminals and cartels seeking to exploit our borders,\" Biden's plan reads. \"Instead of stealing resources from schools for military children and recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, Biden will direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts, like investments in improving screening infrastructure at our ports of entry, that will actually keep America safer.\"\n Biden's promise to put a stop to construction prompted discussions among Customs and Border Protection officials about what would occur in that event, particularly if funding is cut, according to a Homeland Security official. A US official previously told CNN that some contracts can be modified and government lawyers are discussing what happens with acquisition of private land, but no decisions had been made.\n CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "2020 was one of the deadliest years for law enforcement officers in history, according to a group that tracks officer deaths in the line of duty.\n A report released Monday by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF) found that 264 federal, state, military, tribal and local law enforcement officers to date died in the line of duty last year -- the highest since 1974.\n The reason that number is so high: Covid-19.\n Law enforcement officers died last year of numerous causes, among them vehicle crashes, heart attacks and gun shots. But more officers died of Covid-19 than all other causes combined, with 145 out of the 264 deaths attributed to the virus.\n \"It's going to go down in history as one of the deadliest years for law enforcement,\" said Marcia Ferranto, CEO of NLEOMF. \"Of course, it's due to Covid. The alarming thing is these are just the preliminary numbers.\"\n The organization is still working to certify an additional 70 to 80 Covid-19 related deaths, Ferranto said. And as more continue to be reported daily, she expects the total line of duty Covid-19 deaths in 2020 to double.\n If that holds true, that would make last year the deadliest year for law enforcement on record. By the organization's count, 1930 saw the most line of duty deaths to date, with more than 300 officers dying on the job.\n Ferranto said her organization examines official records and works with law enforcement departments and agencies to determine whether the officers who have died of Covid-19 contracted the virus while conducting official duties.\n Those who died after being exposed to the virus on the job are ultimately included as part of NLEOMF's line of duty death toll.\n So many officers lost their lives to Covid-19 that the NLEOMF had to create a task force to help verify all the deaths.\n How badly officers were affected by the virus depended on where they lived, according to the report. Police had among the highest number of Covid-19 line of duty deaths in Texas, New York, New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, 26 states lost no officers in the line of duty to coronavirus.\n The Officer Down Memorial Page, another group that tracks line of duty officer deaths, reported similar numbers. As of Monday, the group's website lists more than 300 officers who died in the line of duty last year, more than 180 of them from Covid-19.\n \"An additional 200+ COVID line of duty deaths are still pending verification, so 2020 may eventually turn out to be the deadliest year for law enforcement in U.S. history due to the COVID pandemic,\" the Officer Down Memorial Page wrote in a January 8 Facebook post.\n After Covid-19, getting shot was the second most common cause of line of duty deaths last year.\n Forty-eight officers were shot and killed on the job last year, compared to 51 in 2019, the report stated. Thirty of those officers were killed by a handgun, 13 were killed by a rifle and one was killed with their own weapon. The type of weapon used in the four other deaths is not yet known.\n The largest number of firearms-related deaths came while officers were investigating a suspicious person or activity, with 11 such fatalities. Seven were responding to domestic disturbance calls.\n Traffic-related incidents were the third leading cause of line of duty deaths, though the number has been trending down in decades, according to the report.\n Last year, 44 officers were killed in traffic incidents, with 18 in crashes with another vehicle, 15 struck on the side of the road, eight in single vehicle crashes and three in motorcycle crashes. In 2019, 43 officers died in traffic incidents.\n Overall, city law enforcement officers were the hardest hit last year, with 122 line of duty deaths, the report stated. Next were sheriffs with 68 deaths, followed by 31 state and highway patrol deaths.",

On Monday, as acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf resigned, CNN reported that the FBI had received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. Capitol Police officers are under investigation for their behavior during the riot; two have been suspended.\n So was the storming of the Capitol a spontaneous event, or was it part of something more orchestrated?\n There is mounting evidence to justify profound concern and urgent investigations may face barricades of stonewalling.\n Yet, it is imperative that we find out what exactly happened on January 6, and what may still be unfolding. It requires an investigation on two levels at two speeds.\n First, the FBI and law enforcement agencies must track down and detain the instigators and ascertain what might remain on their agenda for the coming days. This is particularly pressing because the day after the assault, when President Donald Trump finally agreed to a peaceful transfer of power, in a video that was taped at the White House and over which he reportedly \"expressed regret,\" he told his supporters, \"Our incredible journey is only just beginning.\"\n Separately, Congress must establish a bipartisan committee to pull every thread and see what unravels.\n The generally accepted version of what played out is that a mass of passionate Trump followers gathered on the day Congress would certify Biden's electoral victory. After Trump and his proxies inflamed their anger over the legitimate election results into a fiery frenzy, they seemingly followed his instructions and headed to the Capitol. There, Capitol Police failed to stop them. The failure of law enforcement, according to this narrative, was the result of a mixture of lack of preparation, poor communications, race of the perpetrators and possibly sympathy for the rioters among some who were supposed to stop them.\n But is this an accurate recounting of what occurred?\n Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the day's events was the failure of National Guard forces to respond quickly. The timeline is mind-boggling.\n At a rally held the night before the riot, attendees heard former national security adviser Michael Flynn tell them Americans were prepared to \"bleed\" for freedom. At Wednesday's rally, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani advocated for \"trial by combat\" to settle the election. Then came Trump's instructions:  \"fight like hell.\" Following Trump's speech, and his false promise to join them there, they stormed the Capitol.\n By 1:18 p.m. on Wednesday, multiple officers had already been injured, according to a Wall Street Journal reconstruction. At 1:41 p.m., a citywide \"Broken Arrow\" alert went out reporting the rioters had overrun the police. By 3 p.m., The Wall Street Journal reported that at least three key officials had urgently requested support from the National Guard, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, and Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who has since resigned.\n Details of their conversations reveal mounting anguish and bafflement as the Pentagon failed to swiftly approve and deploy the troops. Sund told The Washington Post that he pleaded, \"I am making an urgent, urgent immediate request for National Guard assistance,\" he implored, \"I have got to get boots on the ground.\"\n At the same time, Hogan was trying to get the Pentagon to approve deployment of Maryland's guard, but like Sund, he says the urgent request was met with inexplicable delays.\n Sund told The Washington Post he asked six separate times. Hogan, who had approved Maryland's deployment, told CNN it took two hours to get the necessary authorization.\n With people getting killed in the Capitol mayhem, the troops were nowhere to be found. Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, the director of the Army Staff, reportedly disputed Sund's account and said in a Monday statement that authorization to activate the National Guard came approximately 40 minutes after the start of a conference call between officials around 2:20 p.m. However, the first National Guard personnel did not arrive on the scene until 5:40 p.m. By the time the mob withdrew, four people lay dead, and one Capitol Police officer was so severely injured he died the next day.\n What happened? Why did it take so long for help to arrive?\n Many have accurately noted that Black Lives Matter social justice protests have faced much stiffer security, but one historian who has watched multiple protests on Capitol Hill, says he saw more security in other pro-Trump demonstrations. Was the Capitol left deliberately underprotected?\n Once inside, according to Rep. Jim Clyburn, some rioters headed straight for his office, which is unmarked. \"That to me indicated, something untoward may have been going on,\" he told CNN.\n Investigators should answer questions about why, in the midst of the assault, Trump and Giuliani phoned senators and asked them to try to delay the vote on certifying Biden's win. Giuliani said it was because he wanted the process slowed down \"so we can get these legislatures to get more information to you.\" But was something more supposed to happen in the aftermath of the Capitol's occupation?\n If the rampage was nothing more than a spontaneous rally that spun out of control, why were some of the men who occupied the Capitol carrying bundles of flex-cuffs, the plastic restraints used by law enforcement to detain suspects?\n If it was all an unplanned protest gone off the rails, why did authorities discover pipe bombs in the area?\n And what about the truck, parked two blocks from the Capitol and carrying 11 homemade bombs built in such a way that federal investigators said if exploded would have the effect of napalm. Court documents said the explosive-filled mason jars and supplies found closely packed together could have made for a \"destructive device.\" Authorities say other participants brought guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n There's no question that Trump has been trying to overturn the legitimate, democratic result of the election. His followers believed they were about to help him succeed. But we need to know if their attack on the citadel of American democracy was the result of overflowing emotion, or if it was something more sinister. Something even worse than what we saw in those images that will remain engraved in the country's collective memory. Something that will not end with a Trump impeachment.",

        "body_text": "The New York Times (NYT) is facing fresh blowback for how it handled the fallout over falsehoods unearthed in \"Caliphate,\" the paper's award-winning, 12-part podcast about the Islamic State.\n A group of 24 public radio stations sent a letter on Monday to The Times audio department with concerns about \"lapses in judgment\" in its response last month when the paper announced that the podcast \"did not meet our standards for accuracy.\" These stations broadcast \"The Daily,\" The Times' flagship daily news podcast. The letter, obtained by CNN Business, was earlier tweeted by Washington Post's Erik Wemple.\n The Times started an investigation into the reporting process behind \"Caliphate\" in September after Canadian police charged Shehroze Chaudhry with \"Hoax-Terrorist activity.\" Last month, The Times said it \"found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the 'Caliphate' podcast,\" according to an editor's note, and affixed audio corrections to the episodes.\n These journalistic errors have been a black mark on The Times' audio ambitions led by the team behind \"The Daily.\" \"Caliphate\" won the 2018 Peabody in the radio/podcast category, a prestigious journalism award, which The Times has since returned.\n Monday's letter, sent by the Public Radio Program Directors Association, focused not on the merit of the podcast but on the way The Times handled the fallout. It expressed three concerns. The first of which was regarding the host of \"The Daily,\" Michael Barbaro, who contacted other journalists in what was perceived as an attempt to try to sway their coverage of the \"Caliphate\" fallout. These messages were previously reported by NPR's David Folkenflik, who had been among those Barbaro contacted.\n The final concern was about Andy Mills, a producer of \"Caliphate.\" The letter takes issue with Mills being given \"greater visibility\" following the fallout whereas Rukmini Callimachi, the journalist behind the podcast, was reassigned. Mills had produced and hosted an episode of \"The Daily\" that released a few days after The Times announced the results of their investigation into the \"Caliphate\" podcast. The letter also linked to a Washington Post story about allegations of inappropriate behavior by Mills, most of which occurred at his previous job at WNYC's Radiolab.\n Abby Goldstein, president and executive director of the Public Radio Program Directors Association, told CNN Business on Tuesday that the letter was intended to communicate concerns and not \"draw a line in the sand\" with specific demands.\n \"When we put programming on the air for our audiences, we're endorsing that programming. We're telling our audiences we believe in the journalistic rigor of these programs, and we're making them available to you through our biggest megaphone,\" Goldstein said. The letter is \"really about taking responsibility for the behavior of the staff.\"\n The Times responded on Tuesday to each of the concerns in a letter signed by Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor at the paper.\n \"We believe we've handled what was a significant journalistic lapse with accountability. We are deeply committed to continuing to pursue ambitious audio journalism and have already begun implementing changes that will make our audio report even stronger,\" Dolnick wrote.\n Dolnick wrote that The Times did not believe Barbaro had to disclose his relationship with Tobin since the conversation was seen as an \"audio version\" of an editor's note whereas an \"accountability interview\" was given to NPR. He also said Barbaro \"deeply regrets\" the private messages he sent journalists and that \"editors have discussed their expectations with him going forward.\"\n Regarding Mills, Dolnick wrote that The Times is taking the allegations of misconduct \"very seriously.\" As to why Mills hosted the recent episode of \"The Daily,\" Dolnick said the episode had been previously scheduled but that the company \"should have changed plans.\"\n The Times did not comment beyond the letter. Barbaro and Mills did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "title": "Defiant Trump denounces violence but takes no responsibility for inciting deadly riot",
        "body_text": "A defiant President Donald Trump insisted Tuesday his speech inciting the riot at the US Capitol was \"totally appropriate\" while at the same time calling for \"no violence\" in his first public remarks to reporters after the insurrection last week.\n Later, Trump likened attempts to impeach him for a second time to a \"witch hunt\" and baselessly warned that his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, might be removed from office himself.\n Trump assumed no responsibility for what happened last Wednesday, despite telling his supporters in the hour beforehand to \"fight like hell.\" And he did not specifically decry attempts to find and kill political leaders, including his own vice president.\n Instead, speaking at the White House and later at Joint Base Andrews before departing for Texas, Trump suggested attempts by Democrats and tech companies to rein in his dangerous rhetoric could themselves lead to violence.\n He falsely said those who'd analyzed his remarks before the deadly insurrection attempt had found no fault in them.\n \"They've analyzed my speech, my words,\" he said. \"Everybody to a T thought it was appropriate.\"\n It was a characteristically belligerent stance for a President who enters his final week in office under looming threat of a second impeachment. As he has previously, Trump sought to deflect blame on Democrats and equivocated on his own role in fomenting dangerous behavior.\n He claimed the \"real problem\" is what other politicians said about protests over the summer in Seattle and Portland, Oregon.\n It was only in an aside that he said: \"You always have to avoid violence.\"\n Standing in front of a newly constructed stretch of border wall, Trump opened his speech by declaring: \"Free speech is under assault like never before.\"\n \"The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration,\" he said without evidence, referring to renewed talk of invoking the Constitution to remove him from office.\n Only in a brief scripted portion of his speech did Trump appeal for \"peace and calm.\"\n \"Now is the time for our nation to heal,\" he said, the sentiment entirely undercut by his attacks on Democrats and tech companies.\n Earlier, as he departed the White House, the President denounced Democrats pursuing his historic second impeachment, seeming to imply they could provoke a violent response.\n \"This impeachment is causing tremendous anger, and you're doing it and it's really a terrible thing that they're doing,\" he told reporters on the White House South Lawn. \"For Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country, and it's causing tremendous anger. I want no violence.\"\n He similarly said the decisions by Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to suspend his accounts were causing fury among his supporters -- suggesting that could itself cause violence, and not his own language fanning violence among his base.\n \"It causes a lot of problems and a lot of anger,\" he said. \"There's always a counter-move when they do that.\"\n Trump's remarks on the White House South Lawn were his first in days and his first engagement with reporters in weeks.\n He has isolated himself in the White House following riots at the US Capitol that he incited during a rally in the hour beforehand.\n Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that Trump's comments taking no responsibility for the attack on the Capitol were \"despicable.\"\n \"What Trump did today, blaming others for what he caused, is a pathological technique used by the worst of dictators,\" said Schumer. \"Trump causes the anger. He causes the divisiveness. He foments the violence and blames others for it. That is despicable.\"\n Trump was slow to condemn the protests, which he watched on television from the dining room next to the Oval Office. He was convinced by advisers that a forceful denunciation of his own supporters was necessary, both because he was facing removal from office and because he faces potential legal questions about his role in inciting the riots.\n Later, Trump appeared to some aides to regret taping a video in which he denounced the violence and conceded he would not be serving a second term in office.\n Trump spent the weekend largely in isolation, as aides either distanced themselves from him or limited their time in his presence. Trump canceled a planned trip to Camp David, where his closest aides were hoping he would get into a good mindset ahead of his final stretch in office. Instead, he spent the weekend stewing to his deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino, and entered his final full week angrier than ever.\n Despite Trump's comments Tuesday, advisers and lawyers speaking with Trump in recent days have encouraged him to soften his rhetoric and denounce violence in order to reduce his legal liability for the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, two sources familiar with the discussions told CNN's Jim Acosta.\n \"Lawyers have been recommending a de-escalation of rhetoric, not just for the good of the country, but also to reduce the risk of legal jeopardy,\" one source familiar with the discussions said.\n The sources said Trump has been told in the days following the siege at the Capitol that he could be charged with inciting violence by local and federal authorities and be sued by relatives of the victims who were harmed in the insurrection.\n \"He absolutely can be sued,\" a separate source said, reflecting concerns among Trump's advisers that the President's actions have once again put himself in legal jeopardy.\n CNN's Jim Acosta and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "On Monday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley was asked whether President Donald Trump felt \"emasculated\" by being de-platformed from Twitter and Facebook. To which he said this: \"The most masculine person I think to ever hold the White House is the President of the United States.\"\n Yes, really. He said it. You can watch it yourself right here:\n Now, it's worth noting here that Trump has a badly misshapen sense of what being \"masculine\" actually is. He thinks being a man means being \"tough.\" As I wrote back in June 2020:\n \"His idea of strength and toughness is deeply distorted, twisted and gnarled over many decades of grievance and bravado. See, for Trump, being strong and being tough is tied directly to winning, to dominating, to using overwhelming force to get a desired result.\n \"In his mind, might makes right. And the world is split between people willing to use their power over others and those too afraid to exert it.\"\n Masculinity is, for Trump, tied up in power and being a tough guy. Or at least acting like a tough guy.\n But even by Trump's own standards of masculinity, when you compare Trump to the men who have held the office of the presidency, I'm not sure he could possibly measure up to some of them. With an assist from CNN's Kyle Feldscher, here's a brief look at some of the more \"masculine\" men who have served as president.\n * George Washington was the nation's greatest general of his time, winning the Revolutionary War and establishing our current republic.\n * Teddy Roosevelt was shot in 1912 outside of his hotel but went on to deliver a speech that night anyway -- with the bullet still inside him! \"It takes more than that to kill a bull moose,\" he told the crowd.\n * George H.W. Bush was shot down over the Pacific while serving as an aviator during World War II.\n * Ulysses Grant led American troops to a victory in the Civil War. As he was dying from throat cancer and could no longer speak, Grant ground out his famed memoir to keep his wife out of poverty after he passed.\n * Rutherford B. Hayes/ William McKinley: Both served in the Union Army during the Civil War and sustained repeated wounds as a result. (McKinley's horse was shot out from under him in one battle; he lived -- and continued the charge.)\n The point here is two-fold:\n 1) Trump's idea of masculinity is deeply flawed.\n 2) Even by that flawed standard -- or really any standard -- he is nowhere close to being the \"most masculine person\" to ever hold the White House.\n That claim, like so much that has come out of the White House over the past four years, is utter bunk.",

        "title": "America's education system is in need of dramatic reform",
        "body_text": "In attempting to get American life back to \"normal\" in 2021, one of the first agenda items will be making up for a disrupted, disjointed year of school. The Biden administration's pick for education secretary, Miguel Cardona, will inherit not only the problems associated with a pandemic but the systemic problems American K-12 education had long before. This week I talk to David M. Perry, a journalist and historian, as well as Geoffrey Canada, president of the Harlem Children's Zone, about what comes next for American education. But first, Perry writes our CNN op-ed. -- SE Cupp\n Imagine it's August 2021, and the kids are finally able to go back to school without fear of a global pandemic. Parents rejoice. So do teachers. We all give thanks to the medical and logistical experts who rolled out an unprecedented vaccine distribution.\n But even if we've gotten the danger under control, big questions about the future of K-12 education still confront the nation. Can distance learning be deployed in the future to ease inequality rather than exacerbate it? How can those children most in need get help with the academic and psychological burdens of the last year?\n These pressing issues, along with a host of non-pandemic-related ones that have gone unresolved, will face President-elect Joe Biden and his nominee for secretary of education, Miguel Cardona.\n The time to start preparing for the next academic school year is now. Throughout the pandemic, we have been falling behind, reacting (understandably) to the crisis of the moment, instead of building capacity for the next year. There's very little that can be done to fix this February; but a better August is still on the table.\n The future of remote education is complicated. It's a powerful tool not just during this pandemic but also for kids who have to bus a long way to reach a school building, during snow days or extreme weather events (and not just natural disasters, but also heat waves since schools are often not air-conditioned), and perhaps most of all for children who are learning better from home than they did in school.\n I've been thinking a lot about a middle-school student I know. He very bright, but he's never done well in school. He had trouble staying focused in the busy classroom -- getting distracted or tuning everyone out -- and then forgetting to turn in work. His perceived failures crushed his sense of self-worth. Now he sits down every day next to a parental figure, opens his laptop and gets straight As.\n We need to keep the flexibility we've developed on the fly for kids like him. The Department of Education can provide guidance on maintaining that flexibility, articulating the rights of students when it comes to mode of delivery for their educations, and convening (and funding) experts to look at successes and to figure out how to build on them.\n On the other hand, remote learning has been a disaster for so many. Poor children, especially those multiply marginalized by racial bias, disability, nationality and other categories of difference, have not received the same quality of remote education as more affluent children. A recent study found that while many students are behind where they should be -- students of color are averaging three months to five months behind, while White students average one month to three months.\n Part of this, of course, is due to the wildly variable resources in America's public schools. Schools can and often do provide cheap laptops to students, a practice that should be continued, though the supply chain that gets laptops to students can be backlogged. Still, this program is well-suited to support via existing or expanded federal funding.\n But an even bigger problem is disparate access to high-speed internet. The United States has long treated internet as a product to be sold in markets where money can be made, i.e. where middle-class and rich people live in sufficient density. This has left poor communities both in cities and in rural America operating at slower speeds. It was never really acceptable, but it's a travesty when it comes to trying to attend public school remotely.\n This undertaking is going to require massive investment, but the Department of Education can begin by reigniting a Housing and Urban Development program initiated by former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro under President Barack Obama to bring broadband to public housing. There's still a long way to go, but Cardona grew up in public housing himself, so he understands this challenge and would make an excellent partner in reviving this initiative.\n Then the Biden administration needs a program to turn broadband into a utility -- a right rather than a product -- and extend it into rural America. Covid-19 has revealed how essential online connectivity (for work as well as school) is, and the expansion cannot be left to corporate America alone. Biden should draw on the spirit of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal that brought electricity into rural Tennessee -- and make national broadband part of his early economic recovery efforts.\n But even with all the infrastructure in the world, for many disabled children, including my son, distance learning is a complete failure regardless of how fast the data flows. He's a 13-year-old non-speaking autistic boy with Down syndrome. Left alone in his room, as I tracked recently for my own records, he needs in-person help around 100 times a day (from logging in and clicking into a session, to having the teachers understand what he's pointing at, to just keeping him focused).\n He wants to learn, and our state department of education has ruled that the school district \"may\" permit parents like us to hire an in-person aide and have the school district fund it, but our district has thus refused to allow this for any families. (The Mounds View School district, where I live, declined to comment or provide a rationale for this piece.) Many other districts in the country have made similar decisions, though circumstances vary widely. Cardona needs to lead the way to change that \"may\" to a \"must\" and make sure that whatever reasonable accommodations disabled children need, they get.\n Of course, remote learning is the elephant in the room when it comes to public education in the age of Covid-19, but there's another disaster looming in terms of how students are evaluated. According to a recent study of one school district in Fairfax County, Virginia, students are failing in the literal sense of getting \"F\" grades. Meanwhile, over the last 20 years, the Department of Education has doubled, then tripled down on the importance of testing, testing and more testing.\n Test scores are likely going to be a disaster in 2021, too. Back last March I argued for a \"pass/fail\" approach to school at all levels (and, arguably, work and life, too), but while many schools did in fact offer considerable grading latitude then, it hasn't lasted.\n And yet this winter is arguably harder than last April and May, when most schools went remote for the first time. Everything -- from work to remote schooling -- is likely to get harder to manage as our daily infection and death toll continue to rise though this dark winter. Standardized tests should be canceled wherever possible, with schools encouraged to wipe the year away (or at least offer to do so) from the GPA of all students who are struggling.\n Abolishing some testing will, most likely, not spell the end of rigor and might even occasion rethinking some of the reliance on that kind of data when it comes to assessing schools. That's a complex request, requiring strong federal leadership because the tests are tied to school funding at the national level and many districts link pay to test results. But we must act because our children are struggling enough without letting \"Fs\" or low test scores drag them down further.\n When it comes to education, there are also plenty of non-pandemic-related challenges ahead of Biden and Cardona, as well as for every school district in America. I'm hoping that Cardona will work on the school-to-prison pipeline (which hits disabled non-White children especially hard) by banning restraint and seclusion practices, the incarceration of children for offenses like not doing homework and getting cops out of schools. On this issue, Betsy  DeVos, who just resigned after leading the Department of Education since 2017, has either made things worse or at best neglected the pressing elements of it.\n Across society, the pandemic has intensified preexisting inequalities and, perhaps, made them more visible to folks who weren't paying attention previously. The problems in our schools exacerbated by a year of distance, lockdowns, fear and unequal access aren't new. But as we transition out of the Trump presidency -- and then, eventually, the pandemic -- every school, every official, every state education department and especially the Biden administration has an opportunity to ease the burdens of a lost year and to try to do things better in the future. It's an opportunity we can't afford to squander.",

        "body_text": "The Manhattan district attorney's criminal investigation into President Donald Trump's business has slowed as investigators wait for a ruling by the US Supreme Court, according to people familiar with the investigation, making it likely that a decision on whether there is a case to bring will be weeks or months away.\n A fight over a subpoena for the President's tax returns has churned through the courts since September 2019, which has handicapped investigators' efforts, people familiar with the investigation say. Prosecutors can't confront key witnesses without the documents or determine whether there is evidence that any laws have been broken, the people say.\n New York prosecutors also don't have the type of leverage that federal investigators have when interviewing people, since New York state law does not have an equivalent of the federal false statements law, which makes it a crime to lie to federal officials.\n Prosecutors, led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, are investigating whether the Trump Organization violated any state laws, including insurance fraud or tax fraud.\n Investigators with the district attorney's office have interviewed individuals, including Michael Cohen, and have subpoenaed the Trump Organization, lender Deutsche Bank and insurance broker Aon for records. Prosecutors subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, which has loaned Trump more than $300 million, for records in late 2019 and interviewed employees about general underwriting practices after the 2020 election but those employees were not involved in the Trump loans.\n Prosecutors have not been in contact with Rosemary Vrablic, Trump's private banker and advocate at Deutsche Bank, people familiar with the investigation said. Last month, when Vrablic announced her retirement, her lawyer said she is \"committed to cooperating with authorities if asked.\"\n Investigators also have not sought interviews with any employees of the Trump Organization, the people say.\n Lawyers have speculated that the Supreme Court may be waiting for Trump's term to end next week before issuing its ruling. The wait means that investigators are still several weeks or months away from determining whether there is a criminal case to be made, the people say. The Trump Organization has maintained that it has paid all applicable taxes and is in compliance with the law.\n In 2019, Trump sued to block a subpoena to his accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of tax records. The case went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July that the President is not immune to a state grand jury investigation. Trump's attorneys amended the lawsuit challenging the subpoena on new grounds.\n A federal appeals court ruled in October that the subpoena is not overly broad or issued in bad faith, which put the case before the Supreme Court  -- but there has been no ruling. The issue now before the court is whether it will grant the President's request to stay the appeals court decision, which would pause the subpoena, or reject it, allowing the subpoena to be enforced. Vance's office agreed to wait to enforce the subpoena to allow Trump's lawyers time to appeal.\n While areas of the investigation have slowed, prosecutors have broadened their inquiry as new details have come to light. This fall, prosecutors subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization concerning fees it has paid to consultants, including Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter, while she was an employee of the firm, people familiar with the matter said. The subpoenas were sent after The New York Times reported about the consulting fees.\n In response, Ivanka Trump tweeted, \"This is harassment pure and simple. ... They know very well that there's nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever.\"\n The district attorney's office has previously cited the delays due to challenging the subpoena as a threat to the investigation.\n Cary Dunne, general counsel for Vance's office, told a judge in July that the subpoena delay has led to \"continuing concerns about the potential loss of critical evidence and expiration of statutes of limitations.\"",

        "body_text": "Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd, will be tried separately from the other officers because of the ongoing pandemic, according to a Hennepin County District Court ruling.\n The three other officers, who are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, will be tried together starting on August 23, Judge Peter Cahill ruled on Tuesday.\n The judge ruled the \"physical limitations\" of the county's largest courtroom in Minneapolis \"make it impossible to comply with Covid-19 physical restrictions in a joint trial involving all four defendants beginning March 8.\"\n Chauvin will be tried on charges of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's May 25 death -- which was caught on video and became part of a rallying cry for police brutality around the country.\n Videos of the incident show Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd told Chauvin and three other officers that he couldn't breathe.\n Jury selection in Chauvin's trial will take place March 8 to 26, according to the ruling. Opening statemen's will begin \"no earlier than March 29,\" the judge wrote.\n The other officers -- Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, who stood nearby -- will \"remain joined for trial\" in the summer.\n Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, declined to comment on the ruling. Kueng's attorney, Thomas C. Plunkett, also declined comment. CNN has sought comment from attorneys for the other officers.\n The ruling said, \"COVID-19 continues to be a public health emergency. Physical spacing limitations and mask requirements continue. While the State believes the situation will be greatly improved by June due to vaccinations, the Court is not so optimistic given news reports detailing problems with the vaccine rollout.\"\n Prosecutors had filed a motion for continuance at the end of December, asking the court to move the trial to June 7 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Chauvin in October was allowed to live in a neighboring state due to safety concerns stemming from his involvement in the Floyd's death.\n He posted $1 million bail and was released from custody. He was allowed to leave the state while he awaits trial, according to court records. As part of the order, he must keep his cell phone on him at all times.\n Chauvin, Kueng, Lane and Thao have been fired.\n Cahill had ruled in November that the four officers be tried at the same time.\n He said that holding a single proceeding for the four officers would ensure that jurors understand \"all of the evidence and the complete picture of Floyd's death.\"\n \"And it would allow this community, this State, and the nation to absorb the verdicts for the four Defendants at once,\" Cahill wrote in that ruling.",

        "body_text": "The FBI has publicly acknowledged for the first time that it is considering preventing those who attacked the US Capitol last week from boarding planes by adding them to the federal no-fly list.\n FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D'Antuono said Tuesday that the bureau would consider adding rioters to the no-fly list, which is maintained by the bureau and administered by the Transportation Security Administration.\n \"As for the no-fly list, we look at all tools and techniques that we possibly can use within the FBI and that's something we are actively looking at,\" D'Antuono said in response to a question from CNN's Evan P\u00e9rez.\n On Tuesday, congressional leaders intensified calls to keep rioters off planes after they said they remained mostly in the dark from the agencies that oversee the list.\n \"We cannot allow these same insurrectionists to get on a plane and cause more violence, and more damage,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a Tuesday afternoon news conference.\n The top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee also told TSA Administrator David Pekoske in a letter they were concerned \"little is being done to disrupt the travel of terrorists who just attacked the seat of the U.S. Government and wish to do so again.\"\n The no-fly list is derived from the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database, known as the TSDB or terrorist watch list. The FBI and other intelligence services can nominate individuals for the list or the selectee list, which designates an individual as the subject of additional airport security screening.\n Highly redacted federal reports suggest the overall watchlist is larger than number of people on the no-fly and selectee lists. Much of how the lists work, including what qualifies a person for inclusion and how many people are listed, is classified as sensitive security information.\n When a person checks in for a flight, his or her reservation information is checked against the TSA's Secure Flight database, which includes determining whether the traveler is on the no-fly list or selectee list.\n The Secure Flight system then gives the airline the information needed to generate a boarding pass or deny the passenger -- including, for example, if a passenger qualifies for the TSA PreCheck expedited screening program. It also checks if a passenger's identity is on the \"do not board list\" kept by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and TSA. This list is used to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.\n The no-fly list began in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, prior to the creation of TSA, when the FBI provided the Federal Aviation Administration a list of 125 people who should not be allowed on planes.\n This story has been updated with additional details.",

        "body_text": "There's more to the market than the FAANG stocks of Big Tech. It could finally be time for dividend-paying value stocks like the so-called dogs of the Dow to shine.\n The dogs of the Dow refers to a list of high-yielding stocks in the blue-chip average. The theory is that if investors buy these stocks, many of which had struggled in the previous year but still offer the promise and stability of a big dividend, they should mount a solid comeback in the year to come.\n As investors bet on more stimulus, an economic recovery and an eventual winding down of the Covid-19 crisis thanks to vaccines, dividend-paying value stocks might be due for a comeback.\n This year's Dow dogs list includes Chevron (CVX), IBM (IBM), Dow (DOW), Verizon (VZ) and Walgreens (WBA). Several of these stocks are off to a hot start in 2021.\n Walgreens has already surged 20% following a solid earnings report last week. Chevron and Dow are benefiting from a jump in commodity prices. IBM has rallied after hiring former Goldman Sachs (GS) president and ex-Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn as its new vice chairman.\n \"We're seeing this rotation into value stocks now after they had been slow to recover,\" said Paul Axberg, management analyst at Axberg Wealth Management in an interview with CNN Business.\n \"Oil is picking up and dividends may no longer be out of favor. Investors may be looking more at underperforming categories in the market,\" he added.\n The fact that Treasury bond yields, despite a recent spike, remain near historically low levels should bode well for the Dow dogs.\n The US 10-year bond yields just 1.16%. So investors craving steady income in a still uncertain world may flock to companies like IBM, Verizon and Walgreens, which all pay dividends north of 4%.\n Of course, there is no guarantee that this year's dogs will beat the market. in fact, last year's dogs performed like, well, dogs.\n Most of these stocks did so poorly that they are back on the dogs list this year. 3M (MMM), Cisco (CSCO) and Coca-Cola (KO) are all Dow dogs this year, just like in 2020. Amgen (AMGN) and Merck (MRK) are the only two new Dow dogs, replacing Exxon Mobil (XOM), which was booted from the Dow last August, and Pfizer (PFE).\n But the strategy of buying top dividend payers in the Dow has fared better over the previous few years. The Dow dogs outperformed the S&P 500 from 2015 through 2018. The dogs were up about 20% in 2019 too, a solid gain -- but not as strong as the broader market's more than 30% jump.\n So dividend payers and other value stocks could rebound this year -- especially if the economy and job market slowly returns to normal.\n \"There is an anticipation that we will get a cyclical upswing and that more of the economy will start to bounce back. Stocks that were beaten down last year should recover over the near term,\" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan, to CNN Business.\n Hamilton added that unless interest rates spike dramatically higher, value stocks, and dividend payers in particular, remain attractive.",

He was who he has always been: a grievance-driven egotist who is quick to cast blame even while never accepting any for himself.\n \"So if you read my speech -- and many people have done it, and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television -- it's been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,\" Trump said Tuesday before leaving for a visit to the Texas border. (This is, of course, wholly inaccurate.)\n Then he added: \"They've analyzed my speech and words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody, to the 'T', thought it was totally appropriate.\"\n (Side note: Who the heck is this \"they?\")\n Trump also veered into his favorite subject -- how he was right. In this case about his de-platforming by Twitter and Facebook. \"They're dividing and divisive, and they're showing something that I've been predicting for a long time,\" he said. \"I've been predicting it for a long time, and people didn't act on it.\"\n Trump's comments should function as your now almost daily reminder that there is absolutely no bottom when it comes to this President and how low he will go.\n His final days in the White House have functioned as proof-positive of this fact. He is not remorseful. He is not sorry. He is not anything other than convinced he is right and everyone else in the world is wrong.",

        "title": "US carbon emissions fell 10% in 2020, because of the pandemic. It's up to Biden to stop them from bouncing back",
        "body_text": "US greenhouse gas emissions dropped dramatically in 2020, helping the country meet one of its long-standing climate targets. But the dip came at a great economic cost -- and experts warn that unless climate action becomes a priority, emissions will bounce back quickly.\n The crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic caused US emissions to drop by 10.3% last year, according to preliminary estimates by the Rhodium Group, a private data analytics firm. That is the single biggest drop in annual emissions in the post-World War II era, the group said. By comparison, the 2009 economic recession caused emissions to drop 6.3%.\n Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap solar radiation in the atmosphere, just like the glass traps heat in a greenhouse. This causes temperatures to rise and drives more extreme weather, ice melt, sea level rise and ocean acidification.\n Last year's dramatic plunge means the US has met a key emission-cutting target set by the Obama administration.\n Under the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the US pledged that by 2020, it will have cut its emissions by 17% from 2005 levels. Because of the pandemic, emissions were 21.5% lower in 2020, compared to 2005.\n \"However, 2020 should not in any way be considered a down payment toward the US meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement target of 26-28% below 2005 levels,\" the authors of the Rhodium Group report said.\n \"With coronavirus vaccines now in distribution, we expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the US economy, emissions will likely rise again as well,\" they wrote.\n US climate action has stalled under President Donald Trump, but President-elect Joe Biden has promised to put climate at the center of his agenda.\n Biden has said that the US will rejoin the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, and promised to take a number of executive actions to combat the climate crisis.\n It's not just the US.\n Global Carbon Project estimates that emissions of heat-trapping gases decreased by around 7% globally last year. That might look like a significant drop, but it won't make any meaningful difference to climate change.\n Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and last year's decline is little more than a blip on the graph.\n The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere actually surged to a new record high last year, the World Meteorological Organization said in November.\n Under the Paris Agreement, the vast majority of nations agreed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. To reach that goal, greenhouse emissions need to drop dramatically and soon.\n The United Nations calculated last year that to stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, emissions would need to fall by 7.6% each year from 2020 to 2030. To achieve that, the world needs to radically change the way it sources its energy.\n \"This [emissions] decline didn't happen as a result of strong government policies or major penetration of clean energy technologies -- this decline happened mainly as result of the economic downturn [and] pandemic,\" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said at a news conference on Monday.\n Emissions dropped largely because the pandemic brought some of the economy's most polluting sectors to a halt.\n Transportation, which accounts for almost a third of all US emissions, was the biggest victim of the downturn. The Rhodium Group said that at the peak of lockdowns in April and May, demand for jet fuel had dropped 68% year on year, with gasoline down 40% and diesel 18% lower. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation plunged by 14.7% last year, compared to 2019.\n But there are signs the drop was just temporary. According to the US Energy Information Administration, demand for jet fuel in the US is recovering faster than in many other markets.\n Emissions from industrial activities were down 7% in 2020 compared to 2019, also because of the major slowdown in the economy.\n There is some good news too.\n Emissions from the US energy sector declined by 10.3% in 2020. And unlike the drops in transportation and industry, this wasn't driven by the economic collapse, but by the shift away from coal to renewable resources.\n About a fifth, or 20%, of US power was generated by burning coal in 2020, compared to 24% in 2019. The share of renewables rose to 18% last year from 16% in 2019.\n Despite the drop last year, the US remains the world's second biggest emitter after China. It is by far the biggest emitter historically, meaning that no country has put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the US.\n Since reaching a peak in 2007, US emissions have declined by 1.3% per year, on average, according to the US Energy Information Administration.",

        "body_text": "Boeing ended its worst year in more than 40 years with its best month of 2020.\n The company reported that it delivered 39 jets to customers in December -- and deliveries are important because that's when Boeing gets most of the money owed for a plane.\n But doesn't change the full year or near-term outlook for Boeing, which is struggling to recover from the dual crises of the 737 Max grounding and the pandemic-fueled plunge in air travel. The company has been slashing production rates and cutting staff in response to the financial crisis hitting its airline customers.\n That comparatively stellar December delivery figure brought Boeing's total 2020 deliveries to only 157, the lowest figure for the aircraft maker and its predecessor companies since 1977.\n By contrast, Boeing delivered a record 806 commercial jets as recently as 2018, helping to lift annual revenue above the $100 billion mark for the first time that year. Now analysts forecast Boeing will report revenue of only $58 billion in 2020, and $78 billion in 2021.\n Notably, Boeing was able to deliver 27 737 Max jets in December, the first deliveries of the troubled aircraft since its grounding of the plane in March 2019 following two fatal crashes. The US Federal Aviation Administration cleared the 737 Max to again fly passengers in late November, and Boeing delivered 10 to American Airlines (AAL), eight to United (UAL) and one to Panamian carrier Copa, with the rest going to leasing companies. The deliveries came from the backlog of planes that it continued to build during the grounding.\n But it's not just the 737 Max problem that hit the company's deliveries in 2020.\n Airlines grounded most of their existing fleets when air travel ground to a near halt early in 2020 -- so, desperate to preserve cash, many delayed deliveries of planes they had expected to receive during the year. Beyond the 27 737 Max jets, Boeing delivered no other passenger jets in December: The other deliveries consisted of nine freighters and three military versions of commercial planes.\n \"As we continue navigating through the pandemic, we're working closely with our global customers and monitoring the slow international traffic recovery to align supply with market demand,\" said Boeing CFO Greg Smith. \"In 2021, we'll continue taking the right actions to enhance our safety culture, preserve liquidity and transform our business for the future.\"\n On the orders side, Boeing reported 90 new orders in December, including 75 additional 737 Max jets for Ryanair (RYAAY), by far its biggest firm order for the plane in more than two years.\n But that boon was more than balanced out by 107 earlier orders that were canceled during the month, mostly for the Max.\n For all of 2020, orders for 184 jets were more than wiped out by 655 canceled orders, the biggest hit to its order book that the Boeing has ever suffered.\n The company also said it is no longer confident enough about 555 existing orders to still count them in its backlog, either because of its airline customer's financial condition or because the airline has started discussions of canceling an order.\n But even with the canceled and now-uncertain orders, Boeing managed to end the year with an order backlog of 4,223 planes.\n While the December numbers were an improvement from the rest of the year, they were apparently a disappointment for investors. Boeing (BA) shares were trading about 1% higher ahead of the 11 am ET report, but they were down 0.8% after the release.",

The sentiment of the Capitol being \"our house,\" according to those who invaded the building, was heard multiple times throughout Wednesday's event.\n But the US Capitol building was actually built mostly by enslaved African Americans, according to the Architect of the Capitol, the steward of landmark buildings in Washington, DC.\n When Congress moved from Philadelphia to Washington in 1800, there were only a few carpenters, bricklayers and stone cutters already in the area, the Architect of the Capitol says. As a result, most of the building work fell on local laborers, largely enslaved Black Americans.\n \"These slaves, as well as other the laborers, quarried the stone used for the floors, walls and columns of the Capitol, sawed both wood and stone, and became skilled in brick making and laying,\" the Architect says. \"Carpentry was also one of the more significant contributions slaves made to the construction of the Capitol as they framed the roof and installed its shingle covering.\"\n In fact, it was an enslaved laborer named Philip Reid who played a key part in the creation of the Statue of Freedom, which sits on top of the Capitol. When it was time to move the plaster model to the foundry, the Italian sculptor hired to disassemble it refused, barring a pay raise. Reid, an enslaved laborer at the foundry, found a way to separate the five sections of the model so it could be transported.\n In 2012, Congress placed a marker in the Capitol Visitor Center commemorating the role of laborers and enslaved African Americans in building the Capitol.\n And the Capitol isn't the only significant building in Washington built by enslaved African Americans. The White House, too, used such labor in its construction.",

It also should provide confidence in increasing their PA (physically activity) beyond levels they might have regularly taken prior to the pandemic.\"\n People in the top 25% did about 50 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity such as running, while those in the bottom 25% had less than 10 minuts per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity, said lead study author Aiden Doherty, an associate professor at University of Oxford's Nuffield department of population health.\n Although those who exercised more were also more likely to not smoke, drink less alcohol and have a healthy body weight, the researchers said they accounted for these factors in their analysis and found that the association between increased exercise and a decrease in cardiovascular disease was still strong.\n These results, the researchers said, demonstrated that exercise alone has a significant effect on the risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.\n Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, claiming around 17.9 million lives each year, the researchers said.\n Most studies examining the benefits of physical activity typically use questionnaires, which can be less accurate, given that most people are unable to accurately recall all activity that takes place throughout the day -- both for leisure and as part of a person's daily routine.\n The researchers said they were confident that wearing the device, which they described as a \"research-grade Fitbit,\" was an accurate way to reflect an individual's habitual activity over time even though it only recorded seven days' worth of physical activity.\n Other research had shown that activity measured in this way was \"moderately stable,\" Doherty said, and more research was being conducted to gauge its accuracy.\n \"Using this more accurate form of measurement, and in a large number of people, we found the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease in the UK Biobank cohort is seen at the highest level of physical activity, whether total, moderate -- or vigorous -- intensity,\" he said.\n \"This is the largest ever study of device-measured physical activity and cardiovascular disease. It shows that physical activity is probably even more important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease than we previously thought. Our findings lend further weight to the new WHO guidelines on physical activity which recommend at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for all adults.\"\n The World Health Organization revised its guidelines on physical exercise in December 2020. The UN agency now recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes \u2014 that's 2.5 hours \u2014 of moderate to vigorous physical activity weekly.\n The results of the study were similar for men and women, although the benefits of vigorous exercise appeared to be particularly strong for women.\n The findings contrast with a 2015 study of more than 1 million women that found moderate physical activity is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease, but there was no further reduction in risk with increasing frequency of activity.\n The research published in the journal PLOS Medicine on Tuesday.",

        "body_text": "A hot and rocky exoplanet known as a super-Earth has been discovered orbiting one of the oldest stars in our Milky Way galaxy, according to a new study.\n The exoplanet, called that because it's located outside our solar system, is about 50% larger than Earth and has three times the mass -- which makes it a super-Earth by astronomy standards.\n Even so, the planet, known as TOI-561b, only takes less than half an Earth day to complete one orbit around its host star.\n \"For every day you're on Earth, this planet orbits its star twice,\" said Stephen Kane, study coauthor and astrophysicist at the University of California, Riverside, in a statement.\n The study has been accepted for publication in the The Astronomical Journal and was presented Monday at the 237th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, which is occurring virtually due to the pandemic.\n This super-Earth's proximity to its host star creates an average surface temperature on the planet exceeding 2,000 Kelvin, or 3,140 degrees Fahrenheit.\n The planet was discovered using NASA's planet-hunting TESS mission, which launched in 2018. The name \"TESS\" is short for Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The mission regularly surveys parts of the sky and observes nearby stars to determine if there are planets orbiting them.\n The astronomers found TOI-561b -- \"TOI\" is short for TESS Object of Interest -- in the thick galactic disk of the Milky Way. This rare population of stars is known for having less heavy elements, like iron or magnesium, than are often associated with planet creation.\n To confirm their finding, the researchers used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and were able to determine the planet's mass, radius and density.\n Astronomers, however, were surprised to discover that despite the planet's mass, its density is about the same as that of Earth.\n \"This is surprising because you'd expect the density to be higher,\" Kane said. \"This is consistent with the notion that the planet is extremely old.\"\n Older planets are actually less dense because there weren't as many heavy elements present in the universe when these planets formed. Heavy elements are created as stars age and explode -- which seeds the creation of new stars and planets across the universe.\n \"TOI-561b is one of the oldest rocky planets yet discovered,\" said lead study author Lauren Weiss, a University of Hawai'i postdoctoral fellow, in a statement. \"Its existence shows that the universe has been forming rocky planets almost since its inception 14 billion years ago.\"\n There are also two additional planets orbiting the star, both of which are larger and likely gaseous.\n The Milky Way galaxy was likely formed 12 billion years ago. This star and its planets are 10 billion years old -- while our sun is only 4.5 billion years old.\n \"This planet formed at a time when the majority of stars in our galaxy were first beginning to shine,\" Weiss said at the conference on Monday.\n Understanding the planet's mass and radius allow astronomers to learn more about its internal structure.\n \"Information about a planet's interior gives us a sense of whether the surface of the planet is habitable by life as we know it,\" Kane said. \"Though this particular planet is unlikely to be inhabited today, it may be a harbinger of many rocky worlds yet to be discovered around our galaxy's oldest stars.\"\n Even though TOI-561b is a rocky, or terrestrial planet, like Earth, it's far too hot to support life. But given that this rocky planet is so old, and the first confirmed rocky planet around such an old star, astronomers wonder if the planet was habitable at some point in the past.\n And if it was, whoever lived there would have had a wonderful view.\n Stars in the thick galactic disk \"have motions that take them high above and far below the plane of the galaxy, providing them with what might be stunning views, if anyone were there to see them,\" Weiss said.",

        "title": "Drivers and labor union seek to overturn new California Prop 22 law",
        "body_text": "The fight over the future of gig economy work in California isn't over.\n A labor union and a group of gig workers filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging Proposition 22, or Prop 22, the controversial California ballot measure passed by voters in November that exempts firms like Uber and Lyft from having to classify their drivers in the state as employees rather than independent contractors.\n The lawsuit, filed in California's Supreme Court by Service Employees International Union (SEIU), three ridehail drivers and one ridehail customer, seeks to overturn Prop 22. They argue that it unconstitutionally limits the power of the State legislature to implement a worker's compensation program, or pass future legislation concerning certain workers' rights. The complaint also alleges that Prop 22 violates the State Constitution's requirement that ballot measures address a single subject.\n Prop 22 was bankrolled by Uber, Lyft, Instacart and DoorDash, who spent more than $200 million combined on its passage, underscoring how important worker classification is to their future. The companies scaled their businesses with massive fleets of workers who are treated as independent contractors, and therefore not entitled to costly employee benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. Prop 22 allows them to continue to do so, with some benefit concessions.\n Uber (UBER) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. Lyft (LYFT), Instacart and DoorDash referred CNN Business to Protect App Based Jobs & Services, formerly called the Yes on 22 campaign, which provided a statement attributable to Jim Pyatt, a retiree who drives with Uber.\n \"Nearly 10 million California voters -- including the vast majority of app-based drivers -- passed Prop 22 to protect driver independence, while providing historic new protections,\" Pyatt said in the statement. \"Voters across the political spectrum spoke loud and clear, passing Prop 22 in a landslide. Meritless lawsuits that seek to undermine the clear democratic will of the people do not stand up to scrutiny in the courts.\"\n On a call with press on Tuesday, Bob Schoonover, the president of SEIU California State Council and SEIU Local 721, said, \"If giant corporations are allowed to bankroll ballot initiatives that circumvent the California Constitution, it sets a precedent that any right can be rolled back just by spending enough money. The court must strike down Proposition 22 because it is unconstitutional.\"\n Prop 22 came in reaction to a state labor law, Assembly Bill 5 or AB-5, that went into effect January 1, 2020 and codified an \"ABC\" test to determine if workers are employees who are entitled to labor protections and benefits.\n Under Prop 22, the companies can continue to treat drivers as independent contractors while granting some drivers benefit concessions, but not the full suite of protections that workers would have gotten had the measure not passed.\n Prop 22, and the legal dispute around it, could have ramifications beyond the state of California. After their Election Day victory, the companies were quick to signal they would pursue models similar to Prop 22 outside the state.\n Schoonover called Prop 22 \"an attack on California's rights that if left unchecked will grant permission to companies like Uber and Lyft to dismantle workers' rights across the country.\"",

        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nFollowing last week's insurrection at the US Capitol, a growing number of companies are distancing themselves from President Donald Trump and supporters who are peddling false claims about his election loss.\n What's happening: Airbnb said it will try to ban Capitol rioters from staying at properties on its platform as fears grow about more violence ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. GoFundMe will no longer allow people to fundraise for travel expenses to potentially violent political events.\n Deutsche Bank (DB), which has loaned the Trump Organization more than $300 million over the past decade, has decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future, a source familiar with the bank's thinking told CNN Business. Signature Bank said it has started closing Trump's personal accounts and called for the president to resign.\n Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), which recently barred Trump from their platforms, are now doubling down. Facebook said it will begin removing all content that includes the phrase \"stop the steal,\" a common refrain among those who participated in last week's riots. Twitter said it's banned 70,000 accounts since Friday for promoting the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.\n Given widespread shock and horror at the Capitol mob last week, which could lead to Trump's impeachment just days before he's due to leave office, some companies clearly feel they have no choice but to take action.\n But investors appear nervous about the consequences. Twitter's shares dropped more than 6% on Monday, while Facebook shares lost 4%.\n The platforms are increasingly unpopular with Republicans, who bristle at Trump's muting, and Democrats, who think the sites should have acted sooner, according to Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Nicholas Hyett. With an eye toward their customer bases and ongoing regulatory pressure, that's a difficult place to be.\n \"They are increasingly and unavoidably stuck in the middle of this political ping-pong, which is just not good,\" Hyett said.\n Other companies are trying to avoid ending up in a similar situation as they reexamine their political donations. While some firms, including American Express and CNN parent AT&T, have said they will stop giving to Republican members of Congress who contested the certification of election results, many others \u2014 including Coca-Cola (KO) and Google (GOOGL) \u2014 have said they're pausing political giving altogether while they take another look at their policies.\n What's left unsaid: roughly 74 million Americans voted for Trump.\n Watch this space: Politics isn't the only factor weighing on tech stocks, Hyatt noted. Declines are also being fed by a broader reexamination of high-growth firms, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) taking a leg lower on Monday as well.\n In recent days, veteran investors Carl Icahn and Jeremy Grantham have warned of a Wall Street bubble, triggering another round of debates about asset prices that's coincided with political instability in Washington.\n Wall Street made big bets on health care stocks in 2020. Now, as the pandemic continues to rage, they're doubling down.\n See here: The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector, is up nearly 4% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained a more modest 1.2% despite notching a string of record highs.\n Some of those increases are tied to the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.\n Pfizer (PFE) shares rose 1.7% on Monday after the company said it's now aiming to deliver 2 billion doses globally by the end of 2021. CEO Albert Bourla previously said Pfizer would manufacture 1.3 billion doses this year. Partner BioNTech's stock jumped 8.5% on Monday.\n Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could also get a boost shortly, with analysts expecting results from its late-stage vaccine trial to arrive before the end of the month.\n Gilead Sciences (GILD), meanwhile, raised its profit guidance for 2021 on Monday, citing higher expected sales of Covid-19 treatment remdesivir as cases and hospitalizations surge.\n Investors are also keeping an eye on research that has nothing to do with the pandemic. Eli Lilly's shares soared nearly 12% on Monday, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, after the company released promising early results for its experimental Alzheimer's drug.\n On the radar: Bespoke Investment Group points out that JPMorgan's annual health care conference, which often coincides with strong stock performances as companies pitch investors, is taking place virtually this week. That could open the door to additional gains.\n A computer chip shortage has shut down the Ford (F) plant in Louisville, Kentucky this week \u2014 a warning sign for an industry that's struggling to get back on its feet during the pandemic.\n Details, details: The Louisville plant employs 3,800 hourly workers, who will receive about 75% of their normal pay during the one-week shutdown, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports. It assembles the Ford Escape and the Lincoln version of that SUV, the Corsair.\n It's the first shutdown to stem from an industry-wide problem that's expected to persist for months.\n Automakers cut back orders for computer chips early last year when Covid-19 slammed the brakes on auto sales and production because of temporary plant closings. When car sales bounced back sooner than expected, it left producers scrambling.\n The problem has been exacerbated by skyrocketing demand for laptops and other home electronics during the lockdown era, according to Kristin Dziczek, vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research.\n The average car has between 50 to 150 chips in it, she said. All are needed to proceed with vehicle assembly.\n UBS analysts expect all major automakers will be affected by the bottlenecks during the first three months of the year, with Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Nissan also calling out supply chain issues.\n Tuesday's data releases include the NFIB small business optimism index for December and job openings from November.\n Coming tomorrow: US inflation data for December will reveal the state of consumer prices as policymakers prepare to discuss another round of stimulus spending.",

        "title": "Washington Post: FBI warned of violent 'war' at Capitol in internal report issued day before deadly riot",
        "body_text": "The FBI warned of a violent \"war\" at the US Capitol in an internal report issued a day before last week's deadly siege, but it wasn't acted on urgently enough to prevent the domestic terrorist attack, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.\n The Post said that last Tuesday, an FBI office in Norfolk, Virginia, issued an \"explicit internal warning that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and 'war.'\" The report \"painted a dire portrait of dangerous plans, including individuals sharing a map of the complex's tunnels, and possible rally points for would-be conspirators to meet up\" in several states before heading to Washington.\n The Post report presents a more vivid picture of some of the threatening and violent discussions that alarmed law enforcement but did not lead to increased security. Law enforcement officials have indicated to CNN that authorities missed key signs ahead of the siege, which left five dead and the Capitol ransacked.\n The Post report is also likely to raise additional questions about why authorities were unprepared to respond to the riot and federal readiness to thwart future threats at a time when the FBI is warning of armed protests ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n The report referenced an online thread in which conspirators discussed their plans, quoting individuals as saying: \"'Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.'\"\n The information was \"briefed to FBI officials at the bureau's Washington field office the day before the attack,\" the Post reported. The newspaper, however, said the document is clear that the information presented was not \"finally evaluated intelligence,\" and that agencies receiving it \"are requested not to take action based on this raw reporting without prior coordination with the FBI.\"\n The newspaper also reported that the FBI was careful with its description of the individuals and organizations listed in the report, with the bureau writing that the activities they engaged in are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution and that though they were mentioned in the report, \"Their inclusion here is not intended to associate the protected activity with criminality or a threat to national security, or to infer that such protected activity itself violates federal law.\"\n But the report also warned that \"based on known intelligence and/or specific historical observations, it is possible the protected activity could invite a violent reaction towards the subject individual or others in retaliation or with the goal of stopping the protected activity from occurring in the first instance,\" according to the Post.\n Officials told CNN last week that going into Wednesday, they had no intelligence indicating there was a threat the US Capitol could be overrun. In the wake of the attack, federal and local officials have said they did not have intelligence suggesting any violent mob was preparing to attack the Capitol, even as demonstrators were publicly saying on social media they were not planning a typical protest.\n The Post's report prompted Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, to call for his panel to open a probe about the matter.\n Former Virginia Republican Rep. Denver Riggleman, who is working with several former national security officials to analyze open source information about the attack, also called for an investigation.\n \"There is a clear breakdown of communications and operational chain of command. It would be interesting to see what the internal intelligence memos were for Capitol Police and support elements. My guess is that the intelligence reports would have had a possible Capitol incursion,\" he told CNN.\n There were reports of violence when President Donald Trump's backers had come to town last month, and the FBI was monitoring everything from social media to the hotels where some of the rioters were staying. One sign of the preparations came in the days before a rally held by Trump last week just before the attack, when, acting on the FBI's intelligence information, Washington's Metropolitan Police arrested Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, after he left the airport en route to his hotel.\n He was charged for his role in destroying a Black Lives Matter banner at a previous Proud Boys march in Washington, and prosecutors later added charges of carrying two extended ammunition magazines that are illegal in the city. As part of his release, a local judge told him to leave town and to stay away from last Wednesday's rally.\n Complicating last week's response was a division of responsibilities for security -- Capitol Police reports to Congress and is separate from the executive branch agencies, including the FBI and Secret Service, which don't have jurisdiction on the Capitol grounds unless requested by the Capitol Police.\n The Post report comes amid a heightened sense of alarm nationwide leading up to Biden's inauguration and efforts by authorities to prevent another catastrophe.\n An internal FBI bulletin obtained by CNN shows the bureau has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in the coming days, and lawmakers have been briefed on threats to the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration.\n Federal officials, however, have yet to hold a news conference since Wednesday's incursion, prompting objections from lawmakers who say media briefings after such incidents are common. And on Monday, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf resigned, citing ongoing litigation challenging the validity of his appointment, raising further questions about the leadership of a key department involved in national security ahead of the inauguration.\n This story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.\n CNN's Zachary Cohen, Evan Perez, Jeremy Herb, Geneva Sands and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\nWhen one of my co-workers found out about a tiny, orphaned kitten that needed a home a few months ago, he didn't hesitate to adopt it. He says his new companion helped make the months of Covid-19 isolation at home much less stressful.\n He is not alone. Animal shelters and breeders across the country have reported record numbers of dog and cat adoptions in recent months.\n But after my co-worker returned to work, he says his adorable kitten started urinating on the kitchen counter while he was away.\n Another friend is worried about how her dog will react when she returns to the office. Her big, goofy Labrador retriever follows her everywhere, even to the bathroom. When she leaves to run a quick errand, the dog sits by the back door and whines, awaiting her return.\n What should these pet owners do?\n A change in routine, such as suddenly being alone for many hours every day, is a major cause of separation anxiety for both dogs and cats.\n Separation anxiety is more than a little whimpering when you head out the door. It's major, unwanted behavior that happens every time you leave or are away.\n For dogs and cats, this can mean excessive pacing, barking or howling, whimpering or self-grooming as you get ready to leave. In some cases it can mean urinating or defecating around the house, often in places where scents linger, such as on bedding or rugs, or destroying household items in your absence. Extreme clinginess or neediness is another symptom.\n Separation anxiety won't go away on its own, and it can be difficult to get rid of entirely. But there are ways to manage it. As a clinical veterinarian and professor, I am often asked to help people find ways to ease their pets' anxiety.\n First, it's important to understand that it's not about you -- it's about your pet. Your dog or cat is not trying to teach you a lesson or get revenge. Animals don't act out of spite.\n Instead, it's a signal of extreme distress and frustration that should be approached like any other medical ailment. Your pet doesn't want to experience separation anxiety any more than you want to experience its consequences.\n For this reason, punishment is never the answer. For one thing, your pet won't connect the punishment with something that happened hours -- or even a few minutes -- earlier. And punishment may only exacerbate your pet's anxiety and stress.\n Similarly, going to the opposite extreme by praising or giving affection when your pet is suffering anxiety also will make the problem worse.\n The goal is to create a balanced relationship so your pet tolerates being alone. First, get your pet checked out by a veterinarian to rule out physical conditions, such as a urinary tract infection if your pet urinates in inappropriate places.\n Next, make sure your pet gets plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. For dogs, this may mean a long run or brisk walk every day. Getting exercise shortly before you leave the house may put your dog in a more relaxed state while you're gone. It's harder to feel stressed when the endorphin levels are elevated. For cats, this could mean a change of environment by being outdoors in a safe, enclosed area such as a \"catio.\"\n Here, we're talking about your behavior. The goal is to make your absence seem like no big deal. Making a fuss over your pet when you leave or arrive home only makes matters worse. If you treat it like it's routine, your pet will learn to do the same.\n Try to figure out when your pet starts to show signs of anxiety and turn that into a low-key activity. If it's when you pick up your handbag, for example, practice picking it up and putting it back down several times over a few hours. Similarly, get dressed or put on your shoes earlier than usual but stay home instead of leaving right away. Try starting your car's engine and then turning it off and walking back inside.\n Next, practice short absences. When you're at home, make it a point to spend some time in another room. In addition, leave the house long enough to run an errand or two, then gradually increase the time that you're away so that being gone for a full day becomes part of the family routine.\n Boredom makes separation anxiety worse. Providing an activity for your pet while you're gone, such as a puzzle toy stuffed with treats, or simply hiding treats around the house will make your absence less stressful. Other options for dogs and cats include collars and plug-in devices that release calming pheromones.\n To maintain your bond while you're gone, place a piece of clothing that you have worn recently in a prominent place, such as on your bed or couch, to comfort your pet. Similarly, you can leave the TV or radio on -- there are even special programs just for pets -- or set up a camera so you can observe and interact with your pet remotely. Some of these come equipped with a laser pointer or treats you can dispense.\n In some severe cases, when the animal harms itself or causes property damage, medication or supplements might be necessary. These alter the brain's neurotransmitters to create a sense of calm.\n While some are readily available without a prescription, it's a good idea to get advice from your veterinarian to determine which are safest and most effective for your pet's situation. Medication can help reduce the anxiety, making it easier for the pet to learn new coping skills. A behavior modification plan accompanying the use of medication can help manage this problem.\n Separation anxiety is difficult for both you and your pet. But a few simple changes can make a huge difference as life returns to some semblance of normal.\n Lori M.

        "body_text": "As the Democratic-controlled House prepares to vote to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday for his incitement of rioters that stormed the US Capitol last week, Republican elected officials and talking heads are rolling out a fascinatingly ridiculous argument for why they oppose the move.\n \"As President @realDonaldTrump stated last night, it is time to heal and move on,\" tweeted South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R). \"If Speaker Pelosi pushes impeachment in the last days of the Trump presidency it will do more harm than good.\"\n Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady (R) put it this way: \"Those calling for impeachment or invoking the 25th Amendment in response to President Trump's rhetoric this week are themselves engaging in intemperate and inflammatory language and calling for action that is equally irresponsible and could well incite further violence.\"\n Then there was this from Brian Kilmeade, co-anchor of \"Fox & Friends\" on Fox News Tuesday morning: \"We see what's happening around this country, how 50 state houses are being threatened on Inauguration Day, this is the last thing you want to do,\" he said.\n Even Trump got in on the act before leaving for the Texas border on Tuesday. \"This impeachment is causing tremendous anger,\" he said. \"I think it's causing tremendous danger to this country. ... I want no violence.\"\n So, let's walk through this logic, shall we? No punitive action should be taken against the President who told a mob of his supporters that \"we fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore\" because, if that action is taken, it could lead to violence?\n Er, what? Just in case anyone forgot, we already had a mob overrun the US Capitol -- incited by the President. That happened six days ago.\n To do what the likes of Graham, Brady and Kilmeade is, quite simply, to let mob rule win. We can't act to punish the President, who clearly egged on the rioters, because it could lead to more riots!\n Tell me how that differs from arguing after September 11 that we had better not seek to punish those responsible for the bombings because it might further incite them and lead to more bombings? Or how we had better not strike back after Pearl Harbor because it could lead to further attacks on the United States?\n Right. You get it.\n You can disagree with the strategy of impeaching the President with only eight days (and counting) left in his term. That's a fine debate to have. But you cannot in good conscience argue that impeachment shouldn't happen because it could trigger a violent reaction from Trump's supporters.\n That already happened, people! Did you miss the people marauding through the Capitol last week? And celebrating both during and afterward?\n We are already through the looking glass. Impeaching this President is not the match that will light this fire. It is already burning in the country -- thanks to the President of the United States pouring lighter fluid of the combustible combination of grievance, victimhood and plain old racism over the past four years.\n In short: Give me a damn break.",

        "body_text": "Deutsche Bank will no longer do business with President Donald Trump, a move that will cut off his business from a major source of loans that once helped fund his golf courses and hotels.\n Germany's biggest bank has decided to refrain from future business with the president and his company, a person familiar with the bank's thinking told CNN Business. The news, first reported by the New York Times, follows last week's deadly riot at the US Capitol.\n A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank (DB) declined to comment to CNN Business, citing a prohibition on discussing potential client relationships.\n The move is the latest example of corporate backlash against the president after his supporters vandalized the Capitol in a brazen assault that left five people dead.\n On Monday, Signature Bank said it had started closing Trump's personal accounts and called for the president to resign. The US bank also said it \"will not do business in the future with any members of Congress who voted to disregard the Electoral College.\"\n Trump has a checking account at Signature Bank, according to a 2019 financial disclosure filed with the US Office of Government Ethics. A revocable trust in the president's name also has a money market account at Signature Bank, according to the filing.\n Trump also has ties to other major banks. The president held between $5 million and $25 million in checking-and-savings accounts at Capital One (COF) and between $500,000 and $1 million in accounts at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), according to the disclosure form.\n Trump also listed up to $250,000 in a money market account at Bank United.\n JPMorgan declined to comment. A Capital One spokesperson said the bank does not discuss current or former customer relationships. Bank United did not respond to a request for comment.\n Trump's disclosure forms indicated he held up to $50,000 in a First Republic (FRC) checking account. However, a spokesman for First Republic told CNN Business that single Trump account was inactive and is now closed. The bank declined to say when the account was closed.\n The loss of future business with Deutsche Bank is potentially a much bigger blow. The Trump Organization owes Deutsche Bank approximately $340 million in the coming years, the person familiar with the bank's thinking said.\n There was no request from Trump for Deutsche Bank to lend more money, the person said.\n Lending by Deutsche Bank to Trump and his companies totals more than $2.5 billion, the New York Times reported in 2019.\n Trump has several outstanding loans with Deutsche Bank, according to the president's financial disclosure documents. The president has borrowed tens of millions of dollars for Trump National Doral, his golf resort in south Florida. Deutsche Bank has also provided loans for the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened in 2016.\n It's not clear how Deutsche Bank will handle the loans once Trump has left the White House, especially with the hotel and hospitality business in steep decline due to the pandemic. The loans mature in 2023 and 2024.\n Late last month, the two private bankers at Deutsche who worked most closely with Trump resigned their positions.\n Christiana Riley, Deutsche Bank's top executive in the Americas, condemned the violence at the Capitol in a post last week on LinkedIn.\n \"Violence has no place in our society and the scenes that we witnessed are a shame on the whole nation,\" she wrote. \"We are proud of our Constitution and stand by those who seek to uphold it to ensure that the will of the people is upheld and a peaceful transition of power takes place.\"\n The Trump Organization is under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office and New York Attorney General and both agencies have subpoenaed the bank about its lending relationship with the company.\n Investigators are looking into whether the Trump Organization misled or defrauded the lender by inflating the value of some of its assets, according to court filings.\n \u2014 Kara Scannell and Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",

        "body_text": "Jessica DuLong is a Brooklyn-based journalist, ghostwriter, book coach and the author of \"Saved at the Seawall: Stories From the September 11 Boat Lift\" and \"My River Chronicles: Rediscovering the Work that Built America.\"\n\"Forgiveness\" in the time of Covid usually refers to loans, as in TD Bank's recent announcement that, pending new information, it was no longer \"accepting new forgiveness applications.\"\n That phrasing got me thinking about how we, as individuals, sometimes struggle to accept a \"forgiveness application\" \u2014 aka apology \u2014 from someone who has done us wrong. Is there a formula to follow for the perfect mea culpa? What might an \"applicant\" need to say or do to earn forgiveness?\n In her new book, \"The Forgiveness Tour: How to Find the Perfect Apology,\" Susan Shapiro explains that a full apology includes four essential elements: acknowledgment of the offense, an explanation of why it happened, remorse coupled with a commitment to do better and making reparation.\n The book is the culmination of a decade-long quest to understand the nature and practice of forgiving. After a fallout with her mentor, Shapiro sought insight from religious leaders and people who had suffered unforgivable wrongs, including genocide, sexual assault and cruelty of all sorts.\n Based on all she has learned, Shapiro dismissed \"radical forgiveness\" as \"wrongheaded\" because \"forgiving someone who doesn't apologize, who doesn't understand what they did wrong, might just perpetuate your own hurt.\" Instead she offered more nuanced alternatives to issuing \u2014 or asking for \u2014 blanket absolution.\n This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n When I asked forgiveness for not attending his father's funeral, my father opened up and started telling me amazing stories about my grandfather. Not long after, he wound up telling me how proud he was of me. Copping to something I'd done wrong opened the floodgates, and we were able to completely reconcile before I lost him.\n But I also interviewed Holocaust and Bosnian War survivors who'd suffered through horrors where an apology was impossible. Several people I spoke with have not forgiven but have found ways to move on, sometimes even surviving out of spite.\n If an apology is impossible, or if someone cannot or will not forgive, they need a plan of action. The more we blame the past, the harder it is to move on.\n Holocaust survivor and therapist Emanuel Mandel explained to me that there is a way to remember and understand trauma without dwelling on it. \"I spent 40 years helping people learn they have choices,\" he told me. The best way to get unstuck is to start by talking with someone you trust: a clergy member, sponsor, therapist or mentor. Another option is writing a letter.\n Of course, not everybody is going to respond the way you want them to, but reaching out could provide information that will help you understand the situation differently.\n If somebody cannot acknowledge what they did wrong or doesn't understand your feelings, keep them at a distance to protect yourself. Forgiveness alone might help you move on.\n When it comes to forgiveness, or at least moving on, sometimes concrete action can substitute for words.",

        "title": "One day until Trump's second impeachment vote: What happens now",
        "body_text": "The next few days are going to be long, but by the end of Wednesday, we expect that President Donald Trump will be impeached a second time.\n The story over the upcoming days will continue to be not just what is happening on the floor, but how the Capitol and the members in it prepare for the next week as new threats and the inauguration looms.\n The US Capitol has become a fortress in Washington as Democrats -- keenly aware that a new President will be inaugurated in just eight days -- grapple with how to curtail the damage that could be done by the outgoing man in the White House.\n The jarring juxtaposition of Democrats beginning to prepare for their new power paired with the reality of the moment is starting to sink in. Still, there is no stopping impeachment now. House Democrats are there. Senate Democrats are working through how it might unfold and President Joe Biden is acknowledging that his opening days in office may be divided between his agenda to bring the country together and a Senate impeachment trial that will continue to keep the country divided.\n The House Committee is the hottest ticket in town Tuesday. Starting at 11 a.m. ET,  the committee is going to begin debate on Rep. Jamie Raskin's bill urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. That debate is expected to go one to three hours. But, it could go longer. After that, the Rules panel might take a break.\n Rules is expected to then return in the mid-afternoon to begin debating the impeachment article. This meeting is expected to stretch hours. It could go well into the evening. For context, the last impeachment Rules debate lasted about eight hours.\n Around 7:30 p.m. ET, the House will begin voting on Raskin's 25th Amendment bill. They will first vote on the rule. Then, they will vote on the actual bill.  A reminder that votes in the house take a while given the protocols in place for coronavirus.\n So what about impeachment? The House will pass the rule to govern the debate on the impeachment article Tuesday night at some point. When that occurs is not clear. But, Wednesday at 9 a.m. ET, the House will meet to begin consideration of the article of impeachment on the House floor. Exact timing for final vote Wednesday TBD.\n Democrats are confident there will be at least a handful of Republicans voting with them on impeachment Wednesday. All eyes are on No. 3 Republican Liz Cheney who has made no secret of her frustrations with President Donald Trump over the years, but comes from conservative Wyoming.\n Cheney has not said what she would decided to do on the issue but she told colleagues on a conference call Monday evening that Wednesday's impeachment vote is a \"vote of conscience,\" a source told CNN.\n Also watch Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois. And, Rep. Peter Meijer, a Republican who told CNN on Monday night \"I had a break on Wednesday around 4:17 p.m. ... The one person who could tamp down the rhetoric , the one person who could have put an end to that violence, the President, he put out that video that said ..'we love you, you're special. Come home.\"\n In a letter Monday, McCarthy tried to give his members an off-ramp or alternative to impeachment circulating a letter that included calling for four options including censure, a bipartisan commission to study the attack, reforming the electoral count act and legislation to promote \"voter confidence\" in future elections. Look, don't expect dozens of Republicans to vote for impeachment, but these alternatives aren't coming to the floor in a Pelosi-controlled House of Representatives.\n Yes, moderate Republicans are calling for censuring the President. Pelosi made it clear on the Democratic caucus call Monday that censure wasn't on the table. The majority of her caucus is backing impeachment. Republicans who have been trying to convince Democrats to switch directions over the weekend and throughout Monday weren't successful. At this point there are two votes coming to the House floor where Republicans can register their anger with Trump's actions. They can vote for Raskin's bill on the 25th Amendment or they can vote for impeachment. That's it. Democrats don't want to give them an out card or another option.\n Right now, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is trying to use a rarely used procedural move to get McConnell to bring back the Senate with him and force a trial. The move only requires McConnell and Schumer to be on the same page, but the expectation as of now is McConnell isn't going to agree with it. So, what's the plan B?\n As the House charges ahead, there is a growing realization in the Senate, that an impeachment trial of Trump cannot be put off for 100 days. Instead, the plan that is beginning to make the most sense is one in which the new Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would divide each day in half. In the morning, the Senate would move ahead with confirming Biden's Cabinet and begin work on his stimulus package. In the afternoon, the Senate would reconvene as a court room where former President Donald Trump is on trial. Biden alluded to this Monday noting  that it was his \"hope and expectation.\"\n Biden noted he had not heard back from the Senate's parliamentarian about whether that plan could be actualized. Remember, there are strict rules that govern the US Senate amid impeachment.\n Alan Frumin, the former Senate parliamentarian, Monday night who told CNN that he didn't believe there was anything precluding Schumer from dividing the day like that, essentially allowing the Senate to double track. In essence, only having a few hours in the morning could delay Biden's agenda. It could make things move more slowly, but it wouldn't necessarily halt it. However, moving nominees along quickly would still require cooperation from Republicans. Maybe Republicans -- aware of the threats to the Capitol itself and the country at large-- are willing to move quickly on a few national security nominees. But, we don't know right now how members will feel. Cardinal rule of the Senate is always things are possible. There are options, but you have to have agreement to move fast.\n Senate rules simply say that once the trial starts at 12 p.m. ET every day the Senate should be in trial, but \"the adjournment of the Senate sitting in said trial shall not operate as an adjournment of the Senate, but on such adjournment, the Senate shall resume the consideration of its legislative and executive business.\"\n That means -- in short -- you can do other things in the morning. But, how much you could actually get done is another question entirely.\n Within the Democratic caucus, members were fired up over the weekend over impeachment. But members and aides on the Senate Democratic side tell me that the reality of what this trial could mean for another stimulus bill, to Biden's nominees, to the country's morale  is sinking in. At first, members thought they could potentially dispose of the articles quickly if they came to the Senate, but while there are no rules governing how long a trial has to be, members also don't want to make a sham out of the process. Essentially, if the Senate Democrats have to have a trial, if Pelosi is going to send them over, many members are arguing they need to do it right. That means expect this trial to last days, not hours.\n CNN's Manu Raju with DJ Judd contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book \"High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nAnger over the pro-Trump mob attack on the US Capitol is growing by the minute in Congress -- Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia told me it is \"white hot\" -- and it is focused like a laser on President Donald Trump. If his first impeachment was a long, hard-fought effort that left confusion in its wake, this second one will be a lightning strike delivered by officials who have no doubt about the crime they allege.\n The five deaths that were the result of the attack and the damage done to the symbolic seat of American democracy all make new outrage over Trump categorically different from the one that brought about his first impeachment in December 2019. That he and several of his allies incited violence with the hope of overturning the election is without doubt. And while the first impeachment depended on testimony from those who witnessed Trump's effort to force Ukraine to investigate then-political rival Joe Biden in exchange for US military aid (Trump denies any quid pro quo), this coup attempt was broadcast live on television, shocking the world.\n It's difficult to imagine how Trump will not be impeached again, and suffer the unique shame of being the only president ever to endure this disgrace a second time. When this occurs -- and if he is found guilty by the Senate -- a man whose vast fortune and extreme methods allowed him to escape accountability during a lifetime of offensive behavior will at last be held accountable.\n For decades those who have been harmed and insulted by Trump have watched him escape serious accountability and then brag about it. He said that he used bankruptcies for his businesses \"brilliantly,\" a move that left creditors holding the bag. He was even more brashly unrepentant when he was not convicted by the Senate after his first impeachment. And then he retaliated against those who bore witness against him.\n In that first case, Trump was impeached by the House for two alleged crimes: abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress.\n This time around Trump will be charged with a single count -- \"Incitement of insurrection.\" Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island told me that he began drafting the charge with colleagues Rep. Ted Lieu of California and Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland within hours of the attack on the Capitol. When I spoke to him about it, Cicilline said he and the others had no real doubt that a serious crime had been committed and no concern that the American people needed to be persuaded of this fact.\n \"The country saw this all play out in real time, on their televisions,\" explained Cicilline. \"They saw an effort by him to incite an insurrection so that the certification of the Electoral College votes by Congress would be interrupted and he could stay in office.\"\n During Trump's so-called \"Save America Rally,\" just before the mob stormed the Capitol, he gave a speech in which he used the word \"fight\" 20 times and as he inflamed their emotions people in the crowd chanted, \"Fight for Trump, fight for Trump.\" After repeating the big lie that the election had been stolen from him, Trump declared, \"We will never give up. We will never concede.\" Trump falsely claimed that Vice President Mike Pence could stop the certification of the election and called on the crowd to march on the Capitol.\n The crowd that arrived at the Capitol included some men and women in military-style gear. They stormed the Capitol and overwhelmed police. Once inside they ransacked offices and invaded the Senate chamber. They got within feet of the House chamber when officers shot and killed one of the rioters. Three other members of the Trump mob died that day and a police officer who was hospitalized died of his injuries.\n In the days that followed the attack, evidence showed that it was even more gravely dangerous than first thought. One man in the mob had come with zip ties, which are used to restrain captives, and appeared to have been bent on taking hostages. Chants of \"Hang Mike Pence,\" which were recorded and played on television, suggest that some considered committing murder.\n In addition to drafting the impeachment document, members of Congress searched for a way to further punish Trump. Connolly said he believes they have found it in the 14th Amendment which bars insurrectionists from public office. He thinks legislation imposing this penalty could be approved by the House and Senate and become law. Some Republican senators and Vice President Pence, who many suspect is eying a 2024 presidential run, might like this idea because it clears Trump from the field.\n As this all unfolds, it's important to remember that the invasion of the Capitol by a huge mob of American citizens happened not just because of a single deranged and inciting speech but because for years others have failed to stop Trump. Those who gave up on decency and became Trump's enablers did so in part because they didn't want to get on the wrong side of his rabid supporters. Well, last week the world saw what those supporters are capable of doing when they are riled up. This week, the world will see how the President will be held accountable through impeachment. In the process of course, Trump's enablers will be on the wrong side of history which will judge them in the same harsh light that will forever shine on Trump.",

        "body_text": "Sheldon Adelson, the chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands and a major donor to Republican politicians, died late Monday following complications related to his cancer treatment, his company said. He was 87.\n Adelson took a leave of absence from Sands last week to resume treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which his aides first disclosed in late February 2019.\n He rose from a hardscrabble childhood in Boston to become one of the world's richest men as founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) He was Sands' first employee, which has since grown to 50,000 employees.\n \"His impact on the industry will be everlasting,\" the company said. Sands' shares opened slightly higher Tuesday.\n Adelson's funeral will be held in Israel, the birthplace of his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson. Plans for a memorial in Las Vegas, where he ran the Venetian and Palazzo casinos, will be held at a later date.\n Adelson spent his fortune -- pegged at $35 billion by Forbes -- to become an influential behind-the-scenes-player in Washington, working to shape US policy toward Israel, help guide Republican Party strategy and lobby against threats posed to his business interests.\n He donated hundreds of millions of dollars to medical research and Jewish causes. He owned Israel's largest daily newspaper by circulation; donated to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance center in Jerusalem; and helped underwrite Birthright Israel, which pays for educational trips to Israel for young Jewish adults.\n Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Tuesday his \"deep sorrow and heartbreak' over Adelson's death.\n \"Many, many among the Jewish people, in the State of Israel, and in the whole world, share in this heavy mourning,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"Sheldon's great efforts to strengthen Israel's position in the United States and to strengthen the connection between Israel and the Diaspora will be remembered for generations.\"\n But he was perhaps best known in the United States as a Republican mega-donor whose millions helped shape the course of presidential and congressional elections in the post-Citizens United era.\n Adelson and his wife, Miriam, donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Republican-aligned super PACs.  They plowed more than $215 million into federal super PACs in the last two years, making them largest publicly disclosed donors of the 2020 elections, according to a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n Adelson did not always support the front-runner in GOP intraparty fights.\n In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, for instance, Adelson invested heavily in a super PAC that helped extend former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's presidential run.\n Gingrich eventually lost the nomination to Mitt Romney, but Adelson's spending underscored his loyalty to Gingrich, with whom he shared a hawkish stance on Israel.\n In 2016, Adelson emerged as a powerful voice backing then-candidate Donald Trump at a time when many GOP traditional donors were reluctant to support the brash real estate developer.\n In May 2016, as Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, Adelson penned a Washington Post opinion piece, urging the party's financial benefactors to unite behind Trump after a bruising primary.\n Adelson called Trump a \"CEO success story.\"\n \"You may not like Trump's style or what he says on Twitter, but this country needs strong executive leadership more today than at almost any point in its history,\" Adelson wrote.\n Later that year, the Adelsons donated $20 million to a super PAC supporting Trump's candidacy. Adelson became the largest individual contributor to the President's inaugural committee, donating $5 million.\n The Adelsons were rewarded for their generosity.\n They attended Trump's inauguration, dined at the White House and had front-row seats in 2018 as US officials opened a US Embassy in Jerusalem -- a long-standing Adelson objective.\n In a White House ceremony in 2018, Trump awarded Israeli-born Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The White House cited her work to support medical research and Jewish causes.\n In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Trump said that the world \"lost a great man\" and that Adelson will be \"missed.\" He added that Sheldon \"lived the true American dream.\"\n Adelson was born August 4, 1933, in Boston. His father, an immigrant from Lithuania, drove a cab, and his mother, whose family came from Wales, ran a small knitting service. He and his siblings slept on the floor of the family's tenement apartment.\n Adelson often touted his rags-to-riches story and his determination to claw his way out of poverty.\n At age 12, he was selling newspapers on street corners in Boston. By 16, he had invested in candy machines. After a stint in the Army, he continued to run businesses, selling condominiums, working as a mortgage broker, taking a turn as a venture capitalist.\n \"Despite being the grandson of a Welsh coal miner and the son of a Boston cab driver, I've had the remarkable experience of being part of almost 50 different businesses in my more than 70-year business career,\" he wrote in the Washington Post piece touting Trump.\n His big break came in the late 1970s, when he launched a computer trade show known as Comdex. He sold it in 1995 for nearly $900 million, parlaying that convention business into a casino empire that comprises the properties in Asia, and the upscale Venetian and Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas. His venture became the world's largest casino company.\n His properties ranged from the opulent Venetian casino resort in Las Vegas, where visitors can ride in gondolas, to a string of lucrative casinos in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macao.\n In October 2020, the company told multiple outlets that it was in \"very early discussions\" about a possible sale of its Las Vegas properties. He sold Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania in 2019.\n In person, Adelson was instantly recognizable for his thinning patch of bright red hair and the electric scooter he rode everywhere. He suffered from peripheral neuropathy, a condition that made walking difficult.\n He generally shied away from media interviews.\n His family's 2015 purchase of one of his hometown newspapers, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was cloaked in secrecy, forcing journalists at the paper to do their own digging to determine the identity of their new bosses.\n During his cancer battle, Adelson had curtailed his office hours at the company he founded, although the company said in a statement that Adelson continued to perform his duties as its chairman and CEO.\n Calling his achievements in the hospitality industry \"well-documented,\" the company said that Adelson's vision \"transformed the industry, changed the trajectory of the company he founded, and reimagined tourism\" in Las Vegas, Macao and Singapore.\n --CNN's Andrew Carey and Amir Tal contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The devastating silence of the Trump administration on the Capitol riot",
        "body_text": "Six days ago, the US Capitol was overrun by violent rioters who marauded through the building, as members of Congress and the media were left on their own to find shelter and safety.\n You might think that an insurrection of that magnitude -- the first time the Capitol building had been overrun since the War of 1812 -- would occasion a massive (and public) federal response to find out how this happened and to prevent it from happening again. And you would be wrong.\n As of Tuesday morning, the US Capitol Police, FBI, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security had held a total of zero -- yes, zero -- public briefings on the Capitol riots. To the extent we know what happened that day, and what is being done internally to address it, it comes from eyewitness accounts, videos shared on social media and arrests of protesters being made by local authorities in their home states.\n Trump himself addressed the riot on Tuesday morning, only to deflect any blame for it. \"So if you read my speech, and many people have done it and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television, it's been analyzed and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,\" he said, adding: \"But they've analyzed my speech and my words and my final paragraph, my final sentence. And everybody to the 'T' thought it was totally appropriate.\"\n In the absence of information, Democratic members of Congress have tried to fill the void. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who chairs a House subcommittee looking into the origins of the riot, announced Monday that two Capitol Police officers had been suspended for their roles in the riots (one posed with a rioter, another put on a \"MAGA\" hat) while at least 190 more are under investigation for their roles during the insurrection. Only after Ryan went public with that news did Yogananda Pittman, the acting chief of the Capitol Police, confirm the suspensions.\n Why the silence? A few reasons:\n 1) Because of the absolute chaos of the final days of the Trump administration (which was worsened by a series of resignations in the wake of the riots and President Donald Trump's incitement of them) there are very few people actually in charge. Bill Barr is no longer at the Justice Department. Chad Wolf resigned on Monday as head of the Department of Homeland Security. The chief of the Capitol Police resigned under pressure following the riots -- as did the House and Senate Sergeants-at-Arms. What that series of departures -- forced and otherwise -- has created is a total lack of leadership within the ranks of the administration. No one is taking point on how to inform the public about what happened because no one really knows who is in charge\n 2) Trump never -- not really -- thought that the protests were a bad thing. As Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse recounted of Trump in an interview last Friday: \"As this was unfolding on television, Donald Trump was walking around the White House confused about why other people on his team weren't as excited as he was as you had rioters pushing against Capitol Police trying to get into the building.\" Even Trump's public pronouncements as he sought to sort-of defuse the situation and get his supporters to leave the Capitol were larded with evidence of how he really felt -- citing that the 2020 election was stolen from him (it wasn't) and telling the rioters \"we love you.\" Given the President's feelings -- and his own personal silence in the wake of the riots -- there's not much momentum to cross him and go public with information about what exactly happened last Wednesday and how to prevent it from happening again.\n 3) The Trump administration is eight days from being over. People are headed for the exits now more rapidly than ever before, as working in the White House is rapidly becoming a scarlet letter in the country. While you're packing up your stuff and trying to get the hell out of Dodge, the last thing on your mind is talking to the public about one of the greatest law enforcement failures in modern memory.\n But whatever the reasons for the utter silence on the part of the Trump administration, it is unconscionable. Five people died in the riots. Many others were injured. And just as a reminder, the United States Capitol Building, one of the most durable symbols of democracy and freedom in this country, was overrun by a mob fed lies about the outcome of the 2020 election by the President of the United States.\n In the face of that reality, silence is simply not an option. It is the job of the federal government to both protect its citizens and inform them. Right now, President Trump and his administration are doing neither.",

        "body_text": "An Indonesian search team has recovered one of the two black boxes that belonged to the Sriwijaya Air plane that crashed in the Java Sea with 62 people on board, a crucial instrument for investigators probing the cause of the crash.\n The flight data recorder was found as a team -- including divers and a remotely operated underwater vehicle -- swept the sea floor in search of the black boxes that were on flight SJ 182 when it crashed shortly after takeoff three days ago.\n Flight data recorders process a flight's information, including pressure, airspeed and altitude. The second black box, the cockpit voice recorder, has not yet been found.\n Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto said that the black boxes' underwater acoustic beacons, which send out a series of pings to help searchers find them, had both been detached. He was optimistic, however, that the team would find the second black box soon.\n Head of the National Transport Safety Committee, Soerjanto Tjahjono, said that authorities would need two to five days to read the recovered black box's data.\n \"We are expecting that through this investigation we can unfold the mystery of this accident,\" he said.\n The Sriwijaya plane plunged into the waters northwest of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, on Saturday afternoon. The flight crashed among the Thousand Islands, a popular tourist destination among Indonesians, and was bound for Pontianak, a city on the Indonesian part of Borneo island.\n Four minutes into the flight, and amid heavy rains, the plane dropped 10,000 feet in less than a minute before disappearing from radar, according to the global flight tracking service Flightradar24.\n Navy divers found the plane's wreckage on Sunday after locating a signal from the fuselage of the plane.\n A search team has filled dozens of body bags with human remains and have recovered parts of the plane and debris from the site.\n The plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500, according to Flightradar24. Sriwijaya Airlines CEO Jefferson Irwin Jauwena said the airliner was in good condition before it took off.\n Indonesia has a poor aviation safety record and aircraft incidents are not uncommon.\n The country, with a population of 270 million people, relies heavily on air transport for commuting between islands across the archipelago, which stretches over more than 3,000 miles, around the same distance between London and New York.\n Indonesia has seen a boom in domestic aviation in recent years, with passenger traffic tripling between 2005 and 2017, according to Australian consultancy the CAPA-Center for Aviation.\n Sriwijaya Air, a low-cost airline and Indonesia's third-largest carrier, transports more than 950,000 passengers per month from its Jakarta hub to 53 destinations within Indonesia and three regional countries, according to the company's website.",

        "body_text": "A US Capitol Police officer bounded up the stairs of the Capitol building, a growing mob of insurrectionists behind him. Using himself as \"bait,\" he lured the rioters away from the entrance to the Senate chambers, where lawmakers were still debating an objection to Arizona's Electoral College vote count.\n That man is Officer Eugene Goodman. Footage from Wednesday's attack on the Capitol shows him leading the mob of Trump supporters in the opposite direction of the Senate chambers after he noticed it was unguarded.\n CNN producer Kristin Wilson identified Goodman through US Capitol Police sources. The agency has not publicly identified Goodman to CNN or other outlets.\n Footage from Wednesday captured by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic shows Goodman, the sole officer among the mob, trying to beat the rioters back several times as he radios other officers, but they continue to trail Goodman up the stairs.\n At one point, Goodman arrives at a landing and looks to a hallway to his left. A door in that hallway led to the Senate chambers, Wilson wrote in a tweet. Goodman then leads the rioters to the right, away from the Senate chambers -- and their \"targets,\" Wilson said.\n Goodman leads them into a larger hall, and backup officers arrive -- still outnumbered by rioters. Bobic stopped recording and was evacuated shortly afterward, he said.\n Bobic said Goodman herded the rioters away from the Senate Chambers at 2:14 p.m. Senators were alerted that protesters had breached the Capitol building just one minute earlier, according to CNN's timeline of events from Wednesday's riot. Vice President Mike Pence wouldn't be evacuated from the Senate until 2:30 p.m.\n The man in a hoodie seen chasing Goodman up the stairs, Doug Jensen, was arrested over the weekend for breaking into the Capitol and faces five federal charges -- of unlawfully entering the Capitol, disrupting government business, violent entry, parading in a Capitol building and blocking law enforcement during the riot.\n Political figures have called on Goodman to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor or the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor for protecting members of Congress.\n CNN has reached out to US Capitol Police for comment on Goodman's actions and is waiting to hear back.",

        "body_text": "Corporate America has finally put its money where its mouth is -- just in time for Democrats to take control of Washington.\n Last Wednesday's Capitol siege appears to have turned the president from kingmaker to radioactive. The fallout has spread to the 147 GOP lawmakers who lined up against the peaceful transfer of power.\n In the past 48 hours, American Express, Marriott, Dow, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Morgan Stanley, Commerce Bank and others have suspended their donations to Republican lawmakers who objected to certifying the votes of the Electoral College. Deutsche Bank (DB) said it would no longer do business with the president. This weekend, Apple, Google and Amazon effectively wiped conservative social network Parler off the internet. And, late last week, Facebook and Twitter, the president's preferred disinformation platform, pulled the plug on him.\n Even more companies are reviewing their political contributions and putting donations to both parties on hold. Many of their press releases frame the move as a defense of democracy and a commitment to their values.\n \"It's not a hard call for them,\" says Tony Fratto, who served in the George W. Bush Treasury Department and now advises companies. \"This is meaningful. These companies are saying we are not going to be there for you because your actions crossed this particular line -- aid and comfort to an effort to overthrow an election.\"\n This boardroom backlash is the final act in the uneasy marriage between the Trump administration and American business. Enriched by his tax cuts, but irritated by his tariffs and embarrassed by his tone, company executives have struggled to stay out of his line-of-Twitter-fire.\n Taken together, Corporate America has done more in the past 48 hours than in five years of the Trump campaign and presidency.\n \"It's long overdue, but better late than never,\" says Greg Valliere, chief US strategist for AGF Investments.\n This corporate virtue signaling comes, conveniently, as the Democrats take control of both chambers of Congress and the White House -- and the wheel on regulation. Everything from corporate tax hikes, infrastructure and trade policy is on the table. Not giving money to Republicans is arguably a donation-in-kind to the party now in power.\n \"Whether companies are doing this because they are disgusted with the politicians or because they think their customers, employees, and investors are, that's exactly how markets are supposed to work,\" says corporate governance expert Nell Minow.\n \"Of course they want to be on the winning side,\" Valliere says. \"But I think there's almost a sense of shame over getting in bed with Trump.  If business wants to take a shower and cleanse themselves, I'll happily focus on this change of attitude rather than any self-serving motives.\"\n Self-serving, yes, but also unavoidable.\n \"I understand why people want to have a cynical view of this.\" says Fratto. \"That doesn't give enough credit to just how disturbing events were last week.\" He notes the people who make these political decisions for business PACS were horrified by the sights of Congress and democracy under siege.\n \"Their heads of government relations walked those halls and worked in those halls. There is pretty deep-seated anger over that event.\"\n Pulling donations from GOP lawmakers no question sends a big message. Money talks in American politics. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, business PACs contributed $360 million in the 2020 cycle, with 57% going to Republicans.\n \"Corporate political contributions and lobbying expenditures are a massive distorting factor that erodes the credibility of our system of government.,\" says governance expert Minow. \"This is not the first time corporations have been embarrassed by their support. I hope, however, it is the beginning of more thoughtful and principled and transparent policies in the future.\"",

        "title": "Sudden change to Homeland Security leadership raises new worries at the worst possible time",
        "body_text": "Against the backdrop of looming threats leading up to Inauguration Day, the Department of Homeland Security is bringing in its sixth secretary under President Donald Trump, fueling concerns over a department in flux as authorities brace for the possibility of more violence.\n Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf abruptly resigned Monday after serving in the role since November 2019. In the middle of a national security crisis, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor -- whose extensive experience in emergency management has been cited as a benefit -- assumes the role of acting secretary.\n The carousel of leaders who have filled, then vacated, roles within the Department of Homeland Security over the last four years has fueled turmoil and distrust -- and it now comes just days before a major security event.\n The acting leaders of the Defense, Justice and Homeland Security departments are all relatively new to their jobs. Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller began in early November and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen started on Christmas Eve.\n In a letter to the department, Wolf cited in part ongoing litigation challenging the validity of his appointment. \"I am saddened to take this step, as it was my intention to serve the Department until the end of this Administration,\" Wolf wrote. But those legal challenges have been ongoing and a White House decision to rescind his formal nomination last week only made things more tenuous.\n \"For months we have known Chad Wolf has been serving illegally in his position, so the timing of his resignation from the Department today is questionable. He has chosen to resign during a time of national crisis and when domestic terrorists may be planning additional attacks on our government,\" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson in a statement Monday.\n Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat and member of the Armed Services Committee, accused Wolf of \"shirking\" his responsibilities, but said the immediate question is dealing with the widespread domestic terrorism event that was \"birthed last week.\"\n \"We have a lot of adversaries that are looking to take advantage of us during this time period of extreme vulnerability,\" Crow said.\n Rep. Conor Lamb told CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday that lawmakers had been warned about a plan by extremists to encircle the seat of Congress and as well as more threats against legislators. \"They were talking about 4,000 armed 'patriots' to surround the Capitol and prevent any Democrat from going in,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat said.\n Shortly before publicly announcing his resignation, Wolf said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin National Special Security Event operations for the inauguration on Wednesday instead of January 19, citing in part \"events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration.\"\n The inauguration is designated as a National Special Security Event, which is intended to bring in the full force of the federal government and its resources. Presidential nominating conventions, for example, is also designated as a National Special Security Event. Planning for these events often happens at least a year in advance, according to a former DHS official.\n \"I don't know that him leaving is going to have that much of an impact operationally,\" the former official said of Wolf, noting that DHS has been operating under acting leadership for much of the Trump administration and to some degree, is accustomed to the consistent change.\n \"It's a component operation. The role of a secretary in a NSSE is less operational, and more administrative,\" another former DHS official said. \"The doers are at the worker bee level.\"\n A senior DHS official told CNN that planning is ongoing, despite the change in leadership.\n \"As in every presidential transition, the senior career staff is diligently on the job, making sure the work of protecting the nation goes uninterrupted. Same for this,\" the official said, adding that Gaynor is uniquely qualified to facilitate coordination as a result of his extensive experience.\n \"[Emergency managers] know how to coordinate and that's what we need right now. That's why Pete is the perfect guy,\" the official said.\n Another DHS official echoed the same confidence in inauguration planning. \"Those plans are developed by experts and will be implemented as planned,\" the official said.\n \"I've been working with Administrator Gaynor, now Secretary Gaynor, for quite some time and he knows the department well and is well prepared to lead the department,\" Ken Cuccinelli, senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary, said on Fox News Tuesday morning.\n The White House referred questions about Wolf's departure to DHS.\n Gaynor, who was confirmed by the Senate last January, has more than 11 years of experience in emergency management and served for 26 years as an enlisted Marine and Infantry Officer in the United States Marine Corps, according to his FEMA bio. During his time in the Marines, he was also assigned as the executive officer responsible for the security of Camp David.\n \"He's got a lot of experience working with Secret Service from his time at Camp David,\" the former DHS official told CNN, adding that Gaynor is \"very capable.\"\n Under Gaynor's tenure at FEMA, the agency juggled natural disasters as well as response to the coronavirus pandemic, including distribution of personal protective equipment.\n Last year, in an attempt to self-correct the succession order, DHS had Gaynor temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf's legitimacy as acting chief of the department. Under one interpretation, Gaynor would be the lawfully serving acting secretary based on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n Gaynor told his workforce Monday that he would serve as acting DHS secretary until January 20 when Biden is inaugurated, adding that a regional administrator, Bob Fenton, will serve as the senior official performing the duties of the FEMA administrator in the interim.\n \"While there are many changes during any Presidential transition, our focus at FEMA continues to be helping people before, during and after disasters. Right now, our nation is facing significant challenges and it is our privilege to support the nationwide efforts to fight the pandemic and protect our homeland,\" Gaynor said.\n FEMA is among the components involved in National Special Security Events to facilitate coordination across government entities.\n Since last Wednesday's attack on the Capitol, there have been adjustments to inauguration planning, according to the senior DHS official. \"There will be measures in place, some of which are visible, some of which are not, that will serve as a deterrent for threats,\" the official said.",

        "title": "The First Amendment doesn't guarantee you the rights you think it does",
        "body_text": "That's it. That's the entirety of our Constitution's First Amendment, the central tenet of our American way of life that gets dragged out every time someone's banned from Twitter.\n There's a lot going on in those few sentences, and it's important to know when and how it applies to common situations -- and, equally as important, when it doesn't.\n Let's look at some common First Amendment arguments, illuminated and debunked by constitutional experts.\n This scenario illustrates one of the biggest misconceptions people have about the First Amendment. Bottom line: It protects you from the government punishing or censoring or oppressing your speech. It doesn't apply to private organizations, like Twitter and Facebook, so those companies can ban speech the First Amendment would otherwise protect.\n However, while it's not unconstitutional, if private platforms outright ban certain types of protected speech, it sets an uncomfortable precedent for the values of free speech.\n As citizens, employees have the right to express themselves and exercise their First Amendment. But those rights don't translate to the private workplace, Gutterman says.\n But just because a private employer has the right to fire someone for something they say doesn't give them legal carte blanche. Depending on what the fired employee said, the employer could be in violation of the Civil Rights Act, or possibly in violation of contract law\n Institutions like police departments, public schools and local government branches can't restrict employee's free speech rights, but they do need to assure that such speech doesn't keep the employee from doing their job, Nott says. It's definitely a balancing act, and the rise of social media has made it harder for such institutions to regulate their employee's speech in a constitutional manner.\n \"If you invite someone to speak on your campus and are a public university, you have to respect their First Amendment rights,\" Nott says. That doesn't mean you can't put regulations on a speech, like dictating the time, place, venue and suggestions for subject matter. It just means you can't do so in a way that discriminates against a certain point of view.\n If students protesting play a hand in moving or canceling a speaker, that presents a different free speech challenge.\n \"If a speaker were to take legal action for being blocked from speaking, they can't do it against the students. You can't take constitutional action against a group of private citizens,\" she adds.\n Such a complaint would have to go against the school, for allowing the constitutional breach to happen.\n But, like pretty much everything in law, there are exceptions and nuances.\n \"It's definitely unconstitutional, unless you are trying to incite people to violence with your speech,\" Nott says. Even then, it needs to be a true threat -- one that has immediacy and some sort of actual intent.\n There's that refrain again: Private companies, like social media sites, can do whatever they want. Users agree to a site's terms of service when they join.\n But whether blocking content -- even offensive or violent content -- is within the spirit of free speech is another issue, Gutterman says.\n While such sites retain the right to remove content they don't like, they are also protected by the Communications Decency Act, Section 230.\n \"That says, if you are an internet company and you have some way for people to post or leave comments, you are not liable for what they do,\" Nott says. This covers things like obscenity, violence and threats.\n The problem is, this protection often butts up against the enforcement of basic community standards.\n \"Facebook is under enormous pressure to take down, not just violent and illegal content, but fake news,\" Nott says. \"And the more it starts to play editor for its own site, the more likely it is to lose that Section 230 protection.\"\n You are fully within your rights to record the police doing their job in public. And if you get arrested while doing so, your constitutional rights are being violated.\n This is, unless you were doing something unlawful at the time of your arrest.\n In a heated situation with police, that can also become a gray area. Physical assault or threats could obviously get you arrested, but what about if you were just yelling at the police while recording, say, to get them to stop an act or to pay attention?\n \"That's tough,\" Nott says. \"If you were disturbing the peace, you can get arrested for that, or for other things. But the bottom line is it's not a crime to record police activities in a public space.\"\n A version of this story was first published in 2017.",

        "body_text": "This was excerpted from the January 12 edition of CNN's Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\nIf you can't hear @realdonaldtrump, does he actually exist?\n America has just enjoyed its most undisturbed weekend for years, freed of the threat of being harangued at any moment by the social media feeds of a man whose presidency is all about barging uninvited into your head. His recent ejection from Twitter is forcing many journalists in Washington to ask questions that have rarely been necessary during his turbulent term: What is the President doing, what is his state of mind and what does he think?\n Trump's supporters say the online purge of the President and his ilk from social media following weeks of false claims of election fraud and dangerously inflammatory talk smacks of censorship. But Trump could hold a news conference any hour of the day or night and still get attention. He has a whole room in the White House dedicated to press briefings and a pool of reporters who follow him wherever he goes \u2014 whether on a state visit abroad or up the road to buy a burger.\n His silent weekend offered the outgoing President a taste of his future out of office. For all the predictions that he will rule the Republican Party from gold-leafed exile in Florida, the deplatformed Trump will find it harder to get the attention he has craved since his youth as a young New York tabloid personality. His eventual role as a reality show star on \"The Apprentice\" helped fashion his false image as a successful tycoon, which he leveraged into an unlikely political career. He might never have become President had it not been for Twitter.\n When he leaves office, Trump will presumably still have an open line to Fox News and smaller conservative media outlets. But he won't have quite the cachet as when he was President. And his hopes of building his own TV or social network have taken a hammering in the aftermath of the Capitol riots. A successful 2024 presidential campaign suddenly looks like an even longer shot. For an attention hound like Trump, his muzzling is going to be intolerable. For the rest of us, it will mean some peace and quiet.\n While Washington has been embroiled in its version of \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been on a Twitter victory lap, presenting his record as the best thing since Henry Kissinger. His boss might have been inciting a riot, but the top US diplomat is patting himself on the back over the return of US \"swagger.\"\n Pompeo has all but claimed a share of the World Food Program's Nobel Peace Prize, pointing out that the US bankrolls a huge chunk of the agency. The US separated hundreds of kids from their parents for crossing the border illegally, but Pompeo boasts that the US led the world \"back to basics\" on human rights.\n Pompeo is not all talk. His department is racing to inflame geopolitical tensions and deliver parting gifts to Trump-approved allies before Biden takes over: In the past two weeks, Pompeo has put Cuba on a list of terror sponsors, blown the protocols off sensitive US diplomacy with Taiwan, named Yemen's Houthi rebels a terror organization and dropped yet another round of sanctions on Iran. And there are still eight days to go.\n Here's a sampling of what's happened so far in 2021, in case you blinked:\n Last week, the Trump administration unveiled fresh sanctions on more than a dozen \"key actors\" in Iran's steel sector, the latest in a series of \"maximum pressure\" sanctions aimed at forcing Tehran to change its ways absent a nuclear deal. Experts, NGOs and local doctors say sanctions penalize ordinary Iranians by making it harder to obtain food and health supplies amid the pandemic.Over the weekend, Pompeo announced that US officials dealing with Taiwan should no longer tiptoe around diplomatic rules designed to avoid upsetting China, which considers the democratically ruled island part of its territory. US diplomats are now free to consider previous guidelines \"null and void,\" he wrote, diplomacy be damned. China has already responded that it will \"hit back.\"On Monday, the State Department put Cuba on a list of \"state sponsors of terrorism\" with only Iran, North Korea and Syria for company. But there's scant evidence of Cuban-sponsored terrorism, and Pompeo's announcement reheats allegations that Cuba harbored American fugitives from the 1970s -- most of whom are now senior citizens. The move, which reverses an Obama-era decision, will have little practical effect since Cuba was already subject to most of the relevant sanctions.The Department also said Yemen's Houthi rebels will be designated a foreign terrorist organization -- a move that might please their Saudi and UAE adversaries but will have little impact on the Iran-backed rebels. Aid groups, on the other hand, say the designation makes it harder to get humanitarian help to Houthi-ruled civilians, who face crushing poverty and hunger after years of airstrikes.\n Designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization is \"pure diplomatic vandalism,\" declared International Rescue Committee President and CEO David Miliband on Monday. \"In the name of tying up the Houthis, (the policy) will actually tie up the aid community and international diplomacy,\" he said.",

        "body_text": "The Food and Drug Administration has expanded a recall and is alerting pet owners and veterinary professionals about high levels of aflatoxin in some pet foods after 70 dogs reportedly died and over 80 others were sickened.\n The dog food in question has been identified as certain Sportmix products manufactured by Midwestern Pet Foods. The products were voluntarily recalled by the company on December 30, 2020, but Midwestern Pet Foods expanded the recall to include additional products that contain corn and were made in their Oklahoma manufacturing plant on Tuesday, according to the FDA.\n The impacted products have and expiration date on or before July 9, 2022, and have \"05\" in the date or lot code.\n Aflatoxin is produced by the Aspergillus flavus mold, the FDA said. It can grow on grains used as ingredients in pet food, and when high levels of aflatoxin are consumed, it can cause illness or death in pets.\n Pets poisoned by aflatoxin can display symptoms that include sluggishness, jaundice -- a yellowish tint in the eyes or gums caused by liver damage -- loss of appetite, vomiting or diarrhea, according to the FDA.\n Even if a pet is not displaying any symptoms of aflatoxin poisoning, the FDA recommends that pet owners who have pets that have eaten the affected products contact their veterinarian -- as it can cause long-term liver damage.\n While the FDA says there is no evidence that pet owners who have handled the affected food are at risk of aflatoxin poisoning, it recommends that they always wash their hands after handling pet food.\n The following foods added to the original recall are as follows, but the FDA says there are over 1000 affected lot codes so they are not listed individually:\n Pro Pac Adult Mini Chunk, 40 lb. bag Pro Pac Performance Puppy, 40 lb. bag Splash Fat Cat 32%, 50 lb. bag Nunn Better Maintenance, 50 lb. bagSportmix Original Cat, 15 lb. bagSportmix Original Cat, 31 lb. bagSportmix Maintenance, 44 lb. bagSportmix Maintenance, 50 lb. bagSportmix High Protein, 50 lb. bagSportmix Energy Plus, 44 lb. bagSportmix Energy Plus, 50 lb. bagSportmix Stamina, 44 lb. bagSportmix Stamina, 50 lb. bagSportmix Bite Size, 40 lb. bagSportmix Bite Size, 44 lb. bagSportmix High Energy, 44 lb. bagSportmix High Energy, 50 lb. bagSportmix Premium Puppy, 16.5 lb. bagSportmix Premium Puppy, 33 lb. bag\n Customers can find the lot code on the back of bag in a three-line code.

        "body_text": "Even after President Donald Trump's disproven allegations of voter fraud fueled last week's deadly assault on the US Capitol, Republicans across an array of swing states are still touting his baseless allegations to advance measures that would make it tougher to vote.\n When Congress voted last week, in the immediate aftermath of the Trump-fueled riot, to finalize the Electoral College results declaring Joe Biden the winner of November's election, bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate joined dozens of courts around the country in concluding that there was not meaningful fraud in the election.\n But despite those findings, Republicans in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas and likely other states including Michigan and Wisconsin are moving to roll back access to mail balloting, eliminate drop boxes, toughen voter identification laws and erect other barriers to the ballot in the name of improving voter security and restoring \"faith\" in the outcome.\n \"We are seeing a continued use of the voter fraud lie and thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories over the integrity of this election to drive a vote suppression agenda,\" says Wendy Weiser, who directs the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.\n This renewed push places Republicans on a collision course with congressional Democrats, who are likely to move quickly on legislation that would expand access. It will also likely prompt a procession of legal battles between GOP states pursuing new restrictions and a Biden Justice Department likely to resist them as violations of the Voting Rights Act.\n With Trump's long march to discredit the election results -- a campaign joined by scores of GOP elected officials -- culminating in last week's horrific violence at the Capitol, voting rights advocates believe they have their best opportunity in memory to galvanize public support for fortifying the right to vote.\n \"The country has now, I think, seen the logical endpoint of this [suppression] strategy,\" says Weiser. \"This insurrection might have unmasked the strategy for what it really is, which is an anti-democratic effort to use lies to thwart our democratic system, in particular by repudiating the votes of Black and brown people.\"\n Although the riot (understandably) overshadowed the proceedings, the congressional vote in the wee hours Thursday finalizing the Electoral College results represented a bipartisan repudiation of Trump's groundless fraud claims. While a majority of House Republicans voted to reject the results, an overwhelming majority of Senate Republicans as well as all Democrats in both chambers voted to accept them -- and in the process more Republicans than at any point since Election Day acknowledged that Trump and his team had not provided evidence to validate their claims of massive fraud.\n \"There's no evidence of significant fraud conspiracies or even significant anomalies that cast any serious doubt on who actually won the election,\" declared Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump's most reflexive defenders, agreed during his remarks that Trump had not produced evidence to support his claims: \"Fraud? They said there's 66,000 people in Georgia under 18 voted. How many people believe that? I said, give me 10. Hadn't had one. They said 8,000 felons in prison in Arizona voted. Give me 10. Hadn't got one. There's problems in every election. But I don't buy this. Enough's enough.\"\n Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky acknowledged during his statement that \"nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election.\" Public doubt about the result, he continued, \"was incited without any evidence.\"\n These admissions by Senate Republicans capped weeks of similar conclusions from courts and state election officials. The result of Trump's extensive campaign to overturn the result was that this year's balloting received likely the most extensive and comprehensive after-action review of any modern election. And, like earlier efforts from Republican administrations to find systematic fraud -- such as a push under the Department of Justice under George W. Bush, along with Trump's own disbanded voter fraud commission -- the reviews turned up almost nothing.\n \"This has been as vetted as any election could possibly be, and has gotten as clean a bill of health as any election could,\" says Weiser.\n Yet none of that has prevented Republicans across key swing states from offering measures that would create new obstacles to voting on the grounds of fighting fraud or restoring \"faith\" in the election system.\n In a parallel move, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida plans to shortly reintroduce legislation that would mandate national voter-ID laws, require all absentee ballots to be requested at least 21 days before Election Day and bar states from accepting mail-in ballots received after that date. Scott is the incoming chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's Senate campaign arm.\n \"This election has shown we need reforms to our election systems and we need to rebuild trust in our elections,\" Sarah Schwirian, Scott's deputy communications director, told me in an email.\n Despite his remarks acknowledging the absence of fraud, McConnell also called for \"strong state-led voting reforms.\"\n In the states, the push may be greatest in Georgia, which, amid record turnout, saw Biden carry the state -- the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992 -- and Democrats sweep both of this month's US Senate runoffs. In the state legislative session that convened Monday, the state Senate Republican majority pledged to repeal the state's law allowing voters to request absentee ballots for any reason, to impose new photo-identification requirements on any absentee voting that remains and to eliminate drop boxes for returning such ballots.\n \"The Georgia Senate Republicans have heard the calls of millions of Georgians who have raised deep and heartfelt concerns that state law has been violated and our election process abused,\" the caucus said in a statement last month. \"We will fix this.\"\n The Republican speaker of the state House has expressed reluctance to revoke no-excuse absentee balloting, but Georgia's GOP secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who drew national attention for resisting Trump's demands to subvert the election, has endorsed the repeal. Raffensperger has cited both claims of \"election integrity\" and the argument that large-scale absentee voting, combined with early in-person voting and Election Day itself, creates too much work for county election officials.\n Raffensperger continues to support the repeal even though an audit of absentee ballots in Cobb County conducted by his office found virtually no discrepancies. Republican legislators are also pushing proposals to bar local governments or organizations from mailing absentee-ballot requests to voters and to prohibit groups from organizing buses to the polls during early voting.\n In Pennsylvania, Republican legislators have also proposed bills to repeal the no-excuse absentee ballot law passed in 2019. Though Toomey, the state's Republican US senator, has acknowledged that no one has produced evidence of fraud in Pennsylvania's balloting, state Rep. Jim Gregory introduced the repeal by declaring, \"This past Presidential Election cycle we witnessed an extreme amount of irregularities regarding mail-in ballots.\"\n Other state legislative Republicans, hesitant about completely repealing no-excuse absentee balloting, want to ban drop boxes, bar voters from signing up to automatically receive absentee ballots during each election and impose tighter signature-verification requirements.\n Texas is already one of the states that make it toughest to register or vote (it allows absentee voting for only a limited number of causes), but Republican legislators there are looking at adding new hurdles, including a ban on local governments mailing out absentee ballot requests, as some Democratic-leaning large counties tried to do last year.\n Specific proposals to roll back absentee balloting haven't yet surfaced in Michigan, but appear likely in the upcoming session after the GOP-controlled state House and Senate each held extensive hearings in December that allowed Trump allies to air wild claims of fraud.\n At the hearings, \"it was pretty clear ... that they were trying to build fodder for potential voter suppression efforts,\" says Sam Inglot, deputy director of Progress Michigan, a progressive advocacy group.\n The Republican-controlled state Legislature in Wisconsin seems poised to act too.\n The prospects for these measures -- and others that may be coming in states with Republican-controlled legislatures -- are mixed. Democratic governors in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would be certain to veto any GOP efforts to roll back ballot access. But advocates of expanding voter access worry that even if legislation fails in those states the effort will provide new oxygen for the same unproven fraud claims that fanned last week's insurrection.\n For Michigan Republicans, pursuing legislation that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is certain to veto may be just \"a tactic to really try and fire up their base, but that is a very dangerous proposition because what we just saw was an insurrection fueled by this misinformation,\" says Art Reyes III, executive director of We the People-Michigan, a liberal group that organizes working-class communities around the state.\n Civil rights experts say that if red states pass laws rolling back mail balloting or adding other restrictions, it's likely the Biden Justice Department would fight them in court. But that may be a limited remedy. In the 2013 Shelby County decision, five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices outvoted four Democratic-appointed justices to effectively repeal the federal government's authority under the Voting Rights Act to require that states with a history of discrimination receive preclearance for changes in election laws.\n As a result, Washington can fight such laws only with litigation after the fact under another section of the act. And that is a lengthy and time-consuming process, as Vanita Gupta, at the time president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, acknowledged in an interview with me last month. Gupta has since taken a leave from the organization now that Biden has nominated her for the number three position at the Justice Department.\n \"It can take years and a lot of money to actually litigate these cases, during which elections are taking place pursuant to what could be unconstitutional laws,\" she told me. \"So [that] is hardly a remedy.\"\n Gupta said the more feasible response was intense pressure on legislatures not to add these restrictions in the first place. Such resistance could emerge: Efforts to protect the vote against Trump's calls to overthrow the results drew intense public pushback in Michigan, Georgia and other states, and the expanded mail balloting and other measures taken to ensure access during the pandemic proved extremely popular with voters.\n \"What we've seen coming out of Covid is this extraordinary surfacing of these profound inequities in voting, and people don't want to go back,\" says Hannah Fried, national campaign director for All Voting is Local, a project of the Leadership Conference. \"People never should have waited in a long line to vote; people never should have had to pay to return an absentee ballot. But now we see that as even more unfair.\"\n In states with unified Republican control of government, however, like Georgia and Texas, opponents may not be able to stop new voting restrictions. That could focus more attention on Democratic efforts to establish expansive nationwide voting rules.\n In the previous Congress, House Democrats passed both a new Voting Rights Act restoring the federal government's preclearance authority, and a sweeping election bill known as HR 1, which, among other things, requires states to permit online and same-day voter registration and provide at least 15 days of in-person early voting. Reintroduced in the new Congress this month as HR 1, the bill now also requires states to offer no-excuse absentee voting.\n House sponsors say they expect the bill to pass within the opening weeks of the new Congress. In the previous Congress, House Democrats passed the new Voting Rights Act and HR 1 without a single dissenting vote; every Senate Democrat endorsed both measures as well. Every House Republican opposed both bills except for one who supported the new Voting Rights Act.\n Even if the House, as is likely, passes both bills, Senate Republican filibusters against each are virtually certain. It would be extremely difficult for Democrats to attract enough GOP support to reach the 60 votes required to pass such measures through the upper chamber.\n For that reason, these measures to protect and expand voting rights could become a flashpoint in the debate among Senate Democrats about whether to try to overturn the filibuster, which could be eliminated with a majority vote.\n In an interview with me last summer, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the principal proponent of ending the filibuster, said he believed that Democrats reluctant to terminate it for all issues might consider doing so solely for revisions in election rules.\n Uniting all 50 Senate Democrats behind even a limited filibuster repeal wouldn't be easy. But ironically, a new push in Republican states to restrict voting access --even after Trump's fraud claims were both disproven and implicated in last week's unprecedented violence -- could increase pressure on Senate Democrats to act, even if that means confronting the filibuster.\n \"Voters do not want to go back to how things were,\" says Fried. \"And I don't think people who are in position to change this ... want to be on the wrong side of history.\"",

        "body_text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said Tuesday it will require a negative Covid-19 test from all air passengers entering the United States -- a move it says may help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n Air passengers will be required to get a viral test within three days before their flight to the United States departs, and to provide written documentation of their lab results, or documentation of having recovered from Covid-19, the agency said in a statement to CNN.\n CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield is expected to sign the order on Tuesday and it will go into effect on January 26.\n \"Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continue to emerge in countries around the world, and there is evidence of increased transmissibility of some of these variants,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"With the US already in surge status, the testing requirement for air passengers will help slow the spread of the virus as we work to vaccinate the American public.\"\n If a passenger does not provide documentation of a negative test or recovery, or chooses not to take a test, the airline must not allow the passenger to board, the CDC said.\n \"Testing does not eliminate all risk, but when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations,\" Redfield said in the statement.\n The new variant of coronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible, has already been found in at least 10 states in samples dating back to mid-December.\n An airline industry group has expressed support for the new measure.\n \"[We are] writing to express our support for a [CDC] proposal to control the spread of COVID-19, including variants of the virus, by implementing a global program to require testing for travelers to the United States,\" the industry group Airlines for America wrote to Vice President Mike Pence on January 4.\n The new rule is similar to one put in place last month for passengers from the UK to the US, which requires that passengers have a negative test within three days of boarding their flight. For the UK requirement that went through last month, airlines can be subject to criminal penalties if they fail to comply, and passengers can be subject to criminal penalties if they willfully give false or misleading information.\n The earlier requirement for UK travelers was a response to a new coronavirus variant that was identified in the UK. While the variant appears to spread more easily, there's no evidence that it's any more deadly or causes more severe disease, according to CDC.\n At least 72 cases of a variant first identified in the UK have been found in 10 US states, according to data posted Monday by the CDC. That includes at least 32 cases in California, 22 cases in Florida, five cases in Minnesota, four cases in New York, three cases in Colorado, two cases in Connecticut, and one case each in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia.\n The variant has been identified in dozens of countries worldwide.\n Michael Nedelman, Maggie Fox and Jamie Gumbrecht contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Even before the pandemic hit, the Cherokee Nation was dealing with a crisis: the potential disappearance of its native language.\n Only about 2,000 people can speak the Cherokee language fluently. And as Covid-19 began to spread, that number started to dwindle.\n So when the Cherokee Nation began receiving shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine, the tribal government identified Cherokee speakers as among the first groups to be eligible for the shot.\n \"When you lose a speaker and you're a tribe that has only 2,000 fluent speakers left, you've lost something that isn't just irreplaceable, as all life is, but is really a national treasure,\" Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. told CNN. \"Whether they survive and whether they pass down their knowledge will help determine in a couple of generations if there is a Cherokee language left.\"\n Vaccinating Cherokee language speakers alongside frontline health care workers is just the latest effort the tribe has made during the pandemic to keep this treasured population safe.\n And in doing so, the tribe is not only protecting some of most revered citizens, but also ensuring the survival of its culture and identity.\n In relative terms, the Cherokee Nation has fared much better than other tribes and many parts of the US in controlling the spread of the virus.\n The tribe, with about 141,000 citizens living on its reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, has reported a total of more than 12,300 Covid-19 cases and 69 deaths as of Tuesday. More than 30 of those lost were native Cherokee speakers, according to the tribe.\n \"When I took office, preserving our language and revitalizing it was a high priority,\" Hoskin said. \"In the midst of Covid, knowing what we're losing, it just tells me that that's the right priority and we need to emphasize it even more.\"\n The first 975 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine arrived in the Cherokee Nation on December 14. The next morning, the tribe started vaccinating frontline health care workers at its health complex in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.\n Three days later, the tribe began administering the shot to Cherokee language speakers.\n The Cherokee Nation already had a record of its living first language speakers, thanks to an effort Hoskin initiated in 2018 when he was the tribe's secretary of state. So its staff started contacting those listed in the speaker roll book to let them know they could now schedule an appointment to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\n More than 600 speakers have been vaccinated so far, according to the tribe. The aim is to vaccinate 1,000 by the end of the week.\n On January 4, the Cherokee Nation announced it was beginning vaccinations for elders aged 65 and older.\n Prioritizing the vaccination of Cherokee speakers and elders has also had an unintended consequence: It has built trust in the vaccine among other citizens of the tribe.\n Hoskin said he's seen some hesitation among Cherokee Nation citizens about taking the vaccine. But the tribe's decision to vaccinate native speakers early helped ease the anxieties that some people might have otherwise had, he added.\n \"People revere elders in the Cherokee Nation,\" he said. \"I think when they saw that group of people being made a high priority and celebrating it, that surely has built some confidence.\"\n Sandra Turner got her first vaccine dose in December and received her booster shot last week.\n Turner, 64, grew up speaking Cherokee at home in a family of 11 children. Until about first or second grade, she didn't even know English. And even then, she and the many other Cherokee students at her school would speak to each other in the language they knew best.\n Today, people like her are rare.\n Turner, who lives in Salina, Oklahoma, knows firsthand the threat that Covid-19 poses to her mother tongue. Just last week, she attended the funeral of her children's father, who died of the virus and spoke the language fluently like herself.\n So when Turner received an email informing her that she could receive the vaccine, she says she was grateful.\n \"We have been losing a lot of our fluent speakers due to the virus,\" she said. \"And I was ready. I said, 'I'm getting in line.'\"\n As one of the few people left whose first language was Cherokee, John Ross, 65, says he felt a responsibility to get the shot as soon as it was available to him.\n Ross, who lives in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, is a translator for the Cherokee Nation. He's actively worked to preserve the language he grew up with, including getting Cherokee on Microsoft Office programs and making vaccine information from Pfizer and Moderna available in Cherokee. And it's important that that work continues.\n \"As a Cherokee speaker, there's probably less than 2,000 speakers left like me that's alive on the face of this earth,\" he said. \"They want to keep us as long as we can because we try to help out to preserve our language to the young ones or whoever wants to learn.\"\n Fortunately for those interested in learning Cherokee, Ross received his final dose of the vaccine last week.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nDays after the US Capitol siege, which saw a mob storm the halls of Congress and unmasked Republicans pack into secure rooms with their colleagues, lawmakers are beginning to fear that the riot kicked off a coronavirus superspreader event.\n Lawmakers and Capitol staff on Sunday received a memo from the Capitol's attending physician warning of a possible risk of Covid-19 exposure after lawmakers were forced to gather in a secure location during the breach of the Capitol.\n Two Democratic lawmakers who have tested positive in the days since are blaming fellow members of Congress who refused to wear masks while sheltering in place.\n \"Only hours after President Trump incited a deadly assault on our Capitol, our country, and our democracy, many Republicans still refused to take the bare minimum COVID-19 precaution and simply wear a damn mask in a crowded room during a pandemic \u2014 creating a superspreader event on top of a domestic terrorist attack,\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington said, announcing her result on Tuesday.\n Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said in a statement that she believes she was \"exposed during protective isolation in the US Capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots.\" An aide told CNN that Watson Coleman was in a room with six House Republicans, who were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the siege.\n Two Republican lawmakers who were in protective isolation at the Capitol have also announced that they tested positive for the virus.\n As the nation's capital continues to reel from the fallout of the riot, Washington, DC is dealing with a broader surge of the virus. On Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser called on the President to issue a pre-emergency declaration for the District of Columbia ahead of Inauguration Day, citing concerns of both the spread of Covid-19 and the aftermath of the \"January 6 domestic terror attack.\"\n Currently, the vaccine is given as two doses about a month apart.

Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415.\n World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan warned on Monday that herd immunity is unlikely to be reached this year, despite the Covid-19 vaccines already being rolled out around the world, saying it takes time to scale up the production of doses.\n Mass coronavirus vaccination efforts are under way in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. But many countries are still waiting to secure deals and receive doses -- an estimated 70-90% of the world's 7.8 billion people would need to receive the vaccine before achieving the so-called \"herd immunity\" required for people to return to normal life.\n \"Even as vaccines start protecting the most vulnerable, we are not going to achieve any level of population immunity, or herd immunity in 2021,\" Swaminathan told a briefing. \"Even if it happens in a couple of pockets in a few countries, it's not going to protect people across the world.\"\n Most patients who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 still suffered a variety of symptoms -- including fatigue and sleep difficulties -- six months after infection, a Chinese study has found.\n The study of more than 1,700 patients treated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, shows 76% suffered at least one symptom months after they were discharged from hospital.\n The findings indicate that even people who recover from Covid-19 may suffer long-lasting health impacts from their bout with the coronavirus, which has now infected more than 90 million people worldwide.\n The Republic of Ireland recorded the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the world last week, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University.\n The staggering surge in transmission has been blamed on the relaxation of lockdown rules over the Christmas holiday, combined with the appearance of the more transmissible variant of the virus first identified in England.\n Things don't look much better in the UK, which England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said has reached \"the worst point\" of the pandemic as cases rise and hospitals reach their breaking point. The country, which has already suffered more deaths as a result of the disease than any European nation, recently became the fifth nation on earth to reach the grim milestone of three million cases.\n President-elect Joe Biden on Monday received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on camera, as part of an effort by the incoming administration to reassure the country of the safety of the vaccines.For the past week, the US averaged more than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths per day. The situation is spiraling out of control in Los Angeles, California where deaths have increased by 1,000%.     Preparations for the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games are moving ahead despite the Covid-19 state of emergency in the Japanese capital and other prefectures, the head of the Organizing Committee said Tuesday.  South African President Cyril Ramaphosa extended the country's existing coronavirus restrictions on Monday, closing land borders through mid-February, citing a \"massive increase\" in Covid-19 cases driven by a variant discovered there last year. The King of Malaysia has declared a state of emergency until August 1 to contain a rise in Covid-19 infections, according to state news agency Bernama.

        "body_text": "Just now, silence may not be that comforting.\n For years there has been a din on social media -- from President Trump on Twitter (TWTR), from right wing extremists amplifying his varying brands of crazy, from smaller sites hatching their own parallel universe.\n But now Trump is off Twitter, and Parler seems shut down for the foreseeable future, there is a discombobulating quiet that gives rise to some uncomfortable questions: What next? Does the lack of oxygen mean these ideas -- and the personalities that espouse them -- simply wither? Do they move wholesale to a new and less-moderated platform? Or do they move to a yet smaller, more radical circle, where their ideas become more extreme?\n There is a lot we do not know, but the broad consensus from experts and law enforcement in this field is that less space for extremists online is a good thing. Yet there are pertinent questions as to how the far-right have adapted and will adapt their message online to avoid scrutiny and further deplatforming. Certainly, also, there is no precedent for the deplatforming of the world's most powerful man -- no sense of what it might mean.\n In some ways, this is new and troubling territory. In others, it is familiar. Social media played a vital role with ISIS, both in its rise and its dismantling. It was often startling just how much open information from a terror group you could access on a US-based website -- like Twitter -- that your mother might also frequent. And while persistent campaigns against ISIS online did not remove the horror entirely, it did significant damage to its ability to recruit, terrify, and proliferate its ideology.\n (To be clear, I am not comparing ISIS to the US far-right or to Trump supporters generally -- such direct comparisons are clumsy, far-fetched and ultimately lazy -- but the deplatforming campaign waged against ISIS is a rare direct parallel to what is happening now, and it is worthexamining how lessons learned from its online rise and fall might be useful in combating US domestic terrorism).\n \"In 2013 and 2014, ISIS content was just out in the open\", said Amarnath Amarasingam, associate fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. \"Young adults were almost stumbling on this content, and then would enter into a new community of ISIS supporters almost by accident. Deplatforming protects against this to some degree.\"\n Twitter and other platforms would have periodic -- and sometimes urgent -- purges in which accounts would vanish. A former senior US counter terrorism official with experience fighting ISIS who requested anonymity in order to speak freely said \"there's value in pushing violent extremists off platforms that have the widest audiences\", while accepting that doing so would not completely silence the extremists. \"But it will make them harder to be found and, even more importantly, to stumble upon casually.\"\n But, Amarasingam said, the \"truly committed\" found a way back into the networks online, or in the physical world -- including the territorial Caliphate ISIS had for a while. \"Die-hard supporters are already plugged into the network, usually in private groups anyway. They usually were able to keep in touch. People studying this stuff just lost visibility\", he said.\n What will happen as the far-right replicates that pattern now is an urgent question in the United States, where extremists went to Parler, and now will perhaps migrate to Gab -- less popular platforms, where minimal moderation permits an information atmosphere of often dizzying and sometimes violent mistruths. (Indeed, at the time of writing, Gab was promoting itself on Twitter with Exodus' biblical verse about \"letting my people go.\")\n Amarasingam said a sustained approach against even ISIS's more advanced networks online did have a significant impact. He noted a Europol campaign in November 2019 against ISIS extremists on Telegram -- an encrypted messaging app that many far-right extremists in the US are reported to be moving to now. The pressure forced supporters onto other apps, which quickly kicked them off too. The strategy worked, reducing significantly the space for ISIS on Telegram because the effort was sustained. It might again too with the far-right, he said.\n \"Their reach will be diminished, their ability to form a real community online will be crippled, and they will spend most of their time simply trying to claw their way back as opposed to producing and disseminating new content\" he said, dismissing the idea advanced by some experts that allowing extremists to air their views among a platform mostly inhabited by moderates might temper their behaviour. \"Keeping neo-Nazis chasing their tail instead of barking at the rest of us is always a good idea\", Amarasingam said. He noted smaller groups of more radical extremists are also more easily and profitably infiltrated by law enforcement.\n One factor that could make it harder for platforms to take action against the far-right is that some studies have suggested its online profile is less blatant than ISIS'. Professor Maura Conway at Dublin City University, who has extensively studied far-right extremism online, said their propaganda was often much less explicit in terms of its message and branding and was therefore harder to block or stop. It doesn't, for example, have something like the black flag that was ubiquitous among ISIS supporters, or images of masked militants in fatigues.\n She wrote, in a February 2020 study called \"Routing the Extreme Right\", that they \"cannot legitimately be compared to ISIS\" as they are more a \"fast-changing 'scene' rather than a group\". Conway wrote these extremists espoused \"common extreme right-wing talking points\" in such a way that political leaders and swathes of the public might identify with them.\n \"For example, in an online post, Patrick Crusius, the alleged El Paso shooter\", she wrote, \"described the purpose of his attack as warding off the 'Hispanic invasion of Texas', which is a commonplace talking point on the US president's preferred television station, Fox News, and a trope that Trump himself has employed repeatedly.\"\n Conway added this high-profile endorsement shifted the \"Overton Window\" of ideas considered acceptable in public, and made it harder to \"respond effectively to right-wing extremist content ...because to do so will increasingly be framed as reflecting a political bias against the right more broadly.\"\n Money is another complicating factor. Conway noted that far-right content also seemed profitable, drawing, according to her research, greater numbers of followers (and so eyeballs for advertisers) than ISIS content -- on average about six times as many, when comparing followers of ISIS to far-right Twitter accounts. \"The possibility for some platforms to profit from extreme-right activity is considerable\", she wrote.\n And the de-platforming of the world's most powerful man presents a new challenge. President Trump's office theoretically provides the largest platform in the world whenever he should choose to use it: in mainstream media, press statements, or the White House briefing room. But it may have been the raw nature of @realDonaldTrump that made it so popular, said Conway.\n \"It was precisely the sense that one was getting the US President's unfiltered views via his Twitter account which made the @realDonaldTrump account so compelling to so many\", she emailed. Conway said other platforms were similar to Twitter, but none a precise replica, so she would not discount the possible impediment of Trump's \"personal learning curve ...in switching to a new platform.\"\n Other toxic personalities have almost vanished after being deplatformed. The urgent question the US will learn the answer to in the weeks ahead is whether a historic figure -- like an ex-president -- can still influence through the internet when his many millions of followers have been scattered into an online netherworld.\n In 2021, with the trillions our online lives are worth, there is little blunter indictment of the mess we are in online that -- when faced with this high-stakes, existential question for democracy and the safety of Americans -- officials and tech giants do not have a ready answer.",

        "title": "New terror threat points to plot to surround Capitol, lawmaker says",
        "body_text": "Thousands of armed pro-Donald Trump extremists are plotting to surround the US Capitol ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, according to a member of Congress who was among those briefed late Monday on a series of new threats against lawmakers and the Capitol itself.\n \"They were talking about 4,000 armed 'patriots' to surround the Capitol and prevent any Democrat from going in,\" Rep. Conor Lamb, a Pennsylvania Democrat, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"They have published rules of engagement, meaning when you shoot and when you don't. So this is an organized group that has a plan. They are committed to doing what they're doing because I think in their minds, you know, they are patriots and they're talking about 1776 and so this is now a contest of wills.\"\n He continued, \"We are not negotiating with or reasoning with these people. They have to be prosecuted. They have to be stopped. And unfortunately, that includes the President, which is why he needs to be impeached and removed from office.\"\n Monday's briefing followed an FBI bulletin warning of \"armed protests\" being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington, DC, and provides the latest sense of a heightened state of alarm among lawmakers and law enforcement officials following last week's deadly siege at the US Capitol.\n Two Democratic lawmakers who participated in the briefing told CNN that they were walked through several scenarios on a call Monday and officers were sober about the threats. An effort was made to emphasize how different security is right now, the members said.\n \"They are very strong when we are weak. That is when the mob psychology takes hold and they are emboldened, but when met with actual determined force, I think a lot of these fantasy world beliefs about what will happen when they come to Washington will melt away,\" one of the members said.\n The member added that lawmakers are hoping National Guard troops who are being dispatched to the capital are vetted, because while lawmakers trust most of them, many will be coming in from all over the country.\n Early Tuesday afternoon, The Washington Post reported that an FBI office in Norfolk, Virginia, issued an \"explicit internal warning that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and 'war.'\" Although the FBI report was described as not \"finally evaluated intelligence,\" it is likely to raise additional questions about how law enforcement officials missed signs leading up to last week's attack and readiness ahead of potential new threats.\n The congressional inaugural committee on Tuesday said it would initiate a special security event on Wednesday and informed those at the Capitol to \"expect a significant law enforcement and national guard presence as part of the layered security measures within the expanded footprint.\"\n In Washington itself, security measures are being stepped up, with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies preparing for the possibility of more violence.\n Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday urged Americans to avoid the city during Biden's inauguration next week and to participate virtually, referring at a news conference to \"very extreme factions in our country that are armed and dangerous.\"\n At the mayor's request, Trump approved an emergency declaration for the city ahead of the ceremony.\n In addition to warning of possibly more armed demonstrations by right-wing groups in coming days, the FBI is tracking reports of \"various threats to harm President-Elect Biden ahead of the presidential inauguration,\" the bulletin states. \"Additional reports indicate threats against VP-Elect Harris and Speaker Pelosi.\n Asked if Biden should still do a traditional outside inauguration given the information he has received, Lamb said if Biden wants to have one outside, he will be there beside him.\n \"I believe that Joe Biden was elected President by a huge margin because the American people trust him to exercise powers of commander in chief. And I saw him on TV yesterday saying he's not afraid to do this outside. And I agree with him and I believe him,\" Lamb said. \"So if that's what he wants to do, I'll be right there beside him because I think the most important thing is to continue showing all Americans that no matter how impassioned and, you know, committed these people who attacked the Capitol are, we are more committed.\"\n Trump on Tuesday insisted his inflammatory speech an hour before last week's siege -- in which he told supporters they will \"never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong\" -- was \"totally appropriate.\" He did not condemn last week's events and sought to create a false equivalency with the deadly violence committed by his supporters in his name with protests over the summer in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, that largely focused on racial justice.\n The President did not address the prospect of additional threats in the days ahead, but said, \"you always have to avoid violence.\"\n This story has been updated with additional reporting and background information.\n CNN's Daniella Diaz and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Things are so bad in Los Angeles County that health officials are now advising all essential workers to wear masks inside their own home to prevent spreading Covid-19 within their household.\n \"Right now, because there is so much spread, we're recommending that people wear their face coverings while they're inside the home,\" Los Angeles County Director of Public Health Barbara Ferrer said in a news conference Monday. That's for people who are either leaving their home every day for work or who are running errands regularly for their family, Ferrer said.\n Doing so, she said, \"will add a layer of protection while we get through this surge.\"\n For the county, that surge has been long and brutal. Every minute, an average of 10 people test positive for the virus, county health officials said Monday. More than 932,600 people have tested positive in the county throughout the pandemic.\n There are more than 7,900 Covid-19 patients hospitalized countywide -- 22% of whom are in intensive care units. In just two months, the county has seen an increase of more than 1,000% in its average hospitalizations -- a grim jump that has pushed hospitals to their breaking point.\n And last week, the county said a person was dying of Covid-19 every eight minutes. A total of more than 12,300 people have died, county health officials said.\n \"The damaging impact to our families and our local hospitals from this surge is the worst disaster our county has experienced in decades,\" health officials said Monday. \"And, as with other terrifying situations, the end of the surge only happens when more people and businesses take control and do the right thing.\"\n As Los Angeles approaches the one-year mark of its first known positive case of Covid-19, the numerous citations and business closures where large outbreaks have occurred have been insufficient because appropriate action is not being taken on an individual level as many residents are \"failing to protect each other,\" Ferrer said.\n \"Now is not the time to meet with friends at your home to watch the game,\" Ferrer said in a statement. \"It is not the time to go for a walk without a mask.\"\n \"All it takes is one mistake and soon, five, 10 or 20 other people become infected -- many of whom could be your friends, family members, or colleagues.\"",

Interest in businesses that have updated their Covid-19 sections increased more than 40% between September and December 2020, Yelp said.\n Last year, the website also added warnings on businesses that were accused of \"overtly racist actions.\" Reports of businesses engaging in alleged racist behavior on Yelp increased last spring and summer, when the police killing of George Floyd sparked protests across the United States.",

        "title": "Trump's disastrous end to his shocking presidency",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump is leaving America in a vortex of violence, sickness and death and more internally estranged than it has been for 150 years.\n The disorientating end to his shocking term has the nation reeling from a Washington insurrection. The FBI warned Monday of armed protests by pro-Trump thugs in 50 states, which raise the awful prospect of a domestic insurgency. Lawmakers have been briefed about a plot to surround the US Capitol by extremists inspired by Trump's false and dangerous claims the election was stolen. Health officials fear 5,000 Americans could soon be dying every day from the pandemic Trump ignored. Hospitals are swamped and medical workers are shattered amid a faltering rollout of the vaccine supposed to end the crisis.\n It took 200 years for the country to rack up its first two presidential impeachments. Trump's malfeasance has led the country down that awful, divisive path twice in just more than a year. With House Democrats expected to formally impeach the President for inciting a mob assault on Congress on Wednesday, he will rely on the Republican enablers who refused to rein in his lawlessness to save him from conviction again.\n Millions of Americans have bought into the delusional, poisoned fiction that an election Trump lost was stolen, and there are signs that some police and military forces have been radicalized by the grievance he stokes.\n The city Trump has called home for four years is being turned into an armed camp incongruous with the mood of joy and renewal that pulsates through most inaugurations. In a symbol of a democracy under siege, the people's buildings -- the White House and the US Capitol -- are caged behind ugly iron and cement barriers.\n This is the legacy President-elect Joe Biden will inherit in eight days when he swears to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution -- an oath that Trump trampled when inciting the Capitol attack last week from behind a bulletproof screen while buckling the cherished US chain of peaceful transfers of power.\n With unintended irony, Biden's team has picked \"America United\" as the inaugural theme -- a motto that is now more apt in defining Biden's hoped for destination rather than the splintered land he will begin to lead.\n It is becoming ever more obvious that the horrific scenes on Capitol Hill on Wednesday were not a one-off. Instead, they now look part of a pattern including the White supremacist marches in Charlottesville that Trump refused to condemn, and the gassing of peaceful anti-racist protesters in the square outside the White House so he could hold an inflammatory photo-op.\n In a chilling new warning, the FBI revealed the possible next stage in this now nationwide wave of radicalization, saying armed protests were planned at state Capitols in all 50 states between January 16 and Inauguration Day, January 20. Even as a nationwide sweep widens for the perpetrators of last week's outrage, the bureau said new protests were planned for Washington for three days around the inauguration.\n There are threats of an uprising if Trump is removed by way of the 25th Amendment. The FBI said it was also tracking threats against Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In Washington, two Capitol Police officers were suspended and more are under investigation for allegedly helping the mob.\n Rep. Conor Lamb told CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday that lawmakers had been warned about a plan by extremists to encircle Congress as well as more threats against legislators.\n \"They were talking about 4,000 armed 'patriots' to surround the Capitol and prevent any Democrat from going in,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat said.\n Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was shocked by the magnitude of the bureau's intelligence on possible new violence.\n \"I don't think in the entire scope of my career working counter terrorism issues for many, many years, I don't think I ever saw a bulletin go out that concerned armed protest activity in 50 states in a three- or four-day period,\" McCabe said on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\"\n Biden told reporters that despite the warnings, he was not afraid of taking the oath of office outside next week -- but the combination of a massive security effort to protect him from Trump's supporters and social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic mean his will be the most hollowed out inauguration in years.\n Trump's acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf resigned on Monday, in a yet another sign that the country lacks effective government at a moment of stark danger. By contrast, senior officials from the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration worked closely together in the Situation Room on January 20, 2009, when there was concern about the authenticity of terror threat to the inauguration.\n So far, after a massive domestic terror attack on the citadel of US democracy, there has been no major public briefing by any major federal law enforcement agency or the White House, an omission that fosters a sense of an absent government.\n The current atmosphere of fear and wild political insurrection are a lesson in what happens when a figure as powerful as a President deliberately tears at America's deep racial and social fault lines as a tool of his own power. Trump's presidency revealed a new insight about the all-powerful modern presidency -- the character of the person in the Oval Office chair really matters.\n Momentum towards impeachment is now all but unstoppable in the House after Pelosi rejected a suggestion from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of some kind of censure motion.\n McCarthy did acknowledge to Republican caucus members Monday that the President bore some responsibility for last week's insurrection, according to a person familiar with the call. But some of his other responses to the outrage -- an overhaul to the electoral certification process and legislation to promote voter confidence -- hinted at the insincerity of the Republican approach.\n With a few exceptions, Republicans -- who indulged and in many cases supported Trump's blatantly false claims of electoral fraud for weeks -- have responded to the uproar over last week's Capitol attack by complaining that by pushing impeachment, Democrats are fracturing national unity. It's as if the last four years never happened.\n There are also questions over whether Republicans understand the seriousness of last week's events. Remarks by Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt are still reverberating through the Capitol.\n \"My personal view is that the President touched the hot stove on Wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again,\" Blunt said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n His comment eerily recalled the rationalizations of Republicans who declined to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial after he tried to get Ukraine to interfere in the election to damage Biden.\n America has emerged from many dark periods since the Civil War. The country was torn by resistance to the Civil Rights movement. And the Vietnam War turned generations against one another. But the fact that millions of people now appear to deeply mistrust the electoral system that is the basis of US democracy means that the country's internal political cohesion is now being tested as it has rarely been in the last century-and-a-half.\n And the Republican indulgence of the President's repeated political arson has revealed a massive constitutional blind spot. When one party's lawmakers are in thrall to a strongman leader, their duty to ensure checks and balances to constrain presidential power is soon forgotten.\n Trump has not appeared in public for days. And the suspension of his social media accounts amid concern that he could stir up more violence mean the country has been unable to assess his mood.\n But the President is due to make a trip to visit the border wall that he said Mexico would pay for but instead saddled the taxpayers with the bill. White House sources said that the President is determined to spend his last full week in office touting his achievements and is expected to release another round of controversial pardons. CNN reported Monday that former Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone have advised the President not to attempt what would be yet another epic abuse of power -- an attempt to pardon himself.\n The virus is meanwhile running rampant. Eleven states and Washington, DC, just recorded their highest 7-day average of new cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. For the first time, the country is averaging over 3,000 deaths from the pandemic per day. Trump's outgoing head of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Robert Redfield warned in a recent interview with McClatchy newspapers that the pandemic would get worse for the rest of January and parts of February and that the country could see 5,000 deaths a day.\n And hopes that the nation could soon turn a corner are being tempered by the glitches in the vaccine roll out. Just as with the early stages of the crisis, poor coordination between federal and local and state authorities and the overall lack of a broader distribution plan are hampering the effort.\n Like everything else, it will be up to Biden to fix it.",

The emergency proclaimed by the king is not a military coup and curfew will not be enforced,\" Muhyiddin said, in an attempt to dispel alarm over the measures.\n The move should reduce, at least for now, some of the political uncertainty hovering over Muhyiddin since his unelected alliance came to power with a razor thin majority in March, following the collapse of the previous coalition led by veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad\n Some lawmakers in the ruling coalition have pulled support for the premier and have called for early elections, while opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said last year that he had a majority to form a new government.\n Muhyiddin assured people that elections would take place once a new independent committee declares that the pandemic is over and it is safe to hold polls.\n Under emergency rule, his government can introduce laws without parliamentary approval.\n On Monday, Muhyiddin announced a nationwide travel ban and a 14-day lockdown in the capital Kuala Lumpur and five states, saying the healthcare system for the country of 32 million people was at a breaking point.\n The number of new daily infections hit a record high last week, breaching the 3,000 mark for the first time. Total coronavirus cases passed 138,000 on Monday, with 555 deaths.\n Malaysia's benchmark share index fell as much as 1.6% after the emergency announcement.\n Malaysia's palace said Muhyiddin requested King Al-Sultan Abdullah to declare a state of emergency as a proactive measure to curb Covid-19.\n The declaration will last until August 1 or earlier, depending on whether coronavirus infections have been brought under control, it said.\n \"Al-Sultan Abdullah is of the opinion that the spread of Covid-19 is at a critical stage and that there is a need to declare a proclamation of emergency,\" the palace said in a statement.\n The king had rejected a similar request from Muhyiddin in October. Opposition leaders had then criticized the request as a move to cling to power.\n Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy in which the king has a largely ceremonial role, carrying his duties with advice from the prime minister and cabinet. But, the monarch also has the power to decide if an emergency should be declared, based on threats to security, economy or public order.\n Nik Ahmad Kamal Nik Mahmood, legal expert at the International Islamic University of Malaysia, said the government will gain wide powers during the emergency.\n \"The constitution is more or less suspended, as a substantial part of it can be overridden by emergency law,\" he said.",

A day after the siege on the US Capitol, a comment was posted using the officer's name that criticized attempts to remove Trump from office and accused lawmakers who accepted the electoral college vote of \"committing treason on live tv.\"\n \"Good morning patriots!

As this is a personnel matter, the agency will not be further commenting,\" the spokesperson said.\n Two US Capitol Police officers have been suspended and at least 10 more are under investigation for their behavior during last week's assault on the Capitol. A spokesperson for Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat, told CNN that at least 10 Capitol Police officers are being investigated for their roles in the riot.

The official expects reserved doses to be distributed over the next two weeks.\n The move comes after Trump administration officials recently disparaged Biden's plan to do the same.\n \"If President-elect Biden is calling for the distribution of vaccines knowing that there would not be a second dose available, that decision is without science or data and is contrary to the FDA's approved label,\" Operation Warp Speed spokesman Michael Pratt said Friday in light of Biden's announcement. \"If President-elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening.\"\n The new plan would also change guidelines to allow vaccinations immediately for anyone anyone 65 and older and would help states set up mass vaccination sites should they request assistance. The administration wants to shift focus away from hospitals and focus more on adding more accessible venues, such as pharmacies, the source said.\n This will attempt to address a reoccurring issue states have faced in trying to administer the vaccine through hospitals and medical providers that have said they don't have the resources or personnel to serve as vaccination clinics.\n The Trump administration which had previously balked at releasing all available doses.\n Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines require two rounds of injection, and while releasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up availability, it also runs the risk of depleting resources that are necessary to make sure people are fully vaccinated.\n The changes come after two Operation Warp Speed meetings held by HHS Secretary Alex Azar over the past 48 hours about how to speed up the lagging process, according to the official. Vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped.\n Appearing on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday morning, Azar downplayed the significance of the shift, calling it \"just a staging, moving to the next phase on the vaccine program.\"\n Last week, two top officials from the FDA said anyone who receives the reserved vaccines needs both doses, dismissing the idea of stretching the supply by allowing just one dose or cutting doses in half.\n They also dismissed other ideas for stretching the vaccine supply and said people who are speculating about the possibility of making do with just one dose or cutting doses in half are misinterpreting the data.\n \"We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's vaccine division, said in a statement at the time.\n Nearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have now been distributed, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. But that's far behind initial administration estimates, which at one point predicted 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of 2020.\n Meanwhile, the coronavirus is surging across the United States. More than 200,000 new Covid-19 cases have been reported every single day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the US has averaged more than 3,200 reported deaths each day over that period.\n CNN's Sara Murray contributed to this report.",

For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this President,\" he said in a statement he tweeted.\n Moments after Katko said he supported impeachment, Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking GOP leader, said in a statement she would also support impeaching the President, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, another Republican, also tweeted he supported it.\n House Democrats are now moving rapidly toward impeaching Trump for a second time as a result of the Capitol insurrection, which Trump incited after repeatedly making false claims that the election had been stolen from him.\n While the vast majority of House Republicans are expected to oppose the article of impeachment on Wednesday, there are expectations there could be as many as 10 -- maybe more, maybe less -- breaking ranks, according to House GOP aides.\n The House plans to vote Wednesday on one article of impeachment against Trump. The House will first vote on a measure Tuesday evening urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power, which could signal how many Republicans will back impeachment.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Clare Foran contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden pushes to prevent impeachment from upending his agenda",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden is pushing to keep impeachment from consuming his agenda and overshadowing the early days of his administration, as he tries to avoid the appearance of either promoting the proceedings or trying to stop them.\n With that in mind, CNN has learned, Biden called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week to discuss the possibility of \"bifurcation,\" which would be conducting impeachment proceedings at the same time senators work to confirm his Cabinet nominees and consider a sweeping Covid relief package.\n It's the latest sign that with each passing day since the siege of the Capitol, people close to Biden say, he has become resigned to the fact that impeachment is simply one more crisis that he will inherit from the Trump presidency.\n That realization, according to people close to the incoming President, has not stopped Biden and his aides from trying to keep the focus on his top priorities.\n Biden is both making and fielding calls from members of Congress, advisers said, with House Democrats and their advisers primarily interested in discussing impeaching Trump for a second time.\n That focus represents a divide between the incoming Biden administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill, many of whom lived through the siege of the Capitol and believe it is a moral imperative that Trump be punished for inciting the insurrection. Biden, the advisers said, understands the trauma experienced on Capitol Hill and the desire for action, but believes the issue is not as important to a majority of Americans as is his coronavirus response, a plan he is slated to roll out on Thursday.\n The call from Biden to McConnell on Monday, which was first reported by The New York Times, underscores the lengths to which Biden is immersing himself in his longtime haunt: Capitol Hill. The two men spoke frankly about a potential impeachment trial for Trump, people familiar with the call said, as both of them noted it would be far different from the trial they sat through in 1999 for President Bill Clinton.\n McConnell told Biden that the Senate parliamentarian would have to rule whether the Senate could work on legislative business other than impeachment, people familiar with the call said, adding that McConnell did not offer his own view.\n After next Wednesday, of course, McConnell becomes the Senate minority leader. But for the next eight days, McConnell is running the Senate schedule, which is why Biden reached out to him.\n It is one of several scenarios Biden and his advisers are working through as they balance the competing priorities of responding to a bipartisan call to sanction Trump and trying to advance his agenda.\n \"He's not going to use his political capital to stand in the way, but he's not going to use the bully pulpit to advocate for it publicly,\" a Biden adviser said of impeachment. \"He's focused on what his pro-active agenda is.\"\n Biden and his team were initially cold on starting his administration -- which Biden pledged would \"turn the page\" on Trump -- with a focus on the Republican President. But as more alarming details are learned about the attack, early discussions among Biden advisers of taking an active role in slowing or trying to somehow manage impeachment have been abandoned, aides say, as they've become well aware that trying to do so could divide Democrats even deeper.\n \"That would destroy any hope of party unity,\" a Biden ally tells CNN. \"It could derail Biden's presidency.\"\n Biden's focus on coronavirus, however, reflects a political reality for the President-elect, one that the official said was fully understood by his senior staff: His first year in office will be defined by his ability to combat the virus. The incoming Biden administration has pledged to administer 100 million coronavirus vaccines within his first 100 days and is fully aware that will be a \"big point of judgment on whether we are successful or not.\"\n \"So, when he has these calls with members,\" another adviser said, \"that is what he wants to talk about -- the Covid plan.\"\n The turn to impeachment has all but dominated Democratic focus in the wake of the January 6 insurrection by pro-Trump rioters, with many top lawmakers publicly suggesting ways they could balance a focus on pressing issues like the coronavirus and reprimanding Trump.\n Some Democrats, like South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, have suggested or expressed an openness to the House slow-rolling the process.\n \"Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running, and maybe we'll send the articles sometime after that,\" Clyburn said.\n Others, including Biden, have suggested having the Senate divide its time, spending half of its day conducting an impeachment trial and the other confirming his nominees -- a complicated dance that exemplifies the differences between Biden and Capitol Hill Democrats.\n But the urgency among Democrats and a handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill could make the gambit difficult to pull off.\n Democratic members who directly experienced the savage storming of the United States Capitol on January 6 largely view impeachment as their main avenue of recourse against not only Trump, but the increasingly violent movement around him.\n New Jersey Rep. Andy Kim described returning home on Friday, less than two days after what he described as a \"siege\" of the Capitol, and being asked by his young son if he was OK, whether his office had been \"destroyed\" and if \"the bad people\" who did it had been caught or punished.\n \"It took the questions and the logic of a 5-year-old to just show me that these actions need to have consequences,\" said Kim, a close ally to the Biden team. \"Consequences I can show my kid and future generations, as well, that this is not what this country is about.\"\n Kim added that he wants the Biden to hit the ground running and doesn't believe impeachment and moving on the President-elect's agenda are \"incompatible.\"\n \"I certainly want President-elect Biden to get off to a strong start and I don't see how this would necessarily hamper that,\" Kim said, \"but we are also a separate and co-equal branch of government that just experienced an attack from one branch of government against us, the executive branch against the legislature. That is severe. I don't want us to minimize what happened.\"\n Even still, there is growing worries inside Biden's orbit that any focus on impeachment could distract from the \"mission critical\" action needed on coronavirus.\n A senior aide to a House Democrat who supports moving forward with impeachment said of the Biden team that it has \"been clear that (the Covid response) is their focus,\" but added that the President-elect has not sought to knock the process off course.\n \"If they wanted to put an end to this, they could,' the House aide said. \"Biden is smart enough to know, whatever his instincts are, that Nancy Pelosi knows how to run her caucus better than anyone,\" the House aide said. \"He could have very easily said, 'I don't think it's a good idea.'\"\n The Biden team is also intensifying its focus on things its can control.\n On the first day of his presidency, Biden still intends to sign a series of executive actions designed to overturn some of the Trump administration's work on climate change and immigration and other actions.\n But the energy behind delivering a clear rebuke to Trump -- and sending a message to those who might follow him -- remains front of mind for many in the President-elect's party.\n \"If we do not do this, if we do not (take) any concrete steps to signify that this was wrong and to hold the President accountable, that will do something,\" said Kim, a veteran national security professional. \"That will erode our democracy, that will make it easier for someone in the future to do something like this.\"\n The Biden transition team also accelerated its behind-the-scenes pressure on Tuesday to assure that nominees for top national security positions in his new administration receive a confirmation hearing before the inauguration.\n While some nominees have their hearings already set for next week, a hearing has yet to be scheduled for Homeland Security Secretary nominee Alejandro Mayorkas. Republicans control the Senate until next Wednesday, so it is up to GOP chairmen to schedule confirmation hearings before inauguration.\n Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who will become majority leader after Biden takes office, reminded senators in a letter Tuesday of the fresh urgency surrounding confirmations.\n \"The violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th showed us we need qualified Senate-confirmed people (not in an acting capacity) in key national security positions on Day One, including Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and others,\" Schumer wrote. \"The economic challenges our nation faces also require having key economic nominees confirmed and on the job ASAP.\"\n Biden has raised the notion of bifurcation, which could allow the Senate to conduct an impeachment trial for half of a day, with the remaining hours devoted to his Covid relief package and voting on confirmations. But it remains unclear whether the Senate parliamentarian would approve such a plan, considering the rules of impeachment.\n Aides say a range of options are still being discussed about how to proceed, but those options do not include trying to stop impeachment. The precise Senate timeline will likely not become clear until after the House vote.",

        "title": "Pastor who left ministry to help her children with virtual school wants to return, but isn't sure how",
        "body_text": "Pastor Meredith Dodd tried really hard to keep working during the pandemic. Her three children -- each with varying degrees of special needs -- were doing virtual learning at home and needed her assistance.\n And Dodd's parishioners in the congregation of Bryn Mawr United Methodist Church in Seattle were on her mind, too.\n \"I have people in the parish who desperately needed help paying rent or utilities and were really concerned about eviction. There's tremendous need in the neighborhood, at the same time there was tremendous need at home,\" she told CNN.\n First, she tried to do it all -- be available for her children during their school day and handle her parish work before 8 in the morning or after 10 at night.\n Her body soon told her that would not work. \"I used to get migraines maybe every couple of months. And by this point of the pandemic, I was getting migraines every week,\" she said of how she felt in the fall. \"It was starting to have a huge demand on my body and my mental health.\"\n Dodd shared her concerns with her boss at the beginning of the school year. \"I said, 'I really need your prayers because I can tell that I'm on the edge of burning out,' which set off alarm bells for him.\"\n She tried working out different options with the church where she had worked for more than two years, but it became clear that, reluctantly, she would have to step down from her post.\n \"The church could find another pastor in this moment, but my kids could not find another mother,\" she said of the choice she and her husband, Mike, made.\n They crunched the numbers and did a lot of soul-searching to make sure Dodd's stepping down from the pulpit would work. In the end, it was the only answer.\n Dodd is far from alone. Millions of women left or lofst their jobs in 2020. Of those without a job, women ages 25-44 were nearly three times as likely as men to not be working because of child care demands in the pandemic, the Census Bureau reported.\n And women were shown to be hit hardest in December's jobs report that revealed backtracking in the pandemic recovery. Women lost 156,000 jobs overall that month while men gained 16,000, meaning women accounted for the entire net national loss of 140,000 jobs.\n Betsey Stevenson, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, calls the impact of the pandemic a triple punch for women.\n \"They're just disproportionately likely to hold the kinds of jobs we needed to send people home from,\" said Stevenson, who is a labor economist. \"Women do a lot of caring jobs, in-person jobs. Those are the kinds of jobs that tend to be robust to a downturn, but not this downturn because this downturn was all about stopping in-person contact and that really hit women's jobs pretty hard.\"\n On top of that, a lot of jobs in state and local government -- more likely to be held by women than men -- were lost. And then children were sent home from school, again more likely to impact women.\n Stevenson said there will be adjustments getting back to \"normal\" even when the vaccine is widely available and schools are open again.\n \"The kids are going back to school, but kids ... had a hard time in this particular situation. I don't think that their needs are going to go away, just because they're going back to school.\"\n Months without playdates and socializing have certainly taken a toll on families, along with all the other strains of living in a pandemic.\n And even though Dodd has been able to leave her job for her children, she also sees the limits. \"It's heartbreaking as a parent to say, 'There is nothing I can do to make this better. This is how it is right now. And I am standing with you and I am walking alongside you, and we will do hard things together.'\"\n For Dodd, there needs to be vaccine availability and there needs to be in-person school. She says her heartache now is not knowing when that might be.\n But she has many reasons for wanting to return to ministry.\n \"For me, pastoring is a vocation and it's not one that's gone away because of circumstance. The call has not gone away, the job has for the moment,\" she said.\n She says she still loves preaching, teaching and being with people. And she anticipates returning to a place that she says needs more female workers.\n \"I'm in a male-dominated industry, one that's been male-dominated, frankly, for 2,000 years.\"",

        "body_text": "A nearly human-sized robot grabs a dish out of a crowded sink with its gripper arms and neatly adds it to the dishwasher. It then sets the table, placing a flower into a vase, and pours a glass of red wine.\n The robot, Samsung's Bot Handy, is the company's vision for \"a better new normal,\" as more people work, cook, eat and drown in dishes at home than ever during the global pandemic. As seen in a video shown at the all virtual 2021 CES consumer tech show on Monday, Bot Handy is, well, handy around the house; not only to pick up some unfinished chores but to remind you of upcoming meetings and to stretch your legs if you've been sitting for too long.\n It's only in development for now -- no pricing or release date has been announced -- but Samsung said it's part of a greater effort to make technology to simplify your life at home. \"The technologies in your home need to work harder to help you adjust to this new normal,\" the company said in its session description on the CES website.\n Companies big and small showed off their new innovations at the closely watched tech trade show, which kicked off on Monday, many with features tied to life during the pandemic. There's MaskFone, a face covering marketed as having a built-in N95 filter, earbuds and microphone to make calls, and a wearable for the ears called Cove that claims its gentle vibrations regulate anxiety and stress.\n For the kitchen, manufacturer Kohler showed off voice control features for its sinks and other fixtures, so homeowners can turn on faucets without ever touching them. UK startup Handsteco touted sinks with built-in artificial intelligence to guide people through hygiene techniques in hospitals, offices and public spaces.\n The pandemic tech theme took a step outside the home, too. Riding on the growth of online deliveries, lock manufacturer Yale announced it's now shipping its smart delivery box to keep packages safe from porch pirates when they arrive. A delivery person places a package in the storage box, which automatically locks, and homeowners receive a notification.\n While some of these products, like Bot Handy, may seem a bit gimmicky, ABI Research analyst Jonathan Collins said there's definitely money to be made from items that help automate household tasks. The market research firm found the smart home market in 2020 grew 6.7% over 2019 to $88 billion. However, that's $11 billion below pre-pandemic expectations.\n Even products that weren't specifically pandemic-related may still tap into the way we live now. Flashy new TVs, a mainstay of CES events, seemed all the more fitting this year as we're stuck at home, glued to the TV and ever-more conscious of our surroundings. LG, for example, drummed up excitement over its new 55-inch transparent TV, the latest company to show screens you can see through when off.\n Meanwhile, a Panasonic hair dryer that you don't need to move -- a built-in oscillator does all the work for you -- also generated some buzz, at a time when many people have not gotten a proper haircut or blowout in too long.\n People watch CES events to get a sense of where technology is going in the years ahead, but this year's event is arguably about the industry catching up to the ways the pandemic reshaped our lives in the past year.\n With vaccines on the horizon, it's unclear how much longer we'll be largely stuck at home, but these tech companies seem to be betting that even if the pandemic ends, our habits won't entirely change.",

        "title": "How Liz Cheney became the conscience of Republicans",
        "body_text": "On a conference call with her fellow House Republicans on Monday night in advance of Wednesday's expected vote on impeaching President Donald Trump, Wyoming's Liz Cheney, the third-ranking GOP leader, called it \"a vote of conscience.\"\n Which is a very interesting choice of words.\n It signals to rank-and-file Republicans that leadership won't -- at least not yet -- whip the vote (i.e., pressure them to vote) to support the President. That would make this a \"free\" vote, meaning that leadership isn't going to hold it against you if you support impeaching Trump over his role in inciting the mob seizure of the US Capitol six days ago.\n Later Tuesday, Cheney announced that she plans to vote for Trump's impeachment in the wake of the violent attack on the US Capitol last week.\n \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" she said in a statement. \"Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\"\n Cheney's use of the word \"conscience\" earlier in the day was also telling in that, increasingly over these final months of Trump's presidency, she has been a lone voice among prominent House Republicans willing to speak up when she disagrees with the President.\n Consider:\n * As Trump and his allies pushed to reopen the country (and the economy) in early spring 2020, Cheney tweeted this: \"There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what's necessary to stop the virus.\"\n * Cheney broke with Trump over his assertion -- made last April -- that he had \"total\" authority to force states to reopen even if their governors objected. \"The federal government does not have absolute power,\" tweeted Cheney. \" 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' United States Constitution, Amendment X\"\n * When, in May, Trump spent several days pushing a debunked conspiracy theory about the death of a young intern in former Florida Rep. Joe Scarborough's office, Cheney told reporters that the \"President should stop tweeting about Joe Scarborough. I think we're in the middle of a pandemic. He's the commander in chief of this nation, and it's causing great pain to the family of the young woman who died. So I would urge him to stop it.\"\n * In June, as Trump continued to reject the science on mask-wearing as a way to slow the spread of Covid-19, Cheney tweeted a picture of her father (aka the former vice president of the United States) wearing a mask, with this caption: \"Dick Cheney says WEAR A MASK. #realmenwearmasks\"\n * As Trump was ramping up his rhetoric around the election being stolen, Cheney called on him to either produce evidence of the alleged fraud or bow to \"the sanctity of our electoral process\" and concede.\n * In the immediate aftermath of last week's Capitol riot, Cheney blasted Trump. \"What he has done and what he has caused here is something that we've never seen before in our history,\" she said in a statement. \"It's been 245 years, and no president has ever failed to concede or agree to leave office after the Electoral College has voted, and I think what we are seeing today is the result of that, the result of convincing people that somehow Congress was going to overturn the results of this election, the results of suggesting that he wouldn't leave office.\"\n Cheney's emergence as the one GOP leader willing to stand up and say, essentially, \"What the hell are we doing here,\" is intriguing for a number of reasons -- not the least of which is that her father, prior to the Trump presidency, was the Republican who Democrats most loved to hate. And yet now his daughter has emerged as a voice of reason and sanity within a party that has gone full Trump.\n There's a through line there, of course. Dick Cheney, while loathed by Democrats, was a very traditional establishment politician. He had spent decades in Washington -- in and out of elected office -- prior to signing on as George W. Bush's vice president. He was not radical in any meaningful way. And his brand of hawkish Republicanism bears zero resemblance to how Trump sees the world.\n But beyond even that, Liz Cheney was not, at all, the most obvious choice to carry the common-sense banner for Republicans against Trump.\n She got off to a very shaky start in Washington. Her short-lived 2014 primary challenge to Sen. Mike Enzi (R) ruffled lots of feathers in the nation's capital --- especially among the same establishment types who were her father's bread and butter. But Cheney bounced back in winning an open House seat in 2016. And she rapidly moved up the House leadership ladder -- seemingly committing to that path when she decided against running for the open seat created by Enzi's retirement in 2020.\n What distinguishes Cheney is that unlike the two lawmakers higher than she is on the leadership chart -- House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (Louisiana) -- she has not fallen in line with Trump. (Both McCarthy and Scalise, even after the Capitol riot last week, voted to object to the Electoral College results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.)\n Cheney, instead, has gone in the other direction, which, in truth, looked like a giant leap of faith in her GOP colleagues (and the broader Republican Party). While it still looks like a risky strategy, politically speaking, Cheney's questioning of Trump -- and calling on her colleagues to do the same -- sure does look like the right thing to do in the light of last week's riot.\n CNN's Allison Gordon contributed to this report.",

Sidner asked Sesma, \"How many people ended up getting it?\" Sesma responded, \"All of us.\"\n \"Don't let this be you,\" Sesma said. \"If you truly love your loved ones, don't let this be you. Continue to take all the precautions. Take extra precautions. Exaggerate if you have to.\"\n After wrapping the report, Sidner choked up. \"To see the way that these families have to live after this and the heartache that goes so far and so wide, it's really hard to take.\"\n She apologized as she wept through her statement, but Camerota quickly comforted her and thanked her for her reporting. \"No apology needed,\" Camerota said. \"We've been watching your reporting on the ground. Throughout this horrific year, and we have all been struck by the grief.\" She added, \"Sara, we we all appreciate the heart that you bring to this every single day as well as your excellent reporting.\"\n In response, Sidner said, \"It's just not OK.

Sign up here.)\n The FBI has warned that \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next Wednesday. And two US Capitol police officers have been suspended and at least 10 others are being investigated for behavior during last week's riot. Meantime, House Democrats plan first to vote this evening on a resolution urging VP Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment\u00a0to remove President Trump from power, then vote tomorrow on an article of impeachment charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection.\" But let's get something straight: Impeachment itself would not ban Trump from holding future office, as some viral claims suggest. For that, the Senate would have to hold an additional vote on the matter. Another avenue that's getting attention is the 14th Amendment, which bars from federal or state office any officeholder who takes part in insurrection or rebellion\u00a0against the US.\n The Capitol riot is shaking up the world of political fundraising, as major companies like Google, Coca-Cola and UPS all have pledged to suspend contributions across the board. Other companies are focusing on lawmakers they view as complicit in Trump's effort to disrupt the affirmation of Biden's election win. PR and lobbying experts wonder whether the upheaval is temporary or represents a permanent political shift. More companies are also creating policies in response to last week's violence. GoFundMe says it will no longer allow people to fundraise for travel expenses used for potentially violent political events, and Airbnb says it will attempt to restrict violent Capitol rioters from making reservations in the DC area during the inauguration. Parler, the social media app that serves as a safe space for the far-right, sued Amazon for deplatforming it on grounds the app encourages and incites violence.\n We're not going to be done with social distancing any time soon. The World Health Organization has warned that herd immunity won't happen in 2021, and social distancing measures will need to stay in place \"for the rest of this year,\" despite vaccine progress. In the US, more than 200,000 new coronavirus cases have been reported every day for a week. In the UK, health officials say the country is entering the \"worst point\" of the pandemic, as cases rise and deaths increase. Malaysia has announced more restrictions, and South Africa has closed its land borders to curb the spread. At the San Diego Zoo, there's a new complication: At least two gorillas have tested positive for Covid-19, the first known cases among great apes.\n A federal judge halted the execution of Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row, just hours before she was scheduled to die. Montgomery, who was sentenced to death in 2008 after murdering a woman and kidnapping her fetus, will now be subject to a competency hearing. Montgomery was one of three people scheduled to die by federal execution during the remainder of President Trump's time in office. The Trump administration revived the federal death penalty last year. Before then, there hadn't been any federal executions since 2003. Since July, the federal government has executed 10 people, more than in any presidency since 1896.\n The Trump administration has designated Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism, complicating any efforts by the future Biden administration to repair relations with the former Cold War foe. President Obama removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2015, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the new designation was given for \"repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists.\" A top Cuban called the move hypocritical and an act of \"political opportunism.\" Cuba now joins three other countries on the list: Iran, North Korea and Syria.\n It's nice to see the underdogs come out on top sometimes.\n Well, of course. You need your summer Crocs and your winter Crocs, your goin'-out Crocs and your yard work Crocs ... It's a spectrum.\n If anyone can pull off an energy drink brand, it's The Rock.\n No, thank you, we will not be processing this information today.\n You just have to convince yourself the vaccine is worth: forgetting to eat because you're nervous, passing out in the nurse's chair and having to munch on crackers and juice for 15 minutes until they let you leave.\n That's the proportion of Americans who would be able to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to a new report from Bankrate.com. That's down from 41% in 2020.\n \"That's why I can no longer call myself a fellow Republican. I'm not a fellow of anything right now. I'm just a citizen who has voted Republican, voted Democrat throughout my entire career. And right now I'm just watching my country and not concerned with parties.\"\n Thrill in the cinematic suspense of watching baby ducks scale a small flight of stairs. (Click here to view.)",

        "title": "2 years after she fled her captor, Jayme Closs is dancing again, her aunt says ",
        "body_text": "Today, Jayme Closs is surrounded by loved ones, doing well and taking life day by day, her aunt said -- a far cry from fighting for her life just two years ago.\n Then 13 years old, Jayme escaped the home of the man who had killed her parents and abducted her for 87 days. Wearing only her pajamas and her captor's sneakers on the wrong feet, she trudged through the Wisconsin winter until she found help in the arms of his neighbors.\n At the sentencing of her captor, Jayme said, \"I used to love to go out with my friends. I love to go to school. I love to dance. He took all of those things away from me, too. It's too hard for me to go out in public.\"\n Now she is dancing again and enjoying school activities as much as she can given the Covid-19 pandemic, her aunt and guardian Jennifer Naiberg Smith said in a statement Monday.\n Reflecting on Jayme's escape to freedom on January 10, 2018, Smith said she is thankful for those neighbors, the law enforcement who fought for justice, the world that kept its attention on finding her -- and, most importantly, for Jayme's bravery.\n \"We always want to say and remind others never take life for granted,\" Smith said. \"You never know what tomorrow will bring. Always remember to take the time to tell your loved ones you love them.\"\n Jayme was asleep in her bedroom on October 15, 2018 when she woke up to her dog Molly barking. She rushed to get her parents when she saw an unfamiliar Taurus in her family's driveway with the headlights off.\n At the time, none of them knew that the driver had been there before. Jake Patterson, a 21-year-old man who would eventually face two life sentences, had seen Closs by chance as he drove by her school bus and had already been to their home twice to plan her abduction.\n While her father James went to the door with a flashlight, Jayme and her mother Denise hid in the tub of a bathroom barricaded with a cabinet drawer. Jayme cowered as she heard the shot that killed her father. Her mother called 911.\n All the dispatcher could hear when the call came in around 12:53 a.m. was \"a lot of yelling.\"\n Patterson, who had shaved his head and face so as to avoid leaving DNA, burst into the bathroom to find Jayme and her mother. After shooting her mother dead, he dragged the duct-tape bound teen to the trunk of his car.\n Patterson sped off, yielding for squad cars that were on their way to the Closs home, a deputy said.\n Volunteers and police searched northern Wisconsin for three months. Jayme's photo was splashed across posters and in total $50,000 was offered for information on her.\n All the while, she was 70 miles away in Patterson's Gordon home. Her captor forced her to stay under his twin-sized bed, where she sometimes remained for as long as 12 hours, with no food, water or access to the bathroom.\n He would turn up the bedroom radio to muffle her movements when his father came to visit, and he would strike fear into Jayme by yelling and hitting the walls, warning that \"bad things would happen to her if she tried\" to come out.\n Two weeks after the kidnapping, Patterson told detectives he believed he had gotten away with his crimes.\n But then on January 10, he told Jayme he was going to be out for a few hours. Once he was gone, she shoved away the bins and weights that barricaded her under the bed, crawled out, got out the front door and stepped into the snow.\n A woman walking her dog saw the girl, who said she needed help.\n \"I'm lost and I don't' know where I am and I need help,\" the teen said. \"I'm Jayme.\"\n The woman hustled her to the nearest home where they called 911.\n Patterson returned to the area and was arrested shortly afterward. Prosecutors said he confessed in detail during an interview after his arrest.\n He received one life sentence each for the murders of James and Denise Closs and was given a 40-year sentence for the kidnapping, including 25 years in prison and 15 years on parole.\n Jayme had a chance to read a statement before his sentencing, in which she said he should be locked up forever.\n \"Jake Patterson took a lot of things that I love away from me. It makes me the most sad that he took away my mom and my dad,\" she said.\n CNN's Ray Sanchez, Keith Allen, Faith Karimi, Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Panasonic's augmented reality display aims to change the way drivers see roads",
        "body_text": "The head-up display, which projects information onto the windshield for drivers, has been available in some cars since 1988. But while over the past decade they've gone from relatively simple information displays like speed and music selections, Panasonic wants to take things to another level by precisely linking up symbols and text with real-world objects and roadways in front of the car.\n Panasonic showed off its Augmented Reality HUD at 2021's all-online Consumer Electronics Show. In a demonstration video, Panasonic's system laid blue navigation lines, indicating the direction the driver should go, over the actual road. A yellow symbol pointed out a bicyclist to the side of the road and flashing signals warned of cars that were getting too close.\n In the decades since they made the jump from fighter jets to cars, head-up displays, or HUDs, have become a commonly available option on all kinds of vehicles. These displays project information, such as speed and navigation instructions, onto a car's windshield or a clear plastic screen in front of it so the driver doesn't have to glance down at the gauges or at a screen in the car.\n The numbers and symbols usually appear as if they're floating somewhere just above the car's hood. Some companies have figured out how to make them lay over real objects -- including other cars, pedestrians and bicyclists -- in the real world, creating a sort of augmented reality experience for the driver. It's the next big step for head up displays, and systems like this have recently begun hitting the market. Mercedes will have a similar system on its new S-class sedan, and Volkswagen will include a similar system on the new ID.4 electric SUV in some markets.\n This kind of real-world alignment is difficult to do because it requires knowing exactly where all the features of the road outside are, moment by moment, but also precisely where the driver's eyes are at all times. It's necessary to know both, because otherwise the graphics can't be lined up properly.\n To do this, Panasonic's AR HUD uses eye-tracking technology to closely follow the driver's eyes. A vibration control system helps compensate for bumps and other vibrations, and keeps the images in the windshield steady from the driver's point of view. Imaging radar scans the road ahead across at least three lanes of traffic, according to Panasonic.\n If the driver is using the navigation system, the head-up display will show a line on the road to indicate the correct route. The system can also highlight faded lane lines that might be hard to see. If the vehicle gets too close to a car ahead, a warning symbol can flash at the back of the other car to warn the driver to allow more space.\n The 2021 Cadillac Escalade has a somewhat similar feature, but it's not projected in the windshield. In the Escalade, a video camera captures an image of the road ahead which gets displayed on a screen in front of the driver. Navigation cues and other information are then incorporated into that image. That's simpler to do, technically, because it doesn't require the complex alignment a heads-up system does.\n Panasonic is making its system available to various automakers so they can offer it as an option on their vehicles.",

        "body_text": "A Florida sheriff's deputy who was just one shift away from retirement was killed Monday by a suspect in a fatal car crash, Hillsboro County Sheriff Chad Chronister said during a press conference.\n Hillsboro County Sheriff's Office (HSCO) Master Corporal Brian LaVigne, 54, was in a marked vehicle when a suspect who had been tased unsuccessfully by deputies intentionally rammed the car, according to a press release from HCSO.\n We will \"honor him as the hero and for the service he left behind -- as a teacher, as a mentor and again, someone who unselfishly served this community,\" Chronister said.\n According to the HSCO, Deputies had responded to two calls about a suspect who was acting erratically at the Paddock Club Apartments in Brandon, Florida, on Monday afternoon.\n Brandon is just east of Tampa.\n They first responded to a call that the suspect, identified as Zachary Gabriel Garrett, 28, was \"throwing property out of his apartment window and front door\" and had \"threatened to harm staff in the past,\" the release said. The deputies spoke with Garrett but found no cause for arrest at the time, according to the release.\n The deputies responded to the same location around 5 p.m. after the Garrett was reported to be nude and acting erratically, according to the release. Deputies attempted to talk to the suspect on their second visit but he was \"unresponsive\" and \"became combative and struck one of the responding deputies...multiple times,\" the release said.\n Both responding deputies deployed their tasers \"without success,\" according to the release, before the Garrett fled to his car.\n The deputies attempted to block Garrett, but he was able to get past them, crashing through an apartment complex gate entrance, the release said.\n Several witnesses reported the suspect \"intentionally rammed into Master LaVigne at a high rate of speed,\" as he was in his marked HCSO vehicle, the release said.\n Deputies tended to LaVigne's injuries and first responders with Hillsborough County Fire Rescue attempted to extricate him for several minutes, according to the release.\n \"Despite their courageous efforts and those on frontlines at Tampa General Hospital, Master Corporal LaVigne passed away while in the line of duty,\" the release said.\n \"Master Corporal Brian LaVigne has been a part of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office family since 1990, and he was just days away from retirement,\" Chronister said in the release. \"We will never forget Master Corporal LaVigne for laying down his life in the line of duty or the response of his squad members who did everything they could to ensure that the individual responsible for his death was apprehended.\"\n LaVigne leaves behind a wife and two adult children, one of whom is also a deputy with the same Sheriff's Office, the release said.\n Garrett was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, Chronister said. Charges against him are forthcoming and he does not have a previous arrest history in the county, according to the release.",

        "title": "White House moving day packed with taxpayer-funded Covid-19 cleanings and shifting sports equipment",
        "body_text": "A thorough cleaning is part of the every-four-years tradition that comes with the outgoing president and his family swapping White House living with the incoming president and family.\n The delicate and highly choreographed event of packing up and moving out, and unpacking and moving in, done by dozens of prepped and trained staff and movers, typically occurs in the six-hour window when both the exiting and entering presidents and their spouses attend Inauguration Day ceremonies on Capitol Hill. By the time the new president and first lady return to the White House, all of their stuff will have been moved in and ready to go -- down to a refrigerator stocked with their favorite foods and the master bathroom equipped with their preferred shampoo.\n But, like most things Trump administration, this January 20 won't be very traditional.\n Before the Bidens move in, the White House will first undergo a Covid-19 cleansing, top to bottom, from East Wing to West Wing. According to federal contract data reviewed by CNN, the total for the amplified White House inauguration deep clean right now hovers near a half-million dollars.\n This includes $127,000 for what one government order refers to as \"2021 Inaugural Cleaning,\" bid out to Didlake, a Virginia-based business that employs people with disabilities for jobs including janitorial and housekeeping services. That's separate from a $44,000 order for carpet cleaning and the $115,000 purchase agreement for \"2021 Presidential Inauguration and Transition Carpet Replacement and Installation to correct the current floor condition of selected interior floors for various offices,\" within the East Wing, West Wing and Executive Office Building, according to the description.\n In traditional administration-swaps, the bulk of the cleaning, while thorough, is done predominantly by White House staff -- housekeepers, butlers, ushers -- and upkeep such as electrical fixes and small maintenance jobs completed by White House workers, of which there are typically 90 to 100 in roles that range from pastry cooks to florists to plumbers.\n However, this time around, the incoming Biden administration wanted to ensure that 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, which has been a hot spot of at least three Covid-19 breakouts, gets the sort of scrub-down a pandemic deserves, according to a White House official who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n \"The idea that they would just move in seems unlikely,\" said the official, who was not aware of the specific contract numbers but was aware there were additional measures being taken after the Trumps leave the White House.\n President Donald Trump tweeted last week that he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration and CNN has reported the Trumps are scheduled to leave Washington the day prior, on January 19. Biden is planning to spend the night before his inauguration in a Washington hotel, people familiar with the plans say, and will move to the White House after the thorough clean.\n \"People tend to forget how big this building is,\" said the official; the White House is some 55,000 square feet.\n The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment about the additional cleaning contracts.\n Additional inaugural cleaning contracts, which were all made though the Public Building Service within the General Service Administration, include more than $29,000 to clean the curtains in the East Wing, West Wing and Eisenhower Executive Office Building and $53,000 for painting and wall coverings.\n Typically, the window of time on Inauguration Day is not enough for updating paint and wallpaper around the house, but as there is more time now, thanks to what appears to be the Trumps' early departure on January 19, the walls will get refreshed. A contract for $37,975 was awarded to an Annapolis, Maryland, company for the removal of trash and recycling, \"per the scope of work in relation to the 2021 Inauguration.\"\n Another $50,000 has been contracted for overtime pay for the movers.\n Melania Trump has been moving items for almost two months, according to multiple sources. She has already completed several shipments to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida, private club where the first couple is expected to reside. She has also put much of the family's furniture and d\u00e9cor into storage. One of the sources estimates Trump is \"about 50%\" packed from the White House, a job she began in earnest in the weeks following Election Day.\n Despite the national turmoil, two sources confirm to CNN that much of her attention has been on her photo album collection, a hobby she has maintained for more than a decade, clipping and creating large, leather-bound albums embossed with the dates and occasions of each of the contents.\n One of the sources familiar with her penchant for photo albums said the first lady has utilized the services of her official White House photographer, Andrea Hanks, to help her complete the personal projects. Hanks is a government employee and her request for overtime hours has riled colleagues in the White House photo office.\n The East Wing did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\n The first lady's chief of staff and spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, resigned last Wednesday following the insurrection at the Capitol. Melania Trump has not been seen publicly since returning from her Florida home to the White House on December 31.\n Meanwhile, the Biden transition team has already been in touch with White House chief usher Timothy Harleth, two sources told CNN. Harleth was hired by Melania Trump in June 2017; he was previously working at the Trump International Hotel Washington as manager of rooms. One White House source said Harleth is covertly helping the Biden team navigate the moving-in process, as the tradition of the current first lady welcoming the incoming first lady never happened under Trump -- Melania Trump still has yet to reach out to Jill Biden.\n As such, communication between staffs on the two opposing sides is nonexistent, where prior administrations, even those on opposite sides of the political aisle, have by now had lengthy and in-depth discussion about moving logistics.\n It is not clear, for example, whether the Biden family's moving trucks will be allowed to haul the President-elect's beloved Peloton from his Wilmington, Delaware, home into the White House residence. The standalone bikes typically have video cameras that connect to the internet, which could be one of few minor hiccups.\n Past presidents' high-tech gadgets have typically required security vetting and retrofitting -- especially when they connect to the internet or cell networks. The Washington Post reported in February 2019 that Trump had a $50,000, room-sized golf simulator installed in the White House -- replacing a less sophisticated simulator installed by President Barack Obama. At the time, the price for the fully set-up Trump simulator from TrackMan, which has golf simulators at multiple Trump properties, started at around $50,000.\n High-end simulators such as TrackMan's often connect to the internet and have sensors or cameras. Emails from the US Secret Service obtained by CNN through the Freedom of Information Act show that agency personnel, including a protective detail liaison for the Secret Service's Technical Security Division, exchanged \"notes\" and \"tech info\" on the TrackMan golf simulator in the months prior to its reported installation.\n Previous presidents didn't have such high-tech problems. President George W. Bush asked for workout equipment, including an elliptical machine and dumbbells, to be installed in a poolside cabana steps from the Oval Office, and a fold-up treadmill to be placed aboard Air Force One. Old-school enough not to raise security flags.\n No word whether Biden's Peloton will get the same scrutiny.\n CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Following the reopening an investigation into the 2009 fatal police shooting of Oscar Grant, no charges will be brought against a second former Bay Area Rapid Transit officer, the Alameda County district attorney said in a statement Monday.\n Grant was fatally shot on January 1, 2009, while lying face down on a platform at the Fruitvale Station in Oakland, California. Johannes Mehserle, the officer who shot Grant, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in July 2010.\n Following demands from Grant's family, District Attorney Nancy O'Malley reopened an investigation in October into another officer, Anthony Pirone, who was terminated following an internal investigation.\n \"In view of everything we have considered -- and reconsidered -- we conclude that we cannot prove Pirone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\" O'Malley said.\n \"We condemn Pirone's conduct but we cannot charge him with murder or any other crime.\"\n Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson-Morris, had called for Pirone to face charges for allegedly escalating the arrest that led to her son's death.\n According to a report prepared at the time, Pirone hit Grant and used profanity and the N-word during the incident, and later lied to investigators about Grant's actions, claiming Grant hit Pirone's partner and kicked Pirone in the groin.\n \"Although Pirone's conduct was aggressive, utterly unprofessional and disgraceful, it did not rise to the mental state required for murder,\" O'Malley said.\n The district attorney said that there was no evidence to show that Pirone acted with an intention to kill or cause Mehserle to kill Grant, or that he might have known it would happen. For those reasons she could not bring charges against him, she said.\n \"Everyone on the platform that night was shocked that Mehserle suddenly pulled out his gun and shot Oscar Grant in the back. That included the hundreds of people on the BART trains who were watching and recording, as well as the other officers on the platform and the companions who were with Oscar Grant that night,\" O'Malley said.\n Pirone's account of the New Year's Day incident was directly contradicted by video evidence reviewed by investigators, according to a report written by a third-party law firm. The firm was hired to conduct an internal affairs investigation that \"examined and analyzed the conduct and performance\" of the officers involved in the shooting death of Grant, a Black 22-year-old father.\n Pirone and his partner went to the Fruitvale station in response to reports of a fight on a train. Several men were taken off the train and lined up against a wall. Pirone then saw Grant walking between the train cars and used profanity to order him to get off the train.\n Pirone told investigators he saw Grant \"attacking\" his partner. Pirone said he approached and Grant attempted to punch and kick him in the groin, at which point Pirone thought, \"I've got a fight now.\" Pirone said he felt he was \"fighting for my life at this point.\"\n The report says none of this happened in the footage seen by investigators. They determined that Grant \"did not appear to assault\" Pirone's partner, and that Pirone grabbed Grant and pushed him against the wall before punching him in the head. \"There is no indication that Grant kneed Pirone in the groin as he claims.\"\n Later, Pirone forced Grant to sit back down before hitting Grant in the face with his left knee in an \"unprovoked\" attack. An autopsy would later suggest \"the possible conclusion\" that injuries Grant suffered to the face were due to the actions of Pirone, whose use of force, investigators wrote, \"did not appear reasonable, justifiable or excusable.\"\n Pirone admitted to using the N-word during the encounter, but said it was in response to Grant directing the word at the BART officer.\n Investigators ultimately called for Pirone to be fired because of his unwarranted use of force against Grant, his inappropriate use of language and untruthfulness about his own actions, among other policy violations.\n CNN's Amir Vera and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.",

        "title": "How Trump's second impeachment will be different from the first",
        "body_text": "The overall impeachment process laid out in the Constitution is relatively simple: President commits \"high Crime or Misdemeanor,\" House votes to impeach, Senate conducts a trial.\n Those overall contours are constant. But there's no such thing as a routine impeachment.\n The one President Donald Trump faces now, after inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol, is unprecedented in all sorts of ways, which means the process will feel entirely new and different from the one we saw in late 2019 around the Ukraine investigation.\n Specifically, this House impeachment vote is likely to be done this week, and the Senate trial will occur after Trump leaves office.\n Here's another look at the impeachment process as it is spelled out in the Constitution and how it applies to this second impeachment of Trump, in which a US President is accused for the first time of inciting violence against another branch of government.\n The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Article 2, Section 4)\n There was a lot of debate during Trump's first impeachment and trial about whether the pressure he exerted on the President of Ukraine amounted to \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" or simply a set of policies.\n This time, while there's an argument he committed treason, Democrats in the House have alleged Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\"\n The Article argues that Trump incited his supporters by repeatedly denying the election results in the lead-up to the counting of the electoral votes, that he pressured Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" additional votes for him, and in doing so he \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,\" \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\"\n Read the entire thing here. It's short.\n The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. (Article 1, Section 2)\n Getting from Trump's misdeed to impeachment proceedings in the House took 86 days in 2019.\n It's going to take just a week in 2021.\n The House can essentially impeach at will. While there are precedents in place around instigating the impeachment process and utilizing House committees to investigate whether impeachable offenses occurred, none of that is necessarily required. And Democrats, moving quickly, aren't going to burden themselves by dragging this out.\n And why bother with an investigation when this time Trump did it on TV? In that first effort, the details of Trump's pressure on Ukraine leaked out over the course of weeks and built into Democratic support to launch and conduct an investigation and, ultimately, to impeach him.\n With Trump's time in office set to expire at noon on January 20, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also gave Trump and Vice President Mike Pence the option of avoiding impeachment if either Trump resigned or Pence mobilized the Cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n When those two offramps were ignored, Democrats in the House moved quickly toward impeachment and the first post-presidential impeachment trial in US history.\n Impeaching Trump in the House requires only a simple majority and Democrats hope to gain at least some support from Republicans.\n The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. (Article 1, Section 3)\n It took 48 days to get from Trump's December 19, 2019 impeachment to his February 5, 2020 acquittal. That process was slowed by a break over the holidays. The trial actually began January 16.\n This time it could be slowed by the fact that Trump won't be in office any more by the time the trial starts and new President Joe Biden will be asking the Senate to vote on his Cabinet nominees and act on legislation to address the Covid pandemic as well as relief for Americans hurt by the troubled economy.\n In 2020, Senate business ground to a complete halt during the trial. This time, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is hoping to pursue a half-day schedule to conduct the trial part of the day and business the rest of the day.\n The charges this time are much simpler to convey and understand, however. It should still take some number of days with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding and senators sitting in judgment. When both of the new Democratic senators from Georgia are seated, it will take 17 Republicans voting with Democrats to reach a two-thirds majority and convict Trump.\n Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. (Article 2, Section 3)\n The most unconventional aspect of this second impeachment effort is that Trump will be a former President by the time it concludes. There is precedent for former officials facing impeachment both in US history and in England, from whence the Founders imported the idea of impeachment. Read here about what's technically called a \"late impeachment\" from the scholars Frank Bowman and Brian Kalt.\n The swift effort to impeach him certainly puts Trump in the position of wanting to keep Republican senators on his side. In that regard, it would keep him in check during the last week of his presidency.\n Beyond the stain of being a President who a majority of Congress feels it's worth impeaching for a second time, conviction could mean he can't run for office again in 2024. Barring him from further office would require a second vote by senators, although it probably would not require two-thirds agreement. It could also cost him his more-than $200,000 per year pension if the Senate wants to take that way.\n ...he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. (Article 2, Section 2)\n Trump is widely thought to be considering the never-before-attempted self-pardon, to inoculate himself from future legal jeopardy related to his time in office and running for office. What's not clear is whether a late impeachment would have any bearing on his power to pardon himself. As the impeachment scholars Kalt and Bowman point out, the text of the Constitution doesn't mention pardons in terms of impeachment. It certainly seems like a successful impeachment would come up if and when a potential self pardon is challenged in court.\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Chuck Schumer's title. He is incoming Senate Majority Leader.",

        "body_text": "Israel is no longer a democracy but an \"apartheid regime\" devoted to cementing the supremacy of Jews over Palestinians, the country's best-known human rights group said in a report published Tuesday.\n B'Tselem, which until now has confined its work to scrutiny of human rights issues in the Palestinian territories, has now also decided to look at what it calls Israel's \"regime\" between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean.\n \"More than 14 million people, roughly half of them Jews and the other half Palestinians, live between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea under a single rule,\" B'Tselem said in a new analysis titled: \"A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid.\"\n The human rights group says that the traditional view of Israel as a democracy operating side-by-side with a temporary Israeli occupation in the territories \"imposed on some five million Palestinian subjects ... has grown divorced from reality.\"\n \"Most importantly, the distinction obfuscates the fact that the entire area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River is organized under a single principle: advancing and cementing the supremacy of one group -- Jews -- over another -- Palestinians,\" B'Tselem said in its controversial analysis.\n Years of injustice against Palestinians, culminating in laws that have entrenched discrimination, mean that \"the bar for labeling the Israeli regime as apartheid has been met,\" B'Tselem said.\n The allegation that Israel is an \"apartheid state\" has often been dismissed by rightwing Israelis and their support groups as anti-Semitic. But this argument will be harder to make now that Israel has been labelled this way by such a well-respected Israeli institution, albeit one that enjoys only minority support in its home country.\n Israel's embassy in London dismissed the report as \"not based on reality but on a distorted ideological view.\"\n \"The fact that B'Tselem chose not to present the report to the Israeli government for comment testifies to the fact that this is nothing more than a propaganda tool. Israel rejects the false claims in the so-called report ... Israel is a strong and vibrant democracy that gives full rights to all of its citizens regardless of religion, race or gender. The Arab citizens of Israel are represented in all branches of government -- in the Israeli parliament, in the courts (including the Supreme Court), in the public service, and even in the diplomatic corps where they represent the State of Israel around the world.\"\n Over the last decade there have been increasing concerns among Israel's traditional allies, especially in Europe, that the relentless loss of Palestinian territory to Jewish settlements on the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, was not only undermining a long-term peace process but Israel's moral standing.\n Those concerns were brought into sharp focus with the 2018 passing of the \"Basic Law: Israel -- the Nation State of the Jewish People\" -- which permanently enshrined Israel as a Jewish state into its constitution -- and reinforced by promises from Israel's politicians, notably Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to unilaterally annex large areas of the West Bank.\n Israel captured and occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. The Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the first of which was signed in 1993, were supposed to lead to a \"two-state solution\" establishing an independent Palestinian state living alongside Israel.\n Twenty-eight years later there are no signs of that outcome.\n B'Tselem argues that Israel has, rather, entrenched discrimination against non-Jews in the areas under its control.\n These include fewer rights for Palestinians living in Israel with Israeli citizenship (17% of the population). The most obvious example, B'Tselem says, is the fact that non-Jews cannot emigrate to Israel. Palestinians marrying an Israeli need Israeli official permission to move to Israel.\n On the West Bank, Jewish settlements are under continuous construction, while building permission for Palestinians in areas officially under Israeli security control is almost impossible to get and \"illegal\" structures are frequently bulldozed.\n Freedom of assembly and expression are also severely curtailed for Palestinians on the West Bank, the human rights group argues, whereas it's largely unrestricted for Jews.\n B'Tselem Executive Director Hagai El-Ad: \"Israel is not a democracy that has a temporary occupation attached to it: it is one regime between the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and we must look at the full picture and see it for what it is: apartheid. This sobering look at reality need not lead to despair, but quite the opposite. It is a call for change. After all, people created this regime, and people can change it.\"\n Between 1948 and 1994 South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation and \"separate development\" was designed to confine non-Whites to \"self-governing Bantustans,\" stripping them of their citizenship and placing them under the administration of puppet regimes which resembled discontinuous ink blots on a map.\n The Palestinian Authority, established under Oslo, administers the majority of Palestinians on the West Bank but they're largely confined to urban areas separated by territory under Israeli control and mostly prevented from travelling on roads predominantly set aside for Jewish settlers and other Israelis.\n B'Tselem officials said that they want the international community to \"take action\" over Israel's policies towards Palestinians.\n But they refused to be drawn on whether \"action\" included calls for international economic and cultural sanctions of the kind that were imposed on apartheid South Africa before it gained freedom with a series of steps that led to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994.",

        "title": "Impeaching Trump isn't enough",
        "body_text": "Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on \"CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\" on weekends.\nImpeachment of President Donald Trump is necessary but not enough. Conviction, too, is amply warranted but still insufficient. Congress must take that final step and use its rarely invoked constitutional power to disqualify Trump from ever again holding federal office.\n If ever a case cried out for application of the disqualification power, this is it: the President of the United States inciting a mob that ransacked parts of the Capitol and resulted in five deaths.\n The Constitution provides that, upon impeachment in the US House of Representatives (by majority vote) and conviction in the US Senate (by two-thirds vote), an official can be punished with \"removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\" Under Senate precedent, disqualification requires a separate vote, after and only if they have voted to convict. And while a two-thirds vote is necessary to convict, the Senate has previously used a lower standard -- a simple majority -- to disqualify. Over its history, the Senate has convicted and disqualified only three officeholders, including the last person who was impeached before Trump, federal Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. in 2010.\n The disqualification power, though rarely invoked, is particularly relevant here because of the calendar. Ordinarily, impeachment and conviction carry a heavy penalty: forfeiture of a president's remaining term in office. But because Trump's effort to inflame his followers to storm the Capitol crested on January 6 -- exactly two weeks before the end of his tenure -- there is little practical chance that the House can impeach and the Senate can hold a trial and convict before the natural end of his term on January 20.\n So disqualification likely will be the only real way to impose tangible punishment.\n Indeed, the Constitution and historical precedent appear to permit the Senate to try a federal official after he leaves office. This has happened once before. On March 2, 1876, Secretary of War William Belknap resigned under political pressure; later that day, the House impeached him. Then, in August 1876, the Senate held Belknap's impeachment trial (and ultimately acquitted him).\n There undoubtedly is a punitive aspect to disqualification; it is necessary to deter treacherous conduct even in the final days and hours of a president's term in office. And the looming threat of a post-presidency disqualification vote by the Senate could deter Trump from committing further potential abuses of power -- from his authority as commander-in-chief to his exercise of the pardon power.\n Further, the disqualification power protects against the eventual return of a president who has so seriously abused his power to warrant impeachment. Typically, impeachment and conviction alone would pose a major obstacle to a politician's re-election. But Trump is anything but typical. He has shown an uncanny ability to hold onto his base of political support through countless scandals. Trump could well try to ride that support to another run for the presidency in 2024.\n Think it's impractical, that he'd be too old? Consider that Trump in 2024 will be nearly the same age that President-elect Joe Biden is now. And Trump has made clear throughout his career in business and politics that he does not easily accept defeat.\n Of course, it's about even more than preventing Trump from holding office again. The impending impeachment of Trump is also about the history books. It's vital that Congress condemn Trump's conduct not just in words but also in action -- and impose meaningful punishment to stand as a marker for future generations.\n Impeachment and conviction without disqualification ultimately would be toothless, permitting Trump to escape with a wag of the finger but minimal concrete consequences. But disqualification sends an unmistakable message: any president who violates the oath of office as Trump has done will be cast out of office and never permitted to return.\n Yes, but only if impeached and convicted. The federal Former Presidents Act entitles former presidents to an array of benefits including a pension, support staff and Secret Service protection. That law also provides that its benefits are available only to a person \"whose service in such office shall have terminated other than by removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the Constitution of the United States of America\" -- referencing the constitutional provision for impeachment, conviction and removal. Thus, on its face, the law would strip a president who has been impeached and convicted of at least some of those benefits (though it is unclear whether he would lose Secret Service protection).\n There also could be an argument that if Trump is convicted by the Senate only after he has left office on January 20 -- which is possible, as discussed above -- he technically was not \"removed\" from office. But the spirit of the law plainly is to punish former presidents who have been found guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors by stripping away their post-presidency benefits.\n Yes. Article I of the Constitution allows the House and the Senate to expel their own members by votes of two-thirds of membership. Expulsion has rarely been used; no senator has been expelled since the Civil War, and only two representatives have been expelled since 1861 (in 1980 and 2002). The House and Senate also could formally censure -- essentially, reprimand -- their own members by a majority vote. While censure does not carry any specific penalty, it can have political consequences. For example, the Senate formally censured Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1954, which damaged his standing in the Senate and in the public eye.\n The latter. The First Amendment applies only to governmental action. The very first word of the amendment is \"Congress\": \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" That has been applied more broadly to any governmental entity. For example, the First Amendment could apply if Congress passed a law restricting the media, or if a public school board or public library banned certain books.\n But the First Amendment does not bind private actors like Twitter or Facebook. There simply is no way for Trump, or anyone else, to legally compel such private entities to allow them to use their platforms.",

        "body_text": "General Motors is starting a new vehicle brand to sell electric delivery vans in the United States and Canada beginning in 2021.\n Called BrightDrop, the new brand has been working with FedEx to test the new delivery system, and FedEx Express will be its first customer. In addition to the vans, BrightDrop will also offer a motorized electric pallet, controlled by a courier, that will carry packages from the trucks to front doors.\n Other companies have expressed interest in the products, said Pamela Fletcher, GM's vice president for global innovation, but the company isn't identifying any potential customers yet.\n GM's BrightDrop joins a number of startups getting into the electric delivery van business. Rivian, best known for its upcoming electric pickup and SUV models, is also working on delivery vans for Amazon, a major investor. Canoo, a company that unveiled a self driving electric concept vehicle in 2019, more recently announced plans for its own delivery van. UK startup Arrival, which has received funding from Hyundai, is also testing electric delivery vans.\n Demand for last-mile deliveries is expected to grow by 78 percent by 2030, GM said in a statement, citing a World Economic Forum Study.\n GM plans to set up a new separate dealer network for BrightDrop. The company did not share information about the cost of either vehicle or how that dealer network will be set up.\n The BrightDrop EV600 will be able to drive up to 250 miles on a full charge, according to GM. With fast charging, it can take on up to 170 miles worth of power in an hour, according to GM.\n The EP1 motorized pallet, which FedEx has been testing, is something like a rolling locker. With a top speed of 3 miles an hour, it has electric motors to help them move as they are pulled along a sidewalk or up a walkway to a house. One EP1 can carry up to 200 pounds, or 23 cubic feet of cargo. During a pilot program, FedEx Express couriers were able to handle 25% more packages using the EP1, according to GM.\n The EP1 can work with any van, GM said. BrightDrop will help customers modify other vans in their fleets to work with the EP1, GM said, and customers can use a standard cargo lift gate to get the EP1 in and out. GM also showed an animation on its CES website of a concept van with openings in the side and a built-in lift to more quickly load multiple EP1s.\n BrightDrop is also working on a \"medium distance\" delivery vehicle that can carry multiple EP1s around large enclosed areas such as campuses or large warehouses.\n As with many electric vehicles, the van and the EP1 will provide provide real-time information about their location and state of charge.",

        "body_text": "Sheldon Adelson, the chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands and a major donor to Republican politicians, died late Monday following complications related to his cancer treatment, his company said. He was 87.\n Adelson took a leave of absence from Sands last week to resume treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which his aides first disclosed in late February 2019.\n He rose from a hardscrabble childhood in Boston to become one of the world's richest men as founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) He was Sands' first employee, which has since grown to 50,000 employees.\n \"His impact on the industry will be everlasting,\" the company said. Sands' shares opened slightly higher Tuesday.\n Adelson's funeral will be held in Israel, the birthplace of his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson. Plans for a memorial in Las Vegas, where he ran the Venetian and Palazzo casinos, will be held at a later date.\n Adelson spent his fortune -- pegged at $35 billion by Forbes -- to become an influential behind-the-scenes-player in Washington, working to shape US policy toward Israel, help guide Republican Party strategy and lobby against threats posed to his business interests.\n He donated hundreds of millions of dollars to medical research and Jewish causes. He owned Israel's largest daily newspaper by circulation; donated to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance center in Jerusalem; and helped underwrite Birthright Israel, which pays for educational trips to Israel for young Jewish adults.\n Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Tuesday his \"deep sorrow and heartbreak' over Adelson's death.\n \"Many, many among the Jewish people, in the State of Israel, and in the whole world, share in this heavy mourning,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"Sheldon's great efforts to strengthen Israel's position in the United States and to strengthen the connection between Israel and the Diaspora will be remembered for generations.\"\n But he was perhaps best known in the United States as a Republican mega-donor whose millions helped shape the course of presidential and congressional elections in the post-Citizens United era.\n Adelson and his wife, Miriam, donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Republican-aligned super PACs.  They plowed more than $215 million into federal super PACs in the last two years, making them largest publicly disclosed donors of the 2020 elections, according to a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n Adelson did not always support the front-runner in GOP intraparty fights.\n In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, for instance, Adelson invested heavily in a super PAC that helped extend former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's presidential run.\n Gingrich eventually lost the nomination to Mitt Romney, but Adelson's spending underscored his loyalty to Gingrich, with whom he shared a hawkish stance on Israel.\n In 2016, Adelson emerged as a powerful voice backing then-candidate Donald Trump at a time when many GOP traditional donors were reluctant to support the brash real estate developer.\n In May 2016, as Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, Adelson penned a Washington Post opinion piece, urging the party's financial benefactors to unite behind Trump after a bruising primary.\n Adelson called Trump a \"CEO success story.\"\n \"You may not like Trump's style or what he says on Twitter, but this country needs strong executive leadership more today than at almost any point in its history,\" Adelson wrote.\n Later that year, the Adelsons donated $20 million to a super PAC supporting Trump's candidacy. Adelson became the largest individual contributor to the President's inaugural committee, donating $5 million.\n The Adelsons were rewarded for their generosity.\n They attended Trump's inauguration, dined at the White House and had front-row seats in 2018 as US officials opened a US Embassy in Jerusalem -- a long-standing Adelson objective.\n In a White House ceremony in 2018, Trump awarded Israeli-born Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The White House cited her work to support medical research and Jewish causes.\n In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Trump said that the world \"lost a great man\" and that Adelson will be \"missed.\" He added that Sheldon \"lived the true American dream.\"\n Adelson was born August 4, 1933, in Boston. His father, an immigrant from Lithuania, drove a cab, and his mother, whose family came from Wales, ran a small knitting service. He and his siblings slept on the floor of the family's tenement apartment.\n Adelson often touted his rags-to-riches story and his determination to claw his way out of poverty.\n At age 12, he was selling newspapers on street corners in Boston. By 16, he had invested in candy machines. After a stint in the Army, he continued to run businesses, selling condominiums, working as a mortgage broker, taking a turn as a venture capitalist.\n \"Despite being the grandson of a Welsh coal miner and the son of a Boston cab driver, I've had the remarkable experience of being part of almost 50 different businesses in my more than 70-year business career,\" he wrote in the Washington Post piece touting Trump.\n His big break came in the late 1970s, when he launched a computer trade show known as Comdex. He sold it in 1995 for nearly $900 million, parlaying that convention business into a casino empire that comprises the properties in Asia, and the upscale Venetian and Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas. His venture became the world's largest casino company.\n His properties ranged from the opulent Venetian casino resort in Las Vegas, where visitors can ride in gondolas, to a string of lucrative casinos in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macao.\n In October 2020, the company told multiple outlets that it was in \"very early discussions\" about a possible sale of its Las Vegas properties. He sold Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania in 2019.\n In person, Adelson was instantly recognizable for his thinning patch of bright red hair and the electric scooter he rode everywhere. He suffered from peripheral neuropathy, a condition that made walking difficult.\n He generally shied away from media interviews.\n His family's 2015 purchase of one of his hometown newspapers, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was cloaked in secrecy, forcing journalists at the paper to do their own digging to determine the identity of their new bosses.\n During his cancer battle, Adelson had curtailed his office hours at the company he founded, although the company said in a statement that Adelson continued to perform his duties as its chairman and CEO.\n Calling his achievements in the hospitality industry \"well-documented,\" the company said that Adelson's vision \"transformed the industry, changed the trajectory of the company he founded, and reimagined tourism\" in Las Vegas, Macao and Singapore.\n --CNN's Andrew Carey and Amir Tal contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The real lesson of Trump's social media silencing",
        "body_text": "Ethan Zuckerman is an associate professor of public policy, information and communication at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and director of the Institute for Digital Public Infrastructure. He is the author of the new book \"Mistrust: Why Losing Faith in Institutions Provides the Tools to Transform Them.\" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nOn January 8, President Donald Trump was kicked off his soapbox: He lost his Twitter account.  After suspending Trump for videos that praised Capitol riot participants, Twitter concluded that his follow-up tweets might incite future violence and it permanently banned him.  Facebook has also suspended the President's account.\n These actions reflect a major shift in how large social media platforms handle extreme speech. They have long tolerated right-wing extremists and were particularly hands off with Trump, concluding that his tweets and posts -- for all his flagrant lying and bullying -- were important dispatches from a world leader, and had to stay up for everyone in our democracy to see.\n But over time, lines have been drawn.\n The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was deplatformed in 2018, helping start a migration of right-wing social media onto parallel platforms that have included Parler and others. It's possible that Trump, now sidelined and silent online, may reemerge on another platform, making it more influential... and subject to more public scrutiny. Parler is offline now because Amazon removed hosting services due to concerns over unmoderated violent content.\n But incitement to violence and hate aren't the only reasons platforms are removing extreme speech. Last spring, we saw coordinated action among the main tech platforms to remove the \"Plandemic\" video, in which a discredited scientist railed against Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and warned against mask wearing.\n Because the disinformation in the video was likely to exacerbate the Covid pandemic, platforms quickly took down the video, limiting its spread.\n We are indeed seeing a shift by the platforms away from their previous free-speech absolutism toward an understanding of speech moderation as a matter of public health and safety: Sharing disinformation about Covid makes it harder to fight the disease; similarly, sharing disinformation about voting weakens our democracy.\n Under the paradigm of the public good, it makes much more sense for platforms to control speech more assertively.\n But the actions by Twitter and other companies are being falsely labeled censorship. This is untrue: Trump isn't being censored. None of these platforms have an obligation to provide a forum to anyone. They are all private companies with terms of service that users agree to.\n Trump, like everyone else on Twitter, agreed to its rules, which include a ban on promoting violence. This has nothing to do with the First Amendment, which applies to government restrictions on speech, not contracts between private companies and their users.\n Furthermore, Trump still has vast powers to communicate. He has a press secretary, and a press briefing room inside his house.  He can talk to reporters -- not to mention the country and the world -- whenever he wants. This is not a man who has a problem being heard.\n If Trump is determined to speak online, he has other options.  Many of the millions of subscribers Trump has lost on Twitter would likely find him on a new platform. And the press will surely continue to cover his rantings in a new space, even though we all might benefit from paying less attention to Trump once he leaves the White House.\n All that said, the power over speech enjoyed by platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube is still deeply problematic. The answer is not as simple as more regulation that shifts control from platform owners to government. A much better shift would be toward a new vision of social media -- as public infrastructure that is built, owned and moderated by communities.\n This is how speech works in the offline world. If I say something violent or offensive within a group of friends, that group has to figure out how to respond: do they confront me to make clear that such speech is unacceptable? Do they kick me out of the group? Or do they decide it's better to ignore or tolerate what I say?\n These are not easy discussions, whether in the workplace, church, or community organizations, but they are the bedrock of small \"d\" democratic life.\n The platforms have done us a real disservice in taking these discussions out of our hands and handing them over to algorithms and low-paid moderators overseas. We need to debate what sort of public speech and behavior we will accept and who we want to be as a society. A society that abandons this responsibility abdicates a key aspect of full citizenship.\n The events of January 6 were heartbreaking and shocking, if not surprising. It is understandable that many are celebrating Trump's social media muzzling. The satisfaction people are feeling comes from seeing that actions have consequences, something that is, unfortunately, easier to demonstrate within corporate America than within the halls of Washington.\n If you are afraid that Trump's removal from Twitter and Facebook reflect the disproportionate power those platforms have over public life, you're not wrong. We have allowed our public sphere to be controlled by a small number of private companies, and we are now discovering how vulnerable online speech can be.\n The silencing of Trump was justifiable under the circumstances -- an active insurrection spurred on by the President -- but it still should lead us to sustained conversation about how we want our digital public spaces to operate, and what the rules should be.",
