        "title": "11 of 22 Chinese miners trapped in gold mine rescued, ten others dead",
        "body_text": "Eleven miners who were trapped in a gold mine for more than two weeks in eastern China have been rescued, while ten so far have died, Chinese state media reported.\n Authorities have been racing to dig out 22 people trapped underground in the city of Qixia, Shandong Province, since an explosion blocked their exit on January 10.\n The first miner was rescued on Sunday morning at about 11:13 a.m. local time, and was in \"extremely weak condition,\" according to state-run news wire Xinhua. State broadcaster CCTV said he was sent to hospital.\n The next 10 were lifted from a deeper section of the mine. At least one of them was injured, according to CCTV, but it is not clear how seriously.\n A total of ten miners have been found dead, according to Yantai city mayor Chen Fei speaking on Chinese state media.\n One miner's body was recovered on January 21 and nine more recovered Monday, media reported. Rescuers are still searching for one more miner out of 22.\n Authorities had previously said 10 people who were stuck in the mine's chamber 600 meters (1,969 feet) underground were in contact with the outside world after rescue workers drilled a channel into a section the mine and installed a telephone line, according to Xinhua. It is not yet clear if those 10 are among those who have been rescued.\n Efforts have been underway to reach the workers since the blast occurred about 240 meters (800 feet) from the mine's entrance, but Chinese officials had said Thursday it could take 15 days to drill through 70 tons of debris trapping many of the miners.\n Food, medical supplies, blankets, and batches of nutrient solution have been passed down a shaft to the 10 workers who have been located. They are in good physical and psychological condition, Xinhua reported.\n According to state media, rescue teams are hoping to pull the miners out through a 711-millimeter (28-inch) diameter passage. By noon Thursday, rescuers had drilled 18 meters (59 feet) into the mineshaft but heavy debris could slow efforts.\n Concern has been growing for the uncontacted miners. Some of the workers in the chamber are trying to help rescuers locate their missing colleagues by using laser pointers and loudspeakers, but they have received no response, Xinhua reported.\n Rescuers have also drilled smaller channels into other sections of the mine and are lowering nutrient solutions and other means to detect breathing or movement, but no signs of life have been encountered.\n Rescue workers are reported to have first heard knocking sounds from those trapped on January 17, followed by pulling on iron ropes. On Monday, miners were able to get a note to rescuers. Xinhua quoted the note as saying: \"We are heavily exhausted and in urgent need of stomach medicine, painkillers, medical tape, external anti-inflammatory drugs, and three people have high blood pressure.\"\n Explosions and deaths are not uncommon in Chinese mines. In September, at least 16 workers in southwestern China died after they became trapped underground in a coal mine and exposed to unsafe levels of carbon monoxide, state media reported.\n And in 2016, dozens of workers were confirmed dead after a gas explosion at a coal mine in the city of Chongqing.\n CNN's Beijing bureau contributed reporting",

        "title": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders announces bid for Arkansas governor",
        "body_text": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders, President Donald Trump's former press secretary, announced Monday that she is running for governor of Arkansas.\n \"With the radical left now in charge of Washington, your governor is your last line of defense. In fact, your governor must be on the front line,\" Sanders said in a nearly eight-minute video posted on Twitter. \"So today, I announce my candidacy for governor of Arkansas.\"\n She also notes the riot at the Capitol earlier this month as an example of lawlessness in the country.\n \"We've seen violence in our streets, at a congressional baseball practice and at our Capitol. This is not who we are as Americans. To remain free, we must have law and order,\" she says in the clip.\n Sanders had been seen as a likely candidate ever since she left the White House in the summer of 2019. The daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee will likely face a primary challenge -- multiple top Republicans in the state have already announced a bid -- but she is widely seen as an early favorite for the position. A source familiar told CNN of Sanders' plan to run for office on Sunday.\n Asa Hutchinson, the current governor of Arkansas, is term limited.\n The governor's mansion is expected to stay in Republican control. While the state has elected Democrats in recent history -- from former governor and President Bill Clinton to former Sen. Mark Pryor more recently -- Arkansas has politically veered right over the last decade. The state backed Trump with more than 62% of the vote in November.\n The former President endorsed Sanders on Monday night.\n \"Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct. Sarah is strong on Borders, tough on Crime, and fully supports the Second Amendment and our great law enforcement officers,\" Trump said in a statement.\n \"She loves our Military and Veterans -- and her home state of Arkansas. Sarah will be a GREAT Governor, and she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\"\n Sanders began considering running for governor before she left the White House in 2019. CNN reported at the time that Sanders, in multiple private conversations, had floated the idea and told colleagues and friends that she believes running for office would be a good next move for her.\n Sanders' run and expected primary challenge could represent a good test of Trump's continued hold on the Republican Party. Not only is Sanders well-liked by the President -- unlike many in Trump's orbit, she left the White House on good terms and in the President's good graces -- but the primary experience she is expected to tout on the campaign trail is her work with Trump.\n \"She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job,\" Trump tweeted when Sanders was leaving the White House. \"I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas\u2014she would be fantastic.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Terence Burlij and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "If you thought Fox News would dial down the highly charged rhetoric after Donald Trump left office, you'd be mistaken. It is not slowing down when it comes to bashing President Joe Biden.\n The network, which has long attacked Democrats, has noticeably ramped up the war of words about Biden since Inauguration Day.\n \"These channels are more anti-Democrat than they are pro-Trump,\" said CNN's Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter on \"Reliable Sources\" Sunday. \"The Biden bashing has been turned up to 11 ... and 12 and 13.\"\n In addition to calling Biden weak, frail, senile and a radical, conservative media outlets, including Fox News, OAN and Newsmax, cynically argue that the mainstream media has been fawning over Biden, failing to cover him critically.\n \"Every hour, every day, that's the narrative,\" Stelter said. \"And it's going to be like this for the next four years.\"\n Conservative media had been pushing lies about the election for months, amplifying false information about election fraud, telling viewers the election was rigged and how Biden didn't rightfully win the presidency. Biden, in his inaugural address, plead with those outlets to take down the temperature and tell their viewers the truth: \"We must reject the culture where facts themselves are manipulated \u2014 and even manufactured,\" he said.\n Stelter argued that's an impossible task.\n \"Biden can talk about politics not needing to be a raging fire,\" said Stelter. \"But it is. It was yesterday, it is today and will be tomorrow on these shows that millions of people watch.\"\n That's not about to change, said Stuart Stevens, former top strategist for\u00a0Mitt Romney and current senior advisor to the Lincoln Project on \"Reliable Sources.\"\n \"Fox exists as an organ of the Republican Party,\" Stevens said. Now it's up to the \"responsible people in the Republican Party\" to speak the truth, he said.\n While news networks including CNN, MSNBC, ABC and CBS reported on Biden's Inauguration Day Wednesday evening, Fox News hosts focused on Hunter Biden's laptop and mocked the president, calling him \"weak.\"\n That's why Australia's Rupert Murdoch -- who has ownership stakes in News Corp and Fox Corp., the parent companies for outlets including Fox News and the New York Post -- is \"the most dangerous immigrant in America,\" Stevens said\n He said that Murdoch is \"a classic example of somebody who never assimilated American values.\"\n Stevens said Fox and similar outlets have created a new identity for the Republican party: victimhood. He called it a \"pathetic way to look at your role in the world and America's role in the world.\"\n \"When Ronald Reagan was president, to be born in America was to win life's lottery,\" he said. \"Now, if you're a Republican, if you're a Trump voter, to be born an American is: you're a victim, you're a sucker.\"\n Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Fox News' parent company. It is owned by Fox Corp.",

        "body_text": "President Joe Biden on Monday reinstated the Covid-19 travel restrictions on non-US citizens who have been in Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom and much of Europe.\n Biden also extended the restrictions to travelers who have recently been to South Africa.\n The step, which was first reported by Reuters, came just one week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in his final days in office lifting the restrictions on travelers from these countries effective January 26.\n \"The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of noncitizens who were physically present within the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of Brazil during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States, is hereby suspended,\" the proclamation read in part.\n The proclamation is in effect for people who do not fall under a number of exceptions spelled out in the order.\n The Biden transition team had vowed the new administration would not lift the restrictions. \"With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,\" then-incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.\n \"On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\"\n The decision to reinstate the travel restrictions -- and expand restrictions in the case of South Africa -- marks the latest effort by the Biden administration to break from Trump's discursive approach to the pandemic as cases continue to climb nationwide.\n Biden said on his first full day in office on Thursday his strategy would be \"based on science, not politics\" as he signed a slate of coronavirus-related executive actions, including ramping up vaccination supplies and requiring international travelers to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test prior to traveling to the US.\n Many of the countries that would have been impacted by Trump's order have their own recent requirements for American travelers looking to enter their borders.\n US travelers must have a negative Covid-19 test from within 72 hours prior to travel into the United Kingdom or Ireland, and in conjunction with proof of a completed Declaration of Traveler's Health to enter Brazil. American travelers generally cannot enter countries such as Spain, Germany, France, Italy and Sweden without meeting specific requirements.\n This story has been updated to include additional information.",

It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.\nDeng Pravatoudom followed her husband's dream all the way to Easy Street.\n Pravatoudom, 57, has played the lottery for two decades using a set of numbers that her husband dreamed about 20 years ago. In December, his dream became reality when his wife played those numbers and won a $60 million jackpot, Ontario Lottery and Gaming (OLG) said in a news release Monday.\n On December 1, the mother of two -- who was laid off during the pandemic -- went to the bank to pay some bills while her husband checked the tickets.\n When they returned to the car, he told her they had won $60 million.\n \"I was ecstatically happy, I was crying at the same time. I couldn't believe it at first,\" Pravatoudom said during a virtual celebration where she was presented the check. \"I am going to buy a house, then if it's allowed after Covid, I'm going to travel the world.\"\n Pravatoudom emigrated from Laos to Canada with her 14 siblings in 1980. For decades, she and her husband have worked hard to support their family, she said.\n \"My family was sponsored by a local church and because we had nothing, I am thankful for the great support they provided us over the years,\" she said. \"My husband and I have worked long hours as general labourers for over 40 years, trying to save what we could for our family. Due to the pandemic I was laid off last spring, so this money will certainly help make our lives much easier.\"\n Along with buying herself some diamonds, Pravatoudom and her husband will first pay off their bills and help their children, who she says are overwhelmed with joy for their parents.\n \"They said, 'Mom and Dad you have worked so hard for 40 years and made many sacrifices, so you deserve this happiness,\" Pravatoudom said.",

        "title": "Tacoma police officer drives through crowd, leaving at least one person injured, officials say",
        "body_text": "A Tacoma, Washington, police officer is under investigation after he drove his vehicle into a crowd, running over at least one person and possibly striking others, according to a press release from the Tacoma Police Department.\n Along with other police units, the officer was responding to reports of an incident at the intersection of South 9th and Pacific Avenue in Tacoma around 6:20 p.m. on Saturday, the release said. Once on scene, the officers found a number of vehicles and approximately 100 people blocking the intersection, which they began to clear \"for the safety of those gathered and people trying to use the street,\" the release said.\n The crowd then surrounded one of the police vehicles and began hitting the vehicle and its windows while its lights and sirens were activated, according to police. The officer inside the SUV tried to back up, according to the statement, but was not able to because of the crowd.\n \"Fearing for his safety,\" the statement said, \"the officer drove forward striking one individual and may have impacted others,\" while trying to get out of the \"unsafe position.\" Once the officer was \"at a point of safety,\" police say he called for medical aid.\n The officer was not identified in the police statement.\n The Pierce County Force Investigation Team is investigating the incident, the statement said.\n In a statement issued later on Sunday, the department said the officer had been placed on administrative leave.\n \"The patrol officer involved in this incident is a 58-year-old male who has been a member of the Tacoma Police Department for 29.5 years,\" the statement said. \"The officer was placed on paid administrative leave per department policy on the evening of January 23 immediately following the incident.\"\n According to reporting from The News Tribune, Tacoma police spokesperson Wendy Haddow said the crowd was pounding on the windows of the officer's vehicle. \"He was afraid they would break his glass,\" she said, prompting him to speed away from the scene.\n One person, whose condition is unknown, was taken to a local hospital following the incident, according to police. Haddow told The New Tribune one person sustained a laceration in the collision and was transported to a local hospital, the paper reported.\n In at least one graphic video of the incident circulating on social media, the police vehicle, with lights and sirens on, can be seen slowly moving closer to the crowd gathered in front of the vehicle. An engine is heard revving in the background and the vehicle backs up and then accelerates forward into the crowd, knocking several people to the ground.\n The vehicle slows down slightly and it appears to bounce while driving over something before continuing through the intersection. The back tires of the vehicle can be seen rolling over someone laying in the street.\n A second video shows a white car doing donuts in the middle of the intersection and driving off just as police arrive on the scene, moments before the police vehicle is seen driving through the crowd.\n In another video, the sound of an engine revving is followed by a series of thuds and an individual exclaiming twice, \"Damn, they're hitting a cop car.\" Moments later an engine is heard revving again and people scatter and begin to scream, \"Oh my God! Oh my God!\" repeatedly. A few seconds later, a smaller crowd is seen forming around what appears to be someone laying on the ground.\n \"I am concerned that our department is experiencing another use of deadly force incident,\" Tacoma interim police Chief Mike Ake said in the press release.\n \"I send my thoughts to anyone who was injured in tonight's event and am committed to our department's full cooperation in the independent investigation and to assess the actions of the department's response during the incident,\" he said.\n Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards on Sunday said the incident was being taken very seriously \"as a use of force\" and called on the city manager and police chief to hold everyone involved accountable.\n \"While we await more information, I want the community to know that I am deeply concerned and praying for everyone who was impacted by last night's events,\" Woodards said in a statement. \"I continue to be proud of Tacoma's long-standing reputation as a place of strong, non-violent advocacy and activism. I continue to support your right to use your voice to advocate and demonstrate peacefully during this time of heightened tension.\"\n CNN's Jennifer Feldman contributed to this report.",

        "title": "SpaceX launches 143 satellites on one rocket in record-setting mission",
        "body_text": "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried 143 satellites into orbit on a jam-packed rideshare mission Sunday, setting a new world record for the most satellites launched by a single rocket.\n The mission, dubbed Transporter-1, carried 10 satellites for SpaceX's Starlink internet network, and more than 130 satellites for a variety of customers including Planet, which operates a constellation of Earth-imaging satellites, and ICEYE, which develops small radar satellites for monitoring ice and tracking floods.\n The previous record for the most satellites sent to space in one trip was held by PSLV, an Indian rocket, that carried 104 satellites in a 2017 launch.\n SpaceX's Transporter-1 mission was the first in new rideshare program that SpaceX announced in 2019. The company said at the time it will dedicate \"regularly scheduled\" launches of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket to carrying large batches of small satellites, or \"smallsats,\" rather than focusing on one large, primary payload.\n Smallsats have seen a meteoric rise in popularity over the past few years. They range in size from as small as a smartphone to as large as a kitchen refrigerator. And as they've grown more advanced, hoards of businesses have entered the market promising to deliver services using new smallsat technologies.\n Typically, smallsats reach orbit by tagging along with larger, more expensive satellites, and the waiting list can be long and unpredictable. But there's been a major push in the launch industry to cater directly to the booming smallsat market. Dozens of new rocket companies are promising to build scaled-down rockets that can provide quick and easy launches for smallsats. Two such companies, Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit, have successfully sent their downsized rockets to orbit and begun commercial operations.\n SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are much larger than Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit's rockets, and they're typically used to launch hefty communications or spy satellites or Dragon spacecraft, which ferry astronauts and cargo to and from the International Space Station.\n Deciding to dedicate additional missions just to launching batches of smallsats is a company first, and it's a sign of how much interest in the industry has grown.\n As the number of devices in orbit grows, however, experts are becoming increasingly concerned about congestion. Satellites have collided in orbit before, and though such incidents don't post much of a threat to people on the ground, the debris from the crash can stay in orbit for years or decades.",

        "title": "How Colbert, Kimmel and Fallon plan to adapt to life after Trump",
        "body_text": "Late-night TV has always featured politics. Johnny Carson spent decades lampooning leaders of both parties on \"The Tonight Show,\" and impersonating a president on \"Saturday Night Live\" is considered a badge of honor. Jon Stewart became one of the biggest names in TV comedy by speaking truth to those in power on \"The Daily Show.\"\n But President Donald Trump was unlike anything that late-night hosts had ever really seen before, and his presidency caused a tectonic shift in the DNA of late-night TV \u2014  from the structure of the shows to their tenor and tone.\n Hosts such as Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel acted less like MCs of a nightclub full of celebrity guests and more like nightly news anchors offering viewers much-needed, if not always comical, insights into the administration's antics.\n With Trump out of office, where does late-night go from here?\n \"Trump was like a hurricane you had to cover,\" said Bill Carter, a CNN contributor who has written multiple books about late-night TV. \"But now I think there's a desire to move on, as the country is desiring to move on.\"\n Carter said that even though Colbert, Meyers and Kimmel celebrated Trump's White House departure on Wednesday, the former president will not disappear from the news, which means he also won't vanish from the late-night airwaves, either.\n \"There's a bit of an addiction metaphor here because you can't quit Trump cold turkey,\" Carter said. \"They're going to find it's tough to move on because the stories will continue to play out. I mean, he'll criticize every single thing that Biden does, and there's the story of the insurrection. So until all of that becomes resolved, Trump will still be a massive story for everybody, including late-night.\"\n Away from finding new fodder for monologues, Trump's departure could also alter the power dynamics of late-night itself.\n Take CBS' \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" for example. Colbert struggled to find his footing in the show's early, pre-President Trump years but found its voice \u2014 and an audience \u2014 thanks to becoming a sincere yet satirical backstop to the president.\n Will less Trump mean less success for Colbert, who currently has the top-rated show in all of late-night? Not so much, according to Carter.\n \"I am confident that he'll do well,\" Carter said. \"He may not do as well as he's been doing because I do think there's a tune-in factor that 'Trump did something outrageous, so I have to see what Colbert says.' However, I do think he's come into his own as a late-night host.\"\n Conversely, Trump proved to be a draining force for some in late-night like NBC's Jimmy Fallon. Fallon was the king of late-night as the host of \"The Tonight Show\" before Trump took office, but after an infamous and often criticized September 2016 moment, in which he mussed up Trump's hair, Fallon has found himself lagging in the ratings.\n With Trump gone, Fallon might find his way again.\n \"I think Jimmy was not set out to be the political commentator comedian. He's an incredibly gifted comic, and that's why he was doing well at first,\" Carter said. \"I think people liked the sort of feel-good aspect of his show, but Trump overwhelmed that.\"\n Fallon has dealt with some producer changes during Trump's term, casualties of the last four years that underscore how the show has been struggling to find itself.\n \"I do think Trump being gone will help him,\" which will allow Fallon to get creative again beyond coming up with political jokes, which are not really his strong suit, according to Carter.\n \"He did a lot of really creative things, and I think he's going to have to do that and find new ones,\" he said. \"I mean he's lost that 'I got to tune in to see what Jimmy Fallon is doing' feel, which made him a viral force on TV and online. But I think he can get it back.\"\n Then there's the one show that lambasted Trump week after week during his term in office: \"SNL.\"\n James Andrew Miller, author of \"Live From New York, the Complete, Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live,\" told CNN Business that the NBC variety show might soon find that making fun of Biden is a lot harder than making fun of Trump.\n \"Obama was probably one of the most difficult presidents for 'SNL' because he was difficult to impersonate and there wasn't a lot of drama going on in the White House,\" Miller said. \"Biden promises to probably be the same, so that's a challenge.\"\n But this may be a chance for \"SNL\" to find other things in the news to lampoon, Miller said.\n \"I think now in the Biden years there's an opportunity for 'SNL' to also spend more time on so much of what it's done in the past, which is great comedy, great sketches, reoccurring characters, and other things that have nothing to do with politics,\" he said. \"They're emancipated from the burden of having to cover Trump all of the time.\"\n Although Trump was an all-consuming force on late-night, his presidency brought out a passion in the hosts that \"allowed them to open up their point of view,\" Carter said.\n \"Trump allowed them to really be themselves with the audience, and I think that won't go back,\" he said. \"Whatever they really care about will now be front and center.\"",

        "body_text": "The brother of an alleged US Capitol rioter is a US Secret Service agent who once led former first lady Michelle Obama's detail, CNN has learned.\n Preston Fairlamb III, the brother of Scott Fairlamb -- a man who faces five charges connected to his alleged role in the Capitol insurrection -- is a member of the Secret Service and, according to Obama's 2018 memoir, had \"led my detail\" at one point.\n \"All of us grew close to our agents over time. Preston Fairlamb led my detail then,\" Obama wrote in \"Becoming.\" She attended the 2012 memorial service for the Fairlamb's father, according to a statement by the church where the memorial service was held.\n Scott Fairlamb's attorney, Harley Breite, told CNN that Preston Fairlamb III was unaware of his brother's alleged actions during the attack on the Capitol. \"He was not privy to anything that my client is alleged to have done that day,\" he said.\n CNN has made multiple attempts to reach Preston Fairlamb III directly. The US Secret Service and Obama's office have yet to respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n So far, the Justice Department has charged more than 125 defendants related to the Capitol riots. The charges have largely functioned as placeholders -- the types of complaints that allow authorities to make arrests, search homes and pursue broader investigations that could go before a federal grand jury in the coming days.\n Many of the cases stick to bare bones allegations, based on livestreamed video or social media posts, and accuse rioters of disorderly conduct and entering restricted property. Some of the rioters have turned themselves in to police and already admitted their alleged crimes.\n Law enforcement officials say they are now moving from the so-called low-hanging fruit arrests and charges to more complicated cases, focusing on the extremist groups that participated in the attack.\n That effort will take months to try to piece together, in part, because unlike some of the early arrests of suspects -- who gleefully posted on social media or even live-streamed their involvement -- many alleged attackers took pains to hide their identities and their involvement.\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Jason Hoffman, David Shortell and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

The symptoms are mild, but I am already receiving medical treatment. As always, I am optimistic. We will move forward,\" Lopez Obrador wrote.\n The President added that he would continue his duties from the Presidential Palace, which include conducting a planned phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the topic of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine Monday.\n \"I will be conducting all public affairs from the National Palace. For example, tomorrow I will take a call from President Vladimir Putin, because irrespective of friendly relationships, there is a possibility that they will send us the Sputnik V vaccine,\" Lopez Obrador said on Twitter.\n He added that Secretary of the Interior Dr. Olga Sanchez Cordero will represent him at the daily morning briefings.\n Mexico is one of 17 countries in the world that has reported more than 1 million Covid-19 cases. Newly confirmed deaths and cases have risen steadily throughout the country since early October, with recent daily numbers some of the highest since the beginning the pandemic.\n According to Johns Hopkins University, Mexico has recorded at least 1,752,347 Covid-19 cases and 149,084 people have died from the virus in the country.\n In hardest-hit Mexico City, nearly 30 public hospitals report they have reached 100% percent capacity, and many others are approaching that mark. The city's Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has urged residents to not go out unless absolutely necessary.\n In December, Mexico City and the state of Mexico were placed into \"red level,\" the highest measure on the country's stoplight alert system for Covid-19 restrictions. The tighter measures included the closure of indoor dining, with only essential sectors like transport, energy, health and construction remaining open.\n Lopez Obrador, who rarely wears a mask, has faced widespread criticism over his handling of the pandemic.\n Mexico has one of the lowest testing rates of any major country around the world and tests are often expensive and difficult to come by.",

        "body_text": "Many once-loyal members of Mar-a-Lago are leaving because they no longer want to have any connection to former President Donald Trump, according to the author of the definitive book about the resort.\n \"It's a very dispirited place,\" Laurence Leamer, historian and author of \"Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump's Presidential Palace,\" told MSNBC host Alex Witt on \"Weekends with Alex Witt\" Saturday. He said members are \"not concerned about politics and they said the food is no good.\"\n Leamer said he spoke to a number of former members who \"silently walked out\" after Trump left office.\n Disgruntled members might lead to a smaller paycheck for Trump. When Trump was president, many people paid up to $200,000 for Mar-a-Lago memberships, Leamer pointed out, and he said they don't think they'll continue paying that price.\n Mar-a-Lago has long been ridiculed by critics as a stodgy, stuffy club filled with Trump memorabilia -- some of it fake. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel on Friday recounted a visit to the resort just before Trump became president.\n \"You could not possibly exaggerate how comical it is,\" Kimmel said on The Ringer's \"The Bill Simmons Podcast.\" \"Everyone there is 100 years old.\"\n Kimmel told Simmons he went to the resort about six years ago to have dinner with Howard Stern, who lived near the property at the time. He described the Mar-a-Lago attendees as \"hunched-over people who are eating soft food\" and he said the place is covered in Trump photos.\n \"It was just quiet and a terrible place,\" Kimmel said. \"And now he lives in this terrible place.\"\n Trump's hotels and hospitality companies were hit particularly hard during the coronavirus pandemic, but sales at the Mar-a-Lago resort increased over the last year, from $21.4 million to $24.2 million. In 2019, the former president transferred his permanent residence to the Florida resort from Trump Tower in New York. But questions remain about whether he'll be allowed to live there permanently, because it may violate his 1993 agreement with the town of Palm Beach.\n \"Even here, people don't like him,\" Leamer said, referring to residents of Palm Beach -- many of whom voted for Trump in hopes of lower taxes and a booming stock market. \"It's just another measure of how his power has declined.\"",

It plans to complete the closures and sales by the end of March.\n Godiva will keep its stores open across Europe, Middle East and Greater China. The company did not disclose information on how many employees would be let go because of the closures.\n Less than two years ago, Godiva was planning a massive expansion by getting into the cafe business. The chocolatier opened its first cafe in the United States in New York City in April 2019 and announced that it planned on opening 10 more cafes in New York and more than 400 across the United States. It was part of a plan to open 2,000 new cafes around the world.\n But that plan never came to fruition. Godiva relied heavily on mall traffic, which has been plummeting even before the pandemic. The chocolatier's sales are largely driven by online purchases and purchases through Godiva's grocery, club and retail partners.\n This change comes during a time when Covid has hit dozens of underperforming businesses. The retail apocalypse in particular has come for restaurants, mall stores, businesses that rely on impulse shopping and luxury retailers.",

        "title": "Trump adviser says former President not currently considering launching a third party ",
        "body_text": "Former President Donald Trump remains committed to reelecting Republicans and is not currently considering launching a third party, a senior Trump adviser said Sunday while noting that things could change.\n Jason Miller, who had served as a senior campaign adviser to Trump, said that the former President \"has made clear his goal is to win back the House and Senate for Republicans in 2022. There's nothing that's actively being planned regarding an effort outside of that.\"\n But, Miller maintained, \"it's completely up to Republican senators if this is something that becomes more serious\" -- a reference to Trump's upcoming Senate impeachment trial.\n Multiple Trump advisers confirmed to CNN last week that he was contemplating launching a third party, but those advisers dismissed the idea as not serious. A separate adviser noted to CNN Sunday evening that Trump has talked about creating a third party for decades.\n The path in the Senate to convict Trump is extremely slim.\n A growing number of Republicans are expressing confidence that the party will acquit the former President on a charge that he incited the deadly insurrection aimed at stopping President Joe Biden's electoral win.\n After Democratic leaders announced they would kick off the process to begin the impeachment trial, Republicans grew sharply critical about the proceedings -- and made clear that they saw virtually no chance that at least 17 Republicans would join with 50 Democrats to convict Trump and also bar him from ever running for office again.\n In interviews with more than a dozen GOP senators, the consensus was clear: Most Republicans are likely to acquit Trump, and only a handful are truly at risk of flipping to convict the former President -- unless more evidence emerges or the political dynamics within their party dramatically change.\n And the GOP arguments are now coming into sharper focus, claiming the proceedings are unconstitutional to try a former President and contending that the trial is moving on too short of a time frame to give due process to Trump, claims that Democrats resoundingly reject. But those arguments, Republicans believe, will allow them a way out of convicting Trump without endorsing his conduct in the run up to the deadly mob that ransacked the Capitol on January 6.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Ted Barrett and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Foreign companies are giving up on the United States and betting big on China, report says",
        "body_text": "Foreign companies are turning their backs on the United States, taking advantage of China's booming economy and superior management of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Direct investment in the US by foreign companies plummeted 49% to $134 billion last year, according to a report released Sunday by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. By contrast, foreign direct investment in China grew by 4% to $163 billion in 2020.\n 2020 marked the first year in history that foreign direct investment in China overtook that of the US, according to the UN. China is now the world's largest recipient of foreign companies' investments.\n Although Covid-19 was a large factor in foreign direct investment tumbling in the US -- and most places around the world -- the drop-off in foreign companies' American investments began well before the pandemic.\n After hitting a high of $440 billion in 2015, according to the US Commerce Department, foreign investment in the US has been on a sharp downward slide. Former President Donald Trump's go-it-alone trade policies hurt foreign investment -- particularly from China, which represented the sharpest drop in US investment over the past several years. Growing economic uncertainty around the globe also contributed to the decline.\n Last year, decline in foreign direct investment into the US was most prominent in wholesale trade, financial services and manufacturing, the report said. International mergers and acquisitions, as well as sales of US assets to foreign investors, fell by 41%.\n Meanwhile, China's explosive economic growth -- and quick recovery from the pandemic -- helped foreign investment there soar. China's economy grew 2.3% last year, when most of the world's major economies shrank. The country enforced stringent lockdown and population tracking policies intended to contain the virus, and set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for major infrastructure projects to fuel economic growth.\n China's ability to control the spread of the virus \"helped stabilize investment after the early lockdown,\" the report noted.\n Foreign direct investment to India has similarly skyrocketed, from less than $25 billion in 2014 -- before Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power -- to $57 billion last year, according to the UN report. Much of that growth was brought about by policies that enabled global brands like Ikea and Uniqlo to open up stores, as well as Modi's signature \"Make in India\" campaign to grow the country's manufacturing base.\n That helped India's foreign direct investment soar 13% last year.\n Most economies weren't so lucky. Foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom and Italy fell by almost 100%. Russia's foreign direct investment fell 96%, Germany's sank 61% and Brazil's plunged by 50%. Australia, France, Canada and Indonesia -- all among the top foreign direct investment recipients in 2019 -- also fell by double digits.\n Overall, foreign direct investment tumbled 42% last year to the lowest level since the 1990s -- and 30% below the lowest level reached during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.\n The attractiveness of the US as a safe and robust place for foreign companies to invest has been one of the more powerful driving forces behind America's economic growth over the past several decades. But the UN said the circumstances stopping the flow of foreign direct investment to the US and other countries will remain in place this year.\n \"The effects of the pandemic on investment will linger,\" James Zhan, director of UNCTAD's investment division, said in a statement. \"Investors are likely to remain cautious in committing capital to new overseas productive assets.\"",

        "body_text": "On the surface, Wuhan bustles like a city that has never known a paralyzing 76-day lockdown.\n At dawn, market vendors busily unload fresh fruits and vegetables. Office workers fill popular eateries during their lunch break. As dusk falls, elderly couples descend on the city's parks, practicing dance moves by the Yangtze River. Red lanterns have been erected around the city in anticipation of the Lunar New Year celebrations.\n A year has passed since the central Chinese city of 11 million people was placed under the world's first coronavirus lockdown on January 23. At least 3,869 Wuhan residents eventually died from the virus, which has since claimed more than two million lives around the globe.\n The world was stunned when flights, trains and buses leaving Wuhan were canceled, highways were blocked and people were ordered to stay in their homes, relying on officials and volunteers for daily necessities. Initially, it was difficult for patients, families and even some healthcare workers to reach hospitals.\n But the Chinese government has since heralded those drastic steps as crucial to curbing the initial outbreak, and similar measures have now been enforced in countries around the world -- with some cities outside China undergoing multiple lockdowns.\n In that context, Wuhan has become a success story in taming the virus. It has not reported a local coronavirus infection for months.\n On December 31, as millions of people in other countries spent New Year's Eve in the confinement of another lockdown, Wuhan's residents packed glittering streets to celebrate the arrival of 2021 with a midnight countdown.\n Today, residents speak proudly of the resilience and strength of their city, and the efforts they made to ward off Covid-19.\n But the severe measures also came at a huge personal cost to residents, and despite the apparent return to normal life, deep emotional scars haunt the city.\n Some residents who lost loved ones to the virus are still living in grief, angry at the government for its early missteps in preventing people from knowing facts that could have saved lives.\n Yang Min, 50, still wonders if her daughter would be alive had she been told that coronavirus was infectious just four days earlier.\n Three days later, the night before authorities finally admitted the virus is transmittable from person to person on January 20, Yang's daughter developed a high fever. She was transferred to another hospital, before eventually ending up in Jinyintan Hospital, a designated facility for coronavirus patients. She died there on February 6.\n Yang believes her daughter caught the virus in hospital, and blames the government for not warning the public about the severity and true nature of the outbreak earlier. \"If I knew there was an infectious disease, I wouldn't send my child (to hospital for cancer treatment),\" Yang said. \"I sent her to the hospital for life, not death.\"\n While tending to her daughter, Yang also caught the virus. Her husband didn't tell Yang that their daughter had died until she had recovered herself, fearing the news would devastate her.\n Yang accused the government of covering up the severity of the initial outbreak, and says she has met local officials several times to demand accountability. \"I was told by the street and district leaders that (the government) did not cover up the pandemic. (They said they) released an online notice on December 31,\" she said.\n On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a statement that reported the discovery of a cluster of \"pneumonia\" cases. But it claimed there was no sign of \"human-to-human transmission.\"\n Around the same time, authorities silenced healthcare workers who tried to sound the alarm of the virus -- including Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang, who was punished by police for \"spreading rumors\" and later died of Covid-19. The suppression likely led to unnecessary cross-infections inside hospitals, as well as in families and communities, according to health experts.\n In an interview with state broadcaster CCTV on January 27, Wuhan's then-mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted his government did not disclose information on the coronavirus \"in a timely fashion.\" He said the city's management of the epidemic was \"not good enough\" and offered to resign if that would help the efforts to control the crisis.\n Two weeks later, amid widespread public criticism of the authorities' handling of the outbreak, several senior local officials were removed from office, but Zhou stayed on. Last week, state media reported that Zhou had resigned due to an unspecified \"work arrangement.\"\n Yang wants all officials involved in the early handling of Wuhan's crisis to be punished, and for the truth to be told over their actions.\n \"I want to hold them accountable. I need to ask for an explanation. If there's no explanation, there's no justice,\" she said. \"To seek truth for (my daughter) ... is the best way to remember her.\"\n Yang is not the only bereaved family member demanding justice. Zhang Hai, who lost his father to the coronavirus, spent much of last year trying to sue the government for compensation over his father's death.\n Taking the government to court is a rare -- and often futile -- step in China, where the judiciary is firmly controlled by the ruling Communist Party.\n Still, Zhang was undeterred. He filed a lawsuit against the governments of Wuhan and Hubei province in June, but a local court rejected the case. He turned to a higher-level court two months later, only to be dismissed again. In November, he submitted a complaint \u2014 seen by CNN \u2014 to have his case heard at China's highest judicial organ, the Supreme People's Court, but has received no reply so far.\n \"'Ruling the country by law' and 'everyone is equal before the law' have long been our country's slogans. But so far, I haven't seen any evidence of that,\" he said.\n Like Yang, Zhang blames the Wuhan government for withholding the truth about the coronavirus.\n On January 17, a day after Yang sent her daughter for cancer treatment, Zhang brought his father Zhang Lifa to a Wuhan hospital to treat his leg fracture. The surgery went smoothly, but his father was infected with Covid-19 while recovering in hospital. He died on February 1, aged 76.\n \"I'm feeling very emotional, and at the same time, my heart is filled with anger,\" Zhang said, standing by the water in a Wuhan park -- it was the last place that the father and son visited together, before going to the hospital.\n \"If the Wuhan government hadn't concealed (the severity of the outbreak), my father wouldn't have left this world,\" he said.\n Zhang's father was an army veteran who worked on China's nuclear weapons program -- and suffered long-term health effects because of his work. \"My father is a patriot. He sacrificed his youth and his health for the country,\" Zhang said.\n \"And I'm a patriot, too. By speaking out and seeking accountability, I'm conducting an act of patriotism. No country, no political party can be perfect. In Wuhan, officials covered up (the outbreak) and went unpunished. By punishing them, I believe it's doing a service to our country and our party,\" he said.\n Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said last month that accusations China covered up the epidemic were \"simply groundless.\"\n Wang said: \"There's a clear timeline of China's effort to fight Covid-19, which is open and transparent. At the earliest time possible we reported the epidemic to the WHO, identified the pathogen and shared its genome sequence with the world, and we shared our information and containment experience of the virus with other countries and regions in a timely manner.\"\n Facing growing criticism and blame from countries around the world, Beijing has unleashed its army of propagandists and censors to reshape the narrative around its coronavirus response as a victorious one from the start, and suppress any voices that stray from the official line.\n China's subsequent success in containing the virus has been used as proof to deny that any mistakes were made in the early stages. Wang said: \"Faced with the once-in-a-century pandemic, can such achievements ever be made by covering up the truth? The answer is simple enough. China's achievements in fighting the pandemic are the best response to the fallacy of China concealing the virus.\"\n Authorities have detained citizen journalists who documented the harsh reality of life in Wuhan during the height of the outbreak. One of them, Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was sentenced to four years in jail last month for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"\n The story of Wuhan, by the official narrative, has become one of heroism, solidarity and triumph.\n At a convention center in the city, which previously served as a makeshift quarantine site for Covid-19 patients, a massive exhibition opened in October, to commemorate the city's struggle against the coronavirus. It is titled \"Putting People and Lives First -- A Special Exhibition on the Fight Against Covid-19 Pandemic,\" and features more than 1,000 items reminding visitors of the effort and sacrifice healthcare workers, soldiers, volunteers, officials and citizens made to defeat the virus. The Party's unfaltering leadership over the fight is highlighted throughout the exhibit, but there is no mention of any mistakes the government had made.\n \"The propaganda machine is on full force to promote the government's success -- the (hardship) is all over and we can now sing and dance in celebration of peace,\" Zhang Hai said. \"But the so-called victory was achieved by sacrificing the people.\"\n In the heart of Wuhan's city center, there is one unmistakeable reminder that not everything has recovered from the coronavirus: the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where a cluster of coronavirus cases was first detected, propelling the site to international notoriety.\n Today, the market -- with its name removed from the gates -- remains shut behind metal fences, its future uncertain.\n Xiao Chuan'an, who sells sugar cane near the market, remembers the lockdown with dread. As restrictions kicked in, Xiao, who comes from a neighboring city, was trapped in Wuhan for more than two months. In the days before the lockdown was imposed, her daughter had kept pleading with her to go home, but Xiao didn't want to abandon her stock of sugar cane. In the end, she was unable to sell any of it -- as the lockdown dragged on, her sugar cane all rotted.\n \"I really washed my face with tears every day. It was the most tormenting time, and I was so sad and scared to death,\" she said.\n But the strict measures apparently worked. By mid-March, the number of new infections had slowed to a trickle from thousands per day at its worst in February. Residents were allowed to return to work. Public buses and underground trains resumed service. Finally, on April 8, the lockdown was officially lifted.\n Chinese authorities have largely been able to avoid a Wuhan-style city-wide lockdown during subsequent local flareups, by resorting to mass testing, extensive contact tracing and more targeted restrictions.\n As the pandemic spreas, China's overall success in containing the virus, especially when contrasted with the chaotic and deadly failures to do so in countries like the US and UK, has won wide domestic support for Beijing.\n A year on from the lockdown, Xiao's business has resumed outside the closed market. It isn't as good as pre-pandemic times, but Xiao remains hopeful. \"Wuhan will definitely be getting better and better,\" she said. \"The people in Wuhan are very tough and doing great.\"\n But the virus can make a comeback after a long respite. Earlier this month, tens of millions of people in northern China were placed under strict lockdowns, similar to what Wuhan underwent, after hundreds of people were infected in the country's worst outbreak in months.\n Authorities are also rushing to build a massive quarantine camp that can house more than 4,000 people, reminiscent of earlier efforts undertaken in Wuhan, where several medical facilities, including a 1,000-bed hospital, were built from scratch in just 10 days.\n The festival typically sees tens of millions of Chinese traveling home to reunite with family. But authorities have discouraged people from traveling this year, requiring those returning to rural areas to produce a negative Covid-19 test taken within 7 days and a 14-day quarantine upon arrival.\n \"During the early stage of the Wuhan lockdown, (the government) was at a loss of how to deal with issues concerning residents' livelihood, it was an utter mess. I'm sure everybody hasn't forgot about it,\" he wrote in a post on Weibo last week.\n \"Now, after so long, no new case has been identified and Wuhan has begun to recover for a while. The streets are full of people. I just feel that all those efforts made at that time were worthwhile,\" he said.\n David Culver reported from Wuhan, Nectar Gan wrote from Hong Kong.",

        "body_text": "Tom Frieden (@DrTomFrieden),the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, oversaw responses to the H1N1 influenza, Ebola and Zika epidemics during the Obama administration. He is president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, and a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. Amanda McClelland is the senior vice-president of the Prevent Epidemics team at Resolve to Save Lives. A registered nurse, she has more than 20 years of experience in primary health care, global health and responding to natural disasters, conflict and epidemics in more than 15 countries including the West Africa Ebola response. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion at CNN.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been well-intentioned calls to honor our health care workers. But to truly honor them, we need to keep them safe. Keeping health workers safe is not just a moral imperative -- it is a practical one as well. Our lives depend on it.\n The risks of this pandemic unfortunately continue a long-term trend of failing to protect those who care for us. During outbreaks of drug-resistant tuberculosis, Ebola, and MERS, to name a few, we have applauded the dedication of nurses and other front-line health workers while sending them into battle inadequately protected. Tragically, those in frequent contact with the victims of epidemics often become victims themselves.\n What's more, infected health care providers can infect vulnerable patients. Transmission in health care facilities undermines confidence in health care, because it exacerbates both the spread of infectious diseases and interrupts essential care.\n We know how to keep our health workforce safe. We simply haven't done it effectively or consistently. Hospitals and health centers often lack the policies, facilities, equipment, and procedures in place to prevent the spread of infection, or often ignore them even if they are available. The result is avoidable infection and the incapacitation or death of medical staff we need to provide life-saving care -- especially now when our hospitals are reaching maximum capacity.\n Our organization Resolve to Save Lives has studied how to improve safety for nurses and other health workers. Protecting our Front Line: How to Keep Health Care Workers Safe lays out the problems confronting frontline health care workers and makes recommendations for governments and health systems, and those funding them. There are four key tasks we must put into place now and fully implement in the next five years:\n Donors and development partners also have an important role to play in increasing support for infection prevention and control, including PPE and clean water for facilities. All health funding programs should automatically include assessments of health worker and health care safety. Funding for infection prevention and control and WASH must be embedded in a wide range of investments, including both health-specific initiatives and broader development programs.\n Nurses and other health care workers deserve to have their safety assured. When health workers are at risk, patients and the entire health system suffer. There is already a global shortage of health care professionals, and without focused action, this shortage will worsen. We have a collective responsibility to protect the vital resource of medical personnel by providing these workers with the standards, tools, support and training to provide the safe and life-saving care we all need.",

        "title": "Transportation officials weigh options to enforce Biden's mask requirement for travelers ",
        "body_text": "The normal rulemaking process can take months, at least, to complete, so officials are believed to be considering emergency actions that could take effect much sooner. Biden signed an executive order Thursday mandating interstate travelers wear a mask, and on his first day in office, he challenged Americans to wear masks for 100 days to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\n Agencies are considering enforcement measures for the executive order such as civil penalties for air travelers from the Federal Aviation Administration, a broader order from the Department of Transportation applying to multiple modes of transit, and a Transportation Security Administration directive, the sources said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive and initial discussions among agency officials and with the transportation industry.\n Several of the individuals described the conversations as preliminary and noted it was possible the approaches of each agency could change.\n A possible outcome is a patchwork of measures from different agencies that oversee rules for different types of travel such as trains, buses, airplanes, public transportation and ferries. In addition to the FAA, the Transportation Department includes the Federal Railroad Administration overseeing trains, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration overseeing buses, and the Federal Transit Administration, which is involved in transit system oversight. The Coast Guard regulates ferry safety.\n Federal action could provide greater consistency and more stringent penalties, and Biden directed multiple federal agencies to \"immediately take action.\"\n Mask requirements currently stem from local government orders governing terminals and airports, plus rules from individual companies and operators outlining passenger conduct.\n The project comes as Biden's administration is still taking shape. Nominees to lead the Transportation, Labor, Homeland Security and Health departments have not yet been confirmed by the Senate. The nominee for transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, testified at his confirmation hearing that once he takes office, he wants to look at \"all relevant authorities\" to enforce mask wearing. Some agencies are currently led by senior career officials, and the administration's handpicked policy officials are just settling into their new jobs.\n One approach under consideration is enforcing mask-wearing with civil penalties the FAA is allowed to assess against disruptive or non-compliant passengers, according to one of the sources familiar with the discussions. An early conversation included consideration of fines up to $20,000, according to one of the sources familiar with the discussions who stressed it was all preliminary. Agency attorneys were working on the issue, another source said. Two sources said the FAA could act within approximately two weeks.\n The FAA policy could be accompanied with a formal or informal recommendation that airlines include the mask rule in the pre-flight safety instructions and demonstrations conducted by flight attendants, according to one of the sources.\n At the same time, the Department of Transportation is said to be considering issuing a mask directive that would apply to multiple modes of transportation, according to two sources. It is not clear what form of action the DOT might use and when it could take effect.\n Two sources familiar with the matter said Sunday that the Transportation Security Administration was in touch with industry officials as it considers how to act.\n Spokespeople for the FAA and DOT declined to comment and referred CNN to the White House for comment on the plans. The White House did not comment when contacted by CNN.\n The TSA told CNN in a statement it is \"exploring how the agency, in conjunction with the DOT, FAA, CDC and TSA's security partners (i.e., airports, airlines), can work collaboratively to enforce the President's travel order for travelers to wear masks while in airports, on planes, trains, ferries, intercity buses, mass transit and passenger rail systems.\"\n In the industry, there is an appetite for action. Flight attendants and other transportation employees find themselves on the front lines as tense situations have in some cases turned rowdy, and even violent, when a passenger refuses to mask up.\n Airlines for America, representing the largest US carriers, has said on several occasions it backs a federal mandate. It has asked the administration to limit the scope of an order to only passengers, citing other requirements for crew members.\n The National Air Carrier Association, whose members include Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air, said Friday the forthcoming rules are \"a critical and long-overdue step to ensure the safety of passengers, crewmembers and those working at airports and to eliminate any lingering uncertainty regarding mask requirements in commercial aviation.\"\n The Association of Flight Attendants, a union which had urged the Trump administration to act last spring, called masks \"vitally important\" in the cabin \"where proper social distancing is not an option.\"\n FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, a Trump nominee serving a five-year term, has said he believes passengers should wear face masks but has not previously required it.\n He did recently sign an order directing FAA officials to crack down on passengers who do not follow flight attendant instructions and are disruptive in flight, including not abiding by an airline's rule to wear a mask. The agency noted it can fine passengers as much as $35,000 for some violations.\n The amounts of fines the FAA may levy for various violations are laid out in agency guidelines. Alleged violators may be able to negotiate down to a lower amount.\n The most recent version of the guidelines -- amended earlier this year -- stipulates a fine of between $10,000 and $20,000 for a passenger who is \"posing (an) imminent threat to safety of (an) aircraft or the collective safety of other individuals.\"\n CNN's Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Jim Acosta: I've never seen Trump this alone",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump spent his last moments as President sad and alone, according to Jim Acosta, who led CNN's coverage of Trump during his presidency.\n In his farewell to Washington on Wednesday morning, Trump greeted a small crowd of about 200 at Joint Base Andrews before he boarded Air Force One with family and the press, including Acosta.\n \"It was sort of a sad and pathetic sight,\" Acosta told CNN's Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter on \"Reliable Sources\" on Sunday. \"I've never seen him this alone the entire time he was at the level of presidential politics.\"\n Acosta, now CNN's lead domestic reporter, said Trump may have had a different outcome at the end had he not instigated a riot that laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6 -- one of several attempts in the waning days of his presidency to overturn the election results. After the siege, Trump lost whatever remaining credibility he had with many of his supporters, according to Acosta.\n \"Essentially what we saw was the undoing of the Trump presidency,\" Acosta said of Trump's final days. \"What we saw the President build over the course of four or five years out on the campaign trail and over at the White House just sort of of unraveled at the end.\"\n After the Capitol riot, Trump was banned from Twitter, and he has largely remained out of public view save for a few short video messages and his last address to supporters at Joint Base Andrews. It's an unusual quiet period for Trump, who has relished the spotlight for decades.\n Outside the White House, the daily media scrutiny of Trump will almost certainly fade. Stelter noted major media outlets, including Fox, are not stationing reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, to cover Trump.\n Acosta expects Trump won't be able to remain silent for long.\n \"I think it is temporary,\" he told Stelter. The populist political forces that sent Trump to the White House \"have the potential to come back in the days to come. I do think Trump is going to lead at least a fringe movement in this country.\"\n But with record-low popularity in the last days of office, Trump probably doesn't have the ability to lead a major political party and win back the presidency, Acosta noted -- and that's if the Senate in its upcoming impeachment trial fails to convict Trump and prevent him from running for office again.\n Trump likes to compare himself to Grover Cleveland, who remains the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms. But Grover Cleveland was more popular than Trump when he won his second term, Acosta noted.\n \"Trump isn't going to be able to do that right now,\" he predicted.\n Acosta had a combative relationship with the Trump White House that at one point took away his credentials -- a decision that CNN successfully sued to overturn in court.\n Although Trump is out of office, Acosta still calls him \"lord of the lies\" and believes he should not be ignored.\n \"While he's still licking his wounds down in Mar-a-Lago, he poses a threat to this country,\" Acosta said.\n \"This is not a time to put away our fact checkers in some sort of box on a shelf. They're going to be needed to fact-check this movement. Trump may be going away, but Trumpism is not.\"",

        "title": "White House holds call with senators to drum up bipartisan support for Covid-19 relief package",
        "body_text": "Money for vaccine distribution was viewed as the top priority on a Sunday call that President Joe Biden's top economic official held with a group of senators to discuss the administration's proposed Covid-19 relief package, according to one person on the call.\n Sunday's meeting, which came as the White House pushes for bipartisan support of the $1.9 trillion proposal, was described as productive, according to the person, who said that members wanted more details and evidence of where the money was needed most. The person said there was a desire to ensure that stimulus checks are targeted to those who need it most.\n Coined the American Rescue Plan, Biden has deemed the proposal a top legislative priority in the early days of his term. Brian Deese, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, hosted the call with as many as 16 senators -- eight Democrats and eight Republicans were invited.\n The White House still wants to pursue the $1.9 trillion package as one big package, rather than splitting it up, the person on the call added. That means the Democrats may ultimately choose to use the budget reconciliation process where they can advance legislation with 51 Senate votes since such a measure cannot be filibustered.\n A separate source told CNN that the call was a \"great\" first meeting and this bipartisan group will continue to work together, discussing a pathway forward on another relief package. That source said everyone agreed the number one need is quickly producing and efficiently distributing a vaccine across the country.\n The source also said the call was about an hour and 15 minutes, with White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients and director of legislative affairs Louisa Terrell also joining.\n \"President Biden and his advisors will continue to engage and consult bipartisan groups of lawmakers, including today, to make the case why urgent action is needed to get relief to hard-hit communities and families and more resources to public health officials so we can ramp up vaccinations,\" one White House official told CNN.\n GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, however, said in a statement to CNN Sunday evening, \"It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope.\"\n \"That concern, which I had prior to the briefing, remains a concern of mine,\" she said of the bill's size.\n Collins added that she will, \"suggest that our bipartisan, bicameral group get together and see if we could come up with a more targeted package that would address unmet needs that we are experiencing now.\"\n CNN has reported that Biden's stimulus proposal already faces Republican objections, and Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans stall their efforts.\n Pressed earlier Sunday on whether the President will hold out for bipartisanship agreement to pass the package amid growing reports of Republican unease, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the administration does want to see the proposal passed quickly, but that engaging both sides is not the \"enemy\" of speed.\n \"We're reaching out to people,\" Klain said. \"I don't think bipartisanship and speed are enemies of one another. The need is urgent.\"\n Deese told reporters Friday that the goal was to be \"reaching out to members of Congress from both parties to make the case for the rescue plan and to engage with them (and) understand their concerns,\" a mandate from Biden himself.\n Among the Republican senators invited to join the call is Mitt Romney of Utah, who told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" earlier Sunday that while he wants to \"hear what the White House has to say\" on its proposal, he's worried about the prospect of the US borrowing more money \"for things that may not be absolutely necessary.\"\n But the senator noted that \"Republicans like me have demonstrated (that) we're open to compromise\" and have \"demonstrated a capacity to compromise.\"\n Responding later on the same program to the Utah senator's comments, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, told Bash, \"Well, I don't know what the word compromise means. I know that working families are living today in more economic desperation than since the Great Depression. And if Republicans are willing to work with us to address that crisis, welcome. Let's do it.\"\n But Democrats, he said, cannot \"wait weeks and weeks and months and months to go forward.\" Sanders was not among the senators invited onto the White House call, according to CNN's tally.\n Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has voiced support for Democrats using reconciliation to pass major parts of the relief package if Republicans stand in the way.\n \"We're going to use reconciliation -- that is 50 votes in the Senate, plus the vice president -- to pass legislation desperately needed by working families in this country right now,\" he said, shrugging off the possibility of Republicans not supporting the package.\n CNN's Lauren Fox, Phil Mattingly and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The US just marked 25 million Covid-19 cases. Now it's a race between vaccines and variants",
        "body_text": "It took just over a year for the US to go from one to 25 million coronavirus infections.\n That's an average of about 67,934 new infections every day, or an average of one new infection every 1.2 seconds since January 21, 2020.\n As infections kept soaring this weekend, so did the death toll. As of Sunday, more than 417,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n The US death toll could reach 569,000 by May 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation -- even though \"42,800 lives will be saved by the projected vaccine rollout.\"\n While some states have reported recent dips in their daily Covid-19 numbers, new coronavirus variants have many scientists worried.\n \"It is, first of all, good news to see that curve bend down a little. We're still at a very high level of infections,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n \"But I am very worried about whether we're going to be able to sustain this or not. If we move quickly on vaccinations...then we can keep that curve heading down. But if the variants take hold first, that curve will turn back up. And things will get much worse,\" he said.\n \"So this is a race. Obviously, I hope we win.\"\n A coronavirus variant called B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom, is one of the more concerning strains.\n It's been detected in at least 22 US states, according to data posted Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n The CDC has warned this strain appeared to be more easily transmissible and that the US could see \"rapid growth\" of its spread in early 2021.\n A UK report released Friday said there's \"a realistic possibility\" that B.1.1.7 has a higher death rate than other variants.\n \"The data is mounting -- and some of it I can't share -- that clearly supports that B.1.1.7 is causing more severe illness and increased death,\" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"Already we know this variant has increased transmission, and so this is more very bad news.\"\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it's certainly possibly this strain could be more harmful.\n \"We need to assume now that what has been circulating dominantly in the UK does have a certain degree of increase in what we call virulence, namely the power of the virus to cause more damage including death,\" Fauci said told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n He noted that the research is still evolving.\n \"The data that came out was after they had been saying all along that it did not appear to be more deadly, so that's where we got that information,\" Fauci said.\n The director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins said Saturday it's still too soon to tell if the B.1.1.7 variant is deadlier, saying the data is \"very preliminary.\"\n \"It looks as if, if you look at 1,000 people who got infected with Covid-19, generally about 1%, 10 of them, would die of it. Maybe with this virus, it would be 13 instead of 10,\" Collins told MSNBC. \"That's a small difference.\"\n He added that increased mortality could be a \"consequence of the fact that the UK health system is really overwhelmed.\"\n \"That has an effect also on mortality,\" Collins added.\n In the US, Washington state health officials said they found the variant in testing samples in the state.\n \"We're now in that second half of fighting this pandemic,\" Washington Secretary of Health Umair A. Shah said Saturday.\n \"It's very important for us to really double down on our efforts to prevent this strain as well as any strain from taking over, because we want to make sure that transmission does not happen in our state and the best way to do that is prevention, prevention, prevention.\"\n The good news? Studies so far suggest vaccines will also protect against the B.1.1.7 variant.\n And that the same measures that can help prevent coronavirus infections in the past -- wearing masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing -- also fight against variant strains.\n At least two studies suggest another variant -- this one first detected in South Africa -- might be problematic for vaccines.\n In terms of vaccines, Fauci said that variant was \"a little bit more concerning\" than the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the UK.\n \"It looks like it does diminish more ... the efficacy of the vaccine,\" Fauci told \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\n \"But we're still within that cushion level of the vaccines being efficacious against these mutants.\"\n Fauci said research could evolve, and preparations are already being made for the possibility that vaccines might some day need to be modified or upgraded.\n The strain has been found in more than a dozen countries. But so far, it has not been detected in the US, Fauci told \"Face the Nation.\"\n \"What has been looked at thus far, it has not come up on any of the surveillance,\" he said. \"But we need to expand greatly our genomic surveillance.\"\n CDC data shows more than 21.8 million vaccine doses have been administered across the country -- with more than 3.2 million Americans having received both doses.\n Fauci said if Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is authorized for emergency use, the US could see a significant boost in available doses by May. That vaccine only requires one dose, instead of the two necessary for the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines currently being administered.\n \"I would anticipate that within a period of likely no more than two weeks, that the data will be looked at by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board,\" Fauci told MSNBC.\n If the data is strong enough, the next step would be presenting it to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization.\n \"Let's say they do ... get an EUA in February, by the time they get a meaningful amount of doses, it likely will be a month or two following that,\" he said. \"Once they get going into May, June, July, August, then you're going to see a sharp escalation of additional doses of this one-dose vaccine.\"\n Meanwhile, the FDA also told CNN Saturday that if absolutely necessary, \"modest delays\" between first and second doses of the current Covid-19 vaccines are not expected to decrease protection against the virus.\n The agency said it \"recognizes that getting as many people as possible across the country fully immunized will help to curtail the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 and should be a priority.\"\n Previously, the FDA had warned changes to vaccine schedules without appropriate data could put public health at risk.\n The CDC also updated its guidance to say second doses of vaccines may be scheduled up to six weeks after initial doses, if necessary, adding second doses should be administered as close as possible to the recommended interval -- three weeks after the first dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and four weeks for the Moderna vaccine.\n Dr. Vivek Murthy, President Joe Biden's nominee for US Surgeon General, told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that the goal of 100 million doses in the President's first 100 days in office is \"a floor. It's not a ceiling.\"\n Murthy said Biden understands that the larger goal is that \"we've got to vaccinate as many Americans as possible. And that's going to take a lot of work, work dispelling misinformation, working on the supply, increasing distribution channels, and that's some of what the vaccine plan that he announced over the last week is intended to achieve.\"\n Murthy also told Stephanopoulos that Biden's goal of opening most elementary schools in his first 100 days would take a lot of work.\n \"I know how critical it is for schools to get open for parents, for the economy, for all of us,\" Murthy told Stephanopoulos. \"It's going to take a lot of work though.\"\n Schools need clear guidance on how to reopen safely and the resources needed to do it, something many of them don't have, Murthy said.\n \"If we get them the resources and the guidance, I do think that we can get on a path to reopening schools more safely,\" he said.\n However, it will also take getting the background number of cases in communities down, he said, something which everyone needs to be a part of.\n That all comes as the US continues to fight a brutal battle against the virus.\n More than 110,600 Americans are hospitalized with the virus nationwide, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n Los Angeles County -- the epicenter of the state's Covid-19 crisis -- has now surpassed 15,000 Covid-19 deaths, health officials said Saturday.\n And more than 6,800 people remain hospitalized with the virus -- 24% of whom are in the ICU.\n \"While we are seeing some positive data in daily new cases and hospitalizations, we are far from out of the woods,\" Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said.\n \"It is critically important we slow COVID-19 spread to decompress the strain on our healthcare system and save lives.\"\n In Georgia, one health care official described a grim image of the grip of the virus.\n \"We truly are in the darkest days of this pandemic,\" said Dr. Deepak Aggarwal at the Northeast Georgia Medical Center on Saturday night.\n \"We are seeing more than 200 patients per day now, than we normally see at this time of the year. \"\n \"And also, we're dealing with the increasing number of deaths,\" Aggarwal said.\n \"Our system normally deals with less than 10 deaths per month.\" But by January 21, \"we have already had 169 deaths.\"\n CNN's Naomi Thomas, Nadia Kounang, Michael Nedelman, Lauren Mascarenhas, Elizabeth Cohen and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Five people and an unborn child were killed Sunday after an early-morning shooting in Indianapolis' northeast side, police said -- an incident the mayor called \"a mass murder.\"\n A juvenile was also in critical condition after being shot in the incident, which marks Indianapolis' \"largest mass casualty shooting in more than a decade,\" according to Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor.\n IMPD police officers responded to a report of a person shot just before 4 a.m. Upon arrival, police came across \"a juvenile male with apparent gunshot wounds,\" IMPD spokesman Shane Foley told reporters.\n Officers then received information that led them to another residence less than a block away, where they found five people -- including a pregnant woman -- dead with \"apparent gunshot wounds,\" Foley said.\n \"Despite the best lifesaving efforts provided by medical staff, both the female and the unborn child did not survive,\" he added. \"The juvenile male that was shot is expected to survive his injuries.\"\n Marion County chief deputy coroner Alfarena McGinty identified the victims as Kezzie Childs, 42; Raymond Childs, 42; Elijah Childs, 18; Rita Childs, 13; Kiara Hawkins, 19; and Hawkins' baby.\n While IMPD's investigation is in its early stages, Foley said the multiple shooting \"does not appear to be a random act.\"\n As of Sunday afternoon, police said they did not have any named suspects related to the shootings, but that they believed more than one shooter could have been involved.\n \"This morning, one or more individuals perpetrated an act of evil in our city,\" Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett told reporters. \"While we're still learning more about the circumstances that led to this incident, I want to be very clear about something: What happened this morning was not an act of simple gun violence. ... What happened this morning was a mass murder.\"\n Hogsett said he is in contact with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana and the Indianapolis Field Office of the FBI.\n \"Federal law enforcement are coming for them, as I speak. Coming for them today, coming for them tonight, coming for them tomorrow and the day after that. Coming for them as long as it takes to find them,\" Hogsett added.\n CNN's Laura James contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Chile triggers national panic by mistakenly sending tsunami warning after quake",
        "body_text": "Authorities in Chile have expressed regret for spreading panic with a mistaken tsunami warning calling for people to get out of coastal areas following an earthquake in Antarctica.\n On Saturday evening at 8:36 p.m., the country's interior ministry tweeted a warning that a magnitude 7.1 earthquake had struck, 216 kilometers (about 134 miles) northeast of the O'Higgins Chilean scientific base at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In its tweet, the ministry called for coastal regions of Antarctica to be evacuated due to a tsunami risk.\n But the ministry mistakenly sent the message to cellphones across the entire country, urging people to abandon coastal areas.\n \"We want to provide peace of mind to the population, tell them that it is not necessary to evacuate the entire national territory, only the Antarctic base,\" Miguel Ortiz of the ministry's National Emergency Office (ONEMI) told a news conference.\n He said the agency regretted the inconvenience caused by its messages, which he blamed on a technical error. The tsunami warning for Antarctica was later lifted.\n But the clarification came too late to rein in panic. P{eople in coastal cities including La Serena, to the north of Santiago, and Valparaiso, started to leave areas close to the coast after the warning -- until reports stated that it was a false alarm.\n As Chileans were reacting to the warning, a second tremor, of magnitude 5.6, struck the Chile-Argentina border region according to the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences. The tremor measures a depth of 133 km (82.6 miles), and took place 30 km (18.6 miles) east of Santiago.\n No damage was reported from either quake.\n Sernageomin said that following the first quake, 80 people were evacuated from Chile's main base in the Antarctic, the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base on Fildes Peninsula west of King George Island, and 55 more from three other bases, along with five foreign bases.\n The second quake was close to Codelco's Andina and Teniente copper mines and Anglo American PLC's Los Bronces.\n The Chilean mining regulator Sernageomin said that workers, mining operations and facilities had reported no problems after the quake.",

        "title": "White House expected to lift transgender ban in military as early as Monday",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden is expected to repeal former President Donald Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the military as early as Monday, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n The policy, which has been roundly derided by LGBTQ activists as cruel and irrational, was first announced by Trump in July 2017 via Twitter. The ban specifically blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from serving with limited exceptions. It also specifies that individuals without the condition can serve, but only if they do so according to the sex they were assigned at birth.\n The White House declined to comment on the plans. White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said in a statement last week that the administration would lift the ban through an executive action in the early days or weeks of Biden's presidency.\n CBS News was first to report the expected repeal coming Monday.\n While Trump had argued that transgender troops in the military would lead to \"tremendous medical costs and disruption,\" a 2016 Rand Corp. study commissioned by the Defense Department concluded that letting transgender people serve openly would have a \"minimal impact\" on readiness and health care costs.\n The study put the number of transgender people in the military at the time between 1,320 and 6,630. Gender-change surgery is rare in the general population, and the Rand study estimated the possibility of 30 to 140 new hormone treatments a year in the military, with 25 to 130 gender transition-related surgeries among active service members annually.\n The cost could range from $2.4 million and $8.4 million a year, an amount that would represent an \"exceedingly small proportion\" of total health care expenditures, the study found.\n Trump's decision reversed a policy initially approved by the Defense Department under former President Barack Obama, which was still under final review, that would have allowed transgender individuals to openly serve in the military.\n The Trump administration for years had reversed, dropped, removed and withdrawn established LGBTQ protections and had been particularly hostile toward transgender Americans.\n Among its most criticized moves was an effort last year to roll back an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender. A federal judge blocked the repeal over the summer, ruling it had violated a recent Supreme Court decision.\n CNN's Donald Judd, Zachary Cohen, Barbara Starr and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden is planning a busy week of executive action. Here's what you need to know",
        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nPresident Joe Biden is planning a new wave of executive orders and actions this week as he looks to further dismantle many of former President Donald Trump's policies and address a slate of Democratic priorities as quickly as he can.\n The planned moves, which were outlined in a draft calendar document viewed by CNN's Betsy Klein, allow Biden to set his agenda into motion while his administration continues the plodding work of coordinating with Congress on more ambitious policy goals, like a new Covid-19 relief package.\n The orders scheduled for this week build on the 30 executive actions Biden took in his first three days in office, which included halting funding for the construction of Trump's border wall and imposing a mask mandate on federal property. See the full list here.\n While the orders and timing are subject to change, here's a rundown of the executive steps Biden is expected to take this week:\n Billed as \"Buy American\" day, Biden is expected to sign one executive order directing agencies to \"strengthen requirements for procuring goods and services from sources that will support US businesses and workers.\"\n Tuesday focuses on equity, with a list of executive orders that will:\n Create a policing commission and reinstate Obama-era policy on the transfer of military-style equipment to local law enforcement.Establish steps to improve prison conditions and eliminate the use of private prisons.Formally disavow discrimination against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, which, the document says, comes \"particularly in light of rhetoric around the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n Biden also plans to sign a memorandum directing Housing and Urban Development to take steps to promote equitable housing politics.\n The climate crisis will come into view on Wednesday with an executive order initiating regulatory actions to \"combat climate change domestically and elevates climate change as a national security priority,\" along with the re-establishment of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.\n Biden is also due to sign a a memorandum on scientific integrity.\n Health care is set be the the theme on Thursday with Biden set to rescind the Mexico City Policy and review the Title X \"Domestic Gag Rule.\" There may also be an executive action on Medicaid, as well as the initiation of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.\n Finally, Biden is expected to center on immigration on Friday with executive orders on regional migration and border processing, the US refugee policy and the establishment of a family reunification task force, as well as an executive order directing immediate review of the Public Charge Rule.\n Trump's second Senate impeachment trial is scheduled to begin on February 9 after Senate leaders reached a deal to push it back, giving Trump's legal team more time to prepare and Senate Democrats a chance to consider Covid-19 legislation and to confirm Biden's Cabinet.\n CNN's Capitol Hill team reports:\n House Democrats will formally walk over the single article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Monday evening, but the agreement between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will push back the substance of the trial until February. Without an agreement, the trial would have started the afternoon after the article was transmitted to the Senate.\n \"We have made good progress in our efforts to determine the timing and structure of the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump,\" Schumer said Friday evening announcing the trial schedule, saying it would begin the week of February 8.\n Read more here.\n As preparations for the Senate trial ramp up, Biden's team is busy attempting to build bipartisan support for their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package -- something Biden has established as a top legislative priority in the early days of his term.\n The relief package includes a $1,400 bump for stimulus checks, more aid for the unemployed, additional support for small businesses, and increased funding for vaccinations among other items.\n CNN has reported that Biden's stimulus proposal already faces Republican objections. As a result, Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans stall their efforts.\n Pressed earlier Sunday on whether the President will hold out for bipartisanship agreement to pass the package amid growing reports of Republican unease, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the administration does want to see the proposal passed quickly, but that engaging both sides is not the \"enemy\" of speed.\n \"We're reaching out to people,\" Klain said. \"I don't think bipartisanship and speed are enemies of one another. The need is urgent.\"\n Biden's top economic official held a call with a group of senators Sunday afternoon to discuss the Covid-19 relief package, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n \"President Biden and his advisors will continue to engage and consult bipartisan groups of lawmakers, including today, to make the case why urgent action is needed to get relief to hard-hit communities and families and more resources to public health officials so we can ramp up vaccinations,\" one White House official told CNN.\n The state Republican Party voted this weekend to publicly punish Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, former Sen. Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain, all of whom opposed Trump's efforts to overturn Biden's victory.",

        "title": "Larry King was one of pop culture's favorite newsmen",
        "body_text": "Larry King's death on Saturday was a significant loss for the media world. The longtime CNN host was an industry icon right down to his signature suspenders.\n And it was also a major loss for pop culture.\n King wasn't just a talk show host on CNN for more than a quarter of a century. He was utterly ubiquitous, popping up on TV shows and in movie cameos throughout his long career. His oversized glasses and inquisitive style could be found in appearances in \"The Simpsons,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" and even TikTok, of all places.\n King was simply one of pop culture's favorite interviewers and newsmen.\n His first notable appearance came in 1984's \"Ghostbusters\" when King is included in a montage of the Ghostbusters taking down ghouls throughout New York City.\n \"Hi, this is Larry King, the phone-in topic today: ghosts and ghostsbusting,\" he says. \"The controversy builds, more sightings are reported, some maintain that these professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it of it all.\"\n King had plenty of other film appearances throughout his career, almost always playing himself. But not in the animated film \"Shrek 2,\" where he was the voice an ugly stepsister. (He also played her in two subsequent Shrek sequels.)\n The stepsister works at \"The Poison Apple\" bar and helps the king of Far Far Away find an assassin that can take out the ogre Shrek.\n \"Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fella that can handle a job like that and frankly he don't like to be disturbed,\" says King, in his booming baritone.\n \"Shrek 2\" wasn't the only time that King got animated.\n The host guest starred on a 1994 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" \"Sideshow Bob Roberts,\" playing the moderator of a mayoral debate between Joe Quimby and Sideshow Bob.\n \"A word to our audience, even though we're being broadcast on Fox, there's no need for obnoxious hooting and hollering,\" he warned, before the citizens of Springfield began, yes,  hooting and hollering.\n Away from CNN, King \u2014 or at least people who pretended to be him \u2014 popped up frequently on the NBC variety show, \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n The interviewer was impersonated by Fred Armisen, Norm Macdonald and Kevin Nealon, among others over the years.\n King's interviews, especially one of him asking Jerry Seinfeld if the massively popular \"Seinfeld\" was canceled, were shared endlessly on social media.\n That was never more the case than last month, when a clip of King interviewing Danny Pudi, an actor from Disney's \"DuckTales,\" went viral on TikTok.\n In the clip, King asks Pudi if he enjoys any luxuries. Pudi says he enjoys coffee and socks, which leave King dumbfounded.\n \"Coffee and socks are not a luxury,\" King says.\n Pudi then asks King to give him an example of a luxury.\n \"Private plane,\" King says dryly.\n Pudi takes a beat.\n \"Larry, I'm on DuckTales,\" Pudi responds.\n On a personal note, Larry King was one of my favorite interviewers growing up, and a big reason why I wanted to work at CNN in the first place.\n He was a brilliant interviewer who got the best tidbits from newsmakers simply by being himself and making everyone he spoke to feel comfortable enough to open up.\n Those were the qualities that made him not only a great talk show host, but also one of film and TV's favorite go-to newsmen. Oh, and not to mention, a cultural icon.",

        "body_text": "Nine months. That's how long it took the world's top 1,000 billionaires to recoup their fortunes after the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n More than a decade is how long it could take the world's poorest to recover, according to Oxfam International's annual inequality report.\n The report, released on Sunday ahead of the World Economic Forum's virtual meeting of political and financial leaders, typically held in Davos, Switzerland, lays out the virus' disparate impact around the globe. The pandemic could increase economic inequality in almost every country at once, the first time this has happened, Oxfam found.\n \"We stand to witness the greatest rise in inequality since records began. The deep divide between the rich and poor is proving as deadly as the virus,\" said Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam's executive director. \"Rigged economies are funneling wealth to a rich elite who are riding out the pandemic in luxury, while those on the front line of the pandemic \u2014 shop assistants, health care workers, and market vendors \u2014 are struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table.\"\n The coronavirus, which has infected nearly 100 million people and killed more than 2.1 million globally, has thrust inequality into the spotlight. How people cope has differed by race, by gender and by income.\n For instance, close to 22,000 Black and Hispanic Americans would still be alive, as of December, if these groups died of the virus at the same rate as White Americans, according to Oxfam.\n And 112 million fewer women would be at risk of losing income or their jobs if men and women were equally represented in sectors hurt by the pandemic.\n Meanwhile, the wealthy are generally weathering the Covid storm quite well. Though stock markets collapsed in the early months of the pandemic, they have roared back \u2014 thanks in part to the unprecedented economic assistance provided by governments.\n Worldwide, the wealth of billionaires has grown by $3.9 trillion between mid-March and the end of December, Oxfam calculated.\n But the number of people living in poverty globally could have increased by up to 500 million last year, according to a UN University World Institute for Development Economics Research paper that Oxfam cited.\n Other reports have also found that the pandemic has greatly hurt the poor. A separate World Bank study in October that found the pandemic could push as many as 60 million people into extreme poverty.\n To fight this growing inequality, governments should ensure that everyone has access to a Covid-19 vaccine and financial support if they lose their jobs, Bucher said. Also, this is the time for longer-term investments in public services and low-carbon sectors to create millions of jobs and ensure everyone has access to education, health care and social care, she said.\n In the US, Oxfam urged Congress to pass an economic recovery plan that invests in green jobs and supports the child care industry, which will help women return to work, and provide more aid in the global fight against the pandemic.\n \"These measures must not be Band-Aid solutions for desperate times, but a 'new normal' in economies that work for the benefit of all people, not just the privileged few,\" Bucher said.\n President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus and economic relief package, which contains additional stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and nutrition and housing assistance. He has said he will unveil an economic recovery plan next month.",

        "title": "History made: Renewable energy surpassed fossil fuels for European electricity in 2020",
        "body_text": "Europeans got more of their electricity from renewable sources than fossil fuels for the first time last year, according to an annual report from Ember and Agora Energiewende.\n The report, which has been tracking EU's power sector since 2015, found that renewables delivered 38% of electricity last year, compared to 37% delivered by fossil fuels.\n The shift comes as other sources, such as wind and solar power, have risen in the European Union. Both sources have nearly doubled since 2015, and as of last year accounted for one-fifth of electricity generation in EU countries, the report found. It's also the reason why coal power declined 20% last year, making up only 13% of electricity generated in Europe.\n \"Rapid growth in wind and solar has forced coal into decline, but this is just the beginning,\" said Dave Jones, senior electricity analyst for Ember and lead author on the report, in a statement. \"Europe is relying on wind and solar to ensure not only coal is phased out by 2030, but also to phase out gas generation, replace closing nuclear power plants, and to meet rising electricity demand from electric cars, heat pumps and electrolysers.\u200b\"\n Last year's Covid-19 lockdown measures resulted in less demand for electricity across the globe. European demand decreased by 4% in 2020, according to the report, which said Covid trends had no effect on the growth of renewable energy sources. Since 2015, Europe's electricity emissions recorded a historic decline, becoming 29% cleaner, the report noted.\n \"Post-pandemic economic recovery must not slow down climate action,\" said Patrick Graichen, director of Agora Energiewende, in a statement. \"We therefore need strong climate policy -- such as in the Green Deal -- to ensure steady progress.\"\n Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the amount of renewable energy sources that were used compared to coal.",

It'll be the Chiefs' fourth trip to the Super Bowl in franchise history.\n \"The best thing about this team is we believe in each other,\" Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said. \"I trust my guys over anybody and we're going to go out there and be who we are.\"\n As quarterbacks, Mahomes and the Buccaneers' Tom Brady have each won one of the last two Super Bowls, respectively. Mahomes and the Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year against the San Francisco 49ers. Brady, who was throwing for the New England Patriots at the time, defeated the Los Angeles Rams in 2019.\n Earlier Sunday, the Bucs beat the Green Bay Packers 31-26 in the NFC championship, earning them their second trip to the Super Bowl in franchise history. The first was in 2003 against the Oakland Raiders.\n \"Guys came through. Everyone stepped up to the challenge,\" Tom Brady said in a post-game interview. \"Football's the ultimate team sport and everybody plays a role. I'm just so proud of this whole team.\"\n Brady also made history Sunday. At 43 years old, he will be the oldest player to play in the Super Bowl.\n This will be Brady's 10th trip to the big game. With the Patriots -- where Brady played for 20 years before signing with the Bucs last March -- Brady went to the Super Bowl nine times, leading the team to six wins, the most for any player in NFL history.\n Should Brady win the big game in two weeks, he'll join Peyton Manning as one of two quarterbacks in NFL history to win Super Bowls on two different teams, according to the Buccaneers' website.\n CNN's Homero De la Fuente contributed to this report.",

        "title": "CEOs stepped up during the Trump era. They're not off the hook",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nDuring the Trump era, many business leaders came to an uncomfortable conclusion: They could no longer afford to stay in their lanes, speaking out only on issues that directly affected their companies' bottom lines.\n Filling a perceived moral vacuum in Washington, CEOs warned of threats to democracy and announced commitments aimed at addressing racial inequity. Many made clear in public where they stood on Trump's approach to the climate crisis and immigration.\n There's a new administration in the White House, and on a number of policy fronts, President Joe Biden and Corporate America are more closely aligned. But when it comes to thinking about the role their firms play in society, business leaders shouldn't return to their old ways.\n \"[This] becomes an opportunity to continue that self-reflection,\" Deepak Malhotra, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, told me.\n Why it matters: The public is increasingly counting on companies to make the right calls on political and social issues. According to the 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer released earlier this month, business has replaced government as the most trusted institution during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Following the riot by pro-Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol, a survey of 40 CEOs conducted by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management found that 96% of respondents thought Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n These same leaders now have a role to play as the impeachment process unfolds, Sonnenfeld told me. The trial in the Senate is scheduled to begin on Feb. 9.\n \"I do think they should formally and informally continue to push for accountability,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Our system of government is much of the reason for their business success \u2014 and they know that.\"\n Then there are the looming debates on issues like climate. Over the past four years, businesses have become accustomed to claiming the leadership mantle as the Trump administration disengaged.\n \"Business was outpacing government by a wide margin suddenly,\" Malhotra said.\n That may no longer be the case under the Biden administration, which took steps to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord last week. But that doesn't change the importance of individual commitments, or the necessity for companies to work with the government to reach crucial targets.\n And in some debates, business still has the chance to set standards. While Biden's call to raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour will face opposition from Republicans in Congress, Unilever promised last week that every worker who provides it with goods and services will earn a living wage by 2030.\n One given: Businesses will be forced to continue actively engaging on social issues simply because of changing consumer tastes. As was made clear after the police killing of George Floyd last summer, which brought out millions of protesters, younger customers increasingly demand that the brands they support back causes like Black Lives Matter; workers are asking the same of their employers.\n \"Businesses were forced to reckon with these issues, not specifically because of President Trump but because of what was happening on the streets and in communities, and in their own workforce,\" Malhotra said.\n Watch this space: Normally, the role of corporations in society would be discussed over the next week in the Swiss Alps as executives gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos. This year, unsurprisingly, the January edition of WEF is an all-digital affair, though the group hopes to hold an in-person event in Singapore in the summer.\n Conversations on the subject, featuring leaders like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, are going ahead. Keep an eye on Before the Bell for highlights.\n Wall Street has been counting on a rush of iPhone 12 sales to supercharge Apple's earnings. This week, investors will learn whether such predictions are coming true.\n What's happening: The release of every iPhone is accompanied by a significant degree of hype. But there's an extra unknown this time around, since the iPhone 12 is the first Apple (AAPL) device with 5G connectivity. Some analysts think that will have led to a huge wave of upgrades. Others aren't sure the 5G rollout is far along enough to inspire such enthusiasm, especially in the midst of an economic downturn.\n Apple reports earnings after US markets close on Wednesday. Given the company's 75% stock rise over the past year \u2014 in part due to anticipation about wild iPhone 12 sales \u2014 it will be a major market event.\n Much depends on demand out of China, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, putting any comments on the country's economic comeback in focus.\n \"China remains a key ingredient in Apple's recipe for success as we estimate roughly 20% of iPhone upgrades will be coming from this region over the coming year,\" Ives said in a recent note to clients.\n On the radar: Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 all contributors to the recent market rally \u2014 are also due to report earnings this week.",

        "title": "Biden's opening with Republicans is narrow but real",
        "body_text": "Anyone who has paid attention to American politics lately knows President Joe Biden cannot singlehandedly end the \"uncivil war\" he decried in his inaugural address last week.\n But that doesn't mean Biden can't curtail the conflict and attract some Republican cooperation toward his objectives. He has a chance to do that, for several reasons.\n Most important is the combination of personal qualities and experience he brings to the job. Throughout his half-century in public life, Biden has thrived on personal connection with colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n Biden came to the US Senate at a time when ideological diversity within parties encouraged compromise across party lines; he still touts his refusal to judge the motives of political opponents. He served more than two decades alongside Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, his occasional partner in deal-making when Biden served as President Barack Obama's vice president.\n That didn't stop McConnell from fiercely opposing nearly all of Obama's agenda, most effectively after Republicans won control of the Senate in 2014. Before the twin Democratic victories in Georgia Senate runoffs on January 5, McConnell was poised to do the same to his old friend Biden.\n But now the Democratic Senate majority has transformed the balance of power. It means Biden's party controls the agenda for committee work and the Senate floor, giving Democrats leverage to craft legislation that maximizes Biden's opportunity of luring a small group of moderate Republicans.\n The nature of Biden's immediate agenda -- a $1.9-trillion coronavirus relief proposal, to be followed by a massive infrastructure proposal -- also maximizes that opportunity. Among the White working-class voters whose flip from blue to red made Trump president in 2016, appeals on bread-and-butter economic concerns resonate far better than values issues such as racial equity or abortion.\n Biden won back just 10% of them in November even after a campaign contrasting Trump's divisiveness with his own calls for unity. But the White House bully pulpit gives him a chance to win over more of them on some initiatives, especially with Trump exiled to Florida without access to his social media megaphone.\n \"This is the best chance we have,\" says David Shor, a leading Democratic electoral strategist. As a 78-year-old White man rooted in the Main Street of an earlier era, Biden puts the friendliest face on his party's agenda for voters who feel threatened by cultural and economic change.\n Biden looks even friendlier after the deadly insurrection that Trump incited on January 6, which led to his second impeachment by the House and his looming impeachment trial in the Senate. By deepening fissures within the GOP, those events expand Biden's opportunity to gain defections.\n Consider these results from a Quinnipiac University national poll last week: 15% of Republicans approve of Trump's impeachment, 17% say White supremacy played a major role in the insurrection, and 33% don't want former president to play a major role within the party in the future. While 67% of Republicans falsely believe Biden did not legitimately win the presidency, 28% acknowledge that in fact he did.\n Biden may also benefit from deeper undercurrents of American yearning to move beyond divisions that have been building for years before exploding in violence at the Capitol. Harvard social scientist Robert Putnam, who documented the increasing atomization of American society two decades ago in his book Bowling Alone, has just published a new volume, The Upswing, envisioning the repeat of an historic pattern that would nudge American society back toward shared values.\n \"The task will not be an easy one, and nothing less than the success of the American experiment is at stake,\" Putnam writes. That very possibility propelled the improbable optimism of Biden's inauguration last week.\n \"Don't tell me things can't change,\" Biden said, his voice laced with emotion, before leaving Delaware for Washington to take the oath of office. \"They can, and they do.\"",

        "body_text": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Sunday that Democrats would use a rare procedural tactic to pass major parts of a Covid-19 relief package if Republicans refuse to move on the measure.\n Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that Democrats will use the move -- known as reconciliation -- \"as soon as we possibly can\" to pass the package by 51 votes in the Senate, rather than 60, if Republicans don't move the legislation.\n \"What we cannot do is wait weeks and weeks and months and months to go forward. We have got to act now,\" he said.\n Republicans used the reconciliation process when they attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in 2017 in the Senate. The GOP successfully used the process months later to overhaul the country's tax code, which passed with just Republican votes.\n On the urgency to pass a Covid-19 relief package in this new administration, Sanders told Bash: \"If we do not respond now, yes, I believe two years from now the Republicans will say, 'Hey, you elected these guys, they did nothing, vote for us,' and they will win.\"\n The White House has urged patience when it comes to negotiating and passing the stimulus plan on a bipartisan basis through the regular Senate process, but President Joe Biden's team has said they aren't willing to \"take any tools off the table.\"\n Asked Friday about senators using budget reconciliation, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said it was the administration's \"strong preference\" that they do not, but suggested it was a bargaining tool.\n \"Our strong preference, the President's preference, what we're working toward here, is bipartisan support for this bill,\" she told MSNBC Friday evening. \"Absolutely no question about it, it is urgent, and certainly if the Senate and the House keep reconciliation on the table as an option, that's understandable.\"\n She said there may be \"multiple ways to get to passage, but that does not mean that the President is not wholly committed to working to get Republican votes.\"\n There are still questions about what parts of Biden's Covid-19 relief package would be allowed to advance under reconciliation. Some aides have identified that items like the $15 minimum wage could struggle to meet the criteria.\n CNN's Lauren Fox and Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.",

        "title": "GOP congressman who voted to overturn election results admits 2020 race not fraudulent ",
        "body_text": "Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina said Saturday that he accepts Joe Biden as president and that the 2020 election was not conducted fraudulently.\n The freshman congressman made the comments to CNN's Pamela Brown when pressed about his lingering views on the November election results.\n Cawthorn was one of more than 120 House GOP members who voted to sustain the objection to electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania earlier this month when Congress met to to certify President-elect Biden's victory.\n \"Yes, I think I would say that the election was not fraudulent. You know, the Constitution allowed for us to be able to push back as much as we could and I did that to the amount of the constitutional limits that I had at my disposal. So now I would say that Joseph R. Biden is our president,\" he added.\n There have been no credible allegations of any issues with voting that would have impacted the election, as affirmed by dozens of state and federal courts, governors, state election officials and the departments of Homeland Security and Justice. And not one of the Republican officeholders objecting to Biden's victory have objected to Trump's wins, or in some cases their own wins, on the same day.\n Since Biden's inauguration, Cawthorn has signed onto a letter along with 16 other GOP House freshmen, saying they look forward to working with Biden. Notably, Cawthorn is the youngest member of Congress in modern history, according to US House records, at just 25 years old.\n \"So when I contested to the election, that was within the constitutional guidelines that the framers had set up. But after I've done that and the electors and the delegates from each state elected Joe Biden as our president, I respect the office. He is my president, and I want to work with him to make sure that we can bring some meaningful change to the American people,\" Cawthorn said.\n Cawthorn's office said in a statement to CNN on Sunday -- after the interview had aired Saturday night -- that \"while it is difficult to quantity the number of fraudulent ballots cast in any election, Representative Cawthorn stands firm in his belief that objecting to the certification of electoral college votes was an important step in safeguarding a free and fair electoral process.\"\n His office did not provide any evidence of voter fraud, which is extremely rare.\n This story has been updated with an additional statement from Cawthorn's office.",

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\nOn Wednesday, three men wearing overcoats stood in the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery, grouped at a pandemic-proper social distance as American flags whipped in the wind behind them.\n In the center was former President George W. Bush and alongside him were former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They had just attended President Joe Biden's inauguration and were here to pledge their support to him in front of the American people.\n \"The fact that the three of us are here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country,\" said Bush, a Republican, in a video that was broadcast that evening. The tradition of such a transfer, Obama, a Democrat, pointed out, is \"over two centuries old.\"\n You wouldn't know from the harmony of their appeal that a little over 20 years ago, Bush had promised an administration, in contrast to Clinton's, that \"will appeal to our better angels, not our darker impulses\" or that Obama had told Americans who were out of work in 2008 to blame \"the failed policies of George W. Bush.\"\n The three men, now friends and members in good standing of the Presidents Club, were a symbolic affirmation of the central themes of Biden's inaugural address \u2014 that \"democracy has prevailed\" and \"we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue.\" But the real test of Biden's call for unity is what happens now \u2014 as the new President seeks Congress' support for Covid-19 relief and the Senate weighs how to try the impeached (for the second time) former President Donald Trump, who flew out of town the morning of the inauguration.\n But it's no time to be complacent, she warned. \"The last four years have tattooed a trauma on so many Americans, and it won't fade overnight. There's healing to do, and Biden has a long journey ahead.\"\n Credit for averting disaster belongs to American voters, judges, election officials, journalists, a majority of legislators, military leaders and police officers like Eugene Goodman, who was honored at the Inauguration after he \"heroically moved the rioters from where US senators were hiding during the electoral vote certification process,\" Zelizer noted.\n For more on the Biden and the Inauguration:\n On a larger scale, she also sees positive news. \"Biden announced a new team of scientific advisers and created a Cabinet position for the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Incoming director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has publicly committed to leading with science and restoring public trust in the agency.\" Millions have been vaccinated in the US, though the rollout is \"fraught with problems,\" Hills noted.\n \"There are things we can do to help ourselves and each other. Tell your friends you love them. Tell them your troubles and listen to theirs. Show up for those family Zoom calls, whether or not you feel like it.\"  Lake quoted Dr. Erica Martin Richards, a psychiatrist and a medical director at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, who noted: \"There are studies that show the importance of smiling. The importance of prayer. The importance of exercising.\" Lake added, \"She regularly does all three.\"\n \"Poll after poll has shown that the American people want government to respond aggressively to address the crises they face. The job of Congress now is to listen to the American people, move our country boldly forward on a path to economic success and show voters that Democrats are prepared to do everything possible to improve their lives. This is an unprecedented moment in American history. We must act in an unprecedented way,\" Sanders argued.\n \"President Donald Trump continued this approach \u2014 passing massive tax cuts in 2017, and then, when calamity hit with Covid-19 in 2020, placing the burden of response on the states. It is Biden's historic task to reverse Reagan's \u2014 and Trump's \u2014 reckless radicalism,\" wrote Sachs.\n \"What is so important to me, a Black Southern woman who writes her authentic truth in verse,\" Jones observed \"is the incredible door Gorman is opening and will keep opening for us in poetry. As I watched her, gorgeous as she is, walking up to that inaugural podium\" her red headband \"like a crown, in her striking yellow coat \u2014 a sun only mirrored by the light emanating from her \u2014 I was so proud of Amanda Gorman.\"\n \"Maybe a poem won't literally pass legislation or deflect a bullet from exploding in my Black body, but a poem is what makes our hearts move. It does make people think, reflect, and it can even lead to empathy. We need that.\"",

        "title": "Progressives hope for more power in narrowly divided Congress",
        "body_text": "House progressives are poised to wield their growing influence in the new Congress as the Democratic Party settles in to unified control of Washington for the first time in a decade.\n \"The squad\" has returned to Capitol Hill after Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib beat back primary challenges, and their ranks have been bolstered by newly-elected progressive Democrats who quickly established national profiles, like Missouri Rep. Cori Bush and New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman.\n Democrats now control the White House and hold majorities -- though narrow -- in the Senate and the House, where close partisan splits mean the votes of even a relatively small bloc of members will carry significant weight.\n That new dynamic has emboldened progressives and could increase tensions in a caucus that, over the past two years, has seen a spate of internal clashes, ideological differences and tactical disagreements. During the Trump administration, though, the debates were largely symbolic. But with President Joe Biden in office, the squabbles of the past few years are no longer academic -- Democrats in the House now possess a powerful hand in shaping the agenda in Washington. And progressives could, if they remain unified, match the influence of the powerful moderate bloc as big ticket legislation winds its way through Congress.\n The dynamic has shifted further over the past couple weeks, as the Democratic sweep in Georgia's Senate runoffs flipped the upper chamber and created a new sense of opportunity in the House. Bills that would have been dead on arrival in the Senate, squashed by Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, the former majority leader, will now be delivered to the more welcoming hands of his successor, Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat. And with Biden promising to come out of the gate with a broad and ambitious Covid relief package, which includes longtime progressive priorities like raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, many on the left believe the hour for bold action has arrived.\n \"I'm optimistic that we have the makings of an FDR moment with a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,\" Rep. Ritchie Torres, a progressive freshman from New York, said in an interview. \"We have a once in a century opportunity to govern as boldly in the 21st century as FDR did in the 20th century.\"\n But the razor-thin Senate majority and House Democratic losses in 2020 mean that party leaders will also need to cater to moderate and conservative members. In the Senate, most legislation will require Republican support to clear a 60-vote threshold. Some fiscal items can pass with a simple majority, but even then the margin for error will be narrow since every member of the Democratic caucus will effectively hold a veto on any party-line vote (There will be a 50-50 partisan split in the chamber with Vice President Kamala Harris able to cast the tie-breaking vote).\n Biden, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have to carefully balance competing interests within the party to successfully pass legislation. Newly empowered progressives will have to decide what fights they are willing to pick and, when the time comes, whether they can forge a unity that has often eluded them in the past.\n In an early effort to more effectively apply the power in their increasing numbers, the Congressional Progressive Caucus recently adopted new rules aimed at getting members to vote as a bloc more frequently.\n The CPC will now take an official position when two-thirds of its membership favor it. Each member of the caucus will then be asked to vote in support of those positions at least two-thirds of the time.\n That change, among others, was made with the aim of drawing a harder line on key issues, which would strengthen CPC leadership's position in contentious legislative negotiations.\n Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chairwoman of the caucus, said in an interview that the reforms are \"designed to help us be more effective\" and \"make sure that people are participating and ideologically in line.\"\n \"We have to be able to say this is what the progressive caucus stands for, this is what we're fighting for,\" Jayapal said. \"We're not expecting 100%,\" she added, \"This is not a litmus test, this is not a purity test, but we do want people to generally be in line with the caucus on votes.\"\n Progressive members have expressed confidence in the CPC's new plan of action. But it remains to be seen whether the caucus can hold together under pressure, both from leadership and its own members, a diverse collection of lawmakers with different priorities and degrees of willingness to defy Pelosi -- and potentially run up against the White House.\n \"We need to use the strength in numbers that we have wisely and strategically,\" Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, a progressive freshman Democrat from New Mexico, said in an interview. \"We have to make sure we cultivate unity and stay unified as a caucus as well. That is part of the internal strategic tactical negotiations that you will see progressives engaged in.\"\n The CPC has a membership of close to 100 lawmakers. But if even just a handful of progressive members decided to coordinate strategy and vote in lock step, they could -- either formally or in practice -- breakaway from the larger caucus and exert meaningful leverage.\n Asked if he is prepared to stand in the way of legislation that falls short of his ambitions, Rep. Bowman of New York said, \"The short answer to that is yes.\"\n \"The slightly longer answer,\" Bowman said, \"is I'm organizing with 'the squad' and having those exact conversations right now.\"\n Bowman rose to national prominence last summer after he unseated former Rep. Eliot Engel, then chairman of the influential House Foreign Relations Committee, in a hotly contested primary.\n Grassroots activists have long floated the possibility that at least some progressives should form an ideologically rigid voting bloc that might be described as a liberal version of the Freedom Caucus, a group of unbending conservatives that pushed the GOP further right by repeatedly defying party leaders.\n Bowman said that he supports the new rules changes for the progressive caucus, believes in Jayapal's leadership, and believes the caucus will be stronger \"as long as we continue to communicate, collaborate and trust each other in that work.\"\n But he did not rule out the possibility of seeking other means to advance progressive priorities -- such as joining a smaller, more closely aligned bloc.\n \"If things aren't moving the way that myself and others believe it's moving,\" Bowman said, \"the possibility of a separate caucus ... we'll cross that bridge when we get there.\"\n Others are quick to point out the risks that could follow a progressive splintering at a time when consensus will be crucial to the passage of legislative priorities.\n Torres, who is also a member of the CPC, warned of the possibility of \"political paralysis and gridlock,\" when asked about the idea of a Freedom Caucus of the left.\n \"We cannot afford to have a Democratic Party that devours itself and any attempt at ideological cleansing is going to end in political paralysis and gridlock. We have to proceed with a unified front and with a sense of urgency,\" he said, referring to progressives as well as the Democratic Party as a whole.\n A senior aide to a CPC member acknowledged that the caucus, in the past, functioned more like \"an informal social group\" that rarely discussed \"wielding power as a bloc.\" That, the aide said, was in part a function of the balance of government -- being in the minority foreclosed the opportunity to push and prod for more liberal legislation.\n The aide also urged caution on the question of breakaway factions, warning that a crack-up of the caucus could deliver political capital to Republicans. That dynamic occasionally played out when GOP leadership, faced with an intransigent Freedom Caucus, was forced to turn to Democrats for votes on major bills.\n \"(Former Republican Speakers John) Boehner and Paul Ryan would cross over and say, 'I need your votes, Pelosi, on these year-end spending deals and I'll give you policy concessions for them,\" the aide recalled. \"So you ended up having bills move through a conservative House that were much more liberal than what should have been allowed.\"\n \"There is a greater expectation on the Democratic Party to now deliver the results,\" California Rep. Ro Khanna said, describing the push for a $15 minimum wage, student debt relief and the expansion of free, government-administered health care as \"non-negotiable\" priorities.\n Democratic control of the Senate, he added, will make \"the progressive caucus (in the House) a lot stronger because you can't say, well, McConnell's in charge.\"\n That job now belongs to Schumer, who is up for reelection in 2022 and has taken strides to shore up his left flank. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who will chair the Budget Committee, will also see his influence grow, giving House progressives their most powerful Senate partner in decades.\n But it is Schumer, navigating a slim majority, who will be most responsible for balancing Biden's agenda with the new dynamic in the House. The surprising Democratic takeover of the Senate has opened up new possibilities for what he can achieve, but also constrained his room to maneuver.\n West Virginia's Joe Manchin, the most conservative Senate Democrat, is poised to be one of the most influential Democrats in the chamber. Unlike Sanders or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Manchin and other moderate and centrist senators, like Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, will more often be in a position to seek out votes from the GOP side of the aisle -- giving them outsized power in the closely divided body.\n Schumer has built a reputation for keeping his caucus onside. But he has never been faced with such massive stakes. There is no guarantee that Senate Democrats will hold together in support of the Covid relief bill outlined by Biden last week. And even then, its scope -- which includes both spending and changes to federal law -- means at least ten Republicans will have to back it in order to overcome a GOP filibuster.\n The Biden team has signaled that they are ready to shift their strategy, if the push for bipartisanship is slapped down by the GOP, and seek to pass a bill through a process called budget reconciliation, which would require only Democratic votes and a simple majority to pass. At that point, Schumer would be called on to deliver.\n \"I don't envy the guy. He has a really tough job for the next two years,\" said McKenzie Wilson, communications director for Data for Progress, a left-wing think tank.\n Wilson, a veteran of Warren's presidential campaign and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray's office, pointed to Schumer's support for executive action on student loan debt forgiveness as one sign that he could be a more reliable ally to House progressives than some might expect.\n \"Schumer is, frankly, probably more aligned with progressives than a lot of progressives give him credit for,\" Wilson said. \"But (the question) is going to be, is that just because he's afraid of getting primaried or is that because he's genuinely committed to it?\"\n Pandemic aid is at the top of the agenda for the Democrat-led Congress and White House and Biden has already unveiled a proposal for a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package.\n Democrats across the political spectrum have praised the package and will face pressure to deliver on the President's first major policy agenda item in office. But some House progressives are already signaling they hope to push the proposal further to the left and others have expressed concern over Biden's initial play for Republican votes in the Senate\n Jayapal in a statement called Biden's proposal \"a promising start.\" But she did not offer an immediate, full endorsement.\n \"The Progressive Caucus has long cautioned against going too small in a moment of crisis that demands urgent and sweeping action,\" Jayapal said, adding that the CPC anticipates \"working with the Biden Administration to strengthen this proposal and deliver comprehensive and swift relief to families suffering across the nation.\"\n One policy that progressives have advocated that did not make it into the proposal is recurring direct payments. Instead, the Biden plan provides for a new one-time payment of $1,400.\n \"We're not going to give up on that push,\" Leger Fernandez of New Mexico said of recurring direct payments, adding, \"That's the purpose of having proposals come to Congress. We can then push for what we'd like to see and see what we can get.\"\n Rep. Marie Newman, a progressive freshman from Illinois who ousted a conservative House Democrat in a primary challenge, believes the Biden proposal is a good start, but still she wants to see recurring $2,000 direct payments signed into law as soon as possible.\n \"At least three months of recurring checks is critical and it may need more than that,\" Newman said in an interview.\n Other progressives, including Bush, Bowman and Ocasio-Cortez initially demanded the $1,400 checks -- which would top up the most recent round of $600 direct payments -- be boosted to a clean $2,000. The narrow focus of that first round of criticism, typically delivered on Twitter, frustrated some on the left, who saw deeper flaws in the potential bill -- specifically on the question of process.\n Within 24 hours of Biden's speech, lawmakers began to tweak their messaging.\n Rather than zeroing in on the one-off checks, calls for recurring payments grew louder. Ocasio-Cortez, taking questions from reporters after a virtual town hall on Friday night, praised the contents of the bill but expressed skepticism that Biden could win over enough Republicans to reach a 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority.\n \"My concern is that if we slow down relief or if we water down relief in a potentially futile attempt to appease Republicans, when we have a Democratic majority, that could result in us helping people less than we possibly could,\" she said. \"And I don't think that we can, in good conscience, help people less than we possibly could.\"\n By Monday morning, a little more than 48 hours before Biden took his oath and moved into the White House, outside progressive groups had sharpened their demands. Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement issued a memo that set out progressive demands for \"when\" -- not if -- Republicans refuse to sign on to the bill.\n It cited former President Barack Obama's protracted and ultimately fruitless efforts -- which he detailed in his recently released memoir -- to get GOP support for the Affordable Care Act, and warned Biden not to make the same mistake.\n \"Biden and Democratic Party leadership have essentially nine months to act before the 2022 election cycle kicks into gear,\" the memo read. \"There's nothing that would please Mitch McConnell more than to allow Republicans to run out the legislative clock on key Democratic priorities.\"\n The memo also pushed Biden to consider \"reform(ing) Senate rules to get rid of the supermajority threshold, and pass the package through regular order.\" Or, in other words, to push Senate Democrats to do away with the filibuster.\n For now, though, any effort to enact that sort of root-and-branch restructuring of the legislative process -- which the Democrats could do with a simple majority vote -- appears to be desperately unlikely. Even progressive leaders like Sanders have balked at it.\n Reconciliation appears to be Biden's preferred route in the face of GOP opposition, which means changes to the minimum wage would almost surely be stripped from the bill under Senate rules. Other progressive priorities, like statehood for Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, and major voting rights legislation, would also languish barring changes to the Senate rules.\n \"It would be far healthier, cleaner, and easier to explain politically to simply reform or get rid of the filibuster immediately,\" the groups argued, \"and proceed to pass Biden's agenda through regular order -- including must-pass civil rights bills, climate solutions and statehood.\"\n Still, even the most progressive House members say they are committed to searching out any common ground with Republican colleagues. Sanders and Khanna passed the War Powers Resolution, aimed at blocking further US aid to the Saudi-led war in Yemen, with GOP support during the last Congress in alliance with anti-interventionist Republicans.\n Bowman, who spoke to CNN just hours before the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, said the Democratic victories the night before in Georgia and the refusal of some of his GOP colleagues to object to Biden's election, gave him some hope.\n \"Now we can fight amongst ourselves within the Democratic Party and push for the policies that we know the majority of the American people want and need and demand,\" Bowman said.\n Then he cast his eyes across the aisle.\n \"And quite frankly, I'm going to be looking very closely at the Republicans who are not supporting the circus that Trump and some Republicans are trying to create,\" Bowman said, \"because that may present opportunities for collaboration and true bipartisan leadership going forward.\"",

        "body_text": "Walter Bernstein, the Oscar and Emmy-nominated screenwriter, passed away at his home in Manhattan on Saturday at the age of 101, his widow, Gloria Loomis, told CNN.\n He died of pneumonia, Loomis said.\n Bernstein was best known for being blacklisted during Hollywood's \"Red Scare\" of the 1950s. Caught up in the anti-communist movement punctuated by Sen. Joseph McCarthy's notorious allegations against the US State Department, Bernstein wrote under pseudonyms for years.\n He also published with the help of friends and associates known as \"fronts,\" who listed their names as the supposed authors of Bernstein's work.\n Bernstein reemerged as a screenwriter for the 1959 film \"That Kind of Woman,\" starring Sophia Loren and directed by Sidney Lumet.\n His career rebounding, Bernstein's highlighed works throughout the 1960s and '70s included \"Fail Safe,\" \"Paris Blues,\" \"The Molly Maguires,\" and \"Yanks.\" Bernstein also worked on \"Something's Got to Give,\" the ill-fated Marilyn Monroe picture that was never completed due to her death in August 1962.\n He gained a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination for \"The Front,\" a 1976 film starring Woody Allen that satirized the McCarthyism-era impact on writers in the industry.\n \"Walter was a wonderful guy; bright, talented, witty and politically courageous,\" Allen said in a statement to CNN.\n In 1997, Bernstein was nominated for an Emmy writing award for \"Miss Evers' Boys,\" an HBO movie about the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.\n Before his successes in screenwriting, Bernstein attended Dartmouth College, served in World War II as a correspondent for the military newspaper Yank, and wrote for The New Yorker.\n Bernstein had been a longtime member of the Writers Guild of America, East union, which named an award after him in 2017 intended \"to honor writers who have demonstrated with creativity, grace and bravery a willingness to confront social injustice in the face of adversity.\"\n CNN's Travis Caldwell contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Arizona Republicans still backing Trump are on the wrong path",
        "body_text": "Dean Obeidallah, (@DeanObeidallah) a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show\" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nThe Arizona Republican Party's actions on Saturday night sum up so well what we're seeing from much of today's GOP. Slam those who dare to criticize Donald Trump but don't criticize him for inciting an insurrection.\n In this case, the Arizona state GOP voted to punish former GOP senator Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain, the widow of John McCain, for endorsing President Joe Biden during the 2020 campaign. The Republicans also voted to censure current GOP Gov. Doug Ducey for using \"dictatorial powers\" when he used emergency rules to shut down businesses as Covid-19 cases rose in the state last year. At least, that was the ostensible reason. Common sense, though, suggests it was at least in part because Ducey very publicly refused to help Trump overturn his loss in the traditionally Republican state.\n The reelection Saturday of Trump-loving, election-lie peddling Kelli Ward as Arizona state GOP chair tells us a great deal about the state of the party. Since Ward became state GOP leader in 2019, Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996. Democrats also flipped the US Senate seat in November after winning a seat in 2018. The result is the Democrats now control both Senate seats for the first time since 1953. You would think that record could cost someone the job as party chair. But instead Ward was rewarded with another term after she played an audio message of Trump personally urging Arizona GOP members to support her, saying about Ward, \"I give her my complete and total endorsement.\"\n Kirk Adams, a former GOP state representative in Arizona, voiced concerns to CNN that the GOP is still continuing down \"the rabbit hole of loyalty\" to Trump, remarking: \"What we're getting is a purity test, and that purity test is simple: are you loyal to Donald Trump no matter what?\" He added pointedly, \"If you're not, we'll censure you.\"\n What was missing from the Arizona state GOP meeting was a resolution slamming Trump for his buffet of dangerous lies about election fraud and for inciting the January 6 insurrection on our Capitol. This is what we are seeing from the majority of GOP members of Congress as well. After the deadly January 6 attack on our Capitol by those seeking to prevent the congressional certification of Biden's win, 147 Republicans who returned to the chamber after they and other lawmakers had to flee the Trump mob still voted against certifying Biden's wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n The following week, when given a chance to hold Trump responsible for the insurrection -- which 63% of Americans surveyed in a recent Marist poll blame Trump for -- only 10 out of 211 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump. Since then, as the New York Times reported, nearly all 10 who voted to impeach \"have either already been formally censured by local branches of the GOP, face upcoming censure votes or have been publicly scolded by local party leaders.\"\n The most vocal attacks have come against Rep. Liz Cheney for her vote to impeach, with over half of GOP House members seeking to remove Cheney from her leadership position and primary challengers already lining up to take her on back in her home state of Wyoming.\n Now some GOP leaders -- instead of joining efforts to hold Trump accountable for his misconduct -- are beginning to weaponize Trump's \"Big Lie\" by proposing changes to election legislation. GOP officials are not even hiding the reason for their current focus on \"voter integrity,\" with Alice O'Lenick, a Republican on the Gwinnett County, Georgia, board of elections, recently stating baldly about the laws: \"They don't have to change all of them, but they've got to change the major parts of them so that we at least have a shot at winning.\"\n All the GOP's proposed \"voter integrity\" efforts should be seen through the prism of an effort to make it more difficult for people who don't traditionally vote for Republicans to cast a ballot.\n In Texas, the state GOP chair is now calling for making \"voter integrity\" a top priority and asked the GOP-controlled state legislature to reduce the number of early voting days allowed. No surprise given the Dems' advantage in in-person early voting last year.\n In Georgia, the Republican state Senate caucus endorsed ending \"no-excuse\" absentee voting despite no evidence of fraud. No doubt what they did see was that Biden supporters had utilized mail-in ballots in higher numbers than Trump supporters.\n Many in the GOP have made the choice that even though Trump is out of office they will maintain his \"election fraud\" lies -- as GOP Sen. Rand Paul did Sunday morning on ABC's \"This Week.\" They will punish those not loyal to Trump and refuse to criticize his incitement of an insurrection. This is today's GOP. How exactly are we to find \"unity\" with a party still more concerned with loyalty to a twice-impeached president than with doing the right thing for our nation?",

        "source": "cnn",
        "title": "Why Biden's vaccine goals are likely too modest and good politics",
        "body_text": "That's generally in line with other polling (such as last week's CNN/SSRS survey) that showed that most Americans were displeased with how Donald Trump's administration handled the coronavirus pandemic.\n A look at the statistics reveal that it may very well be too modest, but it's likely good politics.\n Let's start with the basic fact that humans developing multiple Covid-19 vaccines in less than a year was a scientific achievement for the ages.\n The Trump administration then completely botched the expectations game on the vaccine rollout. They set an initial goal of getting 20 million vaccine doses into the arms of Americans by the end of 2020.\n As I noted last week, we simply didn't come close to reaching that milestone in December.\n We're very likely to hit 20 million total doses administered in the next few days, however, as more than 19 million doses have been administered as of early Friday.\n Overall, as Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki pointed out, \"less than 500,000 shots a day\" were administered during Trump's time in office once the first shots were given on December 14.\n It's a true statement, but I must admit that it feels like it doesn't encapsulate all the facts. You can't just look at the entirety of the Trump run to determine whether Biden's setting a low goal.\n After all, it takes time for the states and the federal government to figure out how to coordinate with each other and themselves to distribute the vaccines.\n Moreover, a number of states were very strict with who could get the vaccines at first. There were reports of doses getting thrown out.\n States have since opened up the eligibility. Combined with more practice in actually delivering the vaccine, the number of people getting doses each state has gone up dramatically.\n Since January 13, we have averaged greater than 800,000 doses administered every day. On three days since that date, we've had more than a million people get the vaccine. This includes on Friday, when the CDC reported an increase of more than 1.5 million doses administered from the day before.\n We've done a better job of administering the doses we have than we used to. We used to only administer less than a third of the doses distributed. Only once before January 12 had we administered more than 33%. It's been above that every day since. In fact, it's been greater than 45% each of the last four days reported.\n This is before the Biden administration has had any real opportunity to change anything from the Trump administration.\n Of course, the past isn't always prologue. We could run out of vaccines, but that doesn't seem likely at this point.\n We know that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have pledged to deliver 200 million doses of their vaccine combined in the first quarter of this year (i.e. through March). This doesn't even count the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which, if approved, could deliver tens of millions more doses by the beginning of April.\n The bottom line is that it's very easy to see how the Biden administration hits 100 million doses in 100 days. We're basically already doing it, and we should have the doses available to keep doing it.\n Indeed, America may end up doing considerably better than 100 million doses in 100 days.\n Now, it's possible that things go awry in vaccine production or distribution. That's why it's usually best to keep expectations low.\n Biden's team, if anything, wants to do the exact opposite of what Trump did. They don't want to set a bar that can easily prove impossible to beat. They want a bar that can be met and can potentially be exceeded.\n In other words, they may end up under-promising and over-delivering.\n Usually, voters reward politicians who do what Biden's team could do. They clearly punished Trump for the opposite.\n To be clear, Americans expect Biden to fulfill his promise. The vast majority (70%) of Americans told CNN pollsters that the Biden administration is at least somewhat likely to reach its goal of 100 million does in 100 days.\n If we don't, there could be a heavy political price to pay.",

        "title": "Chronicling Trump's 10 worst abuses of power",
        "body_text": "Former President Donald Trump flouted the limits of presidential power unlike any of his recent predecessors, leaving behind a legacy of unmatched abuses that range from violations of longstanding norms to potentially criminal behavior.\n It was hard to keep track amid the daily deluge of controversial tweets and distractions that were a hallmark of the Trump presidency. And some of the most egregious abuses of power weren't clear at the time but came into focus after exhaustive investigations.\n To chronicle Trump's most consequential abuses of power, CNN spoke with a politically diverse group of constitutional scholars, presidential historians and experts on democratic institutions.\n While these 16 experts did not agree on everything, there was consensus that Trump's pattern of abusing his powers for personal or political gain reached an alarming level that hasn't been seen in modern history, and will have long-lasting consequences for the future of American democracy.\n Here is a breakdown of Trump's 10 most significant abuses of power.\n There is broad agreement among experts that Trump's most severe abuse of power was his relentless effort to undermine the 2020 election and overturn the legitimate results.\n Michael Paulsen, a conservative legal scholar and professor at the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota, called it a \"form of a political coup d'\u00e9tat against our Constitution.\"\n Throughout the 2020 campaign, Trump spread provably false disinformation about the voting process. He even floated the idea of unconstitutionally delaying the election, leading to a bipartisan rebuke.\n After Trump lost, he falsely claimed victory and pressured election officials in battleground states to fraudulently throw out millions of votes for President Joe Biden. The most memorable example was Trump's hour-long call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, when he harangued the GOP official to \"find\" just enough votes to nullify Biden's narrow victory in that state.\n Trump's legal team filed dozens of meritless lawsuits alleging fraud, which were rejected by a bipartisan array of federal and state judges, and the Supreme Court. When these efforts failed, Trump unsuccessfully tried to coerce then-Vice President Mike Pence to unlawfully override the Electoral College process and block Biden's victory in Congress.\n \"Nothing remotely compares to this,\" said Akhil Amar of Yale Law School, who is among the most-cited constitutional scholars in the country. \"His actions since the election have threatened the very existence of our constitutional democracy. This looms large in the history of not just this administration, but the history of America. This is what history will remember most harshly.\"\n Along the way, the Trump administration dragged its feet on the formal transition of power, which was delayed for weeks while Trump refused to acknowledge defeat. Biden said his team was met with \"obstruction\" from Trump appointees at the Pentagon and White House. Trump's efforts to undermine the transition are unprecedented in modern American history, the experts said.\n \"Trump has put more pressure on the integrity of the election process than any individual in modern American history. There has never been anything on this scale,\" said Rick Hasen, a former CNN analyst and election law expert who teaches at the University of California, Irvine.\n Trump's attempts to cling to power reached a horrifying crescendo on January 6, when he incited a large gathering of supporters in Washington to attack the US Capitol while the electoral votes were being counted.\n \"This in and of itself puts Trump in the lowest circle of hell among America's presidents, along with the likes of James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson,\" Amar said.\n At a rally before the attack, Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol and \"fight like hell,\" telling them, \"You'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength.\" The protests quickly transformed into a violent mob, which overran police barriers and stormed the building. The occupation was quelled after several hours of violent clashes, which led to five deaths.\n \"It is not far-fetched to argue that he should have anticipated that his false election claims and incitement to march on the Capitol to 'stop the steal' would have devastating consequences,\" said Ross Garber, a Tulane Law School professor who previously defended four Republican governors that faced impeachment.\n Figures from both parties labeled the attack an insurrection and blamed Trump for the violence, which killed one police officer and four rioters. No US president, with the possible exception of Andrew Johnson, has ever fomented a violent uprising against lawmakers, though Trump denies responsibility.\n The incident led to Trump's second impeachment by the House, in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in US history, for \"incitement of insurrection.\" The Senate is expected to begin Trump's trial on February 9.\n \"The founders intended that the office of the president be held by people with sufficient virtue,\" said Franita Tolson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California. \"They recognized the risk of someone who is a tyrant abusing the office, but they didn't build a system to prevent it. The question is, will we learn from this, and alter our Constitution to prevent this from happening again?\"\n Many of the experts pointed to Trump's inflammatory and divisive rhetoric as a stark abuse of power, albeit not criminal, and probably not impeachable either. But they said Trump abused the bully pulpit by using his platform to brazenly spread lies and conspiracies, attack political opponents of all stripes, and praise bad actors like white nationalists and authoritarian leaders.\n CNN and other news outlets fact-checked thousands of lies that Trump told during his tenure, far surpassing the cherry-picked political spin or occasional whoppers told by past presidents.\n \"Trump abused the bully pulpit to intimidate witnesses, literally bully people and spread disinformation. It's never been done on the scale that he did it,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who testified as a Democratic witness in favor of impeachment in 2019\n Many of Trump's comments debased the public discourse and were blatantly racist or fanned the flames of existing divisions. Others were detrimental to public health. Last year, he often downplayed the risks of Covid-19 and promoted unproven treatments. The experts said these were shameful misuses of his bully pulpit that literally put Americans in danger.\n Larry Diamond, an expert on democratic governance at the Hoover Institution, said Trump \"has massive responsibility for creating the normative atmosphere in which extremism, hatred, racial bigotry and violent imagery have prospered and metastasized.\" Diamond noted Trump's refusal to condemn white supremacists at the 2017 Charlottesville rally to his praising of QAnon in late 2020.\n \"The amount of lies that came out of this presidency was corrosive to our political culture,\" said Joe Goldman, president of the Democracy Fund, a nonpartisan foundation that studies voter attitudes toward democratic institutions and works to strengthen democracy. \"In theory, you could pass new laws to address many of the norm violations we saw under Trump. But earning back people's trust is much harder to do.\"\n Trump politicized the Justice Department and FBI from the very start of his presidency until the final days. He repeatedly crossed lines and violated norms that have been in place since Watergate to create independence between the White House and federal law enforcement.\n \"It's extremely important for the integrity of American democracy that the president cannot manipulate law enforcement for partisan, political, self-interested preferences,\" said Rick Pildes, a former CNN legal analyst who teaches at New York University. \"Trump constantly agitated to eliminate the boundaries between a President and the DOJ, which was incredibly disturbing.\"\n The experts ranked this among Trump's worst abuses because his goal was often to twist the Justice Department to serve his own needs -- not the national interest. A clear pattern emerged where Trump leaned on law enforcement to protect him and his allies, and to harass his critics. This created a tense atmosphere with some resignations and public rebukes.\n During his four years, Trump publicly urged the FBI to investigate more than two dozen of his perceived opponents, including several Democratic lawmakers, some of the prosecutors and FBI officials involved in the Russia investigation, Biden's son Hunter Biden, the tech company Google, and even the author of the infamous 2018 \"anonymous\" op-ed in The New York Times.\n While most of these abuses were rhetorical in nature, he took some overt actions that triggered scrutiny from criminal investigators, like his 2017 firing of then-FBI Director James Comey, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n \"By politicizing (the Justice Department) now, and frankly by engaging in a lot of conduct that appears to be illegal, President Trump undermined the ability of the department to proceed in a clear way going forward,\" said Lisa Manheim, a University of Washington law professor who specializes in constitutional issues and co-wrote a 2018 book about the limits of presidential power.\n The Mueller investigation dominated the first three years of Trump's presidency. Angry over an investigation that he felt was illegitimate, Trump repeatedly lashed out at Mueller and took steps to undermine and obstruct the sprawling criminal probe. Mueller investigated 10 episodes and found persuasive evidence that Trump's actions fit the legal criteria to warrant criminal charges.\n But Mueller decided not to make an up-or-down decision on whether to charge Trump, citing Justice Department rules against indicting a sitting president and the difficult constitutional questions that would make for a challenging prosecution. Instead, Mueller famously said, \"If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"\n Mueller's cryptic refusal to clear Trump's name was quickly washed away by Trump's often-repeated lie that Mueller gave him \"total and complete exoneration,\" a false claim he and his allies parroted dozens of times.\n \"The offenses in the Mueller report make a powerful and overwhelming case for obstruction of justice and political corruption,\" said Paulsen, the conservative legal scholar. \"To some extent, it was criminal. To some extent, it was non-criminal corruption. Mueller couldn't get to the full scope because of the obstruction.\"\n The experts had mixed views on Trump's possible criminal exposure. Some said there was strong proof that Trump broke the law, while others said some of the alleged episodes of obstruction would be difficult to prosecute.\n Michael Zeldin, a former CNN legal analyst who previously worked for Mueller at the Justice Department, said there were one or two incidents that were strong and prosecutable obstruction crimes, including when Trump ordered his White House counsel to write a memo falsely stating that Trump never ordered him to fire Mueller.\n \"In my view, that is a clear act of obstruction,\" Zeldin said. \"The sole intention was to interfere with the investigation. There is no other explanation for it.\"\n The Constitution places almost no limits on presidential commutations and pardons for federal crimes, and many past presidents have granted controversial pardons, especially in their final weeks in office. But the experts agreed that Trump took this phenomenon to new extremes.\n \"I thought Bill Clinton abused the pardon power at the end of his term. But what we're seeing from Trump makes Clinton look trivial in comparison,\" said Diamond, from the Hoover Institution, referring to Clinton's controversial pardons to associates and allies on his last day in office.\n Trump eschewed the regular process and almost never consulted with the Justice Department's clemency office, leading to some highly controversial pardons. Some of the experts said that while allowable, these pardons undercut anti-corruption efforts and undermined the rule of law.\n Mueller found some evidence that Trump obstructed justice by publicly urging ex-aides not to cooperate and dangling pardons in exchange for loyalty. Trump closed the loop in December 2020 by pardoning former aides Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, who were convicted of lying or obstructing the Mueller probe, among other crimes.\n \"He used the pardon as a tool to entrench himself in power and to subvert the legal system,\" said Manheim, the constitutional specialist at the University of Washington School of Law.\n In one of his final acts in office, Trump pardoned his former strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged in 2020 with defrauding Trump supporters in a \"build the wall\" scheme. The pardon was especially controversial, given Bannon's violent rhetoric and ties to \"stop the steal\" groups that attacked the Capitol.\n Trump also pardoned prominent Republicans who were early boosters of his 2016 campaign, and used footage of a pardon ceremony for political purposes at the 2020 Republican National Convention. He never followed through, but Trump openly mused about pardoning himself, claiming multiple times that he could if he wanted to, even though that claim is untested and legally dubious.\n \"I think the president's pardon power is essentially unlimited. I even think he can pardon himself for past crimes,\" Paulsen said. \"Nonetheless, to abuse the pardon power like Trump has, while not unconstitutional, it is surely impeachable and deserves condemnation.\"\n Trump is one of three presidents to get impeached, a fate he first faced in 2019 after pressuring the Ukrainian government to help his reelection campaign by announcing a baseless investigation into the Bidens. As part of the scheme, Trump unlawfully withheld nearly $400 million in much-needed military aid from Ukraine, even though Congress appropriated the funds with bipartisan support.\n \"This clearly looked like an extremely inappropriate quid-pro-quo offer,\" said Susan Rose-Ackerman, a law professor at Yale University who has written books about political corruption.\n The Trump White House told government officials and agencies not to cooperate with the Democratic-run House impeachment inquiry, and many officials defied subpoenas for testimony or documents. Yet, other Trump administration officials from the National Security Council, State Department, and Pentagon testified under oath and implicated Trump.\n \"There has always been tension between the President and Congress over investigations of the White House,\" said Pildes, the legal expert from New York University. \"But we never had a president who stonewalled Congress and made it this difficult for Congress to perform one of its most important functions -- oversight of the White House.\"\n Trump's impeachment was a heated partisan affair: The House impeached Trump with only Democratic votes, and just one Senate Republican voted to convict Trump, who was acquitted on both articles.\n Many of the experts said Trump's dealings with Ukraine were wholly inappropriate for a sitting president. There is debate over whether his actions were impeachable -- or separately, maybe even part of a criminal conspiracy. But there is strong consensus that he inappropriately used the powers of his office to benefit his reelection campaign, and that his blanket stonewalling of Congress was improper.\n \"Seeking a foreign nation's help to prosecute a US citizen, that's an exercise of the president's foreign relations power,\" said Paulsen, the conservative legal scholar. \"The problem is the misuse of that power for personal political gain, and it's clear that's what Trump did. That is impeachable, and this is the big one that got away.\"\n A recurring theme of the Trump presidency was the personalization of government, with Trump regularly conflating his interests with the national interests, and demanding personal loyalty from nearly everyone around him in government.\n \"Trump's demand that government actors pledge loyalty to him, as opposed to the law or to the constitution, is a corruption of the rule of law, and it's a corruption of government institutions,\" Pildes said.\n This pattern first came into focus when Comey revealed to the public that Trump demanded \"loyalty\" from him during a private meeting in early 2017 -- an inappropriate request from any sitting President to an FBI chief. As the years went on, it became clear that Cabinet members and top officials could only survive if they put on a show for Trump, showering him with praise and platitudes.\n \"Under Donald Trump, it was almost impossible to tell who was purportedly working on behalf of the government and who was working for Trump personally. That has significant consequences,\" said Garber, the impeachment expert, referring to Trump's legal team during his 2019 impeachment.\n This is an abuse of power, the experts said, because it subverts the loyalty that Trump and his aides are supposed to swear to the constitution, and usurps it with personal loyalty to one man's whims.\n \"To the extent that a president tries to use his own authority to pressure executive branch officials to be loyal to him rather than to the law, that undermines on a fundamental level the governmental level the structure that we've set up,\" Manheim said.\n The experts pointed out that there were trickle-down effects from Trump's behavior. Many White House aides were flagged for violating the Hatch Act, the toothless federal law that prohibits executive branch officials from using their jobs for political purposes. In a brazen flouting of the spirit of this law, Trump delivered his 2020 GOP convention speech from the White House lawn, which had never been done before.\n \"We only have a limited window into how much he tried to bully, manipulate, distort and threaten officials who were just doing their constitutional duty,\" said Nancy Gibbs, a presidential historian and former editor in chief of Time Magazine who now runs Harvard University's political research shop.\n As someone who demanded absolute loyalty, Trump didn't react well when officials disagreed with him, either publicly or privately. Officials often lost their jobs if Trump felt like they weren't doing his bidding, or if they contradicted him in public, even to stand up for the truth.\n There were firings, forced resignations and premature departures, which ramped up in Trump's final year. The experts agreed Trump had the authority to take these actions, but they said he crossed a line by clearly retaliating against officials for personal reasons without good cause.\n \"I have a strong view of presidential power,\" Paulsen said. \"These are actions that are within the president's constitutional powers. But it's still an abuse to use those powers for corrupt personal purposes.\"\n Some of the most egregious examples stemmed from Trump's impeachment. After his acquittal, he purged several officials who testified against him, like US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland as well as Lt. Col Alexander Vindman from the National Security Council.\n \"The President can fire an ambassador, but Trump fired Gordon Sondland because Sondland was a whistleblower against him -- and that's an abuse of power. If you punish someone for exercising their rights, you are violating those rights,\" said Gerhardt, who testified in favor of impeachment in 2019.\n Trump also removed inspectors general that uncovered wrongdoing by his administration, and fired Chris Krebs, the top election security official who publicly debunked his voter fraud conspiracies.\n He also relentlessly attacked whistleblowers who spoke out against him, including the anonymous intelligence official whose complaint triggered his impeachment, as well as Dr. Rick Bright, the former public health official who publicly criticized Trump's failed pandemic response in early 2020.\n \"There has been real damage to expertise across the government. The civil servants have to be able to speak honestly without fear of being fired unless they've done something wrong,\" said Kim Scheppele, a professor at Princeton University whose research focuses on the collapse of constitutional governments. \"Why would anyone want to go into the public sector anymore?\"\n Trump was the first billionaire to ascend to the presidency. When he took the mantle in 2017, he defied the near-universal advice from ethics specialists and refused to divest from his international business empire. Instead, Trump temporarily turned over control of his company to his adult sons, which he said his lawyers cleared from a conflict-of-interest standpoint.\n The biggest issue, the experts said, was the appearance of a massive conflict of interest.\n \"It is reflective of his own moral compass. It is showing the way in which he thinks about his role as president,\" said Rose-Ackerman, the Yale professor who studies political corruption. \"It isn't tied so much to a million dollars here or a million dollars there. It's tied to his perspective about what it means to be president -- that he sees it as giving him free range to do things.\"\n Trump spent considerable time at his own properties and golf clubs, substantially raising their profile, and even making money from the federal government along the way. Trump's company billed the US government millions of dollars, including for Secret Service agents to stay at his properties while protecting him.\n His high-end hotel in Washington, DC, became a mainstay for GOP insiders and lobbyists, and even some foreign officials, who were accused of buying influence by booking rooms. (The Trump Organization said it voluntary donated all profits from foreign governments to the United States Treasury.)\n \"We've depended on a combination of legal requirements and norms to prevent conflicts of interest and self-dealing,\" said Deborah Hellman, a University of Virginia law professor who studies political corruption. \"Once norms get broken, it's hard to put them back together again.\"\n Some of the experts said there are serious questions about Trump's potential violations of the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution, which bans federal officials from taking payments from foreign governments. DC-area businesses, as well as Democratic lawmakers and attorneys general, tried to go after Trump in the courts, but progress has been slow.\n This was yet another situation where Trump skirted norms and benefited from the fact that the laws on the books aren't really designed to deal with a president with his own global business.\n \"What Trump figured out -- the autocrats that I study, like Orban in Hungry, Erdogan in Turkey and Bolsonaro in Brazil, they all do this -- they operate in this space where no law actually prohibits, but soft norms govern. And because there is no law, it's hard to hold them to account. That's how democracies collapse,\" said Scheppele, the Princeton expert on failed governments.\n CNN's Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Biden's decrees vault America back onto the global stage. A whiplashed world wonders for how long",
        "body_text": "Within hours of taking office, US President Joe Biden set to work signing a blizzard of executive orders, memorandums and directives to agencies, ranging from steps to combat the coronavirus to beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord.\n To the outside world, the powers of a US president to make sweeping changes with a stroke of his or her pen can seem bewildering. Every four or eight years, an incoming leader can upend the policies of his predecessor and leave international allies struggling to keep up.\n Biden set a new record by signing 17 on his first day in office and he has plans to sign more. Some of them will have a significant impact beyond America's borders.\n So how do they work?\n The president's \"executive power\" relies on a wide, but vague, set of prerogatives granted to the US president in Article II of the Constitution. Every president dating back to George Washington has used executive powers in some fashion or another -- some more than others.\n Trump signed 29 executive orders in his first 100 days, back in 2017, as he sought to get quick wins on the board. That was more than any President since 1945, when President Harry Truman signed 57 orders in his first 100 days.\n By the time Trump left office, four years later, he had signed 220, or an average of 55 a year, according to data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n That compares with 291 in the course of President George W. Bush's eight years in office and 394 over President Bill Clinton's two terms, according to the same data. Meanwhile, Barack Obama averaged fewer executive orders per year in office than any US President in 120 years, issuing 276 executive orders in total during his eight years in office, or roughly 35 per year.\n Notably, Biden's first actions reversed several of Trump's attempts to pull out of international agreements, from starting the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord to halting the US withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n Biden also halted funding for the construction of Trump's border wall and reversed his highly controversial travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries.\n Next week, he plans to revoke the so-called Mexico City Policy, which bars international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from receiving US government funding, according to a draft of a calendar document sent to administration allies and viewed by CNN.\n Short lived or not, the changes enacted through executive orders can have a serious impact on US relations with other nations and on international organizations whose activities are affected by shifts in US policy and funding.\n And the upheaval every four or eight years when a new administration comes in can leave policymakers feeling like they have whiplash.\n A prime example is the Paris Agreement, the landmark international pact signed in 2015 under Obama to limit global warming. The US abandoned the non-binding agreement late last year on Trump's orders and the former president spent much of his time in office weakening many of the country's key climate and environmental guardrails.\n Biden's swift move to rejoin the accord is significant, especially with the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on the horizon.\n \"It sends a very important signal to the rest of the world on one of the biggest problems we face,\" said John Holdren, a professor of environmental science and policy at Harvard University who served as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Barack Obama. \"I think it is very important that the US demonstrates once again that it will take the global climate change challenge seriously.\"\n How long the US will take the challenge seriously for, however, is an open question.\n When Trump pulled out of the accord, it was not the first time that the US had left an international climate agreement after leading the negotiations. The US signed the Kyoto Protocol more than two decades ago under then-President Bill Clinton, only to bail a few years later under President George W. Bush.\n Speaking in the Senate on Thursday, Republican leader Mitch McConnell slammed Biden's decision to reenter the Paris Agreement as \"a terrible bargain that would set us up to self-inflict major economic pain on working American families.\"\n To prevent further flip-flops on climate policy, Biden would have to get Congress on side so that legislation can be passed that can't simply be overturned by a new administration, said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the US and the Americas Programme at UK-based think tank Chatham House and associate professor in international relations at SOAS University of London.\n \"If you don't go through the hard work of building the consensus that it takes and building the coalitions and striking the deals to get something through Congress, you just don't have staying power,\" she said. \"So, you know, in Paris one day, out of Paris the next -- it's not quite as quickly as that but you know it's pretty darn quick because it took a long time to unravel Paris.\"\n Meanwhile, the see-sawing between Republican and Democratic administrations over the Mexico City Policy, also known as the \"global gag rule,\" could carry on for as long as women's reproductive choices remain an ideological battleground for the two parties.\n The measure was initially put in place by the Reagan administration in 1984, and has since been rescinded and reinstated by subsequent administrations along party lines -- with the result that it has been in effect for 19 of the past 34 years, according to the non-profit organization KFF.\n The policy was last rescinded by the Obama administration in 2009. Three days after he was sworn in in 2017, Trump signed an executive action reinstating it.\n Even during the Obama years, US law banned direct funding for abortion services. But NGOs that performed the procedure were allowed to receive US funding for other programs, including those related to contraception access and post-abortion care.\n However, after Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, NGOs that offered or promoted abortions as part of their family planning services were prevented from receiving any assistance from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), one of the largest contributors to international development assistance.\n MSI Reproductive Choices, which describes itself as one of the world's leading providers of reproductive healthcare, urged Biden to follow the lead of past Democratic presidents in revoking the order, saying Thursday it would be \"a huge step forward into a new era.\"\n It argues the see-sawing on this policy has real consequences for women, particularly in developing countries. In a 2020 report, MSI -- formerly known as Marie Stopes International -- said continued USAID funding would have allowed it to serve an estimated 8 million women, preventing an estimated 6 million unwanted pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths.\n \"MSI has never and will never sign the Global Gag Rule and in 2017, this meant we were unable to access USAID funding. For many of our programmes, in Uganda, Madagascar and Nepal, to name but a few, this led to service closures, a recorded rise in unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions and a broader chilling effect, impacting partnerships and advocacy for women's healthcare,\" it said in a statement.\n \"We call on partners to not let the impact of the Global Gag Rule outlive Trump's presidency. Even if the Global Gag Rule is revoked, USAID funding would likely not be available in the near term to providers like MSI who took a stand against the Global Gag Rule, and any future funding would not cover safe abortion care.\"\n Another dizzying about-face with global repercussions concerns US membership of WHO, a body that has been at the forefront of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n Trump announced last year that the US was formally withdrawing from the body, after he said it \"failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms.\" The withdrawal was due to take effect in July 2021.\n But Biden issued an executive order on his first day halting that withdrawal.\n Global Health Council, which represents the global health community, welcomed Biden's re-engagement with WHO, having last year described Trump's move as a \"dangerous gamble.\"\n There's no guarantee that a future Republican president would not follow the precedent set by Trump and haul the country back out of WHO.\n But Kate Dodson, vice president for global health at the UN Foundation, said Biden's move was \"a welcome first step in restoring America's global health leadership\" and urged sustained US funding to help WHO safeguard the health of all people, including Americans.\n Biden appears to see an opportunity in the first, closely watched weeks of his presidency to repair some of the damage done to US credibility on the international stage by Trump's often knee-jerk actions.\n According to the draft calendar document seen by CNN, the focus for February is \"Restoring America's Place in the World.\"\n Steps the administration plans to take include an executive order which would reinstate the policy of closing Guantanamo Bay, and a memorandum on LGBTQI+ rights abroad.\n Biden's swift move to reverse Trump's ban on travel from certain Muslim majority countries may also help to reassure international partners.\n \"(The ban) sent a horrific signal to the rest of the world. So I think for the Biden administration it's been so important to say, we will have a very measured position on immigration,\" said Vinjamuri.\n European allies are well aware that 74 million American voters chose Trump, said Vinjamuri, and despite Biden's election victory they may be wary of placing too much trust in America.\n \"I think the big outstanding question for the UK and some of these European governments is what we're going to see in the next 100 days and, over the course of the four years, where America is really going to remain -- or do we need to protect ourselves against an erratic and unpredictable and constantly changing America?\" she said.\n Vinjamuri suggests that as they seek to reassure America's allies, the Biden team could try to show that the country's foreign policy commitments have staying power by making use of concrete mechanisms such as treaties and legislation to lock them in, rather than relying on executive actions.\n One example of this could be the Iran nuclear deal. Trump pulled the US out of the multilateral agreement -- negotiated by Obama and much disliked by US Republicans -- in May 2018.\n Rather than an immediate return to that deal, Vinjamuri predicts the Biden administration will embark on \"a real effort at consultation\" with Congress and work with Europe and regional partners such as Saudi Arabia and Israel in order to create \"something much more sustainable and which more people think will have traction.\"\n Biden has previously expressed a desire to return to the 2015 agreement, writing for CNN last year that Trump had \"recklessly tossed away a policy that was working to keep America safe and replaced it with one that has worsened the threat.\"\n But other signatories may need to be persuaded of America's longterm commitment. Since the Trump administration pulled out of the pact, imposing punitive sanctions on Tehran instead, Iran has resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity, far beyond the limits laid out in 2015.\n Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that \"the ball was \"in the US court now\" as he urged Biden to rejoin the deal. \"If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact,\" he said.\n CNN's Nikki Carvajal, Kevin Liptak, Drew Kann and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Inside Kamala Harris' historic first days",
        "body_text": "In the hours after her historic inauguration, Kamala Harris beamed into televisions across the country, delivering her first speech as vice president just steps beyond the sitting relic of Abraham Lincoln and a short distance from where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. shared his iconic words that inspired generations.\n \"Even in dark times, we not only dream, we do. We not only see what has been, we see what can be,\" she said. \"This is American aspiration.\"\n It was a notable move for a vice president to command so much of the spotlight alongside the new president on Inauguration Day.\n The decision to provide that visibility was a nod to her historic role as the nation's first female, Black and South Asian vice president, a source familiar with planning said. It sought to harness Harris' skyrocketing popularity, show progress and project her significance as President Joe Biden's diligent lieutenant.\n It's an example of the outsized role Harris is likely to have as Biden's governing partner and marks a contrast to the approach taken by President Donald Trump, who demanded the spotlight and relegated his own vice president to cleaning up his messes.\n Harris has been strategically visible as Biden's right-hand woman so far -- at his side as he signed executive order after executive order in the State Room and received private briefings on Covid-19 and the economy. She sat alongside Biden in the Oval Office as they received the President's Daily Brief, which was an occasional event for their immediate predecessors but a frequent occurrence when Biden served with President Barack Obama.\n The President and his No. 2 lunched together Friday, with Biden writing on Facebook, \"a new Administration means a new lunch partner.\" It's a tradition the White House says will continue and one Biden deeply valued in his years at Obama's side.\n Developing that relationship will be key as the pair forge their governing path for the next four years. While Biden spent more than four decades in the halls of Congress and the White House, Harris -- who served in the Senate for four years -- is a relative newcomer to the power corridors of Washington.\n Those close to the history-making vice president say she's navigating that new reality, familiarizing herself with the rhythm of the West Wing and executive government but eager to help solve the country's multiple crises.\n \"She was not joking when she said, 'It's time to get to work,' \" one White House official told CNN.\n In her first full day at the White House Thursday, Harris sat in her office mid-morning to read the letter left behind by Vice President Mike Pence. Aides declined to detail the contents of the letter, calling it private. But Harris and her predecessor have enjoyed a slightly more cordial, though still delayed, relationship than Biden and Trump have.\n Harris and Pence spoke by phone the week before the inauguration and again at the steps of the Capitol on Wednesday after the peaceful transfer of power. The two have left open the possibility of speaking in the future, an administration official said, similar to the conversations Biden had with Pence when Pence first took over the role of vice president.\n But those close to Harris say she'll lean on Biden himself as a blueprint for how to do the job.\n \"This is not hard for President Biden to do because he's lived it himself and he knows the value of it. He knows that he brought value to President Obama in multiple ways and he's going to want that out of Vice President Harris,\" said Jay Carney, who once served as Biden's vice presidential communications director.\n So far, Harris has spent most of her time working out of her office in the West Wing. While Biden's Oval Office is completely decorated, officials say Harris' is still a work in progress, missing sentimental relics and busts but outfitted by a deep navy blue wall and a handful of framed photos of her mother, husband, sister, niece and one of her and Biden.\n The former prosecutor will be adjusting to this new work life, as her own is in a type of upheaval. Instead of moving into the official vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory, Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff temporarily moved into Blair House on Thursday night, just across the street from the White House. It's a shorter commute, but one official cited increased security as the main benefit -- an upgrade from the hard-to-fortify mega-unit condo building Harris occupied in DC.\n Among the updates to the vice presidential home at the Naval Observatory are a replacement chimney liner and other household maintenance that would be \"more easily conducted with the home unoccupied,\" according to White House officials.\n A White House official said it is the Navy that manages the decades-old property and ordered the maintenance.\n Other possible updates could eventually include the kitchen, one source said. A self-proclaimed cooking aficionado, Harris shared recipes and cooking videos during the campaign. The new vice president has said she looks forward to returning to hosting Sunday night dinner with her family in an effort to create some normalcy.\n Officials and those closest to Harris contend that her portfolio and how she will define herself over time are directly linked to the pandemic and economic crises the Biden administration faces in his first term. At least initially, she'll have no specific portfolio as the duo works out which issues she should prioritize. It's an early arrangement that allows her to have a hand in everything from the start.\n \"She's focused on how her office can support and amplify the administration's agenda,\" said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser and top spokesperson for Harris.\n Harris has undertaken some solo ventures as well, including outreach to allies both foreign and domestic. On Friday, she spoke at an SEIU executive board meeting, according to a source, a private call left off her official daily guidance schedule. The day before, she spoke with the World Health Organization's Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a call that confirmed she's eager to beef up her foreign policy experience.\n In the days before Biden introduced his massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, Harris was deployed to call mayors across the country to preview the legislation.\n \"Right now, the President has laid out four big challenges which requires everyone bringing their best thinking to the table and she is committed to being the best partner she can for this President,\" Minyon Moore, the political operative veteran who managed Harris' transition, told CNN in an interview.\n As the new White House navigates the complexities of Covid-19, Harris is not expected to make foreign travel within the first six months of the new administration, an official said, but domestic travel could come sooner.\n Harris could also become a frequent face back on Capitol Hill, as she holds the title of Senate tie-breaker to the tenuous 50-50 majority Democrats. She's been vocal that she hopes to not cast any votes, instead aiming for \"common ground\" on legislation through bipartisanship.\n \"The goal is to not have to pass everything with 51 votes,\" a source added. \"If they're going to be votes in the Senate where the outcome isn't known ... She basically has to stay in DC. International trips, national trips to small businesses or wherever -- that can't really be happening, which is a new dynamic they're going to have to deal with.\"\n Another source spoke about it in more personal terms.\n \"It doesn't help her make friends long term, you know. If she's thinking about (running in) 2024 or 2028, she's got to think about what senators she's going to need,\" the source said.",

        "body_text": "More than 25 million people are under winter weather alerts from California through Michigan due to a winter storm developing in the Golden State and heading for the Midwest.\n Confidence is growing that a significant winter storm will be pushing through portions of the Midwest at the start of the week. Several locations could see heavy snowfall, gusty winds, and dangerous ice accumulations.\n At the same time, a series of systems are moving through the southwestern US where the moisture is much needed to help ease drought conditions.\n \"A pair of winter storms will impact the area Sunday and Monday afternoon into Tuesday with a good chance of valley rain and  mountain snow,\" according to the National Weather Service office in Tucson. \"The strongest and coldest storm is expected to start  Monday afternoon with lower snow levels possible and more significant accumulations in the mountains.\"\n Widespread rainfall across the desert southwest will be up to 1 inch, but snowfall across California, Arizona and Colorado could exceed 1 foot through Monday.\n Snow in the desert may sound like an oxymoron, but it depends on which desert you're referring to as elevation plays a key role and mountain range peaks vary widely. The forecast area for the National Weather Service office in Las Vegas includes portions of three major US deserts: the Great Basin, Mojave, and Sonoran.\n \"Elevation is a huge factor for snow in the Western US as elevation varies widely,\" said Jenn Varian, a weather service meteorologist in Las Vegas. \"Our forecast area has both the highest elevation and the lowest elevation point in the CONUS (continental United States). And they're in the same county!\"\n Varian is referring to Mt. Whitney, the tallest mountain in the 48 states at 14,505 feet in the Sierra Nevadas, and Badwater Basin, which is 282 feet below sea level in Death Valley. They are about 84 miles apart in Inyo County, California.\n This means snowfall accumulations will range from just a few inches for elevations of less than 4,000 feet to more than a foot of snow at elevations above 6,000 feet across Arizona, California and Nevada.\n Then another system is forecast to push through the region on Wednesday.\n \"The midweek system aligning with an atmospheric moisture surge has the potential to dump an extreme amount of precipitation, potentially flirting with snowfall duration records, in portions of southern California and the western Great Basin,\" Varian says.\n The region badly needs the rain and snow. Nearly 80% of the western US is under drought conditions, with nearly 25% under exceptional drought, the highest level possible.\n The first system will gradually shift from the Southwest into the central Plains and Midwest.\n A swath of very heavy snow will extend from northern Kansas to northern Illinois through Monday. Widespread snowfall totals of 6-8 inches, with over one foot possible across areas of Iowa.\n Ice is also in the forecast and could potentially accumulate up to a quarter inch across several states. For now, the highest confidence in ice exists from Topeka, Kansas to Philadelphia.\n Even though it is January, many Midwestern cities have with snowfall deficits this winter.\n Both Grand Rapids and Marquette, Michigan, are about 30 inches below normal for the season. Oddly, some Southern cities have actually seen more snow than ones in the Northeast.\n For instance, Amarillo, Texas, has had more than 15 inches of snow, surpassing Green Bay, Wisconsin, which has had 11, as well as Chicago with about 9 inches total.\n As of Saturday, Milwaukee has picked up 11.9 inches, which is the exact same amount as Oklahoma City.\n San Angelo, Texas, has had 5.8 inches, which is more than Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Louisville, Kentucky.\n At this point, the forecast snowfall across the Midwest is likely not enough to make up the difference in snowfall deficits in some of these cities.\n On the southern side of that same system pushing through the Midwest, moisture pulled up from the Gulf of Mexico will create conditions for moderate to heavy rainfall to develop. This could lead to an elevated threat for excessive rainfall and flash flooding conditions, especially for the southern Plains and the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys.\n From Oklahoma through Kentucky, rainfall totals of 1-3 inches are expected with isolated higher amounts.\n There is the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms across portions of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas on Sunday. Nearly 15 million people are under at least a marginal risk for tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail Sunday evening through early Monday morning.",

        "title": "7 strategies for truly restorative rest",
        "body_text": "Many people suffer from a chronic sleep deficit, and that was the case even before the pandemic hit -- bringing with it stress, fear and anxiety.\n A third of us get fewer than seven hours of shut-eye a night, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- and that's before you factor in the 50 million to 70 million Americans suffering from sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea.\n Poor sleep has been blamed for increased stress, weight gain, a decrease in our ability to be creative and a reduced ability to solve problems. For those people who get the recommended amount of sleep yet still feel tired, however, it's possible that we're not resting our bodies and minds in the ways needed to restore them.\n Board-certified internal medicine physician Dr. Saundra Dalton-Smith, author of \"Sacred Rest: Recover Your Life, Renew Your Energy, Restore Your Sanity,\" thinks so.\n These types of rest don't come from crashing on the sofa over the weekend with a string of Netflix shows in the queue. \"Rest is not simply the cessation of activity, the core of rest has to be restorative,\" she said.\n We talked to Dalton-Smith \u2014 who designed a free online quiz to better understand where your own rest deficit might lie \u2014 about how to prioritize the seven types of rest she deems important to everyone.\n Once you determine the optimal hours of sleep for you, play around with it. When you cut back by two hours because you stayed up watching a movie, see how it makes you feel. These kinds of internal assessments can help you figure out where your optimal level of sleep is.\n Active physical rest is different. It's the restorative activities you do to improve your muscle flexibility and increase your circulation and your body's lymphatic processes \u2014 yoga, stretching, leisurely walks and massage therapy are all things that can help with active physical rest.\n Look at your computer \u2014 do you have 10 tabs open at any given time? Our minds are constantly jumping from one thought to the next. Let's say you're someone who's trying to be mindful and in the moment \u2014 when you're home with your family, for example \u2014 but your mind wants to jump to your to-do list. Try making what I call a \"word chair.\" Focus on a single word and return to it. This is like when you ask a kid to sit still in a chair. It's hard because the child wants to bounce off the walls.\n Your word chair might be \"family.\" When your brain goes elsewhere, direct it back to the idea in your word chair and focus on what you need to be present. That's a way to achieve some mental rest.\n Another thing you can control is unnecessary noise. Downgrade the number of notifications on your devices so email and social media aren't putting a further demand on your sensory level by controlling when you engage with them. Turn off the TV when nobody is watching. Most of us do some of these restorative activities naturally \u2014 we intuitively know when it will make us feel better.\n You get social rest by being around people who don't need anything from you \u2014 you get fed from time in their presence. The people who don't need anything from who don't put demands on you \u2014 they're not the loud ones in your life. You have to intentionally make space for them.\n Terry Ward is freelance writer based in Tampa, Florida.",

        "body_text": "More than three dozen Capitol Police officers have tested positive for coronavirus since the Capitol riot on January 6, the union representing the Capitol Police told CNN Sunday.\n It's unclear how many of the 38 officers may have been on duty during the attack or when they contracted the virus. But health officials have worried that the mass of largely unmasked people, many shouting and pushing, would result in the spread of the virus. Several police officers were directly assaulted during the insurrection.\n By Friday, 19 Capitol Police officers had tested positive in the more than two weeks since the attack, Gus Papathanasiou, chair of the United States Capitol Police Labor Committee, told CNN in an email. The union could also not confirm that those officers were on duty the day of the attack.\n \"I do think you have to anticipate that this is another surge event. You had largely unmasked individuals in a non-distanced fashion, who were all through the Capitol,\"  former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield said in an interview earlier this month with the McClatchy newspaper group.\n Several lawmakers tested positive in the wake of the attack, with some Democrats saying they tested positive after sheltering in place with other members of Congress who were not wearing masks.\n \"Following the events of Wednesday, including sheltering with several colleagues who refused to wear masks, I decided to take a Covid test. I have tested positive,\" New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman tweeted on January 11.\n A statement from her office said that the congresswoman \"believes she was exposed during protective isolation in the US Capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots. As reported by multiple news outlets, a number of members within the space ignored instructions to wear masks.\"\n CNN has previously reported that six House Republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the US Capitol insurrection.\n Lawmakers and Capitol staff received a memo from the Capitol's attending physician warning of a possible risk of Covid-19 exposure after a large group of lawmakers were forced to gather in a secure location during the breach of the US Capitol.\n \"On Wednesday January 6, many members of the House community were in protective isolation in (a) room located in a large committee hearing space. The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others. During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection,\" Dr. Brian P. Monahan wrote in the January 10 memo.\n Clare Foran and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump is not a fascist. But that didn't make him any less dangerous to our democracy",
        "body_text": "Thomas Weber is professor of history and international affairs at the University of Aberdeen and author most recently of \"Becoming Hitler: The Making of a Nazi\" (Basic Books). Follow him on Twitter at @thomas__weber. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.\nOver the last five years, I have often wondered how political analysts who have compared Donald Trump's presidency to the rise of Nazi Germany would feel if a time machine sent them to Berlin in 1933. They would be stunned by the differences between then and now.\n Unfortunately, there are no signs of these comparisons abating anytime soon. In the wake of the attack on the US Capitol, alarmists warning of a fascist America have gone into overdrive. In a video he shared on Twitter, Arnold Schwarzenegger told us that the January 6 insurrection \"was the Day of Broken Glass right here in the United States.\"\n The action hero-turned-politician described the infamous anti-Jewish pogrom that presaged the Holocaust as \"a night of rampage...carried out in 1938 by the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys.\" His message: America's Night of the Broken Glass and \"selfishness and cynicism,\" if left unchallenged, could spiral out of control and bring democracy down.\n Schwarzenegger's message is noble, but the reference to Nazi Germany is a misguided one. The Night of the Broken Glass did not bring democracy down. That had already happened half a decade earlier. It was not carried out by the 1930s version of the Proud Boys -- it was a state-organized attack that resulted in 30,000 Jews being arrested and sent to concentration camps. And \"selfishness and cynicism\" had not paved the path to the pogrom.\n Schwarzenegger's intervention is a classic example of the historical record of European fascism being rewritten to fit political messages that warn against Donald Trump. The underlying message behind invocations of Europe's dark past is clear: Trumpism is fascism, and, even under Joe Biden's presidency, it is here to stay.\n Of course, there is some overlap between fascism and Trumpism, particularly in the use of demagoguery and the promise to restore the glory of the nation. While this overlap is well worth exploring, the alarmists who have performed public 'Gotcha!' dances every time Trump has used the playbook of demagoguery have missed one obvious point: All fascists are demagogues, but not all demagogues are fascists. Ignoring this crucial point blinds us to the real danger the core of Trumpism poses to democracy even with Trump out of the White House.\n As I said in an interview immediately after Trump was elected in 2016, \"My advice would really be to point out what is dangerous about Trump and a presidency of Donald Trump. By invoking Hitler, you run the risk that people will just somehow try to prove that Trump is not Hitler, and if Trump isn't Hitler than everything will be fine. My point is, Trump isn't Hitler, but things won't be fine.\" After four years, one may also add: Trumpism isn't fascism, but things won't be fine.\n Beyond their shared strategy of stirring up resentment, appealing to popular prejudices and peddling lies, Trump and Hitler are most similar in how they view the state of nature. Both would likely agree, if the world was left to its own devices, dog-eat-dog anarchy would reign supreme. Yet Trump and Hitler fundamentally differ in their conclusions on how to respond to this nature.\n Hitler thought the state of nature could and should be overcome, and that a strong and total state was the tool to do so. In keeping with fascist thinking, his starting point was that the pursuit of individual self-interest is poisonous to overcoming the state of nature. For fascists, individuals can only thrive as part of a collective, held together through common kinship and ideology and organized through a strong state.\n Trump's starting point is the exact opposite. For him, the pursuit of individual self-interest is paramount to all human existence. For Trump, it seems this pursuit is the glue that holds an intricate web of relationships together. Adhering to this principle is what helps manage the state of nature -- both within and between states -- even if it can't be overcome.\n The core of Trump's political philosophy is that the ruthless pursuit of individual self-interest allows people to thrive both individually and collectively. Kinship beyond family, ideology and the state -- unlike in fascism -- only exist in a transactional sense meant to remove any obstacles to the unobstructed pursuit of self-interest.\n This may be why notions of service, sacrifice and heroism seem incomprehensible to Trump. During a 2017 visit to Arlington National Cemetery, Trump reportedly said: \"I don't get it. What was in it for them?\" (The White House called the report \"false\" and Trump issued a denial on Twitter).\n Hitler's discussion of the role of the state in Mein Kampf rejects the Trumpian pursuit of self-interest and personal enrichment. \"The State,\" Hitler wrote, \"has nothing whatsoever to do with a definite conception of economics or development of economics.\" Hitler did not think the state's primary function was to drive the economy; instead, he considered the state as the great facilitator that would allow the German \"racial\" community to flourish collectively.\n Donald Trump, meanwhile, acted as if the state only existed as a transactional tool that he could wield at his will. It seems he was repeatedly baffled by the discovery that he did not have unlimited executive power but was bound by the Constitution and laws. He never seemed to comprehend that he needed to follow process in exercising power. When the Supreme Court justices he appointed, Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General William Barr upheld the Constitution, rather than do as he wished, Trump took it personally and considered Pence's refusal to overturn the election a betrayal. In Trump's world, letting him down personally also meant letting down and destroying all of America.\n Hitler and Trump, along with fascism and Trumpism, are all destructive to liberal democracy but in fundamentally different ways. Taking these distinctions seriously allows us better to understand the specific threat Trump posed and be better equipped to spot the warning signs of someone who might follow in his footsteps.\n Displaying a poor understanding of history, making faulty comparisons and crying wolf at the faintest signs of fascism could lead the world to become anesthetized to dangerous leaders when they actually try to use Hitler's playbook to consolidate their own power.\n There is another reason why it is important not to conflate Trump and Hitler, or Trumpism and fascism. In order for the US to heal, Americans need a clear-eyed view -- not at \"what stands between us / But what stands before us,\" to quote Amanda Gorman's beautiful inaugural poem. However, it is impossible to get to that point without first rebuilding mutual trust.\n Trust in each other -- the most important prerequisite in rebuilding America -- can only be reestablished if people are not showered with false accusations. If people have supported a bumbling emperor with no clothes for the last four years, we will not get through to them by calling them fascists. Yet, if we identify with clinical precision what is wrong with Trumpism -- rather than using the label of fascism where it does not apply -- all the while treating his supporters with empathy, we might have a shot at slowly rebuilding trust. And this trust is what will allow both sides of the political divide to engage in conversations about how supporting Trump, even if he is not a fascist, still brought the country to the verge of democratic breakdown.\n As we attempt to rebuild trust in each other, we need to do one more thing. It is time we turn to history to identify ways to heal our democracy and apply them to the digital age. What does history tell us about how can we heal our democracy? Due to our love of studying how things blew up, we know surprisingly little about how societies rebuild. If there's anything Trump taught us, it's how fragile our democracy is, even at the hands of a largely incompetent strongman. It is time we start doing the hard work of repairing our democracy.",

That's a level of devotion to regular religious services not seen from recent presidents, who were professed Christians but intermittently attended church or worshipped privately while in office.\n And while it's unclear whether he will adopt a permanent parish in Washington during his term, Biden's churchgoing will provide a window into how his spiritual side aligns with his politics.\n Biden was inside Holy Trinity for at least 35 minutes and his grandchildren, Maisy and Finnegan, and his son, Hunter, accompanied the President to Sunday's service. Asked how the service was, he replied, \"Lovely.\"\n Biden's motorcade then made a stop at Call Your Mother, a popular bagelry-deli in the area, to pick up an order. Call Your Mother retweeted a video of the motorcade on Sunday and called the visit a \"GREAT Sunday surprise.\"\n \"Thrilled to have an admin again who will love all that DC has to offer \u2014 starting with sesame bagels!! Come back anytime @JoeBiden,\" the post said.\n Catholicism has been an integral part of Biden's life, who has been a regular at Mass since childhood and attended Catholic schools. He married his late first wife, Neilia, in a Catholic church and peppers his political speech with quotes from Scripture, Catholic hymns and references to the nuns and priests he learned from in school.\n He frequented Holy Trinity during his time as vice president to former President Barack Obama. The church -- the oldest Catholic church in Washington, according to Holy Trinity -- was also regularly attended by the first US Catholic president, John F. Kennedy.\n The morning of his inauguration, Biden attended a service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, DC, with all four congressional leaders.\n This story has been updated with additional details of the President's Sunday outing.\n CNN's Michael Warren, Jason Hoffman and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Romney: Impeachment trial after Trump has left office is constitutional",
        "body_text": "Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said Sunday that he believes holding an impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump is constitutional, a position that puts him at odds with some of his Senate colleagues.\n \"I'll of course hear what the lawyers have to say for each side. But I think it's pretty clear that the effort is constitutional,\" Romney told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"\n The Utah Republican said that he's reviewed law review articles, which have shown that \"the preponderance of the legal opinion is that an impeachment trial after someone has left office is constitutional.\"\n \"I believe that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense. If not, what is?\" Romney said, referring to the impeachment article passed by the House earlier this month that charges Trump with inciting the deadly US Capitol riot on January 6.\n The comments from Romney, the only Republican senator to vote to convict Trump during his first impeachment trial, come one day before the House is set to formally walk the article of impeachment over to the Senate. The chamber plans to begin the former President's trial next month.\n Several Republican senators, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Roger Marshall of Kansas, have said they don't think it would be constitutional to convict Trump in the Senate after he's left office.\n The Constitution doesn't specifically address convicting an ex-president but simply says \"The President,\" vice president and all civil officers \"shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" A January 15 Congressional Research Service report noted most scholars have concluded that Congress does have the authority to impeach and convict a former president.\n A number of congressional Democrats have also dismissed the argument that trying Trump is unconstitutional. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal blasted such claims as \"bogus,\" saying that \"there's nothing in the Constitution that prevents any federal officer from being tried after they're out of office.\"\n While Romney appeared to support a trial in the Senate, he told Bash on Sunday the chamber shouldn't punish two of his GOP colleagues -- Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas -- for their role in objecting to the election results earlier this month. Seven Senate Democrats, in a filed complaint last week, called for the the Ethics Committee to investigate how their objections to the Electoral College votes on January 6 may have contributed to inciting the violent Capitol insurrection.\n \"I think history will provide a measure of judgment with regard to those that continue to spread the lie that the (former) President began with, as well as the voters in our respective communities,\" Romney said. \"I don't think the Senate needs to take action.\"\n Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, one of the House impeachment managers, told Bash later in the program that it was \"heartening\" to see  bipartisan support for Trump's impeachment earlier this month, adding she hopes \"more and more elected officials will pay attention to their oath and see the egregious high crimes and misdemeanors\" that the House says Trump committed.\n The former president's upcoming trial has worried some Democrats, who are concerned that it could get in the way of legislative priorities in the early days of President Joe Biden's tenure.\n Dean said she expects the trial to move faster than Trump's first impeachment trial did last year, but cautioned that it's important for Congress not to \"turn the page\" on the matter too quickly.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Sunday.\n CNN's Holmes Lybrand and Tara Subramaniam contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Why Biden's bipartisanship hope is probably already lost",
        "body_text": "If there was one big message from President Joe Biden's inaugural address, it was bipartisanship and unity. This theme wasn't surprising given that inaugurations are often about coming together and Biden's 2020 campaign emphasized unity over division.\n Still, the underlying political disagreements that have led to nastiness will almost certainly remain. There are deep divisions between us that cannot magically be solved.\n Americans are more divided by ideology than ever before in recent memory. According to Gallup, 51% of Democrats now consider themselves liberal. That 51% ties the highest percentage of Democrats saying they were liberal since Gallup started regularly measuring ideology by party in 1994. In that year, a mere 25% of Democrats called themselves liberal. Even when Biden ran for the presidency in 2008, a little less than 40% of Democrats were liberal.\n Likewise, the 75% of Republicans who call themselves conservative is the highest since 1994. It was just 58% of Republicans who were conservative in 1994 and 70% in 2008.\n But it's not just about individuals having different ideologies that make it hard for unity. Our interactions tend to be limited with those who disagree with us.\n Take a look at a Pew Research Center survey from last year. A mere 22% of Donald Trump and  Biden supporters said a lot or some of their close friends backed the other candidate. (It was down to 3% when isolating just the \"a lot\".)\n Now, obviously it's possible for folks to believe in different things and still find common ground.\n But it's more difficult when Republicans don't believe Biden's even a legitimate president. Only 19% of Republicans say he won enough votes to be legitimately elected, according to our last CNN/SSRS poll. That's much lower than the 58% of Democrats who said Trump was the legitimate winner in a comparable question from the ABC News/Washington Post after the 2016 election.\n LIkewise, most Republicans don't prize compromise with the Biden administration. When given a choice by Monmouth University pollsters between working together with Biden or keeping him in check, 67% of Republicans nationwide want to keep him in check.\n For reference, 50% of Democrats in a 2017 CNN/ORC poll wanted congressional Democrats to resist Trump's policies rather than attempt to compromise.\n In other words, today's Republicans are more resistant to their party compromising than Democrats were of their party at the beginning of the Trump presidency.\n Members of Congress, like their own constituents, don't seem like they're in the mood for unity.\n During the Trump administration, the average House Republican voted with him 92% of the time on legislation that came to the floor (and not every piece of legislation does). The average Democrat voted with him just 15% of the time. That 77-point gap between how often House Democrats and Republicans sided with the President is huge.\n To put that 77-point difference between how often Democrats and Republicans voted with the sitting president in some historical context, the difference was about 30 points in 1994 and 55 and 45 points in 2007 and 2008 respectively. We can, in other words, say that just like voters, members of Congress are also further apart than they used to be.\n Likewise, in the Senate, the place has increasingly come to a standstill because senators are using the threat of a filibuster to stall or stop legislation. You can see this by looking at the number of cloture motions filed to end a debate. It was 328 in the last Congress (2019-2020). In 2007-2008, it was 139. In 1993-1994, it was 80.\n It's plausible things will be different under Biden. Maybe the events of the last few weeks will make more people come to the table than would have before. Perhaps, Biden and the Democrats can pick off a few Republicans on some votes.\n If nothing else, we could see a change in the tone from the two sides. Maybe.\n But even after the insurrection on the US Capitol, about two-thirds of the House Republican caucus voted to sustain the objection to Pennsylvania's electoral votes -- challenging Biden's legitimate victory. That's no small vote. It was an illustration of just how far down the rabbit hole a lot of Republicans had gone.\n Indeed, the electoral incentives to come together in Congress are minimal.\n There are basically no members who represent states or congressional districts that vote opposite how they do on the presidential level.\n Almost every single Senate Republican, except for Susan Collins of Maine, represents a state that Trump won in either 2016 or 2020. Every single Senate Democrat, except for three, represents a state Biden won in 2020.\n Likewise, only about 10 congressional Republicans are in districts Biden won in 2020. While we're still waiting for some final precinct figures, it looks like even fewer than 10 congressional Democrats are in districts Trump won in 2020.\n There's going to be very little electoral pressure for members of either party to compromise. If anything, the pressure will be to avoid upsetting the base of their party.\n Once we get past any Biden honeymoon, the smart bet is for things to get nasty again.",

        "body_text": "Anthony Scaramucci is the co-founder of SkyBridge Capital and the SALT Conference. Brett Messing is the president and chief operating officer of SkyBridge. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n Smart investing is about balancing risk and reward. Typically, when analyzing potential pluses and minuses, financial professionals consider the fundamentals: How has the investment performed over time? What are the market trends? Do the company valuations look strong?\n Until recently, as an investment, bitcoin has had unique and pronounced risks, but that's changing, with new rules and regulations that have spurred wider institutional adoption.\n Throughout its 12-year history, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has faced extreme volatility, with prices rising and falling as much as 10% on any given day \u2014 reaching an all-time high of more than $41,000 earlier this month. Beyond wild price swings, bitcoin also has structural issues that most asset classes don't have to consider, like lost or stolen password keys, which can wipe out someone's entire investment.\n Fortunately, bitcoin's rapid growth has caused government and institutions to step in and address many of the risks associated with the digital currency, with the US Office of Comptroller of Currency authorizing banks and custodians to provide cryptocurrency services, which eliminate these types of problems.\n In short, bitcoin has matured \u2014 though it's still in an early adoption phase \u2014 and now offers significant long-term value.\n Since the onset of Covid-19, the federal government has allocated nearly $4.5 trillion in spending for direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment, small business loans and other types of financial supports \u2014 with more likely to come, as detailed in President Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion relief package. Though deficit spending is necessary for the long-term health of the economy, it also poses potential for inflation. In the past four years alone, the national debt rose about $7.6 trillion to $27 trillion.\n To hedge against this type of volatility, many investors are scooping up bitcoin, which, because of its very nature, is impervious to inflation. There can ever only be 21 million bitcoins in existence, due to a stipulation in its source code. By the law of supply and demand, that makes bitcoin a limited \u2014 and in-demand \u2014 asset.\n At the same time, increased regulations, improved infrastructure and access to financial institutions \u2014 like Fidelity \u2014 that hold investors' money have made bitcoin investments as safe as owning bonds and commodities like gold, which are also used to balance portfolios.\n When gold rallied from 2001 to 2011, it was largely because the era of tight monetary policy had come to an end due to the Fed reducing the funds rate targets. In 2012, the value of gold fell when fears of inflation receded and the stock market soared.\n You might then ask: If bitcoin is volatile, how can it also guard against volatility? Though bitcoin has experienced dramatic price shifts over the years, much of that movement can be attributed to the newness of the asset class and lack of regulation. Today, that's changing with recently enacted regulations coupled with the entrance of large players, including macro funds, large hedge funds and life insurance companies, no doubt drawn to the more stable environment. While price fluctuations aren't going to go away entirely, we view bitcoin as a long-term value proposition that should only grow over time.\n With major institutions now bullish on bitcoin, investors may have a different worry \u2014 that they've effectively missed the boat. But history proves otherwise. Amazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world. In each of Amazon's first 12 years, the stock's high price was, on average, more than double its open price. But investing in Amazon over the last 12 years has remained highly profitable.\n When investing in an emerging asset class, there is always an inflection point \u2014 a moment where there is enough of an infrastructure to allow for wider adoption while still leaving room for appreciation. We believe that we're at that moment with bitcoin.\n The strongest indicator of bitcoin's value is the sheer size of its market capitalization \u2014 more than $600 billion. If we were to look at that through the prism of the S&P 500, it would make bitcoin a top 10 company in the world, having gone from zero to half a trillion in just 12 years. Only a few companies, like Facebook and Tesla, have grown that fast.\n When the world is spinning out of control, it's natural to want to invest in something tangible, like gold. But bitcoin is valuable because of \u2014 not despite \u2014 it's intangibility. You can always mine for more gold. Bitcoin is unique among assets as the first store of value in the world where supply is completely unaffected by increased demand.",

        "body_text": "In her Ohio hometown, she's known as an Army veteran who runs a bar and set up a small\u202fself-styled militia\u202fher boyfriend says she created to help neighbors if tornadoes hit.\n To the FBI, she's a\u202fmilitant leader who traveled to Washington, DC, and stormed the US Capitol, encouraging\u202fothers to do the same.\n The two worlds of Jessica Watkins crashed into each other in the\u202fsmall\u202fvillage of Woodstock, Ohio, when FBI agents turned up early one morning to arrest her for her alleged role in the January\u202f6\u202finsurrection.\n \"We could hear so many sirens. And then we heard them yelling for her to come downstairs with her hands up and she did not,\" said Emma Dixon, who witnessed the pre-dawn raid from a home across the street.\n Watkins was seen on video taking part in the insurrection that is linked to the deaths of five people and that terrified lawmakers, who were forced to run to hiding places, fearing for their lives.\n When the FBI arrived in Woodstock, Watkins was not there. Her boyfriend, Montana Siniff was. He told CNN disorientating flash-bangs were used.\u202f\u202fA window was broken. It remained that way days later.\n FBI agents\u202fquestioned him and eventually\u202fleft, he said. In a complaint filed in court, federal prosecutors said agents\u202frecovered what \"appears to be directions for making explosives, authored by 'the Jolly Roger.'\" Jolly Roger is also the name of Watkins' bar and a Facebook account believed to be linked to her, authorities say.\n \"That is entirely false. She hates explosives. There is no moral or lawful way to really make use of explosives as a regular citizen,\" Siniff said.\n Watkins, 38,\u202fis now detained at the Montgomery County Jail, about 50 miles away in Dayton,\u202fafter she handed herself in to authorities last Sunday.\n Records show Watkins served in the Army under a different name from April 2001 to December 2003. She was deployed to Afghanistan from September to December 2002.\n Watkins is accused, along with two other military veterans, of\u202fa multitude of charges: conspiracy,\u202fconspiracy to impede an officer, destruction of government property, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n The\u202fthree veterans were the first\u202fto face conspiracy charges, some of the most severe charges so far for those who breached the Capitol on January 6.\n CNN has found a disproportionate number of people charged in the Capitol attack are former members of the military.\n No one disputes that Watkins went to the Capitol to protest against the certification of President Joe Biden's election win.\u202fShe is seen on video bragging about it while inside the Capitol building.\n Her boyfriend said she went to \"help protect some Trump VIP members within the rally,\" but he did not know whom.\n After breaching the Capitol, Watkins described the scene inside the building as she saw it.\n She told the Ohio Capital Journal: \"To me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw until we started hearing glass smash. That's when we knew things had gotten really bad.\"\n She added: \"It was some people hijacking what started off as a peaceful movement.\"\n But the words on her Parler account after the breach offer a very different perspective. They are highlighted in the federal complaint against her.\n \"Yeah. We stormed the Capitol today. Teargassed, the whole, 9. Pushed our way into the Rotunda. Made it into the Senate even,\" she wrote.\n Another post from Watkins\u202fused as evidence\u202fby the FBI said: \"We never smashed anything, stole anything, burned anything, and truthfully we were very respectful with Capitol Hill PD until they attacked us.\u202f Then we stood our ground and drew the line.\"\n Watkins and many others came to Washington trained in warfare, some wearing their combat gear of ballistic helmets, Army fatigues and goggles.\n Videos showed one group of more than a dozen people, in formation, hands on each other's shoulders, marching up the Capitol steps.\n Federal prosecutors say Watkins and others used the Zello phone app, which works like a walkie-talkie, to communicate and plan the assault.\n Watkins has yet to have an attorney assigned to her. But her boyfriend did talk on her behalf. The two own the Jolly Roger bar together. They are both members of the group she \"commanded\" called the\u202fOhio State Regular Militia. \"She's not a violent person,\" Siniff told CNN. \"She can be very spirited, but she is a very good person at heart and she just really wants to try to help people.\"\n But law enforcement and many of the lawmakers inside say the rioters that breached the Capitol put lives in danger.\n Siniff said Watkins formed the militia to help victims of tornadoes when local authorities were absent or overwhelmed.\n There's a long history of paramilitary groups setting themselves up in rural areas of Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere,\u202fand\u202fthe FBI says sometimes there is a darker side.\n Watkins is a member of the Oath Keepers, a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country.\n There is no private citizen militia that exists in the US. A militia has to be sanctioned by the state.\n The Oath Keepers are clear that they try to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders and\u202f police, and its name refers to the oath taken to \"defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"\n In court documents the FBI says, \"Oath Keepers will violate federal law if they believe their cause is just.\"\n Watkins' alleged co-conspirators are named by the FBI as Donovan Crowl, a former Marine, and Thomas Caldwell, who served in the Navy.\n Crowl lives just down the street from Watkins' Jolly Roger bar and was a regular there.\n Neighbors told CNN that Watkins would try to recruit people when they came into the bar. Most didn't take her up on it. But Crowl did join Watkins and Siniff in their armed group.\n \"When drunk, he's the guy you want to shut up. \u202fWhen sober the best man you could have,\" Siniff said of the former Marine. \"The militia was a good thing to help him ... like it was a reason to be sober.\"\n CNN has reached out to Crowl's attorney but has not received a response.\n Crowl's criminal record shows charges for domestic abuse and drunk driving, some of which resulted in conviction. This was noted by the federal judge when his attorney tried to get him released before his trial. His attorney said he merited release as he was not a danger to society.\n \"He's seen on video saying, 'we overran the Capitol,' his criminal history includes violence and alcohol offenses, he also demonstrated prior non-compliance.\u202fThe suggestion to release him to a residence with nine firearms is a non-starter,\" Judge Sharon Ovington said. Crowl was remanded back into custody awaiting a preliminary hearing in Ohio.\n Crowl's mother, Teresa Joann Rowe,\u202ftold CNN her son has expressed increasingly hostile political views\u202fin recent years.\n \"It felt like he did a 180-degree turnaround, felt like the world owed him a living and had a big chip on his shoulder,\" Rowe said. \"I don't know if it's because life didn't go the way he planned.\"\n Asked why she thinks Crowl may have been drawn to this extremist group, she said, \"I would like to understand myself. I don't get it.\"\n Caldwell, the third veteran named as a co-conspirator, lives in a secluded property down a country road in Berryville, Virginia, 400 miles from the Woodstock homes of Watkins and Crowl.\n It is unclear how long Caldwell knew Crowl and Watkins.\u202f But the FBI says they met up in Washington, DC.  Crowl took video of himself and Watkins inside the Capitol and posted it on social media.\n Outside the Capitol Caldwell made his feelings clear on January 6.\n \"Everyone single b**** in there is a traitor, every single one,\" he screamed in a video, appearing to refer to the legislators inside.\n Caldwell was a name in his local Virginia political circles. He was a delegate to the Clarke County, Virginia, Republican convention last year.\n A lawyer temporarily assigned to Caldwell said at a detention hearing that his opposition to Biden's election win was not out of the ordinary, and that he was not accused of a violent crime.\n But the judge disagreed: \"The conduct and statements of Mr. Caldwell and the others, it really is just pure lawlessness,\" Magistrate Judge Joel Hoppe of the federal court in Harrisonburg, Virginia, said on Tuesday.\n The village of Woodstock is home to about 300 people. Many of the homes are clustered around the crossroads, and the only traffic signal still fly \"Trump 2020\" banners.\n There is also the \"Don't Tread on Me\" or Gadsden flag of the American Revolution and a Stars and Stripes being flown upside down -- a signal of \"dire distress,\" according to the US code.\n Some of the villagers were hostile to our CNN crew, calling the local sheriff to complain twice. Others were happier to talk and argued with their neighbors to back off.\n And even after all the video and social media posts showing Watkins ranting about storming the Capitol, Watkins's boyfriend defends her.\n \"I do not believe the charges of conspiracy are\u202fat all fair,\" Siniff said.\n CNN's Curt Devine contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Schools across Africa shutdown as Covid cases spike across the continent",
        "body_text": "As a second wave of coronavirus spreads through parts of Africa, countries across the continent are shutting down schools to control the spread of the virus.\n Malawi was the latest to close schools when President Lazarus Chakwera announced that they would close for three weeks after a sharp rise in numbers.\n The country had reported no cases for more than two months but now they have spiked and a third of the 353 total deaths have occurred in the past two weeks, according to John Hopkins University data.\n \"The time has come to enforce these things for the common good,\" Chakwera said in a television address on Sunday. Students in boarding schools will however remain on campus until health authorities determine whether it is safe for them to go home.\n Government officials\u00a0have died from the virus including\u00a0Malawi's transport minister and another senior cabinet member\u00a0who passed away last week.\n Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo, died on Wednesday after contracting the virus, as did South Africa's Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, on Thursday.\n Chakwera\u00a0said he has ordered an increase in the number of testing sites and recruited additional medical personnel, noting that the facilities in the country are terribly understaffed.\u00a0The president said he has directed the Minister of Finance to allocate around $23 million as soon as possible' to meet the demands of the current disaster.\n In neighboring Zambia, schools were scheduled to reopen on January 18 but this has been delayed by a further two weeks due to rising case numbers. They will now open on February 1, authorities said.\n Zimbabwe, like Malawi, has only allowed examination classes to open, but under strict Covid-19 rules.\n Rwanda has closed schools in the capital, Kigali, with the possibility of school closures in other regions too if more cases are confirmed, according to the country's education minister. The cabinet ordered a total lockdown of the city on Monday.\n However, in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, schools reopened on January 18 despite opposition from some lawmakers and a rising number of cases in the country.\n \"After extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders... the consensus of opinion is that the resumption date of 18th January should remain, while parents and respective institutions must ensure full compliance with COVID-19 protocols...\" the federal ministry of education said in a a statement.\n Nigeria registered 1,386 new cases and 14 deaths on Wednesday, according to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, with Lagos alone having 476 cases. The number of cases in the country passed 110,000 on Monday.\n Parents there told CNN they are concerned about the decision to send children back to school.\n Brenda Uphopho, a festival director from Lagos, said she opted to keep her nine-year-old son at home.\n \"I don't understand why this is happening,\" she said. \"I am so distressed and angry. It is OK for kids to miss out on school? They can catch up on their studies when it is safe.\"\n \"Given the pressure experienced by the health system in the past few weeks, occasioned by increased COVID-19 infections which has led to the second wave, the Council of Education.. has taken the decision to delay the reopening of both public and private schools,\" Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Reginah Mhaule, MP said in a statement.\n South Africa registered 12,710 new cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of infections to nearly 1.4 million. 566 died from the virus, with another 839 fatalities the day before, according to John Hopkins University data.\n In Malawi, hospitals have been 'overwhelmed' with patients and empty beds are scarce. Medical supplies including ventilators have also been in short supply.\n He has since called for support from donors, including the United Nations.\n But there has been criticism over the government's handling of the virus. A recent report by Oxfam indicates that the previous government -- which lost power last June following a presidential election rerun -- used 80% of the funds raised for the Covid-19 fight on allowances. The charity warned the current government against repeating the same mistakes.\n Onjezani Kenani, a campaigner who has been calling on the government to equip the hospitals with medical supplies and personal protective equipment, asked for donations to assist hospitals through a Facebook post on January 15.\n \"Friends I prefer action,\" he said. \"We can be pointing out things our government is not doing right, but the fact is that the people are suffering out there and some are dying. As the government does its part, you and I can chime in and do ours.\"\n \"I am calling for donations so that we can buy oxygen pressure regulators - they enable oxygen cylinders to deliver oxygen to patients,\" said Kenani, whose fund has raised $100,000 so far.\n \"I therefore applaud the efforts of private citizens who are already running capital campaigns to raise money to go towards these needs,\" said president Chakwera, acknowledging the effort. \"I would like to call on private sector companies to follow this example and practice their corporate social responsibility in this critical hour.",

        "title": "What Latinos want to hear from Biden",
        "body_text": "Ed Morales (@SpanglishKid) is a journalist and lecturer at Columbia University's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race and the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. He's the author of the book \"Fantasy Island: Colonialism, Exploitation and the Betrayal of Puerto Rico.\" The views expressed are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nThe installation of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States was a welcome relief from four years of Donald Trump's constant demonization of Latinos, from separating immigrant children from their families to building his border wall to tossing paper towels at hurricane-ravaged Puerto Ricans. Inauguration Day featured the New York-bred Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, of Puerto Rican heritage, swearing in Vice President Kamala Harris, fellow Nuyorican Jennifer Lopez quoting the Pledge of Allegiance in Spanish, and the revival of \"La Casa Blanca,\" the Spanish-language page on the White House website.\n But it's going to take more than just J-Lo's remix of Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" and some symbolic gestures of inclusion to address the needs of US Latinos, a sometimes united but often fragmented ethno-racial group which too often feels overlooked. The question for Latinos, whose role in electing the new President has been endlessly debated, is how much they really figure into the Biden agenda.\n The promise of the new administration's planned executive actions, as well as hints of a legislative agenda, constitutes some hopeful signs for Latinos, although according to many activists, history has shown they must continue to press for their concerns.\n At least Biden won't fall into the trap of pandering to Latinos by trying to speak to them in superficial Spanish phrases, like other candidates -- he openly admits he just plain mangles it. Just what his presidency can really do for Latinos begins with targeted actions that point directly to Latinos, like immigration reform, policy toward the Mexican border, Cuba, South America and the unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico.\n Some of these have already been addressed in a series of executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day. Although it appears symbolic, the Biden immigration reform proposal to change the word \"alien\" to \"noncitizen\" is extremely significant because it breaks a pattern of dehumanization and stereotyping that props up the language of systemic racism.\n But other reforms, such as re-organizing the nation's Covid-19 response, continuing the freeze on student loan payments, criminal justice reform, a moratorium on evictions, expanding access to health care and higher education, and climate change, though not specifically targeted to Latinos, can have greater impact. While many Latinos are passionate about immigration reform, it is clear that issues that affect the broader population can be even more important. Only 34% of Latinos in the US are foreign born but are significantly plagued by wealth inequality, lack of access to quality health care and the fallout from mass incarceration.\n One of the first clear signals Biden has sent to show that he takes Latinos seriously is his attempt to diversify his Cabinet, naming several Latinos to key posts, such as Mexican American Xavier Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Puerto Rican Dr. Miguel Cardona as Secretary of Education, and Cuban Alejandro Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland Security. Latinos can also celebrate the naming of former California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to replace Vice President Kamala Harris in the Senate.\n But the unexpected Latino turnout for Trump in states like Florida sends a strong signal that the Biden administration, and the core of the Democratic Party, must continue to find ways to respond to Latino voters and their concerns. Taking bold actions to reduce or eliminate Puerto Rico's more than $70 billion debt, as proposed by both Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, could go a long way to push back against Biden's shaky showing among Latinos in Florida. And rolling back the Trump administration's increasingly punitive measures toward Cuba might gain more support from Florida Cubans than previously thought possible.\n The Biden administration may face an early test with the expected increase in a wave of asylum seekers from Central America in the first months of the new year. While Republicans are already cynically portraying this as the result of a Democratic \"open borders\" policy, the real reasons stem from two recent, absolutely devastating hurricanes, as well as drought and economic woes. Biden must improve on both Trump's cruel policies toward Central America as well as former President Barack Obama's misguided deportation policies, recognizing the importance of how US foreign and border policy can negatively impact Latinos living in the country.\n Latinos still struggle with wealth and employment gaps, over-representation in the prison system, lack of parity in education and home-ownership rates, despite outnumbering White non-Hispanics in California and almost equal to non-Hispanic Whites in Texas. While some advocates point to a history of disproportionately low levels of Latinos among local and federal elected officials, the Biden administration could make up for that lack in quantity with the quality of their concern for Latino issues.\n While Biden's declaration that \"democracy has prevailed\" brings some solace to a nation looking forward to restoring its political viability, his administration needs to work on its shaky economic reality, one that affects Latinos and other marginalized groups critically. With Democratic control of both legislative houses, this is their chance to create the conditions that would expand support for Democrats among Latinos so that it could come closer to the level demonstrated by African Americans for many decades.",

        "body_text": "In his first directive since taking office, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is ordering senior Pentagon leadership to send him reports detailing their efforts to prevent sexual assault and harassment, as well as what accountability measures have been implemented and an assessment of whether those efforts worked.\n \"President Biden has ordered a 90-day commission to pursue solutions to sexual assault in the military. We will aggressively support that effort. But I do not want to wait 90 days to take action,\" Austin wrote in a memo issued Saturday.\n Austin, who is the first Black man to serve as Secretary of Defense, committed to \"stamp out\" sexual assault in the military during his confirmation hearing telling lawmakers, \"The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies. But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.\"\n Sexual assault and harassment have been a scourge on the military for years with one of the latest examples being the death of Army Pfc. Asia Graham, who was found dead in her barracks at Fort Bliss on December 31 after reporting an alleged sexual assault by a fellow soldier last June.\n According to data from the Department of Defense, formal sexual harassment complaints reported to military services and the National Guard Bureau increased 10% in 2019 from 2018, when there were 932. The data for 2020 has not yet been made available.\n Austin concluded the memo writing, \"This is a leadership issue. We will lead.\"",

        "title": "Biden urges patience as frustration grows over vaccine supply",
        "body_text": "While outlining his plan to halt the spread of the coronavirus last week, President Joe Biden tempered his ever-present optimism with a dose of realism about the potent staying power of this deadly pandemic and the fact that the nation's vaccine distribution system is a long way from becoming an efficient machine.\n \"Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better,\" the new President said, noting that the US is likely to cross a half-million deaths next month as cases continue to mount. \"We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around.\"\n For many Americans who feel trapped in a never-ending season of grief, isolation and disappointment, the start of a new year, a new administration and a new Congress seemed to offer hope -- however na\u00efve it was -- that there would be some flip of a switch that could speed up the nation's lurching process for getting shots into arms.\n But even as Biden announced a series of executive actions last week intended to curb the pandemic, the reality is sinking in that Americans may be stuck in this maddening purgatory for quite a while longer -- with their state governments finally in possession of vaccines that can protect them, but most people still finding them out of reach.\n In the flurry of White House activity last week, scientists and epidemiologists hailed the actions Biden took with the stroke of his pen -- which included harnessing the Defense Production Act to produce more vaccine supplies like needles, syringes and PPE; aid to states in setting up community vaccination clinics; a strong push to ensure vaccine equity in Black and Brown communities; and the promise that they will find a way to get more doses out to community pharmacies.\n But at a time when thousands of Americans are still dying each day, it is still not clear how much of an impact the Biden administration can make on the biggest problem facing the nation right now -- that there simply aren't enough vaccine doses available for people who desperately want to return to some sense of normalcy.\n On a call with reporters this week, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said the administration could not yet estimate when the vaccine will be \"widely available\" to the general population, in part because what they inherited from the Trump administration is \"so much worse than we could have imagined.\"\n Biden's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra also repeatedly refused to give CNN's Dana Bash a timeline for how long it would take to get Americans fully vaccinated, instead comparing the current situation to a plane in a nosedive.\n \"Once we're in the house, taking care of business, we'll be able to give more precision,\" Becerra said Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" \"But you've got to give us a chance to figure out what's going on in the cockpit, that's causing this plane to nosedive so severely.\"\n On Saturday, the US finally hit that elusive target that the Trump administration had set for the end of last year: 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered, according to new data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC also said that just shy of half (49.6%) of the doses delivered to states have been administered.\n Asked to explain that puzzling gap between expectations and reality, Dr. Anthony Fauci said last week that there is no clear answer.\n \"What I think we really need to do is we've got to go into the trenches,\" Fauci told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day,\" noting that federal officials are hearing from people in some localities where doses aren't being given out and other states that are in desperate need of more doses. \"You've got to get into the local area and find out 'What's going on here?' 'What's wrong?' Let's try and fix it.' \"\n In the midst of that frustration over the pace of vaccinations, Biden is continuing to face heat over whether his goal of administering 100 million doses in a 100 days is too low a bar, given that the US is already averaging almost a million doses a day.\n White House chief of staff Ron Klain on Sunday insisted that it was \"still a very bold and ambitious goal\" and said the administration is working expeditiously to get more vaccine, more vaccinators and more vaccine sites.\n \"Obviously we're not going to stop there -- 100 million people, 100 million shots, is an ambitious goal but we need to keep going after that so,\" Klain said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"That is our first goal. It's not our final goal. It's not the endpoint. It's just a metric that the American people can watch and measure how we're doing.\"\n National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, who said Saturday on MSNBC that the vaccine rollout in the US is \"not as bad as some people are painting it,\" said it was wise for Biden's team to avoid setting expectations too high with their 100-day goal.\n \"We might easily exceed that, but I think he's being smart,\" Collins said of the 100 million doses. \"Instead of overpromising and underdelivering, which is sort of what happened back in December, he's going to kind of under promise and then hope to overdeliver.\"\n But that is cold comfort to Americans still terrified of losing their loved ones before vaccines becomes available to them.\n Given that vaccine manufacturers are already working at full capacity, it seems unlikely that vaccine supply will increase until this spring when more vaccines are expected to be authorized for emergency use. In the meantime, states are still struggling from week to week to understand how many doses they will get -- creating a major kink in the distribution process. The Biden team said this past week that they are redoubling efforts to fix that problem and create more transparency in the process.\n Pfizer/BioNTech has promised to supply 200 million doses to the US government by July, and Moderna has said it will supply the same amount by the end of June. (Both vaccines require two doses).\n If Johnson & Johnson were to get emergency use authorization from the FDA within the next few weeks, Fauci said Saturday on MSNBC that the number of vaccine doses available to Americans could dramatically increase by May.\n \"Once they get going into May, June, July, August, then you're going to see a sharp escalation of additional doses of this one-dose vaccine,\" Fauci said, adding that change would make it more likely that 70 to 85% of Americans could be vaccinated by the end of the summer.\n But those dates on the calendar seem very far away, and states are still struggling from week to week to understand how many doses they will get -- creating a major kink in the distribution process -- even though the Biden team says they are redoubling efforts to fix that problem and create more transparency in the process.\n Some two-thirds of Americans now say that they intend to get vaccinated, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, which is an increase from the 51% who said the same in October.\n But a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll also reflected the level of confusion about how to get the vaccine among some of the highest priority groups. About six in ten adults who are 65 and older say they do not have enough information about when and where they will be able to get the vaccine. More Black and Hispanic adults -- groups that have been disproportionately affected by the virus -- were likely to say they don't have enough information about where to get the vaccine (six in ten) compared with about half of White adults who said the same. Overall, two-thirds of adults said the federal government was doing a \"fair\" or \"poor\" job distributing the vaccine to states. The survey was conducted January 11-18, before Biden took office.\n Since the Trump administration announced that it was expanding eligibility criteria for the vaccine to include those 65 and older, the race to book appointments for eligible loved ones and neighbors has felt like a form of the Hunger Games for those who are lucky enough to have laptops and WiFi and time to engage in that process.\n Many Americans have spent hours online scrolling for a coveted appointment slot, rushed to fill out the patient's information, and then, in many cases, felt the surge of disappointment when hitting submit only to find out that the slot was already gone.\n As vaccine supply has dwindled in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, vaccination appointments are getting canceled because there are not enough doses. Meanwhile unofficial, non-appointment standby lines -- for surplus vaccine doses that might be given away to those who aren't yet eligible -- are springing up outside clinics that actually have it.\n In California, which hit a single-day record for deaths last week, state epidemiologist Erica Pan said during a vaccine advisory panel meeting last week that at the current pace that the state is receiving doses, it could be June before the state is able to vaccinate just the residents in the current eligibility category who are 65 and older.\n Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti acknowledged that some people waited as long as five hours for their vaccine shots at the mass vaccination clinic at Dodger Stadium this week. Los Angeles County officials tried to tamp down expectations about the number of people who get vaccinated by noting that they have more than enough providers ready to administer the vaccine, but only enough vaccination supply to inoculate 1 in 4 people who are currently eligible.\n New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy was one of many governors voicing frustration with the limited supply of vaccine doses this week, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer that widespread vaccinations will take much longer than anyone predicted.\n \"I think the Biden team has found that the cupboard is a lot barer than anyone thought,\" Murphy, a Democrat, told Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\"\n \"I'm not as worried about running out as I am about not getting enough... We've got a huge supply-demand imbalance.\"\n This story has been updated with additional comments from President Joe Biden's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and White House chief of staff Ron Klain.",

        "body_text": "The NFL championship games this weekend will determine who goes to the Super Bowl, and there's more at stake for some of the teams than a win.\n Whether one of your teams is playing on Sunday, both games have historic value, and will be exciting match-ups to watch.\n The obvious players to watch in this game will be the veteran quarterbacks, and for good reason.\n Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers has a 2020 regular season completion rate over 70% and is first in the league in touchdowns with 48 this season. Rodgers has reached the playoffs 10 seasons and has appeared in 19 playoff games, including winning one Super Bowl.\n Tampa Bay's Tom Brady is considered by many as the G.O.A.T of NFL quarterbacks with 43 playoff appearances in 18 years of postseason play, including nine Super Bowls, winning six times. This is his first season with the Bucs, so his leadership is definitely in the spotlight.\n Both teams have a little something that will light the fire underneath them.\n For the Bucs, if they win, this will only be the second time ever the team has reached the Super Bowl. With Brady at the helm for the first time, there is a lot riding on their success.\n As far as Green Bay is concerned, it's the quarterback face-off that really stands to bring some heat. Can Rodgers outplay Brady?\n Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes has cleared concussion protocol after suffering a hit last week against the Browns, and will be ready to go for the game.\n Travis Kelce, the Chiefs' heavily used tight end, is always a go-to for Mahomes. With 11 touchdowns and over 1,400 yards on the season, Kelce is the 6-foot-5 260 pound offensive weapon for Kansas City, and they should look to him in this match-up.\n Wide Receiver Tyreek Hill, who has been an asset for the Chiefs all season, will also be a key player to watch. Hill is currently second in the league for touchdowns with 15 overall, and his season total of 1,276 yards is in the top 10. However, Hill has not scored a touchdown in the postseason, so he will be looking to get his first 6.\n Bills' quarterback Josh Allen has had an uphill battle as an underdog all season, but he is looking to surpass 350 passing yards in this game. Allen has a 69.2% completion rate and already has three post season touchdowns.\n Allen will be looking for wide receiver Stefon Diggs to have his third straight game at over 100 receiving yards and a touchdown. He is first in the league for both total yards and total receptions.\n The Bills are definitely the underdogs heading into the game against the current Super Bowl champions. The Chiefs have been dominating all season, but the Bills are looking to punch their ticket to big game for the first time since 1994. The Bills Mafia, as their fans are called, are ready for a renewed reason to cheer.",

The property owner told police that the basement was supposed to be empty and police are still investigating who was running the establishment, WCVB reported.\n Lawrence is about 28 miles north of Boston and has a population of 80,028 people, according to the latest Census Bureau estimate.\n The city has reported 16,403 cases of Covid-19 and 211 deaths, according to the Lawrence Board of Health.

        "body_text": "Robert Saleh, the new head coach for the New York Jets, is making history as the first Muslim American to lead a team in the National Football League.\n Saleh is also the third Arab American NFL head coach -- joining Abe Gibron and Rich Kotite -- according to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).\n The Lebanese American said in his introductory news conference on Thursday it was \"humbling\" to be the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.\n \"Especially back home, where I'm from, Dearborn, Michigan, there is a lot of pride so it's a very humbling experience,\" Saleh said. \"When you look at an NFL organization and you look at the locker room, it's like the ultimate melting pot of different people and different races and different stories that get together with one goal. To be a part of that is special.\"\n Saleh spent the past four seasons as the San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator, helping lead the team to Superbowl LIV in 2020.\n Prior to his time with the 49ers, Saleh was a defensive assistant with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Seattle Seahawks and Houston Texans.\n Under his leadership, the 49ers finished second overall in the league in total defense in 2019. In 2020, the team had a top 10 defense in total yards, rushing yards and passing yards, according to the New York Jets.\n \"Robert Saleh is an amazing coach who happens to be Arab and Muslim, and we couldn't ask for a better representative for who we are as Arabs and as Muslims,\" ADC legal and policy director Abed Ayoub told CNN.\n \"Sports transcends and it can bring people together and offer a very large, very wide platform. When an Arab Muslim American succeeds in sports, that positively affects the community as a whole.\"\n During the news conference on Thursday, Saleh recalled the moment he decided to pursue his love of football, following the 9/11 terror attacks in New York.\n His brother, David Saleh, was training as a financial adviser that morning in the World Trade Center's South Tower when the planes struck the building. He survived, but thousands didn't.\n Saleh told Sports Illustrated in a 2017 interview that almost losing his brother made him contemplate the purpose of his life, which he decided was football.\n \"I think everyone -- somehow, some way -- is somewhat impacted from 9/11,\" Saleh said during the news conference. \"And, you know, going through my brother's experience and the tragedy that he experienced, being able to self-reflect on what I was doing at that moment and realizing that I had a passion for football really triggered this whole thing.\"\n \"I'm supposed to be here, and I believe that. God does things for a reason and I believe this is one of them.\"",

        "body_text": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that Kamala Harris' historic role as the nation's first female, Black and South Asian vice president signals \"women are one step closer\" to getting top jobs as the country continues to grapple with gender equality in politics.\n \"Look, it's -- it's tough out there. But I am so happy for Kamala. I was so happy when she was sworn in,\" the Democrat told CNN's Abby Phillip on \"Inside Politics.\" \"And I know that millions of little girls across this country see themselves in her. With Kamala's swearing in, women are one step closer.\"\n Warren, one of the progressive voices in the Senate, has spoken out numerous times about the challenges she faced during her own 2020 campaign for president because of her gender. When asked if this election will bring about positive change for women, Warren appeared optimistic.\n \"Yes, I hope so. And it's Kamala, but also look at the number of women who will be heading up agencies,\" she said, mentioning Deb Haaland who has been nominated as interior secretary and could be the first Native American Cabinet secretary.\n She also pointed to Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate, will be the first woman treasury secretary.\n \"They're wonderful women, strong women around President (Joe) Biden and that is a part of tapping into our strength as a nation. We need to hear from many voices. And that means we need to hear from men and from women.\"\n On the campaign trail, Warren told stories of how some male colleagues advised her to \"smile more\" and how she had been discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because it would be too hard for her to win as a woman.\n \"If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner.' And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?'\" she said March 2020 after she ended her presidential campaign.\n Harris, who had also ran for president in 2020 and whose career is full of barrier-breaking accomplishments, shattered a political glass ceiling last week to become the first woman in the second highest-ranking office in the country.\n Biden has touted the historic firsts and diversity in his Cabinet, a promise he made during his campaign of having his Cabinet look like America. Fifty percent of nominees for Cabinet positions and Cabinet-level positions are people of color, according to a CNN analysis. Several of Biden's nominees could make history as the first woman or person of color to serve in their role if confirmed by the Senate.\n This story has been updated with additional details.\n CNN's MJ Lee contributed to this report.",

        "source": "cnn",
        "title": "The Supreme Court's run out of excuses to avoid controversial issues",
        "body_text": "In the aftermath of a divisive election, a riot at the US Capitol and the unprecedented final days of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court kept many controversial issues in a holding pattern of sorts, sticking to Chief Justice John Roberts' objective of keeping his branch of government out of the political spotlight.\n But now Trump is an ordinary citizen, the Biden administration is in place and the justices are expected as soon as Monday to begin to act on a mound of lingering issues they have been sitting upon, including abortion and the question of former President Donald Trump's tax returns.\n Some of the disputes are closely linked to Trump, others are cases on the upcoming calendar that might become moot should the Biden administration reverse Trump policies.\n Also, looming as a backdrop, is the possibility that Roberts might once again be tasked with presiding over Trump's second impeachment trial -- although legal experts differ on the chief justice's role as it pertains to a proceeding against an ex-president. Finally, there is a new whisper campaign in town, as progressives wonder if Justice Stephen Breyer at 82 years old, might be thinking about retirement as early as this term in order to give Biden the chance to fill the seat with a younger justice.\n While much has changed in Washington, one thing remains the same: the composition of the court -- thanks to Trump -- is now split 6-3 along ideological lines. There will always be a significant number of unanimous cases, and other instances where strange bedfellows break expectations. But in the cases that most grab the public's attention down the road, including abortion, immigration, affirmative action and voting rights, the conservatives are likely to unite and treat the Biden administration very differently than they did the Trump administration.\n Friday morning, the justices held their regular private telephone conference to discuss an impressive array of substantial issues. Monday morning, they will release a list of cases they will take up or reject and also issue at least one opinion.\n All the way back in October, Trump's personal lawyers came to the court with an emergency request: they asked the justices to temporarily block a lower court decision that allows Trump's tax returns to go to the Manhattan district attorney while the legal challenge plays out.\n Last July, a 7-2 court had rejected broad claims of immunity from a state criminal subpoena seeking his financial documents. The justices sent the case back to the lower courts so that the President's lawyers could make more targeted objections regarding the scope of the requests. After more losses, Trump returned to the justices who proceeded to say nothing for over three months.\n Also related to Trump is a First Amendment challenge to his decision in 2017 to block followers on his Twitter account. That case is complicated by the fact that the former President was banned from Twitter in the waning days of his presidency and he is now no longer in office.\n Other disputes concern accusations that Trump violated provisions of the Constitution that bar the president from receiving an \"emolument\" or benefit from a foreign or domestic government. It stems from the fact that Trump, unlike other presidents, continued to retain an interest in his businesses and he let those businesses take money from foreign and domestic governments. Critics said his properties could be frequented by officials in order to curry favor with the now-former President.\n Pending from before Election Day is a request from Republicans in Pennsylvania challenging a state Supreme Court decision that allowed ballots received up to three days after Election Day to be counted.\n The justices displayed no appetite to review the last election, but the case offers them the opportunity to examine issues that could impact future elections, such as the ability of the US Supreme Court to review state Supreme Court rulings on state constitutions.\n The justices have been considering a strict abortion law in Mississippi -- blocked by the lower courts -- that bans abortion after 15 weeks that critics say violates almost 50 years of court precedent dating back to Roe v. Wade. Supporters of abortion rights hope the court denies the case but are fearful that Amy Coney Barrett's elevation could move the court to the right in the area of abortion rights.\n Another case concerns a Trump-era regulation that restricts family planning clinics that receive federal funds from providing referrals for abortion.\n On immigration, the court has in front of it a challenge brought by state and local officials against Trump's regulation issued in August 2019 that makes it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.\n Next month, the court is scheduled to hear arguments concerning funding for Trump's border wall as well as his policy that mandates that non-Mexican asylum seekers stay in Mexico as they await hearings in the United States. Biden has already announced reversals in those areas, and it remains to be seen what his Justice Department does in these cases.\n And as he was sworn in, Biden promised to act quickly to pass executive actions. If past is precedent, critics of the new President could act quickly to attempt to block the policies. Such challenges would eventually make their way back to the high court, a very different court, that reviewed Obama-era programs.\n On Inauguration Day, Jessica Anderson of the Heritage Action for America warned that \"conservatives are prepared to fight back against the destructive policies of the far left.\"",
