        "title": "Amanda Gorman's distinctly Black love for country",
        "body_text": "The enterprise of creating a more perfect union still \"stands before us,\" to use Amanda Gorman's words, from confronting persistent racial inequalities to banishing the reanimated forces of White supremacy that threatened the US Capitol on January 6.\n The first National Youth Poet Laureate, 22-year-old Gorman recited her stunning poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' inauguration on Wednesday.\n In portraying the US in aspirational terms -- as a project that isn't yet complete but is worth fighting for -- Gorman roots her poem in a distinctly Black expression of love for country.\n Among other things, the composition movingly articulates what it will take to attain the unity that's been so vigorously called for since the deadly assault on the Capitol.\n \"Somehow we've weathered and witnessed / A nation that isn't broken / But simply unfinished,\" Gorman observes.\n \"We are striving to forge a union with purpose / To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man,\" she adds later.\n Unfinished. Striving. While politicians and pundits tend to depict the US as a country that, save for the occasional aberration, is more or less fully formed -- as a country that achieved democracy 244 years ago instead of, at best, 55 years ago, when Black Americans won the right to the franchise -- Gorman isn't in thrall to such lofty notions.\n This tension -- a kind of patriotism that's by turns critical and optimistic (\"Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true,\" Gorman declares, \"That even as we hurt, we hoped\") -- brings to mind the words of James Baldwin.\n \"I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually,\" the intellectual titan wrote in his 1955 essay collection, \"Notes of a Native Son.\"\n Baldwin was often unsparing toward the US -- but devoted nonetheless.\n Notably, Gorman's poem mirrors Baldwin's thinking in another way, too: in the insistence on remembering history, taking it seriously.\n \"White man, hear me!\" Baldwin implored in his 1965 essay, \"The White Man's Guilt.\" \"History, as nearly no one seems to know, is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.\"\n \"The Hill We Climb\" offers its own take on this conviction.\n \"It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit / It's the past we step into / And how we repair it / We've seen a force that would shatter our nation / Rather than share it,\" Gorman says, referring to the attack on the Capitol.\n And later: \"For while we have our eyes on the future / History has its eyes on us / This is the era of just redemption.\"\n In the above lines, Gorman, in addition to nodding to the popular musical \"Hamilton,\" which she's a big fan of, suggests that moving forward shouldn't mean moving on. Securing the noble ambition of unity shouldn't come at the expense of reckoning with racial animus that's never gone away but, rather, has just presented itself to a greater or lesser degree.\n It isn't surprising that Gorman so immaculately distills the same complex attachment to country that many other Black Americans -- including Langston Hughes and inaugural poet foremother Maya Angelou -- have expressed.\n \"The poets (by which I mean all artists) are finally the only people who know the truth about us,\" Baldwin said in a 1963 address. \"Soldiers don't. Statesmen don't. Priests don't. Union leaders don't. Only the poets.\"\n Gorman certainly knows the truth -- that the violence that was on display at the beginning of the month is, in fact, who we are. But she also knows that it's not too late to change who we are for the better. \"For there is always light,\" she avows, \"If only we're brave enough to see it / If only we're brave enough to be it.\"",

        "title": "Devoted customers help rescue BBQ restaurant on the brink of eviction",
        "body_text": "The pandemic has been devastating for most small business owners. But for some, it also has brought out the compassion and generosity of their local communities and customers.\n That kind of generosity is what has helped Renatta Frazier stave off eviction for Great House BBQ, her restaurant in Springfield, Illinois.\n \"Everyone I've taken or sent there has had a religious experience,\" Rhodes said, noting that a food writer friend was blown away by Frazier's fried mac-and-cheese balls. She's also witnessed firefighters lining up for dinner to go. \"They know their meat,\" Rhodes said.\n But Frazier is very hopeful for the future, thanks to the growth in her customer base over the past year and the support she has received.\n \"I greatly trust and believe there is a God and a universe that is limitless... They work through wonderful, amazing, generous people,\" Frazier said.\n Like many business owners, Sally Jo Ocasio saw her revenue drop sharply during the shutdown months in the spring. But business at her Ridgway, Colorado, vintage store, The Vault, rebounded somewhat over a busy summer.\n She reopened in the new space in mid-December. But two days later, a fire consumed the building, destroying her store and all her inventory, Ocasio said.\n When asked by a local paper if she would start a GoFundMe campaign, Ocasio said she didn't want to because the past year was such a hardship for so many people.\n Erin Graham, an owner of a nearby office supply store who is also one of Ocasio's customers, decided she wanted to help. Without telling Ocasio, Graham and her husband started a GoFundMe campaign for The Vault. It has raised nearly $18,000 so far.\n \"It's overwhelming. ... It filled my heart with enormous gratitude,\" Ocasio said, noting that since Ridgway is such a small town she knows many of the donors.\n She has a lot of expenses ahead -- including rent on her three-year lease, hiring a lawyer to help her figure out just what insurance will and won't cover, and the cost of rebuilding her business.\n Ocasio doesn't want to use the money raised for her very near-term expenses, like hiring a lawyer. Instead, she said, she will put it toward an eventual reopening of The Vault.\n \"[I] will invest it in a fresh start at a new store.\"\n Minho Kim knows the names of all the students who come to his deli, Sunny's (or, as it is more popularly known, Harry's), which is located near the K-12 Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, New York.\n A big menu favorite for them: Kim's bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches.\n And those students are loyal customers, even after they graduate. (During CNN Business' phone conversation with Kim, whose customers call him \"Joe,\" a Packer grad named Justin stopped in just to say hello.)\n Their loyalty is apparent in the more than $20,000 raised for Kim after he reluctantly started a GoFundMe campaign to help with his back rent and other bills, which kept ballooning as his revenue fell by 70% due to the pandemic. He still is in arrears on his utility bills.\n He also promoted the campaign on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. In just a few days, the money came pouring in from students past and present, as well as Packer faculty members.\n \"Ninety-five percent of the donations came from longtime customers ... Kids I've known since kindergarten,\" Kim said. \"I was really, really surprised. It almost made me cry.\"\n One student, Bella Pitman, even created art of Kim's deli for stickers she sold and she gave all the proceeds to Kim.\n In mid-December, Steve Olsen, the owner of the West Bank Caf\u00e9 near Manhattan's theater district, was two weeks away from shutting his doors.\n Through a GoFundMe campaign, promotion on social media, and a star-studded live-streamed telethon on Christmas Day, their efforts raised $342,000.\n Most of the funds came from small donations. \"We're a community that's been out of work since March. You generously saw members of the theater community giving whatever they could. A bunch of people giving a little bit can really make a difference,\" D'Angora said.\n Olsen is beyond touched. \"The support is amazing. It's a miracle,\" he said.\n But D'Angora isn't surprised. \"Steve Olsen goes to every table and sits down with customers. He treats me as well as Al Pacino. No matter who you are, you're treated as family,\" he said.\n And that family is huge since the restaurant -- which is an institution for the New York theater community and residents of midtown Manhattan -- has been around for 42 years.\n When he first opened the West Bank Cafe in 1978, Olsen said, \"I told my staff, 'They'll come for food, but they'll return for the hospitality if you treat them nice.'\"\n And, as their recent support has shown, they'll be there when the chips are down.\n \"He treated me like a star and VIP from Day One. He treated me as well 15 years ago as he did today after raising $300,000 for him,\" D'Angora said. \"I told him, 'This is your George Bailey moment. No man is a failure who has friends.'\"",

        "title": "A pandemic playbook for a new year",
        "body_text": "It has been more than one year since the first reported case of Covid-19 in the United States -- a day that changed our country forever. The arrival of the novel coronavirus on our doorstep continues to challenge our public health officials, scientists, health care workers and, frankly, the American public, to go above and beyond the call of duty and to do everything we can to battle the relentless threat that it poses.\n It's no secret that our handling of the virus over the last year has had its share of shortcomings, and with a new administration in place, both the expectations and the stakes couldn't be higher.\n So far, President Joe Biden has made some sweeping proposals about how he'll handle the pandemic and has made it clear that getting Covid-19 under control is his top priority.\n He's already proposed a $1.9 trillion \"American Rescue Plan\" that aims to help slow the spread of coronavirus and stimulate the economy. Among the slew of executive orders he signed are ones dealing with Covid-19 testing, school reopenings and ramping up the production of masks and other PPE. Another big issue the Biden team has wasted no time tackling: improving vaccine distribution and making it more transparent.\n But as we all know, even the best laid plans often go awry -- or meet resistance, both political and civil.\n Biden has said he wants to set aside politics and face this virus as one nation, but the question remains: How should we best tackle these big problems?\n We asked eight experts how they would advise the Biden administration to tackle four key areas -- masks, testing, vaccines and schools.\n Wearing a mask appears to be simple and straightforward -- put one on and march out into the world -- but it's not. In addition to having become highly politicized, other issues affect masks, including quality questions and supply problems. Even after a year, the fact is there are not enough high-quality masks to go around for frontline workers, let alone the general population.\n Before taking office, Biden signaled he takes masking much more seriously than President Donald Trump by stating his intention to launch a 100-day masking challenge to Americans. And within hours of being sworn into office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on all federal property. \"Masks are incredibly important for slowing the transmission of Covid-19. We've seen this in other countries where they have widespread mask-wearing: the numbers of cases are much lower than in the United States,\" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech.\n Marr, who studied \"viruses in the air,\" points the finger at the patchwork of different regulations across the states and an incomplete understanding among the general public of the importance of wearing masks. \"It's been very clear from the data that states that have implemented strong mask policies have a slower increase in the number of cases or even a decrease -- but it's not masks alone; it's masks in combination with other measures such as distancing and improved ventilation and hand washing,\" she said.\n \"We've come a long way since last March. There are a lot of people wearing masks and a lot of places, but there's still some resistance. And I think, if we can improve that -- the number of people wearing masks and the quality of the mask we're wearing -- we can make a bigger dent in transmission,\" she added.\n Marr said she would make three main recommendations to the Biden team. \"One is, we need strong federal leadership on masks, the importance of masks and requiring them in all indoor spaces where people are sharing the air,\" she stressed.\n \"The second thing is ... because of the new variants of the virus, which seem to be much more easily transmitted, we need to start thinking about improving our masks. And that could be things such as sending every citizen several masks that are of good quality or setting some kind of standards so that people are better able to judge the quality of masks,\" she said.\n \"And the third thing that I would recommend is increased use of carbon dioxide sensors as a measure of whether a place has good ventilation or not,\" Marr said. She explained that carbon dioxide is expelled into the air when people exhale; in poorly ventilated areas, it builds up.\n \"We know from past studies and guidelines that if you keep that level below 800 parts per million you dramatically reduce the risk of transmission of diseases that go through the air,\" she said. \"With that information, people will know, 'OK, is this place safer to go into or maybe they need to open some doors and windows or improve their filtration.'\"\n Marr isn't the only one to put masks front and center of the effort to beat back the pandemic.\u202f Back in the spring, Dr. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and two colleagues started brainstorming about what needed to be done to get the country back on track.\n \"One of the things that came out was that this was primarily a respiratory infectious pathogen and it was primarily transmitted by droplets and also by aerosols,\" he said. The trio concluded that the general population needs access to the same tool that doctors (if they were lucky) had: reusable, high-quality masks, something along the lines of an N95 mask.\n Karan and his colleagues, who have co-authored several articles on the topic, are not alone in thinking along these lines. Several European countries, including France and Germany, have recently started mandating better-quality masks in public.\n But it's a challenge for the average American to get a good-quality mask. \"Right now, it's extremely confusing navigating the mask market ... there are no really great, cheap, affordable, scalable options that are reusable that also provide high filtration, that you can easily find,\" Karan said.\n \"So, we're thinking about [delivering] a kit that includes a high-filtration mask and also may include some kind of a device that can help with the fit of other masks,\" he said. Karan said the mask should be comfortable, washable, reusable, well-fitting and it should allow people to put in additional filters to for higher-risk situations.\n So, how to get a great mask in the hands of every American? Karan knows it's no small lift; he and his colleagues have a policy proposal they hope to put to the Biden team. \"The two main components are: get the kit together and figure out a way to get that kit to people.\"\n Among the logistical issues they tackle: finding a mask of suitable quality and ramping up manufacturing; distributing them to every American; subsidizing the masks so that they are free or low-cost; and then, of course, getting people to wear them.\n A \"mask czar\" could be appointed by Biden to see this effort through, said Karan. And the Defense Production Act could be used to kickstart or supplement production -- a step Biden announced Thursday he is taking. \"We have to start thinking of the pandemic as a wartime effort,\" Karan said, a sentiment Biden echoed his speech.\n Distribution channels could include using the post office to mail them or as a pickup spot; setting up vending machines in grocery stores, pharmacies, religious establishments and giving each citizen a code to use.\n A public health campaign could help spread the word and encourage those who are on the fence. And even some people still balk at mask-wearing, the plan still works.\n \"You don't need 100% of people to do anything. You need some people to do it and the pandemic shrinks ... The more people that mask, the more people that are protected, and so you can reach a threshold where if enough people are masked at the most critical times, you then can still help the pandemic,\" he said.\n While the FDA has given emergency authorization to many tests for Covid-19, the entire testing ecosystem has been hamstrung by a lack of unified testing strategy: whom to test, when to test, and which kind of test to use. And although the world is one year into this pandemic, there are still supply bottlenecks as well as delays in getting results. All of these issues render testing -- as a way to get infected people quickly into quarantine and even for diagnostic purposes -- almost moot. \"Obviously, we have other tools like mask wearing and vaccinations, but testing alone if deployed widely can end up making a very large difference in controlling the pandemic,\" says Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n The first step of making testing an effective tool is to aggressively scale up manufacturing. Jha says we should use the Defense Production Act to \"ramp up this kind of testing because if you really want to do society-wide testing of all high-risk situations, you probably be need to be doing 10 to 15 million tests a day.\"\n The type of strategy he'd like to see is using rapid antigen tests for essential workers and people in high-risk places that include schools, nursing homes and prisons -- basically, \"any place where large numbers of people gathered indoors.\" And how often would they get tested? \"In the ideal world based on the modeling data -- twice-a-week testing,\" Jha says.\n Jha has seen this strategy work at his own university's campus where he said everyone was tested regularly. \"It was a great reminder that if you take a population of people and do regular testing twice a week, that you can actually keep outbreaks under control and you can continue, not totally normal operations, but operations like with in-person classes throughout the fall,\" he said.\n By targeting testing, Jha argues it can bring total numbers down. \"The bottom line is you want to be doing ongoing regular testing of these populations. It wouldn't just protect them -- it would keep infection numbers in the entire community so low that would end up benefiting everybody else as well.\"\n Like Jha, Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, is also an advocate for rapid antigen tests. \"The surveillance PCR testing that we've been doing, like I said, it catches about 5% of people in time to act and it's extremely difficult to scale up PCR much.\" Mina says his advice to Biden would be, \"Ask Congress to appropriate $5 billion, which is a drop in the bucket for this virus at this point, to scale up and deploy rapid antigen testing so that every American can use a test twice a week.\"\n Mina explains the twice-a-week interval using rapid antigen testing: \"Let's say it's a Monday or on Day Zero you get exposed. Day three, you might turn positive on a PCR later that night. Day three and a half or maybe early day four you might turn positive on an antigen test. And so, the whole idea of twice a week is to shave off a considerable part of people's infectious course,\" he said.\n \"And so, if you're using it twice a week, even if you turn positive in the middle of your two tests, by the time you do test, especially because it's rapid, you'll be able to pull yourself out when you've only been spreading for one and a half or two days instead of five days and six days.\"\n Mina also emphasizes that the tests need to be affordable for every American to have access. \"Five bucks is a good price. And it's the right price that if Congress appropriates $5 or $10 billion, we could really, really make a major, major difference in this pandemic with that amount of money still giving the companies what they want,\" he said.\n Also, important: privacy. Mina says that it's important to \"meet the American public where they are at\" and make reporting test results voluntary. \"You pick up your iPhone if you want and do a one-click reporting if you want,\" he said.\n \"And if not, you keep it to yourself and you yourself know that you're infectious today. And so, you won't go visit your grandma in the nursing home, maybe you won't go to church, maybe you won't eat lunch with your buddies, but it's on your terms.\"\n And that's key to making this one of the most successful tools of the pandemic. \"I think this test is the most equitable way to approach fighting this pandemic today. It is a test that can truly be scaled to every household, rich or poor. People can use it on their own terms, regardless of any politics, regardless of how they feel about this virus. You know, and if people don't want to use it, that's their prerogative. But as long as we can get a large number of people using it twice a week, we can actually start to really contain this virus,\" Mina said.\n Unless you have been living blissfully unplugged since the first vaccine received emergency authorization last month, you've certainly read and heard how confusing the vaccination landscape is. Questions abound over who is eligible to get vaccinated (it varies by state), where to go and how to sign up. There are even questions about basics like how much vaccine is available. Vaccinating the majority of the population is a sure way out of the pandemic, both in this country and globally. It's imperative to do it right and do it fast.\n \"Federal leadership, not federal takeover,\" is how Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, sees the role of the new administration in the vaccine rollout. \"I don't see a sudden change that state health departments bow out, because they are the ones with the personnel and the experience and the knowledge of the local conditions -- and that all matters when you're in a rush,\" Lipsitch added.\n He also advocates for quickly extending vaccines to the next priority groups if resources are available. \"I think we need to be ready to move quickly from the early groups to add in the second and third tiers of groups. I think the prioritization serves an important function, it really does matter for those most at risk to get vaccinated first, and for health care workers to get vaccinated first,\" he said.\n \"And I think opening it up, and where there is personnel available to vaccinate a larger group of people, and there are vaccines available, we shouldn't be holding back, especially if the demand from the earlier groups is starting to slow.\"\n But Lipsitch also emphasizes that providing clear communication about how people can get a vaccine is key to a successful rollout.\n \"There is a need to use a range of different approaches to reach people and make it easy for them to get access to the vaccine. And the internet is great, but it is not great for everyone -- those who don't have it or those who are of an age that they find it hard to navigate,\" he said.\n Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC director who in now president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is focused on equitable access to the vaccine.\n \"I worry that opening the floodgates so that, you know, 100 million people are now eligible for vaccination, may create a situation in which our numbers look really good, but those people who are keeping our food supply going, our transportation systems going, they're doing home health care, that these individuals will not be reached by vaccine distribution systems,\" Besser said.\n \"And the incredible health disparities we've seen in this pandemic, where Black Americans, Latino Americans, Native Americans are getting infected, hospitalized and dying at rates that far surpass the proportion of the community -- that that will continue and could, in fact, widen.\"\n Offering transportation to vaccination sites and keeping vaccination clinics open 24/7 could help combat health disparities, he said.\n Besser also believes collecting vaccine data could play a role in equitable distribution.\n \"One of the pieces, though, that I haven't heard enough discussion of and it's critically important, is collection of data that can be broken down by neighborhood, by zip code, by race, by ethnicity, by gender, so we can see where vaccine is going and where it's not. That will allow us to know where additional resources have to be directed to meet needs.\"\n Beyond the physical distribution and administration of vaccines, both Lipsitch and Besser stressed that vaccine hesitancy is a challenge that will need to be addressed head on.\n Most educators, children and parents would probably agree that distance learning is but a shadow of its in-person counterpart, educationally speaking. Yet it's a reality that many school-age children in this country have had to adapt to since this spring, when Covid-19 forced many states, counties and cities to shutter school buildings rather than risk disease outbreaks. Not only is learning affected, but there are no opportunities for critical social interactions. Additionally, distance learning provides none of the additional support that many children need or rely on, such as school meals and adequate supervision. Biden promised on Thursday to help get elementary and middle schools back open within his first 100 days.\n School closures are \"nothing short of a national emergency,\" said Joseph G. Allen, an associate professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the school's Healthy Buildings program. He's also the chair of the Lancet's Covid-19 commission task force on safe work, safe schools and safe travel.\n Allen, who this summer helped put together a study of risk reduction strategies to help schools reopen safely, said he would like to see them reopen before the 100 days Biden has pledged.\n To do that, Allen outlines two crucial steps.\n First, \"you must have universal masking in schools. And we are well beyond the point where any mask will do: three-layer surgical mask for teachers and adults who are higher risk. A surgical mask with a cloth mask on top of it can get you over ninety-one percent removal efficiency for particles,\" he said.\n The second part of the equation is addressing ventilation and airflow issues. \"Aerosols -- respiratory aerosols that people breathe -- can build up indoors and they will accumulate unless they're removed through ventilation or cleaned out of the air through filtration,\" he said.\n While many school buildings across the country are in dire need of costly infrastructure updates, addressing the ventilation issue quickly \"does not have to be expensive or complicated. Opening up the windows. Even in cold weather areas, an inch or two inches can help improve the air exchange rate.\"\n But Allen said the secret weapon lies in portable air cleaners with HEPA filters, which cost a couple of hundred dollars each.\n \"These are the types of resources the federal government can provide that provide an instant stopgap measure to help address airborne particles in classrooms that could be delivered in weeks. And it's simple technology. You plug it in and you turn it on high, put it in the middle of the room. You're done,\" he said.\n Allen called them reasonable and attainable. Moreover, the fix isn't as expensive as it may seem: He estimates the cost at a couple of billion dollars. Compared to completely reinstalling or retrofitting the ventilation systems in school buildings nationwide, that isn't much. Best of all, he said, \"it can be done fast.\"\n Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has been working on pandemic preparedness for about 20 years. She calls schools a \"critical infrastructure\" and said it's important that \"we get them open as quickly as possible,\" noting it is important to strike a balance between the known benefits with the potential harms with the potential benefits.\n Nuzzo outlined \"three clear priorities\" for education right now.\n \"One is, of course, we need to safely return students back to the classroom as quickly as possible. And that's going to require a mix of the safety protocols and perhaps targeted use of vaccination,\" she said. \"We have gotten lucky with the science that we now have a safe and effective vaccine. So, we should absolutely be talking about targeting the use of that in teachers to allow them to return to school and feel safe in returning to school.\"\n Safety protocols include steps like cohorting students to limit the number of people who interact with one another; either upgrading building ventilation systems or using portable options; identifying alternative spaces to hold classes that would allow children to be spaced apart more; and in some cases, moving to hybrid models.\n \"All of those things add up. I mean, we're talking about layered protection: masks, physical distance, trying to improve ventilation, trying to increase hygiene in schools,\" she said.\n \"Of course, it is always easier to do this in the context of being in a community that has a low level of infection to begin with. So, in communities where the case numbers are skyrocketing, it's going to be much harder to keep the virus out of classrooms. (That) is an issue that must be tackled as a matter of priority. Unfortunately, what we've seen in a number of communities is, frankly, we seem to want to open up everything else before we've ever gotten to the point where we're able to reopen schools. And in my view, that's a really misplaced prioritization,\" said Nuzzo.\n Other priorities look toward the future.\n \"The second priority is dealing with the learning loss that we have seen to date. In many places, children will, by the time they're able to return to the classroom, have been out of the classroom for more than a year,\" she said.\n She notes that this learning loss is not shared by all equally. \"There's concern ... that disparities that we see in education and achievement will only be exacerbated by the time spent out of the classroom. So, we need an educational recovery program,\" she said, adding that school systems will also need to find all those students \"lost\" to the system, bring them back in and bring them up to speed.\n And lastly comes the need to plan for the future. \"Unfortunately, this is not going to be the last pandemic that we're going to face,\" she said. \"So, what is our strategy for dealing with schools? When future infectious disease emergencies arise, are we going to have to close yet again for more than a year? I really hope not.\"",

Rosen, along with former Attorney General William Barr and former acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, refused to file the Supreme Court case citing that there was no basis to challenge the election outcome and the federal government had no legal interest in whether Trump or Biden won the presidency.\n Trump also backed down during the New Year's weekend effort after top Justice Department officials, including Trump's own Senate-confirmed appointees and other political staff, vowed to resign if Trump fired Rosen.\n The move would have represented Trump's most flagrant intrusion on Justice Department matters, after years of breaking with decades-long presidential tradition of trying to limit plainly partisan political activity by the department.\n \"He wanted us, the United States, to sue one or more of the states directly in the Supreme Court,\" a former administration official told the Journal. \"The pressure got really intense\" after a lawsuit Texas filed in the Supreme Court against four states Biden won was dismissed in early December, the official told the Journal.\n An outside lawyer working for Trump drafted a brief the then-President wanted the Justice Department to file, people familiar with the matter told the Journal, but officials refused.\n Jeffrey Clark, the Senate-confirmed head of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division who assumed leadership of the DOJ's Civil Division during the closing months of the Trump administration, had advised his bosses, both Rosen and acting deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, that he was meeting with Trump to discuss sending a letter to Georgia officials, falsely saying that the department was investigating serious fraud claims and to withhold final certification of Biden's victory.\n Rosen and others rejected the idea because it wasn't true and because Rosen, and Barr before him, rejected Trump's push to appoint a special counsel to investigate voter fraud.\n Clark denied any plan to oust Rosen, he told the Times on Friday, or that he made any recommendations based on internet conspiracy theories.\n \"My practice is to rely on sworn testimony to assess disputed factual claims,\" Clark told the Times. \"There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president. It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions.\"\n CNN has reached out to former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller for comment. Trump declined to comment to the Times.\n Clark was initially presented as an alternative to Rosen by Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, according to a Saturday report by the Times into Trump's plot to overturn the November election results.\n Perry, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, made Trump aware of Clark's sympathies toward his view that the election was stolen and later introduced Trump to Clark, according to the Times. Clark was appealing for Trump as he was more open to conspiracy theories about election fraud than Rosen, according to the Times.\n The Times noted that it is unclear when Perry, who represents Harrisburg, met Clark or how well the two men knew each other before the introduction to Trump. Administration officials told the Times that it was in late December that Clark told Rosen about the introduction made by Perry, who was among a group of people telling Trump he'd won the election.\n Justice Department officials told the Times that Trump had called Clark on multiple occasions and the two had met without alerting Rosen. DOJ policy states that the president initially communicates with the attorney general or the deputy attorney general on all matters, and then a lower-level official if authorized, according to the Times.\n CNN has reached out to Perry's office for comment.\n Late Saturday night, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin published a letter from Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee addressed to acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson asking for his assurance that \"the Department will preserve all relevant materials in its possession, custody, or control,\" related to Trump's discussions with Clark involving a plan to oust Rosen and overturn Georgia's presidential election results.\n The committee is requesting the materials be released to them no later than the first day of Trump's impeachment trial.\n This story has been updated with additional developments.\n CNN's Evan Perez and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Larry King, who died Saturday at the age of 87, \"had a history-making career spanning radio and television,\" CNN president Jeff Zucker wrote in a tribute to the iconic broadcaster.\n The long-time broadcaster King hosted \"Larry King Live\" on CNN for 25 years, making him one of the most recognized hosts in cable news history.\n Zucker's statement acknowledged King's role in raising CNN's profile around the world.\n \"His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him,\" Zucker said. \"We are so proud of the 25 years he spent with CNN, where his newsmaker interviews truly put the network on the international stage.\"\n CNN was only five years old when Ted Turner recruited King to join the network and host a nightly interview program.\n As King wrote in one of his books, \"My Remarkable Journey,\" the network \"was just getting off the ground,\" he said. \"I don't think you could even get it in Washington at that point. I didn't have it in my home.\"Turner was looking to replace \"The Freeman Report,\" hosted by Sandi Freeman at 9 p.m. ET, so he called up King and offered him the spot.\n \"At the time,\" King wrote, \"people called CNN the Chicken Noodle News... I had no idea if CNN would be successful. But I liked Ted and figured it would be fun to go along for the ride.\"\n For his part, CNN founder Turner said, \"Waking up to the news of the passing of Larry King felt like a punch to the gut. Larry was one of my closest and dearest friends and, in my opinion, the world's greatest broadcast journalist of all time.\n \"If anyone asked me what are my greatest career achievements in life, one is the creation of CNN, and the other is hiring Larry King. Like so many who worked with and knew Larry, he was a consummate professional, an amazing mentor to many and a good friend to all. The world has lost a true legend.\"\n King's first guest was Mario Cuomo, then the governor of New York (and the father of current CNN anchor Chris Cuomo).\n \"My memory of that show is not of a particular question or answer. It's the feeling,\" King recalled. \"The whole thing just felt right. Mario sensed it, too. Afterward, he said, 'This suits you.' I had no idea that I'd just embarked on the longest run in television history... But I knew the platform was perfect.\"\n In the mid and late 1980s CNN gained distribution in homes across the United States and around the world. \"Larry King Live\" helped the network grow and supplied a signature show in prime time.\n Former CNN correspondent, anchor and DC bureau chief Frank Sesno recounted King's arrival during an on-air tribute on Saturday.\n \"The reporters all said, 'What are you doing, bringing Larry King? What's all this about?' What Larry King brought was personality -- he was the first piece of personality in a big way that came to CNN,\" Sesno said. \"He brought this incredible interview program that made people feel comfortable, so they wanted to go on, so that within a few years people were storming the doors.\"\n King signed off \"Larry King Live\" in 2010, but continued to appear on CNN as a guest.\n Zucker's statement on Saturday concluded with a pledge:\n \"From our CNN family to Larry's, we send our thoughts and prayers, and a promise to carry on his curiosity for the world in our work.\"",

        "title": "Got a package you didn't order? It could be a scam",
        "body_text": "Most people who buy things online just have to worry about their deliveries being delayed or never arriving. But some people are dealing with a different problem altogether: getting weird stuff like hair clippers, face creams and sunglasses they never even ordered at all.\n The Federal Trade Commission and cyber experts have been warning consumers about these deliveries, which can be part of something known as \"brushing\" scams.\n Here's how these scams work: Third-party sellers on Amazon, eBay and other online marketplaces pay people to write fake, positive reviews about their products, or do it themselves. To be able to post the reviews, these so-called \"brushers\" need to trick the site into making it appear that a legitimate transaction took place. So they'll use a fake account to place gift orders and address them to a random person whose name and address they find online. Then, instead of actually mailing the item for which they want to post a review, the brushers will send a cheap, often lightweight item that costs less to ship.\n Sending an item (even the wrong one) creates a tracking number, and when the package is delivered, it enables brushers to write a verified review. If you're on the receiving end, you usually aren't charged for the purchase and your real account isn't hacked \u2014 but you are left in the dark as to who is repeatedly sending the mystery packages. In many cases, there's no return address. You don't need to worry that anything bad has happened to you or will happen to you if you get a package that might be part of a brushing scam, experts say. But we all need to be concerned about the scams affecting reviews we rely on when buying products.\n Brushing scams reportedly took off on e-commerce sites in China around five years ago. They resurfaced in headlines last summer, when all 50 states issued warnings about mysterious, unsolicited packages of seeds that people across the nation received in the mail.\n But it's not just seeds. Unsuspecting recipients have also found boxes with goods ranging from dog pooper-scoopers to power cords to soap dispensers on their doorsteps.\n Jen Blinn of Thousand Oaks, California, told CNN Business she has been receiving random packages since June, including most recently a briefcase, a backpack, a hair straightener and a coffee-cup warmer.\n \"Every two weeks...I get another package in the mail of just random stuff I never ordered,\" she said. Blinn notified Amazon of the issue, but a customer service agent \"didn't really understand what I was saying. She obviously didn't know about it,\" she said. The agent looked at Blinn's account and found nothing wrong with it.\n It's not illegal to send customers unordered merchandise. But \"the [Federal Trade Commission] has long gone after marketers that use fake reviews,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection and a law professor at Georgetown University.\n Amazon says its policy prohibits sellers sending unsolicited merchandise to customers, and that sellers can be removed from the site for doing so.\n \"Third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and we take action on those who violate our policies, including withholding payments, suspending or removing selling privileges, or working with law enforcement,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Amazon would not say how how many brushing scams have been found on the site or how many sellers have been removed due to these scams.\n An eBay spokesperson said in an email that brushing schemes \"do not appear to be highly prevalent\" on the site. It violates eBay policy to send unsolicited merchandise to customers or falsify reviews and can result in eBay restricting sellers' accounts or suspending them from the site.\n Experts also say it's difficult to quantify the frequency of such scams because it can be hard for companies to know whether reviews are fake, and scams often go unreported by consumers.\n The fact that you got a package you didn't order is usually harmless to you. The harm is to people who rely on reviews when deciding on a purchase, said Chris McCabe, a former policy enforcement investigator at Amazon tasked with stopping scams and fraud. He is now a consultant to sellers on the site.\n \"The real losers here are the consumers who are possibly believing many of these fake positive reviews, or this artificial padding of reviews, because they might see 100 positive reviews, and then there may only be 60 or 70 of them that are legitimate,\" he said.\n The likelihood that a consumer will buy a product that has five reviews is 270% higher than the likelihood they will buy a product with zero reviews, according to a 2017 report by Northwestern University's Spiegel Research Center.\n Some fake reviews are also being driven by Facebook groups where sellers offer buyers money if they write positive product reviews, said McCabe. Amazon and Facebook should work together to crack down on these groups, he said.\n An Amazon spokesperson said that the company analyzes more than 10 million reviews every week to try to keep fake ones from being published and that it provides details of its investigations to social media companies \"so they can stop these bad actors from abusing their platforms.\"\n A Facebook spokesperson said in an email that when the company is told of groups that may encourage fake reviews, it reviews them and removes them if they violate its policies.\n For consumers, the unexpected deliveries can be jarring. The packages Ashant\u00e9 Nicole never ordered started arriving at her home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2019.\n iPhone and portable car chargers. An iPad case. A heated shiatsu massage. A nail cleaning brush and a blow dryer. Sheets. A mattress cover. A floppy fish toy.\n They didn't have return addresses, so Nicole wasn't sure who was sending the packages. She reached out to Amazon to try to stop them from coming, but they still keep arriving at her doorstep.\n \"It was just kind of a little bit concerning because I don't know who has my information,\" she said. \"I don't know what they're going to send me. Like they could send something illegal and then I'm in trouble because I didn't know whoever that person was or what they were sending me.\"\n If you get merchandise you didn't order, it could mean that scammers have created an account in your name or taken over your account, an FTC spokesperson said in an email. Scammers may have even created new accounts in other names tied to your address, allowing them to post lots of seemingly-real reviews.\n \"We recommend keeping an eye on your online shopping accounts. If you spot activity that isn't yours, report it to the site right away, and think about changing your password for that site,\" the spokesperson said.\n Nicole feels she has done all she can by alerting Amazon each time unsolicited packages from the retailer arrive at her doorstep.\n \"There's literally nothing I can do besides tell Amazon every time it happens. And that hasn't really done much,\" she said.\n Amazon declined to comment directly on Nicole and Blinn's accounts, but said if a customer receives a package that was unsolicited, they should contact Amazon's customer service team.\n Nicole said she hopes Amazon will do more to stop brushing and ban sellers who participate in the scams.\n \"I just think they need to be a little bit more concerned with shutting those stores down and making sure those sellers can't use the platform.\"",

        "title": "The NAACP Legal Defense Fund launches a $40 million scholarship program for future civil rights lawyers, with help from an anonymous donor",
        "body_text": "As the NAACP Legal Defense Fund celebrates its 80th anniversary this year, they're also giving back -- to the tune of $40 million -- to support the careers of future civil rights lawyers.\n Thanks to an anonymous donor, the legal organization is launching the Marshall-Motley Scholars Program, named after Thurgood Marshall, the founder of the Legal Defense Fund (LDF) who was the first Black Supreme Court justice, and Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge and argue a case before the Supreme Court.\n The scholarship will fund the education and training of 50 aspiring civil rights lawyers over the next two decades -- including fully funding law school, summer internships, and a two-year postgraduate fellowship at a racial justice law practice in the South. That amounts to an investment of $40 million, the LDF said in a statement on Monday.\n \"For 80 years, LDF has been at the forefront of developing and supporting many of our nation's legendary civil rights lawyers and leaders,\" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel at LDF. \"The Marshall-Motley Scholars Program is the next phase of our commitment to identify and invest in a new generation of brilliant minds who have a deep personal desire to bring about racial justice in the South.\"\n Those selected for the program, which focuses specifically on developing advocates for southern Black communities, will commit to practicing civil rights law for at least eight years upon completion, the LDF said. And students beginning law school as early as this year can apply.\n The creation of the scholarship comes as a growing number of law students are saddled with debt -- with more than half carrying $150,000 in debt, according to a 2020 survey by the American Bar Association. Among lawyers of color, that number grows even more. White respondents to the survey take on an average of $156,000 in loans, whereas Hispanic, Asian and Black respondents average between $180,000 and $190,000 in loans.\n \"The support offered by this program is an intentional effort to address the racial and economic barriers that often deter students from pursuing their dreams of becoming civil rights attorneys,\" the LDF wrote in a statement announcing the program. \"Systemic racism remains a deeply ingrained part of American life, with widespread and far-reaching consequences, and there is a growing need for lawyers to help combat it. The (scholars program) is a response to the rampant inequality, racial injustice, and lack of resources that continues to plague the South, and its Black communities.\"\n The news comes amidst growing calls to address racial injustice in the US, following a summer of protests last year in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and others.\n In the South specifically, there is a \"stronghold of White supremacy\" and oppressive systems, said Jino Ray, the director of the new scholarship program, in a statement.\n \"If we are truly ready -- once and for all -- to call racial injustice a thing of the past, we will need extremely passionate lawyers, impeccably trained and equipped to work alongside the activists and organizers who have long been committed to the work of dismantling the oppressive systems in the South,\" he said.",

        "title": "FDA gives approval for syringes to extract an extra dose from vials of Covid-19 vaccine",
        "body_text": "As the US set a new daily record for Covid-19 inoculations and states clamored for more vaccine supplies, Pfizer and the FDA said pharmacists and health practitioners can in some cases extract an additional dose from each vial.\n Originally, each vial of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine was designed to contain five doses, but some pharmacists reported they could extract six doses when using certain syringes.\n As a result, the FDA approved an updated label that states: \"Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.\"\n Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said this increase in doses per vial \"provides an additional 20% capacity.\" The New York Times first reported Pfizer's plans to base its vaccine commitment on doses instead of vials.\n However, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Friday the ability to garner the sixth dose with these syringes does not exist everywhere.\n \"Many places have them,\" Gupta told CNN's John Berman, \"but not every place.\"\n McKesson, a medical supplies company the federal government has contracted to help with distribution, said syringe kits that allow extraction of the sixth dose are being made available.\n These changes highlight the push to get as many people vaccinated as possible amid an inconsistent supply chain.\n About 5% of the US population -- roughly 17.4 million people -- has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and more than 3 million people are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data updated Saturday. Nearly 1.6 million vaccine doses were reported administered Friday, the largest one-day increase.\n As inoculation efforts build, the pandemic continues unabated. And while CNN's analysis of data shows encouraging trends in new daily cases and hospitalizations, health officials remain concerned about the apparently more-transmissible variant first identified in the UK.\n \"You're going to see people traveling again, probably, for spring break, in March and April,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, a former member of the Biden transition's Covid-19 advisory board. \"And that is exactly when we expect that these variants -- in particular, the UK variant -- to have taken hold in the US.\"\n \u2022 Cases: Johns Hopkins University reported more than 186,000 new cases on Friday. The US is currently averaging 180,816 new daily cases across seven days. That's the lowest since December 2, and down 27% from the peak seen January 11, when the average of new cases across a week hit 249,168. But the current average is still 2.7 times above the summer's highest level in July.\n \u2022 Hospitalizations: On Saturday, there were 113,609 Covid-19 patients in US hospitals, a metric that continues to drop day by day, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That's the lowest since December 20, but it's still nearly twice the reported peak in the summer.\n \u2022 Deaths: There were 3,655 new deaths reported Friday, per Johns Hopkins data. The US is averaging more than 3,000 new deaths a day across a week. With more than 68,152 deaths so far, January is currently the second deadliest month of the pandemic, behind December 2020. January is on track to surpass December's death toll of nearly 77,500 deaths.\n Jennifer Bagues, funeral director of Felipe Bagues Mortuary in Los Angeles, said her business has been bombarded, prompting her to hire new employees and an answering service to manage the surge in calls.\n \"We have had to turn away families, which is really hard,\" she said, because funeral directors and their staffs also operate as support for families going through their \"toughest time.\"\n \"You have to tell them that, I can put you on a wait list and we'll get to you,\" Bagues said. \"That's unheard of in our industry. I've been doing this 25 years and I've never had this happen.\"\n Hospitalizations in California are declining, dropping below 20,000 for the first time since Christmas, the Department of Public Health said Friday. But intensive care unit capacity remains scarce, with just 1,124 beds available statewide. The Southern California and San Joaquin Valley regions are still reporting 0% ICU capacity.\n A lack of information and a lack of financial support has left states struggling to manage a slow Covid-19 vaccine rollout, according to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n \"I am eligible in Minnesota to get a vaccination also and I can't find one,\" Osterholm, a former coronavirus adviser to President Joe Biden, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday. \"I want to share that frustration loud and clear.\"\n Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told CNN's Chris Cuomo that the state is well-positioned for distribution, but that the vaccine allotment has been bottled up at private pharmacies nationwide.\n \"Long-term care facilities in Utah, they have way too much vaccine. We estimate they have 15 to 16,000 extra doses that they don't need and can't use right now. So, we're taking that back and we're giving it to our local health departments and it will be gone next week,\" Cox said.\n Cox said the competition between states early in the pandemic, when the federal government forced states to scrounge for supplies such as personal protective equipment, should be avoided in the case of vaccines.\n \"This shouldn't be the 'Hunger Games,' like it was with PPE, right. That was ridiculous and we all had to play that game,\" he said. \"We're all in this together. Governors are in this together. We just need insight from the federal government and the manufacturers,\" Cox said.\n Send us your questions for President Biden's Covid-19 team\n The frustrations with vaccine distribution and concerns about supply have echoed across the country.\n New York has administered 97% of its allocated first doses of vaccine, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday, and is expected to run out shortly. On Saturday, Cuomo spoke from a vaccine pop-up site at a public housing complex in Brooklyn, where he emphasized the importance of equal access to vaccines for Black and Brown communities that have disproportionately suffered from the pandemic.\n \"Wealthier, White communities had more Covid testing,\" he said. \"When it comes to this vaccine, access has to be fair across the board.\"\n In Texas, the Houston Health Department's 1,600 new vaccination appointment slots were filled by eligible citizens within approximately five minutes of opening. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said the telephone system received about 250,000 calls which \"literally overwhelmed\" the system.\n Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that she receives daily calls from people \"desperately looking for the vaccine,\" adding \"I'm just not seeing an abundance of vaccine.\"\n The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Friday said it was receiving enough doses to inoculate just 1 in 4 people currently eligible.\n \"We have the infrastructure, the issue is getting access to the vaccine,\" L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell told CNN Saturday, speaking from The Forum in Inglewood, a vaccination super site where 9,400 people have been vaccinated since Tuesday, she said.\n National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins defended the vaccine rollout Saturday.\n \"It's not as bad as some people are painting it,\" Collins said in an MSNBC interview. \"We are now averaging almost a million doses per day going into arms, and that's a pretty good trajectory to get to where President Biden wants to.\"\n Biden has said his goal is to get 100 million doses administered in his first 100 days in office.\n \"We might easily exceed that, but I think he's being smart,\" Collins noted. \"Instead of overpromising and underdelivering, which is sort of what happened back in December, he's going to kind of under promise and then hope to overdeliver.\"\n Johnson & Johnson is expected to present data on its vaccine candidate in the next few weeks to the Food and Drug Administration for evaluation.\n If the vaccine receives emergency use authorization soon after, the United States could see a significant increase in doses available by May, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, said Saturday.\n \"Let's say they do develop and get an EUA in February, by the time they get a meaningful amount of doses, it likely will be a month or two following that,\" Fauci said in an interview on MSNBC.\n \"Once they get going into May, June, July, August, then you're going to see a sharp escalation of additional doses of this one-dose vaccine,\" he said.\n Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke with CNN on Friday about the coronavirus variant known as B.1.1.7, which was first identified in the United Kingdom and is believed to be more contagious. He says its transmission in the US needs to be monitored carefully.\n \"It has not become dominant,\" Fauci said. \"It might. That's the reason why you have to watch it carefully as we go from January into February, and really take a good look.\"\n CDC scientists are speaking with UK health officials to learn more about data they have on the variant that suggests it could be more deadly.\n \"The CDC has reached out to UK officials and is reviewing their new mortality data associated with variant B.1.1.7,\" a CDC official told CNN Saturday, using the scientific name for the variant first spotted in the UK in November.\n A CDC report this month said the variant has the potential to \"increase the US pandemic trajectory in the coming months,\" and people should focus on using masks, maintaining social distance and other measures that reduce transmission.\n Fauci agreed with the health recommendations. \"That's the kind of thing that prevents surges regardless of ... the type of virus.\"\n CNN's Andrea Diaz, Claudia Dominguez, Maggie Fox, Madeline Holcombe, Chuck Johnston, Lauren Mascarenhas, Michael Nedelman, Nick Neville, Raja Razek, Hollie Silverman, Alta Spells, Naomi Thomas, Paul Vercammen, Amanda Watts and Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The Arizona Republican Party sent a clear signal Saturday that its leadership remains loyal to former President Donald Trump when it voted to publicly punish Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, former Sen. Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain, all of whom opposed Trump's efforts to overturn President Joe Biden's victory, or in the case of Flake and McCain, endorsed the Democrat before the election.\n The decision to censure those three Republicans -- in addition to re-electing controversial chairwoman Kelli Ward -- solidified the rightward shift of the official party, while also reflecting the deep fractures among Arizona Republicans over the future of the GOP, which suffered bruising defeats at the ballot box in 2020 in this increasingly purple state.\n Biden flipped Arizona last fall -- the first time a Democrat has carried the state in a presidential election since Bill Clinton won the state in 1996 -- and Democrat Mark Kelly defeated Martha McSally in the US Senate race, just two years after McSally lost the state's other Senate seat to a Democrat.\n The three Republicans are being formally censured for what the state party described in its meeting as a variety of \"failures.\"\n The party censured Ducey for imposing emergency rules as Covid-19 gripped Arizona, saying those emergency orders to contain the virus violated the Constitution and amounted to the governor enacting \"dictatorial powers.\"\n McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain, who endorsed Biden during the election, was censured for supporting \"leftist causes\" and failing to support Trump.\n Flake, a CNN contributor, was also condemned for supporting Biden in the election.\n \"Foolish. It's foolish,\" says Glenn Hamer, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party. \"Parties that want to be successful bring people together and expand the number of people who are attracted to the party. What's going on with the leadership at the AZ GOP is the exact opposite. It's self-destructive.\"\n Kirk Adams, a former state representative and adviser to Ducey, called the actions akin to going down \"the rabbit hole of loyalty.\"\n \"What we're getting is a purity test, and that purity test is simple: are you loyal to Donald Trump no matter what? If you're not, we'll censure you.\"\n Ward appeared publicly unconcerned about any warnings from moderates, as she spoke to the assembled Arizona Republicans at the Dream City Church in Phoenix. The venue was closed to nearly all reporters, except for a few hand-selected outlets.\n Ward ended her speech ahead of the member vote for party chairwoman with, \"Make America Great Again!\" She then introduced a recorded audio message from Trump, where the former President told members, \"I give her my complete and total endorsement.\"\n Ward defeated her challenger by 3 points in two rounds of voting.\n Ducey's political director, Sara Mueller, discounted the power of the state party's actions, namely on the censure of the sitting governor. \"These resolutions are of no consequence whatsoever, and the people behind them have lost whatever little moral authority they may have once had,\" said Mueller.\n Flake tweeted a picture of himself with McCain and Ducey at Biden's Inauguration, with the words, \"Good company.\"\n McCain could not be reached for immediate comment, but tweeted: \"It is a high honor to be included in a group of Arizonans who have served our state and our nation so well...and who, like my late husband John, have been censured by the AZGOP. I'll wear this as a badge of honor.\"\n The late senator was censured in 2014 by the state GOP for what it then described as a liberal record.\n The immediate actions would seem to carry little impact on the three Republicans. And there are signs that some Arizona GOP voters may be disgruntled after the US Capitol insurrection. Numbers compiled by the Arizona Secretary of State's office show that from January 6 through January 20, more than 8,000 Republicans requested to change their party registration from Republican to Independent, Democrat or Libertarian. The Secretary of State's Office doesn't explicitly track party changes for reporting purposes, so it's unclear if these trends are unique to this post-election cycle.\n But Adams sees those registration numbers as a blaring siren that Trumpism has wreaked havoc on the future of this increasingly competitive state for the Republican brand.\n \"A lot of Republicans inside the official AZ GOP apparatus have left their conservative principals behind. They're now loyal to a single man or personality versus a platform of ideas,\" Adams said. \"Perhaps this fever will break. But if it doesn't, it spells bad news for Republicans seeking office in this state.\"\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Kirk Adams' last name.",

Several vehicles were damaged before police ordered the group to disperse, KOMO reported.\n Additional photos posted by police showed an Amazon Go store with shattered windows and spray-painted anarchy symbols and anti-Biden and anti-police graffiti, and broken windows at the original Starbucks location in Pike Place Market.\n \"You know when we don't have any level of accountability for people, and many of them that are coming from outside the city, they will continue that destruction.

        "body_text": "The chief of police in Killeen, Texas, is defending an officer who shot and killed a Black man during a mental health check earlier this month.\n Officer Reynaldo Contreras arrived at the home of Patrick Warren on January 10 after Warren's family called for psychiatric help.\n The police department said in a statement that, upon the officer's arrival, Warren was \"emotionally distressed,\" and newly released body camera footage shows the tense moments that led to Contreras firing his weapon at Warren three times.\n In the video, Contreras can be seen letting himself into the home after he is told by someone inside to \"come on in.\" Contreras quickly exits after Warren begins to yell and advance towards him.\n Warren can be seen outside a residence advancing toward the officer in the front yard and ignoring verbal commands for him to lie down. After the officer steps backward and continues to issue warnings, like \"You're gonna get tased,\" he uses his taser.\n Warren initially falls down but then stands back up and continues to push toward the officer. Contreras uses the taser again, but Warren keeps advancing and Contreras deploys his firearm.\n Warren, who was 52, was transported to a hospital and succumbed to his injures.\n The family's lawyer, Lee Merritt, has called for the officer to be fired. \"This is one of the worst officer-involved shootings that I've seen,\" Merritt told reporters earlier this week after the body camera footage was released, according to KWTX.\n Merritt did not return calls from CNN Thursday and Friday after the footage was released.\n Contreras, a five-year veteran of the department, is on administrative leave, according to the Killeen Police Department. An investigation is underway by the Texas Rangers, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n Bell County District Attorney Henry Garza directed all inquiries to the Texas Rangers.\n Police Chief Charles Kimble said this week that Contreras did everything he could to use non-lethal force against Warren before he deployed his firearm.\n \"I don't see where he could have done anything else. I saw an officer try to handle a call, de-escalate a call,\" Kimble told reporters on Tuesday.\n \"Given the same set of circumstances, I just don't know what else we could do,\" he added.\n Kimble said Contreras had more than the minimum amount of mandated training, but he said the police department was looking at ways to better address psychiatric calls.\n On Saturday, January 9, one day before the shooting, the county sent a mental health deputy to Warren's house. Merritt previously told CNN that the meeting with the county deputy went well. Warren voluntarily went with that deputy to the hospital that night but declined to stay at the hospital for further treatment.\n When the family called for another mental health check the next day, a police officer was dispatched. According to Merritt, the family wanted a mental health deputy again, rather than a police officer.\n Asked why a police officer was deployed on Sunday, Kimble said the call taker raised concerns about what they heard on the call from the family.\n \"It was a call for a psychiatric person,\" Kimble said. \"But as the call taker was listening to the caller, if certain things are said, or certain things are heard, then it prompts a different response...It prompted a police response, and it prompted a response from fire and medics who were standing by.\"\n CNN has reached out to the Killeen Police Employee Association for comment but has not yet heard back.",

He confessed to breaching the Capitol in an interview with investigators and was arrested on Friday, according to the Justice Department. Strong told law enforcement he hadn't done any damage or attacked law enforcement, according to the affidavit.\n Strong works for the Federal Aviation Administration and is a follower of the QAnon conspiracy movement, according to court documents. A day after the insurrection, an employee in the FAA's internal investigation branch contacted the FBI and reported Strong to law enforcement.\n Prosecutors say a tipster told the FBI that Strong has been \"stockpiling items and telling others to get ready for martial law.\" Based on that report, the FBI opened an investigation into Strong on December 30, according to the affidavit. The FBI says it searched Strong's home on January 16 and seized two guns owned by Strong's uncle and multiple digital devices, and that investigators found QAnon items during a search of his home.\n Andrew Ericson of Oklahoma, 23, was charged with two misdemeanors related to the attack. Prosecutors say he live-streamed himself entering the Capitol, walking into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and taking \"what appeared to be a beer out of a refrigerator in an office,\" according to someone identified in court documents as \"Witness 1,\" who watched the footage and recognized Ericson from a previous professional relationship.\n Investigators say they tracked down Ericson after Witness 1 watched his livestream on Snapchat and provided his name to the FBI. Ericson was arrested Friday, according to an FBI affidavit and the Justice Department.\n Ericson was charged with unlawful entry on restricted buildings or grounds and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.",

        "title": "Larry King, legendary talk show host, dies at 87",
        "body_text": "Larry King, the longtime CNN host who became an icon through his interviews with countless newsmakers and his sartorial sensibilities, has died. He was 87.\n King hosted \"Larry King Live\" on CNN for over 25 years, interviewing presidential candidates, celebrities, athletes, movie stars and everyday people. He retired in 2010 after taping more than 6,000 episodes of the show.\n A statement was posted on his verified Facebook account announcing his passing. His son, Chance, confirmed King's death Saturday morning.\n \"With profound sadness, Ora Media announces the death of our co-founder, host and friend Larry King, who passed away this morning at age 87 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,\" the statement said.\n \"For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster.\"\n The statement did not give a cause of death.\n King had been hospitalized with Covid-19 in late December at Cedars-Sinai, a source close to the family said at the time.\n He battled a number of health problems over the years, suffering several heart attacks. In 1987, he underwent quintuple bypass surgery, inspiring him to establish the Larry King Cardiac Foundation to provide assistance to those without insurance.\n More recently, King revealed in 2017 that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and successfully underwent surgery to treat it. He also underwent a procedure in 2019 to address angina.\n King also suffered personal loss last year when two of his adult children died within weeks of each other: Andy King, 65, suffered a heart attack and daughter Chaia King, 52, died after being diagnosed with lung cancer. King is survived by three sons, Larry, Jr., Chance and Cannon, who released a statement following their father's death.\n \"The world knew Larry King as a great broadcaster and interviewer, but to us he was 'Dad.' He was the man who lovingly obsessed over our daily schedules and our well-being, and who took such immense pride in our accomplishments -- large, small, or imagined,\" their statement said.\n \"Through it all, we knew without a doubt in the world that he loved us more than life itself. He was an amazing father, and he was fiercely loyal to those lucky enough to call him a friend. We will miss him every single day of our lives.\"\n In an era filled with star newsmen, King was a giant -- among the most prominent questioners on television and a host to presidents, movie stars and world class athletes.\n With an affable, easygoing demeanor that distinguished him from more intense TV interviewers, King perfected a casual approach to the Q&A format, always leaning forward and listening intently to his guests, rarely interrupting.\n \"I've never learned anything,\" King was fond of saying, \"while I was talking.\"\n CNN founder Ted Turner, in a statement, said news of King's death \"felt like a punch to the gut.\"\n \"Larry was one of my closest and dearest friends and, in my opinion, the world's greatest broadcast journalist of all time,\" he said. \"If anyone asked me what are my greatest career achievements in life, one is the creation of CNN, and the other is hiring Larry King. Like so many who worked with and knew Larry, he was a consummate professional, an amazing mentor to many and a good friend to all. The world has lost a true legend.\"\n Jeff Zucker, CNN President, on Saturday acknowledged King's role in raising the network's profile around the world.\n \"We mourn the passing of our colleague Larry King,\" he said in a statement.\n \"The scrappy young man from Brooklyn had a history-making career spanning radio and television. His curiosity about the world propelled his award-winning career in broadcasting, but it was his generosity of spirit that drew the world to him. We are so proud of the 25 years he spent with CNN, where his newsmaker interviews truly put the network on the international stage. From our CNN family to Larry's, we send our thoughts and prayers, and a promise to carry on his curiosity for the world in our work.\"\n For that quarter century, King hosted \"Larry King Live\" on CNN, a span that was highlighted by more than 30,000 interviews, including every sitting president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama, and thousands of phone calls from viewers.\n Wendy Walker, his longtime executive producer on the show, said King treated all of his interview subjects the same -- from heads of state to ordinary Americans.\n \"The one thing he loved was being in front of that camera,\" she said. \"He was a very interesting man but that one hour a day, when those lights came on, he was just perfect. He treated every guest the same. It didn't matter if it was a president or somebody just off the street.\"\n King was known for not spending time preparing for interviews, preferring instead to let his natural curiosity guide the conversations, Walker said.\n \"Probably that was the hardest part of our job -- trying to prepare him because he never wanted to be prepared,\" she recalled. \"He read all day long and watched news, so he was really informed but he really just wanted to hear his guests talk and then come up with his questions.\"\n The show made King one of the faces of the network, and one of the most famous television journalists in the country. His column in USA Today, which ran for nearly 20 years until 2001, showcased King's distinct style in print, inviting readers down a trail of non-sequiturs that served as a window into his mind.\n \"The most underutilized player in the NFL this year was Washington's Desmond Howard...Despite what you think of Lawrence Walsh, we will always have the need for a special prosecutor because a government cannot investigate itself,\" King wrote in a 1992 column.\n Those musings, combined with his unmistakable appearance -- oversized glasses, ever-present suspenders -- made King ripe for caricature. In the 1990s, he was portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" by Norm MacDonald, who channeled the USA Today column with a spot-on impersonation.\n Jokes aside, King's influence is evident today in the generation of podcasters who have mimicked -- whether deliberate or not -- his conversational approach to interviews.\n \"A good interview \u2014 you know more than you do before you start. You should come away with maybe some of your opinions changed,\" King told the Los Angeles Times in 2018. \"You should certainly come away entertained \u2014 an interviewer is also an entertainer.\"\n Born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger on November 19, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, King was raised by two Jewish immigrants. His mother, Jennie (Gitlitz) Zeiger, was from Lithuania, while his father, Edward Zeiger, hailed from Ukraine. Edward died of a heart attack when King was 10, a memory King said he mostly \"blocked out.\"\n Left to raise King and his younger brother Marty alone, Jennie Zeiger was forced to go on welfare to support her children. The death had a profound effect on King, and his mother.\n \"Prior to his death, I'd been a good student but afterwards, I just stopped being interested,\" King told The Guardian in a 2015 interview. \"It was a real blow to me. But eventually I channeled that anger because I wanted to make him and my mother proud.\"\n King said his father had enormous influence on him, instilling in his son a sense of humor and a love of sports. And no sport drew more of King's affection than baseball.\n He grew up a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and continued to support the team after its move to Los Angeles. He was a fixture at the team's home games in Dodger Stadium, often spotted in the high-priced seats behind home plate. In 2004, King wrote a book aptly titled, \"Why I Love Baseball.\"\n \"He was a voracious Dodgers fan, baseball fan,\" said longtime friend and Dodgers sportscaster Charley Steiner. \"And we would fuss and fight about what the Dodgers were doing. He was terribly frustrated year after year when the Dodgers would win the division, fall short in the World Series. But this year he got to see the Dodgers win the World Series. It made him enormously happy.\"\n King's career in media began in earnest in 1957, when he took a job as a disc jockey at WAHR-AM in Miami. It was then when he made the decision to drop his surname.\n \"You can't use Larry Zeiger,\" he recalled his boss at the station saying. \"It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name.\"\n \"There was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes,\" King wrote in his 2009 autobiography.\n \"The Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, 'King! How about Larry King?'\"\n It was around this time that King entered what would become a string of failed marriages. His union with Frada Miller was annulled, and the dates of his second marriage with Annette Kaye are publicly unavailable.\n From 1961-63, King was married to Alene Akins, whom he married again from 1967-71; before they re-married, King tied the knot with Mickey Sutphin in 1964 before they divorced in 1966.\n He had two more divorces -- with Sharon Lepore, with whom he was married from 1976-82, and Julie Alexander, with whom he was married from 1989-92 -- before marrying his seventh wife, Shawn Southwick in 1997 at UCLA Medical Center, as he was about to undergo cardiac surgery. King filed for divorce from Southwick in 2019, citing irreconcilable differences.\n King remained in Miami for years, eventually getting hired as a columnist for the Miami Herald in 1965. In 1971, he was arrested in Miami on charges of grand larceny, which led to his suspension from the station and newspaper where he was employed. Although the charges were dismissed the following year, King was not re-hired, prompting him to decamp Florida and head to Louisiana, where he worked as a freelance journalist.\n By 1978, King returned to Miami and to WIOD, the station where he was employed at the time of his arrest. The same year, \"The Larry King Show\" launched as a syndicated late-night radio show. It originally aired in 28 cities; within five years, it had spread to 118 cities, serving as the springboard to fame. The show won a Peabody Award in 1982.\n In 1985, \"Larry King Live\" premiered on CNN, beginning a long and storied run that included a number of high-profile interviews. Throughout its more than two decades on air, the show was routinely CNN's most-watched program, and King was arguably the network's biggest star.\n King left CNN in 2011, a move he expected would amount to retirement. But he kept working until his death, hosting \"Larry King Now,\" a program that aired on Ora TV, Hulu and RT America. King, it seemed, just never wanted the interview to end.\n \"I just love what I do,\" he said, \"I love asking questions, I love doing the interviews.\"\n CNN's Sonia Tucker and David J. Lopez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Democrats working on legislation to provide $3,000 payments per child amid pandemic ",
        "body_text": "House Democrats are working on legislation proposed by President Joe Biden to expand the existing child tax credit, directing the IRS to send recurring monthly payments to American families, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.\n In one draft of the proposal, the IRS would deposit checks worth $300 every month per child younger than 6 and $250 every month per child age 6 to 17. This would give parents $3,000 per year for each child between the ages of 6 to 17, and $3,600 per child under age 6.\n The changes would last for a year, but lawmakers would then push to make them permanent, another Democratic aide said.\n The source also confirmed to CNN that House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal of Massachusetts is directly involved in the effort to write the expansion of the child tax credit, as well as House Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Rep. Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington.\n The drafting of the proposed legislation was first reported by The Washington Post.\n Eligibility for the benefit, similar to the stimulus checks, would be based on family income for the prior tax year and be phased out at a certain income amount, the Post reported.\n A White House official didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.\n Biden has previously said he wants to expand the child tax credit and last week he unveiled a $1.9 trillion proposal that would do so for one year. He also called for making it fully refundable to allow more households to claim it. Currently, 27 million children live in low-income families who receive a partial or no tax credit because they earn too little, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n A one-year expansion would cost about $120 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan fiscal watchdog.\n The President's proposal also includes an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit to more low-income workers, along with $1,400 stimulus checks, increased unemployment, nutrition and housing aid, among other measures.\n \"All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty,\" Biden said Friday before signing two executive orders that would augment nutrition assistance and strengthen federal worker protections.\n Biden also noted that the proposal would reduce poverty among Black families by one third and among Hispanic households by almost 40%.\n The American Rescue Plan would augment many of the measures in Congress' historic $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill from March and in the $900 billion legislation from December, which was scaled back to garner support from Senate Republicans.\n CNN has reported that Biden's stimulus proposal already faces Republican objections, and Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans stall their efforts.\n The White House has urged patience when it comes to negotiating and passing the stimulus plan on a bipartisan basis through the regular Senate process, but Biden's team has said they aren't willing to \"take any tools off the table.\"\n The current child tax credit provides up to $2,000 per child under the age of 17. The credit phases out for single parents with a modified adjusted gross income over $200,000, and $400,000 for married couples. It is paid as a lump sum, not in monthly increments.\n The $3 trillion Heroes Act, which the House passed in May, included similar enhancements to the child tax credit.\n The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act broadened eligibility to many more upper-middle-income households, increased the size of the credit for many families and the amount that is refundable. The changes were pushed by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n More than 48 million households are expected to claim the child tax credit for 2020, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.\n This story has been updated with additional details.\n CNN's Katie Lobosco contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A Chinese-born alleged drug kingpin accused of presiding over a multi-billion dollar narcotics operation has been arrested by Dutch authorities.\n Canadian national Tse Chi Lop was detained at Amsterdam's Schipol International Airport on Friday, according to Australian Federal Police (AFP), which has taken the lead in a sprawling international investigation. Before his arrest, Tse was one of the world's most-wanted fugitives.\n \"The importance of Tse's arrest can not be underestimated. It's big and (has) been a long time coming,\" said Jeremy Douglas, the Regional Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.\n Asia's methamphetamine trade is believed to be worth between $30 billion and $61 billion a year, and Sam Gor, which is sometimes simply referred to as \"the Company,\" is allegedly its biggest player.\n The organization is accused of running a synthetic drug manufacturing empire in large swathes of the under-policed jungles of Myanmar, a region marred by civil war and still under the control of various competing warlords and militias -- conditions that make it easy to hide industrial-scale drug manufacturing operations from law enforcement.\n From there, Sam Gor has allegedly been able to procure large amounts of precursor chemicals, the ingredients to make synthetic drugs, and then move them across the region to nearby markets in Bangkok, but also to farther-flung ones in Australia and Japan, law enforcement said.\n Sam Gor allegedly had operatives working throughout the globe, with players in South Korea, England, Canada and the United States, according to a briefing on the syndicate shared with CNN by an official with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n The documents described Sam Gor as a \"triad-like network\" -- a reference to ethnic Chinese gangs that operate in Asia and North America -- but more mobile and dynamic. The group's existence was revealed in 2016 after a Taiwanese drug trafficker was arrested in Yangon, Myanmar, the briefing showed.\n Further police investigations revealed that the organization was, as of 2018, earning between $8 billion and $17.7 billion worth of illicit proceeds a year, according to the briefing. The organization uses poorly regulated casinos in Southeast Asia to launder a significant portion of those proceeds.\n AFP said a warrant was issued for Tse's arrest in 2019 in connection with an operation targeting Sam Gor.\n \"The syndicate targeted Australia over a number of years, importing and distributing large amounts of illicit narcotics, laundering the profits overseas and living off the wealth obtained from crime,\" AFP said in a statement.\n Tse allegedly ran his multibillion dollar operation from Hong Kong, Macao and southeast Asia. But his name -- or existence -- was not public knowledge until he was revealed by a Reuters investigation published in 2019.\n Dutch police spokesman Thomas Aling said Tse is expected to be extradited after appearing before a judge. Authorities in the Netherlands were unable to provide details about the legal proceedings and it was not clear whether Tse had a lawyer.\n This is not Tse's first run-in with law enforcement. Tse pleaded guilty to felony narcotics charges in the United States in 2000 and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Details surrounding the case are limited because it is still sealed, but the source said he was released in 2006 and returned to Canada before moving to Hong Kong.\n While Douglas of the UNODC praised Tse's arrest, he said more needed to be done to ensure drug lords cannot take advantage of poor government oversight of the areas in Myanmar and Laos.\n \"While taking down syndicate leadership matters, the conditions they effectively used in the region to do business remain unaddressed, and the network remains in-place,\" he said. \"A lot of difficult information is about to come out.\"\n Reuters contributed to this report",

        "title": "She was murdered for catching an Indian priest and nun in a sex act. Three decades later, justice is served",
        "body_text": "The dead nun's slippers were scattered on the convent kitchen floor -- one near the entrance, the other by the fridge.\n Her white veil was found snagged on the door. An open bottle of water was leaking onto the tiles.\n In the corner of the room was an ax.\n Officers discovered the crime scene, described in court documents seen by CNN, at St. Pius X Convent Hostel in southern India on March 27, 1992.\n Later that day, they found Sister Abhaya's body in a nearby well at the Indian convent, in the city of Kottayam, Kerala.\n A post-mortem examination revealed she had nail marks on both sides of her neck and two lacerated wounds on her head. Her body had multiple abrasions and she had sustained a fracture to her skull.\n Despite her wounds and the kitchen crime scene, no one was brought to court over Sister Abhaya's murder for 27 years. Instead, what followed was years of dead-end investigations, plagued with allegations of corruption.\n Finally, last December, guilty verdicts were handed down to a priest and nun who had gone to extraordinary lengths to protect their illicit relationship. The court found Sister Abhaya had walked in on them while they were engaging a sex act in the kitchen, and killed her to conceal their sins. They were sentenced to life in prison.\n After nearly three decades of fighting for justice, her family have one overriding question.\n \"Why did it take so long?\" asks Sister Abhaya's brother, Biju Thomas.\n When she died, Sister Abhaya was a student at a local college run by the Knanaya Catholic Church in Kottayam, then home to about 1.8 million people.\n Among India's Hindu-majority population, 2.3% follow Christianity -- a figure that hasn't changed in more than two decades. But Kerala has a sizable Christian community, around 18% of its people.\n According to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which prosecuted the case, Sister Abhaya woke up at about 4:15am on the day of her murder to study for an exam.\n She went to the ground floor kitchen to fetch some water and it was there prosecutors said she found Father Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy performing a sex act. Father Kottoor taught psychology at the school and Sister Sephy was in charge of the convent hostel where the act took place.\n Prosecutors said the pair \"maintained an illicit relationship\".\n The night before the murder, prosecutors said the priest snuck onto the convent grounds and stayed in Sister Sephy's room, which was on the ground floor of the hostel, near the kitchen.\n When they realized the young nun had seen them in a compromising position, the pair hit her on the back of the head with a small ax kept in the kitchen, then threw her body into a well on the hostel grounds.\n The details of what happened that night didn't come to light until years later, after immense pressure from activists and the young nun's family. Her father, in particular, refused to give up.\n The first investigation into Sister Abhaya's death was opened by the Kottayam West Police Crime Branch on the day her body was found. A year later, it concluded the cause of her death was suicide.\n But Sister Abhaya's father, Matthew Thomas, refused to accept their version of events and urged the CBI, the nation's premier investigation agency, to take over the case.\n They picked it up in 1993, but for 12 years did not charge anyone for her death. Instead, between 1993 and 2005, the CBI filed four reports, including three closure petitions, urging the Chief Judicial Magistrate to drop the case.\n In their first report, they agreed with Kottayam police that the cause of death was \"suicide by drowning.\" However, it was not accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and the case was reopened.\n Their second report, published in 1996, was inconclusive -- they could not determine if it was suicide or homicide. Investigators once again urged the case to be closed. This was once again rejected.\n Their third report, published in 1999, stated it was a homicide but didn't nominate any suspects. This was rejected as \"unsatisfactory\" by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.\n Yet another report was filed in 2005, reiterating the case was \"untraced,\" as they could not identify any suspects. And once again, it was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate.\n After this, the investigation was transferred from the CBI New Delhi branch to the CBI in the southern city of Cochin in Kerala.\n Finally, in 2009, the CBI formally charged Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy with murder, as well as another priest, Father Jose Poothrikkayil, who police said was involved in the killing.\n All three denied the charge, as well as allegations of conducting an improper relationship.\n They filed a dismissal request to get the case dropped, and it took another nine years before a judge ordered Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy to face trial. Charges against Father Poothrikkayil were dropped due to lack of evidence.\n On August 5, 2019, the trial finally began.\n Prosecutors argued that Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy went to remarkable lengths to cover up their relationship and crime.\n In court, prosecutors accused police officers from the Kottayam West Crime Branch of tampering with evidence and destroying documents crucial to the investigation.\n \"It is reasonable to suppose that Father Kottoor had at his control the immense resources of the diocese in terms of money and material, and could command the obedience of priests, nuns, and laymen,\" the prosecution said.\n Prosecutors alleged lead investigators, including the Superintendent and the Deputy Superintendent of the police, were instrumental in the cover up.\n The judge agreed with the prosecution's assertions that early police investigators fabricated and destroyed evidence, including the plastic bottle, Sister Abhaya's slippers, and her white veil.\n He ordered the state's police head to ensure that \"such misdeeds on the part of the police\" do not occur in future.\n Only one charge was made against an investigating officer, but that was dropped in 2008 after he died.\n At least one other lead investigator from the Kottayam West Police Crime Branch, who was accused of fabricating and destroying evidence, also died before the case concluded.\n Father Kottoor maintains his innocence.\n \"I have done no wrong. God is with me,\" he told local reporters as he arrived in court on December 23 for the sentencing hearing.\n His lawyer said the case relied entirely on circumstantial evidence. \"There is no conclusive evidence,\" said Father Kottoor's lawyer, B. Sivdas. \"And there was a delay in the investigation, a delay in finding the accused, there were so many loopholes. The court convicted them because the case became a sensation.\"\n Sister Abhaya -- born Beena Thomas -- was a \"polite and quiet child,\" according to her brother, Biju Thomas. They grew up in Kottayam, and were \"devout Catholics and followers of Jesus Christ.\"\n \"I remember when she was about five or six, she began taking a huge interest in God and the Bible,\" said Thomas, now 51 and living in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. \"She would read the Bible religiously, and take comfort in its teachings. Everyone loved her. She was always laughing.\"\n Sister Abhaya was 19 when she was \"called to a religious life,\" according to Thomas. The family had relatives in Germany and Italy who were also nuns. Thomas said that his sister admired the respect they received, and the work that they did.\n \"She wanted to be respected also, and devote her life to Jesus,\" he said.\n Thomas was 24 when he was told that his sister had died by suicide. \"I was so confused because she was happy, and she was following her dream. Why would she have killed herself?\" he said.\n Thomas traveled back to Kottayam town, from the state of Gujarat where he was studying, to be with his family and take care of his sister's funeral arrangements. Several days later, he visited her body in the morgue and read the postmortem report that revealed his sister had head injuries and nail marks to her neck.\n \"These to me showed that something had happened to her before she was thrown in the well,\" he said.\n Sister Sephy filed an eight-page written statement stating that Sister Abhaya suffered from \"psychological depression.\" She claimed that Sister Abhaya came from an \"economically weak family and was not good enough in her studies.\"\n Some other nuns were \"staunch upholders\" of the suicide theory, according to the final judgment. They \"endeavored to give all support to the accused,\" the judgment said.\n \"It was very hurtful to hear those things said about my sister,\" said Thomas. \"She didn't kill herself. She was silenced.\"\n Sister Abhaya's father -- a low-wage farmer -- fought tooth and nail for his daughter, Thomas said.\n \"We were poor people, we didn't have much money,\" said Thomas. \"But my father would travel for hours a day by bus to probe the police to reopen the case and give us the truth.\"\n \"He suffered a lot,\" said Thomas. \"He always said 'someone killed my Beena. I am sure of it'.\"\n Days after news broke of Sister Abhaya's death, the suspicious nature of the case piqued the interest of a young activist, Jomon Puthenpurackal.\n \"When I heard details about (Sister Abhaya's) case -- the overturned fruit basket, the ax in the kitchen, her slippers in different positions -- I knew immediately that something bad had happened to her,\" said Puthenpurackal, who said he was inspired by Kottayam-based freedom fighter, K E Mammen, to \"do good in the world.\"\n \"I knew she hadn't committed suicide, like the police and the Church said,\" he said.\n Puthenpurackal soon formed an Action Council to get justice for the murdered nun. He took a signed petition, along with Sister Abhaya's father, to the CBI, detailing all the allegations of corruption and listing key witnesses.\n Every time the CBI filed a petition to close the case, Puthenpurackal kept the pressure on, using the Indian media to keep the case in the public eye, and urging investigators to dig deeper.\n There was one witness, in particular, who had testimony Puthenpurackal felt was key to convicting the case. Adacka Raju was a \"thief by profession,\" according to court documents. He had trespassed onto the hostel campus on the night of the murder to steal copper plates from the terrace, which he planned to sell, according to court documents.\n Raju had stolen copper plates from the hostel twice before. But on his third attempt -- the night of the murder -- he told the court that he saw two men approaching the staircase. He identified one of them as Father Kottoor.\n During the trial, defense lawyers vehemently argued against Raju's version of events and sought to discredit him, by branding him untrustworthy and a \"man of no integrity.\" They also alleged that he was a witness planted by the prosecution.\n The prosecution, however, said Raju was taken into custody by the Crime Branch and kept in the station for 58 days. He was subjected to \"inhumane torture\" by officers there, who tried to extract a confession to pin the murder on him.\n \"He stood his ground and did not budge even an inch,\" according to the prosecution. \"He was offered a substantial monetary reward and a job for his wife and the meeting of the educational expenses of his children and a house to live in, but he did not succumb to these blandishments.\"\n The police even arrested an acquaintance of Raju's, and tortured him for two days, according to court documents seen by CNN. The judge stated that the acquaintance's brother was also arrested and tortured for six days. He was repeatedly told to testify that Raju had committed Sister Abhaya's murder.\n \"Raju faced many difficulties in coming forward,\" said Puthenpurackal. \"(The defense) completely dehumanized him. But he was one of the only witnesses who stood his ground, despite the mounting pressure.\"\n \"I dedicated my life to this case and I wanted to see it through the end,\" said Puthenpurackal, who continued to pursue the case even when it endangered his safety.\n Father Kottoor threatened Puthenpurackal at a protest for Sister Abhaya. According to court documents, Father Kottoor warned Puthenpurackal that he would be \"handled in the proper manner,\" also pointing out that \"no one working against the church had ever been spared.\"\n Because religious authorities in India are held in such high regard, victims often find it difficult to come forward if their perpetrators are involved with the church, according to the former president of the All India Catholic Union, John Dayal.\n However, in recent years a number of victims in Kerala have come forward to seek justice.\n In April 2019, Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal was charged with raping a nun multiple times between 2014 and 2016. A group of nuns who spoke against his alleged abuse claimed the church attempted to transfer them to other parts of the country, in a bid to silence them. Mulakkal, who is now based in the northern state of Punjab, has denied all allegations.\n Former Catholic priest, Robin Vadakkumchery was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2019 for raping a 16-year-old girl in Kerala. The incident came to light only after the victim gave birth in February 2017.\n The victim and her parents attempted to redirect focus away from the priest. Her father went as far as telling the court that he was the one who raped his daughter.\n Sister Abhaya's parents died in 2015, before their daughters' attackers were brought to justice.\n \"I just wish my parents could have been here to see it happen,\" said Thomas, Sister Abhaya's brother. \"That's all they ever wanted.\"\n Thomas said he \"can rest in peace\" and move on with his life, now that the case is finally over.\n However, he said he still struggles to reconcile his sister's love for the church with the horror of what happened that night -- and the fact that those who purported to share her faith were the ones who \"took her away.\"",

        "body_text": "Scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are speaking with UK health officials to learn more about British data that suggests a new coronavirus variant could be more deadly.\n \"The CDC has reached out to UK officials and is reviewing their new mortality data associated with variant B.1.1.7,\" a CDC official told CNN Saturday, using the scientific name for the variant first spotted in the UK in November.\n A UK report released Friday states there is \"a realistic possibility\" that the new variant has a higher death rate than other variants.\n While the data is not conclusive, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said \"there is some evidence that the new variant ... may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.\"\n CDC modeling shows this new variant, which has been shown to spread especially quickly, could become the predominant variant in the United States by March.\n Only 195 cases of the new variant have been spotted in the US so far, according to the CDC, but public health officials believe many more cases are going undetected. Cases have been found in 22 states, the CDC says, with California and Florida detecting an especially high number.\n So far, studies suggest that the current vaccines will protect against the new variant, and that wearing masks, social distancing and hand hygiene are key to controlling spread of the virus.\n Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and member of President Joe Biden's coronavirus transition team, said he has reviewed the UK report, as well as other data that has not been publicly released, and he is \"convinced\" that the new variant is deadlier.\n \"The data is mounting --  and some of it I can't share -- that clearly supports that B.1.1.7 is causing more severe illness and increased death,\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"Already we know this variant has increased transmission, and so this is more very bad news.\"\n A CDC adviser said it would be ideal if US doctors could check and see how patients with the new variant fare compared to patients infected with other variants.\n But Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said this could be difficult because genomic sequencing -- the lab work necessary to detect new strains -- is not very robust in the United States.\n \"Our current ability to determine whether your particular patient has this new strain is very limited, and so this really reinforces the notion that other countries have much more capacity to do this than we do,\" said Schaffner, a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n The UK has one of the strongest genomic sequencing programs in the world. Their report gives details of several studies that compare the severity of the new variant with previous ones.\n The UK's chief science adviser, Patrick Vallance, cited the mortality data, adding that the evidence is not yet strong and the data remain uncertain.\n \"If you took ... a man in their 60s, the average risk is that for 1,000 people who got infected, roughly 10 would be expected to unfortunately die with the virus. With the new variant, for 1,000 people infected, roughly 13 or 14 people might be expected to die,\" he said Friday.\n \"That's the sort of change for that sort of age group, an increase from 10 to 13 or 14 out of 1,000 and you will see that across the different age groups as well, a similar sort of relative increase in the risk,\" he added.\n Analyses cited in the UK report include those done by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London, the University of Exeter and Public Health England.",

        "title": "Biden's push for bipartisanship faces early test",
        "body_text": "President Joe Biden's pledge to restore a tradition of bipartisan deal-making in Washington is facing an early test as a divided Congress weighs his ambitious pandemic relief plan.\n The $1.9 trillion \"rescue\" package Biden rolled out last week -- a big-ticket bid to revive a coronavirus-ravaged economy -- is getting the cold shoulder from Republicans. And some Democrats, anxious to act quickly, are beginning to question whether there is any point in trying to win their support.\n For Biden, who as a candidate branded himself the Democrat best positioned to break Capitol Hill gridlock, the story of his presidency could well be written over the coming weeks, as the work of crafting the bill and wrangling votes for it begins in earnest. But even in the face of Republican opposition and Democratic anxiety, Biden is betting on himself and a team of seasoned negotiators to deliver not only a massive aid package, but also a victory that would vindicate one of the core premises of his political life -- that there is always room and reason to negotiate with partisan foes.\n The legislation Biden described will, under the Senate's current rules, require at least 10 Republican votes and a unified Democratic caucus to pass. If that fails, the White House and Senate Democrats are poised to pivot to a process called budget reconciliation, which would allow for a pared-down package to pass with a simple majority. To get the full package without GOP support, Senate Democrats would likely have to go \"nuclear\" and change or end the legislative filibuster, a move that former President Barack Obama endorsed last year.\n Biden's stance is less clear. He has supported retaining the filibuster in the past but hedged in comments last summer, saying his posture could change depending on \"how obstreperous (Republicans) become.\" Asked on Friday where Biden currently stands, White House press secretary Jen Psaki would say only that his \"position has not changed.\"\n Moving to the budget reconciliation or getting rid of the filibuster would put a dent in Biden's claim of being a master negotiator. But it might be the only way, Democrats argue, to deliver relief to Americans desperate for it.\n \"Biden has to give McConnell some chance to see if he's going to play ball, but I think there's a time limit with that. I don't think that Biden has the luxury of waiting forever. I think three months, four months at the most,\" said former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who worked closely with both Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and Biden during his time in the Senate. \"There's going to come a time that the filibuster is going to have to go. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when it's going to go.\"\n Reid acknowledged that getting rid of the filibuster -- or any moves to go around Republicans -- would undercut Biden's political brand. But the Nevada Democrat argued that his former colleague will likely have to choose between being an icon of bipartisanship and a President with a lengthy list of accomplishments.\n \"You can't do both. ... His legacy will be judged on what he gets done. If (Republicans) are going to stop him from getting anything done, his legacy will not be a good one,\" Reid said, before he put a finer point on it: \"Joe Biden will be recognized for what he's accomplished. And won't be recognized for 'I got along with everybody. We didn't get everything done, but I was sure nice to everybody.' \"\n During her first briefing on Wednesday night, Psaki said Biden \"will be quite involved\" in the negotiating process and pointed to his 36 years in the Senate as evidence that his engagement could yield results. But she also suggested that Biden would not hesitate to cut bait when the time came.\n \"His clear preference is to move forward with a bipartisan bill. There's no question about it,\" Psaki said. \"But we are also not going to take any tools off the table for how the House and Senate can get this urgent package done.\"\n One of Biden's top advisers, National Economic Council director Brian Deese, confirmed on Friday afternoon that he will speak to a bipartisan group of senators Sunday.\n \"In terms of the message, it's pretty clear,\" Deese told reporters. \"We're at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy. Without decisive action, we risk falling into a very serious economic hole, even more serious than the crisis we find ourselves in.\"\n He stopped to make note that former Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett has come out in support of the package.\n Still, some Democrats are already beginning to urge Biden not to get hung up on hopes of winning a bipartisan, filibuster-proof majority. Their ranks include veterans of the Obama administration's protracted and ultimately fruitless quest to win over Republican support for the Affordable Care Act more than a decade ago.\n Kathleen Sebelius, a former Kansas governor who was Obama's first Health and Human Services secretary, said she learned the hard way that waiting too long for Republican support -- something that former Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who was the Senate Finance chairman during the process, promised but failed to deliver -- could do real political damage.\n \"There is not a lot of time to waste,\" Sebelius said of Biden's relief push. \"He is wise to put it forward early, to say, 'I want bipartisan support,' and then to do anything he can to get whatever he can passed as quickly as possible, because people are really hurting.\"\n The long process of passing Obamacare allowed Republicans to marshal opposition and positioned them to use the law -- which was still mostly an abstraction after its passage in early 2010 -- as a cudgel during that year's midterm elections, when Democrats got \"shellacked,\" as Obama then put it. A similar delay, Sebelius added, threatened to hamstring Democratic efforts to keep, or potentially expand, their congressional majorities in the 2022 election.\n \"People have to feel the impact of what happens quickly. They have to know their lives are better,\" said Sebelius. \"Things that are very tangible have to happen visibly and quickly.\"\n Democrats in the Senate are keeping a close eye on their GOP counterparts and, according to a senior aide to a member of the caucus, remain \"overwhelmingly upbeat\" about the White House's proposal and the messaging around it.\n \"There's no heartburn over Biden's initial kind of play to make it bipartisan, to reach across the aisle,\" the aide said, adding that there is also \"no illusion\" among the Democrats over the prospect of Republicans coming on board -- a reality that was hammered home by moderate Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins' recent comments questioning the need for more spending.\n The plan, the aide said, was simple: \"We tout (the bill), we celebrate it, we say we want to reach across the aisle -- and at the same time, we need to be quietly moving to pursue some of this policy agenda via reconciliation.\"\n Some Democrats, especially in the party's progressive ranks, have already questioned the strategy or are signaling their desire for a quick pivot to action -- with or without GOP backing.\n \"I believe that President-elect Biden has a very optimistic view of the Republican Party. He has made past statements (saying) once Trump is gone, they will see the error of their ways,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told reporters after a virtual town hall last week. \"I applaud his optimism, but disagree with his assessment.\"\n Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming Budget Committee chairman, has been supportive of Biden's approach so far, but he wrote in a CNN op-ed on the eve of the inauguration that Democrats should be prepared to go it alone, using reconciliation.\n \"The danger we face would not be in going too big or spending too much but in going too small and leaving the needs of the American people behind,\" the Vermont independent wrote. \"If Republicans would like to work with us, we should welcome them. But their support is not necessary.\"\n The tension between the more aggressive approach favored by Sanders and fellow progressives, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, was one of the core conflicts of the 2020 Democratic primary contest. Biden ultimately emerged, in part, because a wider swath of Democratic voters embraced his conciliatory pitch.\n Biden also benefited, in some quarters, from the view that almost anything he supported, because of his long record of taking moderate positions in the Senate and as vice president, was definitionally the moderate approach -- even when he stakes out ground to the left of where the Obama administration landed.\n That brand will likely help the newly inaugurated President as he attempts to convince the public that pursuing his biggest campaign promise -- uniting a severely divided country -- and passing a massive Covid relief bill are not in conflict.",

        "body_text": "Actor Gregory Sierra, best known for his roles in \"Sanford and Son\" and \"Barney Miller,\" died on January 4 from cancer, his widow Helene Tabor confirmed to CNN Friday. He was 83.\n \"He was quite wonderful, and my heart is broken into 400 million pieces,\" Tabor said. The cancer persisted \"for quite a while and he was doing the best he could and just couldn't do it anymore,\" she said.\n Originally from New York, Sierra relocated to California, pursuing a film and stage career that ultimately spanned five decades. His most prominent roles were in sitcoms from the 1970s.\n In NBC's \"Sanford and Son,\" he was a series regular as the Sanfords' neighbor Julio Fuentes. Later, he portrayed Miguel \"Chano\" Amanguale, a detective on ABC's \"Barney Miller.\"\n Sierra also had supporting or guest roles in \"All in the Family,\" \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Miami Vice,\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\"\n Film credits included \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes,\" \"Papillon,\" and \"The Towering Inferno.\"\n Tabor called Sierra \"a brilliant actor\" and said he was still receiving fan mail in the days since his death. His last credited acting role was in 2018. Tabor said he decided to retire because, while he still loved acting, he had difficulty remembering his lines.\n Tabor said he was \"the first person to help anybody that needed help and he cared about people very much.\"\n Sierra is also survived by two stepdaughters and a step-granddaughter, all of whom, Tabor said, \"loved him and called him 'Dad.'\"\n CNN's Travis Caldwell contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The UK's decision to wait up to 12 weeks before giving people their second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine should be scrapped, senior doctors have said, reigniting a debate over the British government's unorthodox inoculation strategy.\n Britain is prioritizing giving more of its most at-risk citizens a first dose of a vaccine, and has delayed appointments for a second jab.\n But the decision has been debated in the medical community, and the chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) urged ministers to follow the \"best practice\" and cut the wait time to six weeks for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.\n Pfizer/BioNTech recommend the second dose takes place 21 days after the first, and have said there's no data to support a 12-week gap.\n \"What we're saying is that the UK should adopt this best practice based on international professional opinion,\" BMA chairman Dr. Chaand Nagpaul told the BBC on Saturday. The organization has sent a letter to the UK's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, warning against the delay.\n \"Most nations in the world are facing challenges similar to the UK, in having limited vaccine supply and also wanting to protect their population maximally,\" Nagpaul added. \"No other nation has adopted the UK's approach.\"\n In a statement to CNN, a BMA spokesperson said the letter informs Whitty of \"the growing concern from the medical profession regarding the delay of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as the UK's strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries.\"\n The group told CNN they were also concerned about the availability of the vaccine in the coming weeks, saying their members feel that \"given the unpredictability of supplies, there may not be any guarantees that second doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be available in 12 weeks' time.\"\n \"The Association is urging the (Chief Medical Officer) to urgently review the UK's current position of second doses after 12 weeks,\" they said.\n Britain is vaccinating its citizens at one of the quickest rates in the world, thanks partly to its spread-out dosing strategy. More than 5 million Brits have received at least one dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and more than 400,000 people are receiving the jab on a daily basis.\n Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle defended the plan, telling the BBC on Saturday it was necessary to bring the virus under control.\n \"The more people that are protected against this virus, the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand. Protecting more people is the right thing to do,\" she said.\n The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been in use in the UK since early December, when it became the first country in the world to approve it.\n When Britain first announced its plans, Pfizer said it did not have data to demonstrate that just a single dose of its vaccine would provide protection against the disease after more than 21 days.\n \"Pfizer and BioNTech's Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days,\" Pfizer said in a statement last month. \"There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.\"\n But the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland explained the move in a letter to health care professionals after the vaccine was approved, saying it was based on the \"balance of risks and benefits,\" and that the \"great majority\" of initial protection came from the first jab.\n The debate comes as Covid-19 deaths soar in the UK. While new cases are declining since Britain went into a third lockdown this month, the country reported its highest-ever daily fatality toll on Wednesday, with 1,820 deaths, giving a total of 97,517, according to John Hopkins University.\n CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Nada Bashir contributed reporting",

        "title": "Capitol riot dilemma: Which rioters should stay behind bars before trial?",
        "body_text": "Not all the Capitol rioters are riotous enough to stay in jail. But the question of which ones are has become one of the thorniest issues for courts to decide, more than two weeks after a pro-Donald Trump mob attacked the US Capitol.\n Four times so far, judges across the country have disagreed with the Justice Department's attempt to keep locked up alleged rioters who breached the Capitol on January 6. The latest ruling came Friday night in Tennessee, where a judge decided to release a man who's become known for the zip-tie-like restraints he carried and the black helmet and body armor he wore into the Senate chamber that day.\n At least three other alleged rioters whom judges said should be released still remain in custody, and will be brought to Washington, DC, according to court records.\n The surprise recent decisions from the judges in Iowa, Arkansas, New Jersey and Tennessee rejecting the Justice Department's requests highlight how prosecutors are running up against a set of laws meant to protect Americans' rights amid a truly unique crime.\n Prosecutors must show a defendant is a flight risk or a danger to the public if they want to keep the person in jail pending trial. Or they can argue that the defendant is charged with a crime of violence -- a more complicated legal standard that in some situations requires heftier charges on the books.\n In Fayetteville, Arkansas, Magistrate Judge Erin Wiedemann decided to release Richard Barnett, who was photographed with his feet on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and carried a stun gun in the crowd at the Capitol. \"It certainly turned into a very volatile situation on Capitol grounds that wasn't just created by Mr. Barnett, but many, many other individuals in a sort of a mob mentality,\" Wiedemann said during Barnett's detention hearing. She ruled for releasing Barnett, putting him on 24-hour-a-day lockdown at home and ordering him to avoid all contact with others in the riot.\n In Trenton, New Jersey, Magistrate Judge Tonianne Bongiovanni said an Army reservist with a secret-level security clearance, whom prosecutors say holds White supremacist beliefs, could be released. \"In order to protect the community from any future outbursts, if you will, or plots, I'm going to require the computer monitoring and access to his phone devices, as well,\" Bongiovanni decided on Tuesday for defendant Timothy Hale-Cusanelli.\n And in Des Moines, Iowa, Magistrate Judge Celeste Bremer said defendant Douglas Jensen -- who was seen wearing a QAnon shirt, chased a Capitol Police officer up the stairs toward the Senate chamber and believed he was supporting a push for Trump to declare an insurrection against Congress -- didn't do enough to merit him staying in jail. \"Defendant's involvement in the riot and invasion of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, is undisputed. However, the issue before the Court is whether any conditions of release would reasonably ensure the safety of the community and Defendant's appearance, as required,\" Bremer wrote. He should stay under house arrest and be blocked from using the internet, including on cell phones, the judge decided.\n Federal district judges in DC are now taking a second look at whether the three men should remain detained until their trials. The DC-based judges, who function like appeals courts in this situation, haven't yet ruled on Jensen, Hale-Cusanelli or Barnett.\n While the riot of January 6 resulted in five deaths, including the shooting of a woman inside the Capitol and the death of a Capitol police officer, some defendants didn't clearly commit violence against others. They may have smashed windows, or are charged with obstructing the certification of the Electoral College vote, according to the vast collection of charges.\n Some of the defendants may have wanted to hurt lawmakers or could have, prosecutors argued. Others who've lived lawfully for years now subscribe to the Trump-era belief of rejecting government authority.\n Taken together, it's an unusual mob situation where prosecutors only have so many legal tools, and defendants' liberties are protected under the law.\n At times, defense attorneys have tried to make the argument that no one defendant was responsible, because an entire crowd was breaching the Capitol.\n \"A crowd was yelling treason. That doesn't mean Mr. Munchel was yelling treason,\" a lawyer for Eric Munchel, who allegedly picked up the white plastic restraints inside the Capitol and is a gun enthusiast and Trump supporter, argued in court in Tennessee. Munchel -- who became one of the most intimidating viral figures from the siege -- shouldn't stay in detention, a federal magistrate judge in Nashville agreed Friday night.\n The judge, Jeffrey Frensley, considered the Justice Department's request to keep Munchel in jail for almost five hours on Friday, calling his actions \"shocking conduct.\" But,  the judge pressed prosecutors, is that enough to keep him detained? Would Munchel have done what he did if there wasn't a crowd on January 6? \"Are you aware of any rallies in the future where that conduct will happen?\" the judge asked.\n The prosecutor couldn't answer.\n Frensley, after reaching his decision, noted Munchel had minimal criminal history and would likely be willing to face his charges and be respectful of law enforcement. \"What happened at the Capitol is difficult to watch,\" Frensley added. \"Mobs are dangerous. They're inherently dangerous.\" But the judge said he didn't believe Munchel went to the Trump rally in Washington with the intention of harming lawmakers.\n The situation is further complicated because the cases against Capitol riot defendants are still in their earliest stages.\n \"The problem for the government is they don't want to get ahead of themselves, and charge someone with sedition if they don't have the evidence,\" said Jonathan Jeffress, a defense lawyer with the firm KaiserDillon in Washington, DC, who previously worked as a federal public defender. \"They're keeping charges fairly low, but if you keep charges low, you might not be taken seriously on your detention request.\"\n So far, the Justice Department has charged more than 125 defendants related to the Capitol riots. The charges have largely functioned as placeholders -- the types of complaints that allow authorities to make arrests, search homes and pursue broader investigations that could go before a federal grand jury in the coming days. Many of the cases stick to bare bones allegations, based on livestreamed video or social media posts, and accuse rioters of disorderly conduct and entering restricted property. Some of the rioters have turned themselves in to police and already admitted their alleged crimes.\n But none of the cases yet have formally become guilty pleas. For defendants who want to fight their charges, grand juries sitting in DC have been slow to churn out more robust indictments at the same rate as prosecutors are opening cases.\n The sheer numbers -- so many cases, dozens of defendants, few judges in Washington, so many leads for investigators to pursue -- has created a bottleneck. As the investigations continue, the defendants still need to go before judges quickly to see if they will stay in jail.\n Prosecutors have agreed to let many of the rioters be released, with orders to stay away from DC. Some, like Olympic swimmer Klete Keller, were even allowed to turn themselves in after being charged.\n A few defendants have been put under slightly stricter terms -- home detention or GPS monitoring, for instance -- or are being held in jail a bit longer until prosecutors or the court learns more.\n A handful of defendants facing the most serious charges will stay in jail, judges have decided, deeming them flight risks or threats to public safety.\n Magistrate judges in Washington have held marathon hearings nearly every day this week to process the new defendants.\n \"If I had a more concerning threats case come before me, I don't remember it,\" Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey of the DC District Court said about one of the defendants, Cleveland Meredith Jr., who is alleged to have threatened to shoot Pelosi and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and brought a trailer of ammo and an assault rifle to the city.\n Meredith's detention proceedings spanned two days, after a public defender in Washington argued his threats alone were not enough of a serious crime to keep him in jail. He hadn't actually committed the violence, in short.\n Harvey decided to keep Meredith detained.\n Other defendants' lawyers have tried similar arguments to have their clients released.\n Typically, prosecutors can make the case more easily to detain defendants with past criminal records. But in the situation of the Capitol violence, many of the defendants had no such rap sheets.\n \"Seventy percent of Republicans believe that the election was fraudulent,\" a temporarily appointed defense lawyer argued in rural Virginia earlier this week, at the detention hearing for Thomas Caldwell, who's accused of leading a group of right-wing militants in their plans to overrun the Capitol. The lawyer, Lisa Lorish, argued Caldwell's opposition to Biden's election wasn't out of the ordinary among the general public -- and noted Caldwell was a retired Navy veteran. Destruction of government property, which he's also accused of, wasn't a violent crime, she added.\n But the judge disagreed, deciding that Caldwell might obstruct justice and could endanger the community.\n Caldwell has not yet been indicted. Prosecutors said he could face more serious charges.\n \"The conduct and statements of Mr. Caldwell and the others, it really is just pure lawlessness,\" Magistrate Judge Joel Hoppe of the federal court in Harrisonburg, Virginia, said on Tuesday. He decided to keep Caldwell in jail as he is moved to Washington, DC, to face more proceedings.\n Lindsay Benson and Marshall Cohen contributed to this story.",

Unlike albinism, leucism does not cause a lack of pigmentation in the eyes.\n The baby was born at the animal park in Harpursville five months ago but was removed by keepers from his mother's pouch for the first time on January 15.\n Like other baby kangaroos born the size of a human thumbnail, Cosmo was left to grow in his mother's pouch for months before being removed to receive his first full medical exam.\n \"Right off the bat when we saw he was white it was remarkable, but when we got a closer look and saw the black eyes, our jaws dropped to the floor. In that moment we knew we had something we'd never seen in our entire careers,\" park owner Jordan Patch told CNN.\n \"This is the only kangaroo of its kind in existence in North America at this moment, so that's how rare this is.\"\n The little joey was born to Boomer, a male red kangaroo who has lived at the park for eight years, and Rosie, who joined the park in 2020.\n \"Whatever the underlying genetics are between the two of them is what produced this very unique mutation,\" Patch said. \"Now we're looking long term to understand and study what that gene is, are both parents recessive trait holders, is this just a fluke?\"\n While Cosmo's genetic makeup should not affect his health, the only danger is that he does not have the ability to camouflage, so he would most likely never survive in the wild.\n \"Animal Adventure is no stranger to having awesome happenings and experiences, and here we are today going into 2021 with some light at the end of the tunnel, and it's bright, it's white, and its name is Cosmo,\" Patch said.",

        "body_text": "Heiko Maas is the German foreign minister. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nThis year, Germany celebrates a special anniversary: Ancient documents have found that people of Jewish faith have been living in today's Germany since the year 321.\n This anniversary reminds us how deep our Jewish roots run, and of the great extent to which they shape who we are in Germany to this very day. What would our philosophy be without the thinking of Moses Mendelssohn or Hannah Arendt? What would the natural sciences be without Albert Einstein? How much poorer would our lives and our culture be without the music of Gustav Mahler, the poetry of Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler or the stories of Heinrich Heine or Franz Kafka?\n Yet the 1,700-year-old history of Judaism in Germany can unfortunately not be told without also speaking about persecution, genocide and hatred of Jews. Hence, we are humbled and grateful that, today, once again some 200,000 Jews are a part of German society.\n However, to this day, anti-Semitism has not disappeared. It just keeps shape-shifting. This is becoming evident in the wild conspiracy theories surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. Anyone who marches through the streets of Berlin alongside right-wing extremists bearing a sign that reads \"Impfen macht frei\" (\"vaccinations set you free,\" referencing the quote \"Arbeit macht frei,\" or \"work makes you free,\" on the gates of Auschwitz), or storms the US Capitol wearing a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt, is not a peaceful protester but an anti-Semite. He or she mocks the victims of National Socialism, or Nazism, plays down its horrific brutality and destroys civilized values that are fundamental to our coexistence and our democracy.\n All democrats have a duty to clearly call this out. As the current chair of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), Germany therefore wants to move forward the fight against such dangerous lies, the distortion of facts and the trivialization of the Holocaust, also at a global level. We have therefore initiated a Global Task Force Against Holocaust Distortion so that, together with our partners, we can defend these universal values. This week, leading international researchers have presented to us their recommendations for countering Holocaust distortion. These indicate there is an urgent need for action, and four main ones can help ensure that we tackle this problem efficiently.\n First, the current digital nature of anti-Semitism means that it knows no borders. That is why, now more than ever, we must combat it globally, in a coordinated way. It may not always be easy to draw a line between freedom of opinion and hate speech, between ignorance and the deliberate distortion of facts.\n So, as a first step, it is important for us and our global partners to develop a common understanding of what we consider as Holocaust distortion, and how to combat it. We are working on this together with our partners in the IHRA, the European Union, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). However, domestic authorities, too, must be part of the effort. A recent study shows how, already today, right-wing terrorists and conspiracy theorists are forging close networks online. Our security authorities must counter them by working in even closer coordination.\n Second, education is the best way to overcome prejudice and a superficial knowledge of history. During our presidency, we have ensured that the  IHRA Recommendations for Teaching and Learning about the Holocaust were disseminated to be widely used around the world. Already in 2019, Germany launched a European network focused on using education as a tool to combat antisemitic stereotypes. Yet the question of how to identify Holocaust distortion and what we can do about it must become a fixture of the curricula at our schools and universities globally, and of the material we use in our police and judicial training programs.\n Third, memorials, museums and educational institutions that deal with Holocaust-related issues require solid political and financial support. Last year, we made a multi-year funding pledge for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation and the World Holocaust Remembrance Center at Yad Vashem. Even during the trying times and budgetary constraints of this pandemic, Germany must and will live up to its special responsibility.\n Lastly, we must finally get a grip on anti-Semitism and hate-mongering on the internet. It is a good thing that companies such as Facebook are no longer denying that they hold great responsibility in this regard. However, while the lies of former President Donald Trump about alleged election fraud in the United States are clearly labeled as such by Twitter, lies about humanity's worst crime, the Holocaust, are all too often not called out.\n The key to doing so is closer cooperation between platform operators, researchers and civil society organizations, which are best placed to distinguish between facts and false claims. Much remains to be done in this regard -- as violent protests in front of the Reichstag in Berlin last summer, or on the steps of the US Capitol have taught us in recent weeks.\n What is absolutely essential, however, is that society must not stay silent when these attacks on truth, our democracies or our fellow citizens happen. What we across the world truly need is greater vigilance when facing such abominations, greater civic courage and greater solidarity.",

        "title": "Rotting fish, lost business and piles of red tape. The reality of Brexit hits Britain",
        "body_text": "Brexit might be done and dusted, but its specter will loom over Britain for a long time yet.\n For all the fanfare made when Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck a trade deal with Brussels on Christmas Eve, the inescapable reality of leaving the European Union's customs and regulatory territory has already started to bite. The fact that the deal was only agreed one week before it came into effect meant that dangerous disruption to countless businesses that relied on seamless supply chains was inevitable.\n Despite Johnson's repeated claims that Brexit is a great opportunity for British exporters and would lead to some kind of revival for free trade, the reality is very different: freshly caught fish are reportedly being left to rot as exporters cannot get them to the European Union while logistics firms are skeptical that both importing and exporting is going to be viable for many businesses in the long term. Fallout from Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic is pushing the UK economy into a sharp contraction in the first quarter, according to data published Friday by IHS Markit, meaning a double-dip recession is now on the cards.\n While it should be a source of embarrassment for the PM that his deal has made life very difficult for many of the industries that he has championed post-Brexit, Johnson's public statements on the matter suggest he is oblivious to the reality that many are facing.\n When asked for comment on the immediate consequences of the trade barriers implemented as a result of the deal, a UK government spokesperson told CNN Business:\n \"From the outset we were clear that we would be leaving the customs union and single market which meant that there would be new processes after the end of the Transition Period. These were widely communicated through our public information campaign.\"\n The starkest example of what Brexit is doing to British business comes from Scotland's fishing industry. Despite the government's claims during Brexit negotiations that the fishing industry was very near the top of its priority list, there is a real fear that the entire industry could collapse in a matter of weeks.\n \"We had an entirely new system for exporters to get their heads around that hadn't been tested prior to use. The result, somewhat inevitably, was that it started going wrong straight away,\" says James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink.\n \"This isn't as simple as an IT glitch that needs fixing. In a matter of days, we went from being able to send fresh food to Madrid with a single cover sheet of paperwork. Now there are roughly 26 steps for each transaction.\"\n The real-world impact of this means that some exporters have had the European market cut off overnight. Almost every day, pictures circulate on social media of virtually empty fish markets and boats tied up. Withers has heard stories of Scottish boats sailing 48 hours to process catches in Denmark, just to get their stock into the single market. In an industry where profit margins are often thin, every hour spent working around red tape is critical to both the freshness of the product and the productivity of the business.\n When pushed on the matter, Johnson has said that he thinks these are merely teething issues and not the fault of his deal or the barriers it's created. His spokesman explains that the government is providing \u00a323 million ($31.4 million) for the industry to ease the process.\n When asked specifically about the fishing industry earlier this week, Johnson once again denied that the problems facing exporters had anything to do with his deal, but instead were due to restaurants being shut because of the pandemic.\n However, Withers believes that money \"will run out quickly\" and without coming to some new sort of arrangement with the European Union, \"this sort of exporting might not be sustainable\" and will \"almost certainly lead to the very people the [Prime Minister] said he was fighting for losing their jobs.\"\n The scenes in Scotland might not be as dramatic as the food shortages and lines of backlogged trucks that many predicted post-Brexit, but the damage is already showing up in economic data. Brexit issues are exacerbating a slowdown caused by pandemic restrictions, IHS Markit said on Friday, and lengthening suppliers' delivery times. While 33% of manufacturers reporting a drop in exports linked the decline directly to the pandemic, some 60% linked the drop to Brexit, according to IHS.\n ForagePlus, a horse nutrition business based in Wales, had dozens of parcels bound for Europe returned this week due to glitches in its shipping company's new systems for processing customs information. \"It's just a shambles basically,\" ForagePlus founder Sarah Braithwaite told CNN Business, adding that it had been nearly a month since the company was able to ship anything into Europe due to the pandemic and Brexit.\n There is real concern among trucking companies and logistics firms that things are going to get much worse in the coming months.\n Multiple sources within the affected sectors told CNN Business that British consumers won't feel much disruption yet, as January is a typically quiet month at ports and the United Kingdom did stockpile goods to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit. But that could change as trade volumes increase over the coming months, putting border systems under additional pressure.\n This could result in a gradual reduction in the variety of fresh produce available to British shoppers. According to a spokesperson for Logistics UK, \"in the short term, while supply chains sort themselves out, it may be that we return to a more seasonal approach to shopping or have a more limited range to choose from.\" This could mean that after decades of fresh fruit and vegetables at all times of the year, Brits might have to start seeing strawberries as summer treat, for example.\n The region where food shortages could fast become a real issue is Northern Ireland, where images of empty supermarket shelves have circulated on social media. Due to the unique position of Northern Ireland, it has split with the rest of the United Kingdom and remained inside the EU single market, making it a lot harder to import food from Great Britain. Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, said that images showing empty shelves in Northern Irish supermarkets were \"clearly a Brexit issue\" and \"part of the reality\" of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.\n Trade experts are concerned about the gradual decline in EU-UK trade. \"The slow decline is in some ways more dangerous than sudden food shortages,\" says David Henig, UK director at the European Centre For International Political Economy. \"I am particularly concerned about exporters being unable to fulfill orders and losing customers or just giving up completely. The long-term message that sends could be very damaging for inward investment,\" he adds.\n There are legitimate questions as to why things have been so bad, despite the United Kingdom having years to prepare for the cliff edge. \"We've known about the risks of not being prepared for five years,\" says Anna Jerzewska, founder of Trade and Borders, which assists exporters and importers across Europe.\n Jerzewska says that her clients are reporting numerous complaints, but most worryingly a failure of support from the UK government to resolve their issues. \"Getting an answer to a technical question could take 48 hours, which is obviously a problem for fresh produce. People in the call centers can only really point to guidance, but the guidance isn't currently fit for purpose.\"\n And despite everyone involved working hard to resolve the early issues, Jerzewska fears this won't be enough to save struggling British exporters. \"At the moment it's shock, but the underlying costs are not going away. And for traders who work at thin profit margins, an extra couple of percentage points could be the end.\"\n Many of Johnson's Conservative lawmakers are struggling with how to reply to their constituents. \"The party gave us lines to read out when the deal came through presenting it as a huge success, but as time goes on, it's clear there's quite a lot of nasty surprises in Pandora's box,\" says one Conservative member of parliament who is not permitted to speak on-the-record about government policy outside of their brief.\n Others say that small local businesses are up in arms at finding out that if they want to visit Europe to sell their goods, they might need a work permit from foreign governments or paperwork allowing them to move goods into the European Union.\n There isn't much optimism that things will improve in the near future among moderate Conservatives. Many are extremely worried that the gradual decline caused by Brexit will ultimately lead to Europe trying to lure Britain's golden goose to the continent: The City of London, which hosts many of the world's biggest banks.\n \"Once the fog of Covid lifts, financial and professional services firms looking to expand globally will see London and realize that we have given up quite a lot of our competitive advantage,\" says the Conservative member of parliament.\n The trade deal Johnson signed bizarrely didn't address either of these, despite them making up a huge part of the UK economy. Banks and traders in London are now hoping to be granted \"equivalence\" by the European Union, a designation that would allow them to continue serving EU clients with limited disruption.\n \"If no deal is reached on equivalence for financial services or data, that could kickstart a squeeze on the city from EU regulators and leave businesses wondering what the benefit of setting up in London is if you want to serve the European market,\" says Henig.\n The European Union and United Kingdom are supposed to reach an agreement in March on financial services, but the mood music from both London and Brussels right now suggests that the United Kingdom is unlikely to be pulled back into the EU regulatory sphere any time soon.\n Those politicians will have to explain to voters why they encouraged their prime minister to pursue such a hard Brexit despite the warnings of its consequences. They have a couple of months before things get really bad to put pressure on Johnson to start engaging with the reality of Brexit a little more.\n The question that matters most to those struggling is how bad things must get before those who most vocally supported Brexit are willing to break ranks and admit the truth: that leaving the world's largest trading bloc has immediate consequences.",

        "body_text": "President Joe Biden spent his first week in office trying to convince the nation to see themselves not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in defeating the pandemic. Then on Friday night, the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump got a formal date on the calendar, complicating every bipartisan goal on the new President's agenda.\n After four exhausting years of Trump that left this country deeply divided and democracy hanging by a thread, the nation breathed easier when Trump decamped Wednesday to Mar-a-Lago, his slashing vitriol silenced by a permanent suspension on Twitter. Next month's trial will bring the outcast former President back to center stage, giving him yet another chance to claim that he is a victim in a never-ending partisan witch hunt and handing him a platform to rally his supporters at a time when he might have otherwise had none.\n Biden is caught in an almost impossible vise as the nation reengages in the most polarizing kind of proceeding that exists in Washington. He has insisted that Trump must be held accountable for the attempted insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, but he has been notably cool to the prospect of impeachment as he tries to unravel Trump's legacy with more than two dozen executive orders in his first three days in office, while simultaneously working the phones to build broader legislative consensus.\n The looming trial -- which has the potential to inflame partisan divisions just as quickly as Biden was trying to squelch them -- offers no visible upside to a President who was elected on his promise to bring the warring parties of Washington together and forge compromise in a Capitol that has been defined by strife.\n The hopes that Biden could bring a different tone to Washington -- which were so bright on Inauguration Day -- were complicated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that the House would deliver the impeachment article charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" to the Senate on Monday evening. Senators will be sworn in for the trial the next day, according to the calendar outlined by Schumer, with trial arguments slated to start on February 9.\n The delay in the trial's start will be helpful to Biden because only two of his Cabinet nominees have been approved by the Senate so far -- a much slower pace than his predecessors. Biden underscored that point Friday when asked whether he favored Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's timeline for a mid-February impeachment trial. \"The more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better,\" Biden replied at the end of a White House event about executive actions on the economy.\n Biden has been circumspect on whether he believes there is any point to holding a Senate impeachment trial for a President who has already left office, answering virtually every question by stating that he will leave the timing and mechanics of a trial up to Senate leaders.\n White House press secretary Jen Psaki crisply shut down questions about Biden's more substantive views on impeachment -- and whether Trump should be barred from holding federal office in the future -- by pointing out that the President ousted Trump from the White House through the electoral process.\n \"He ran against him because he thought he was unfit to serve, and he's no longer here because President Biden beat him,\" Psaki said during the White House news briefing Friday. \"We'll leave the steps -- the accountability steps -- to Congress to determine.\"\n The question of the futility of an impeachment trial at this point is even more salient now given that the Senate looks increasingly unlikely to convict Trump, according to reporting by CNN's Manu Raju, Ted Barrett and Jeremy Herb. Convicting Trump would require 17 Republican senators to vote with the 50 Democrats in the Senate, a tall order on any legislative matter, let alone one as fraught as this one.\n Though there is disagreement among rank-and-file Republicans about how Trump should be punished for his role in the riot -- with conviction dangling the possibility that Trump could be barred from holding federal office in the future \u2014 many Republicans are now also questioning whether it is constitutional to try a president who has already left office.\n The argument about constitutionality is serving as a useful dodge for GOP senators who are wary of Trump's punishing instincts -- allowing them to avoid alienating his base voters, while potentially getting them off the hook with more moderate constituents who were angered by Trump's role in the Capitol riot, seeded by the blizzard of lies he told about the November election results.\n \"I don't know what the vote will be, but I think the chance of two-thirds is nil,\" Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CNN.\n Through almost all of his other actions this week, Biden signaled that he was trying to move Americans beyond the Trump era, not just in policy but also in tone. Swearing in his new employees, Biden told them that if he heard them disrespecting or talking down to another colleague, he would fire them on the spot \u2014 underscoring that he believes everyone deserves to be treated with the dignity and decency that has been \"missing in a big way the past four years.\" Aside from that comment, when given the chance to take a shot at Trump, he has generally avoided it -- describing the letter the former President left him, for example, as \"generous.\"\n Biden alienated some Republicans this week by seeking to undo some of Trump's most controversial policies through executive actions -- halting construction of the wall at the US-Mexico border, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding Trump's ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries.\n But the new President also placed great emphasis on actions he was taking that could garner support from both parties: measures to speed up vaccine distribution like invoking the Defense Production Act to produce more supplies like needles or specialized syringes that could extract more vaccine from each vial; plans to accelerate the reopening of schools; an extension of moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures; and policies aimed at curbing food insecurity in the midst of the pandemic, which has been a concern for both Democrats and Republicans.\n Pointing to the road ahead as he outlined some of the economy-focused executive actions that he was taking on Friday, Biden underscored that there were constraints on what he could do alone with the stroke of his pen -- and made another urgent plea to members of Congress to come to the negotiating table on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.\n With the US Senate divided 50-50, Schumer and McConnell are still wrangling over a power-sharing agreement in the Senate that will determine the number of seats each party controls the chamber's committees. Talks have stalled over McConnell's demand that Schumer preserve the filibuster.\n While Biden is already facing significant resistance among Republicans about the cost of the package, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese warned that Americans may tumble into an even deeper medical crisis and \"economic hole\" without it.\n Biden noted that another 900,000 Americans have joined the ranks of the unemployed, according to economic data this week, while many families are still being forced to drive up to food banks just to feed their children. In an argument for his legislative package attuned to Republican concerns, he said there is a \"growing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy,\" and that it is \"a smart fiscal investment\" that will help America retain its competitive edge around the world. (He noted at one point that Trump's former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has spoken in favor of the proposal that he has outlined).\n \"This almost doesn't have a partisan piece to it,\" Biden said plaintively.\n \"I don't believe the people of this country just want to stand by and watch their friends and their neighbors, coworkers, fellow Americans go hungry, lose their homes, or lose their sense of dignity and hope and respect,\" he said Friday. \"I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs; I believe Americans are going hungry and losing their jobs.\"\n \"We have the tools to fix it.\"\n But Biden still has a great deal of persuading to do as he tries to drum up the political will for another bipartisan piece of legislation using those tools. As he reaches out, there are signs that the two camps are retreating back to their familiar corners -- with impeachment standing as the biggest obstacle in the new President's way.",

        "title": "Biden administration faces mounting pressure to address SolarWinds breach ",
        "body_text": "Despite announcing a thorough intelligence review of Russian misconduct, President Joe Biden's administration faces mounting pressure to respond to one of the worst data breaches ever to hit the US government.\n The computer intrusion campaign that has been linked to Russia has hit multiple federal agencies and the private sector, raising concerns about the security of corporate secrets, government emails and other sensitive data. The Trump administration formally pointed the finger at Russia earlier this month after revelations surfaced in December that hackers had put malicious code into a tool published by SolarWinds, a software vendor used by countless government agencies and Fortune 500 businesses.\n As Biden officials assume responsibility for investigating the hack campaign, members of Congress, former federal officials and new evidence unearthed by Microsoft this week have added renewed urgency to the search for answers.\n \"This SolarWinds massive breach concerns all of us, and frankly, is not that surprising, given what we have been finding, which is that the federal government is not well prepared to deal with these kinds of breaches,\" Sen. Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said at a hearing this week.\n In a letter Friday to congressional leaders, Kevin McAleenan, the former acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said it is imperative that Biden's nominee to lead the department, Alejandro Mayorkas, be swiftly confirmed. The SolarWinds incident, McAleenan wrote, underscores \"the growing need for a renewed focus on our nation's cybersecurity, and in particular the security of our supply chain. In the wake of the SolarWinds breach, DHS needs dedicated and confirmed leadership to work in concert with other government agencies to address this issue immediately \u2014 and to ensure we are prepared for potential future attempts.\"\n The day after Biden was sworn in, a congressional commission on cybersecurity sent a 15-point list of priorities and policy recommendations to the White House, including steps to prevent another government breach.\n And Microsoft's report on Wednesday further highlighted the sophistication of the attackers, estimating that they may have spent an entire month selecting their targets and developing custom code designed to stealthily compromise each victim. SolarWinds was just one mechanism that the adversary used to gain access to networks, an official from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said to CNN, emphasizing that other techniques were used to gain access to networks and compromise information as part of long term \"intelligence gathering effort.\"\n \"There is a concern that things could be worse,\" the former official told CNN.\n Meanwhile, there are indications that officials have only scratched the surface of the scope and scale, a source familiar with the probe said.\n Speaking to reporters Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration would \"reserve the right to respond at a time and manner of our choosing to any cyberattack,\" but that staffers were only \"just getting onto their computers.\" She declined to answer a question about whether Biden intended to raise the spying issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n The computer break-ins will be one focus of a forthcoming presidential briefing by the intelligence community, Psaki added.\n When former President Donald Trump finally weighed in on the massive cyberattack in a pair of tweets in December, instead of condemning the attack -- or Russia -- he downplayed it, criticized the media and baselessly claimed it could have affected US voting machines.\n Biden appears willing to grapple with the espionage effort head-on.\n \"President Biden seems to understand the urgency of this crisis in a way that President Trump did not,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"And in his first days, (he) is moving with fitting speed to investigate it, so that we can take steps to remediate its effects, respond appropriately to Russia, and best determine how to deter and prevent attempts of this kind in the future.\"\n But while there is little disagreement among US officials that the intrusion was severe, opinions about a potential response, and what that would look like, vary.\n A US official told CNN that the evidence currently suggests the hack still qualifies as a highly sophisticated foreign intelligence operation and falls short of an act of cyber warfare -- a nuanced distinction that will factor into any discussions about reasonable response options.\n But that said, there will almost certainly be a cost imposed for this activity, the official added, noting there is a price to be paid for getting caught, even if the attack technically falls within the lines of foreign espionage.\n \"In all likelihood,\" the attack was cyber espionage, former Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf told CNN. At the time he left office earlier this month -- amid an abrupt resignation -- the attackers had not taken any action because of their access into these networks, he said.\n Gen. Keith Alexander, the former director of the National Security Agency, told CNN that Biden has a range of policy options available to him.\n \"There are ways you can respond by indicting individuals and by diplomatic and economic measures, which they should do,\" Alexander said, \"but any response in cyber in the physical space would probably develop into a bigger attack on us, and we're not prepared to defend against that. The nation is not ready for a cyber engagement of that kind.\"\n Alexander added that Congress must pass legislation to enable the public and private sectors to share threat information more easily, and to provide legal immunity to companies that share that data.\n Biden's response could also be complicated by a shortage of senior personnel. Biden's first confirmed Cabinet pick -- Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence -- acknowledged earlier this week she had not yet received a classified briefing on the hack, underscoring concerns that she and other top Biden officials may already be behind the eight ball due to a difficult transition process.\n Though she was sworn in Thursday and indicated that the hack was a top priority, other top intelligence and homeland security positions remain vacant.\n \"I've never seen this level of vacancy. It's mind boggling, really challenges continuity,\" said a DHS official who pointed to CISA as an example of the Trump administration's leadership disarray. \"We will have challenges in replacing some talent.\"\n Earlier this week, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley blocked quick consideration of Biden's Homeland Security nominee, leaving the third-largest federal department without confirmed leadership. CISA has been led by career official Brandon Wales since Trump fired Chris Krebs shortly after the election.\n Rob Silvers, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings, is expected to be tapped to lead CISA in the Biden administration, according to a source familiar with the situation. He served as assistant secretary for cyber policy at DHS during the Obama administration, as well as in other senior roles at the department. Silvers did not respond to a request for comment.\n \"The biggest problem is that you don't have a confirmed secretary,\" the former senior DHS official told CNN. \"That really sets the tone and the trajectory of the ability to start getting things done.\"\n During his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, Mayorkas said he was intensely studying the SolarWinds attack as a private citizen. If confirmed, he promised to conduct a thorough review of two CISA cybersecurity programs -- Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) and EINSTEIN -- to understand if they are sufficient to stop a threat such as SolarWinds, and if not, to explore additional defenses for the federal government.\n Wales said CISA \"actively engaged with the transition team,\" including providing 14 briefings focused on the ongoing cyber incident. \"We're committed to seamlessly integrating new members of the Biden Administration into the Agency, while continuing aggressive efforts to understand and respond to this complex cyber campaign,\" he said in a statement to CNN Friday.\n Given the length of time that the adversary has had access to some networks, remediation -- both short term and long term rebuilding -- will be a protracted process, a CISA official told CNN.\n CISA already provided ideas to the Biden team to help evolve federal cybersecurity and overcome the challenges identified by the latest incident. Suggestions, the official said, include: funding for CISA to hunt for adversary activity on federal networks; the deployment of new sensors inside federal agencies to detect anomalous activity; and improvements to visibility of the cloud environment, like Office 365.\n Officials are also considering creating a civilian program akin to the Pentagon model that helps ensure third party partners are meeting cybersecurity standards, but that would be a longer term endeavor, the official said.",

        "title": "Larry King was the everyman's interviewer",
        "body_text": "Larry King often came across as the guy who sat next to somebody on an airplane and started up a conversation by asking: \"So what do you do?\"\n Except sometimes that person was Vladimir Putin, or Marlon Brando. And they wouldn't get annoyed.\n That was King's gift \u2014 he didn't grill people, he chatted them up. He was someone who actually wanted to know what hooked some British actor on Shakespeare or some Indiana farmer on believing in UFO's.\n King was a throwback, a fish out of water from the start of his career at CNN, because even as he put cable television news on the map he was, down to his shoes, a broadcaster. He looked for wide appeal and he had wide appeal. He didn't parade his views, because that's not what broadcasters looking for the widest reach could ever do.\n He also had a broadcaster's voice \u2014 deep, resonant, memorable. King, who gained fame first as a radio host in Miami, joked all his life about having a face made for radio. But even with an accent engraved with the sounds of Brooklyn's streets, he had the booming voice, tailor-made for radio stardom. It made people turn their heads and listen: \"Hello, Ashtabula, you're on the air!\"\n His life turned out to be colorful, too, full of celebrity stories, news-making moments, health scares and numerous wives \u2014 eight marriages in all, including one wife he married twice. But always he retained his ability to relate, and managed to connect with both high-brow (Nelson Mandela) and low (Kato Kaelin.)\n His method was simple: no method. Don't overthink the job, don't over-prepare for the interview. Keep the questions short. King always said things like, \"If I'm talking, I'm not learning.\" So he stressed simple, direct questions: \"What made you get into public life?\" \"Do you like pets?\" He let his guests dominate his airtime.\n Contrast that with interviews on most cable news shows today: Hosts who often ask convoluted, digressive, minutia-filled questions that leave guests wondering, \"When is he/she going to get to the question here?\" King did not belabor; he rarely seemed even to labor.\n He was often satirized, especially on the late-night shows, for his seemingly bland style, and the \"what's your favorite ice cream\" level of some of his questions. And, of course, for his openly confessed lack of interest in reading any of the books that authors came on his show to plug. That didn't matter \u2014 millions of books were sold off of Larry King interviews.\n Laziness or genius? Whatever it was, it worked. King said he was playing the role of the viewer who knew nothing about the book, allowing the author to prove it was worth reading. Authors rarely turned down the chance to talk to Larry King. Neither was just about anyone else. King's other technique was providing comfort instead of confrontation. Guests at every level, including presidents \u2014 King talked to every one starting with Nixon \u2014 and global heads of state sat down with him knowing they would not be overly pressed, never really put on the defensive.\n That didn't make the interviews uninteresting (well, sometimes it did.) Mostly it made them diverting rather than divisive. Again, it was a shrewd approach. Guests who are comfortable come back. They also tell their associates: \"That's a show you should do.\"\n Timing is everything, and it certainly was a factor in King's success. He emerged at CNN when cable news was not yet a shoutfest or an ideological armed camp. The competition wasn't an outraged rant on Fox News. It was the latest hit comedy on Must-See TV: \"Frasier,\" \"Cheers,\" or \"Seinfeld.\" If the entertainment shows in prime time were less popular, or there was a repeat that night, a viewer might prefer a light-hearted conversation with Miss Piggy \u2014 or something meatier with Ross Perot.\n In that era, King didn't have to chase \"breaking news\" every night, but if the story had the right legs, he was all over it. Never more than during the O.J. Simpson saga, from the infamous 1994 car chase to chaotic trial the following year. The nightly coverage on King's CNN show presaged the saturation news coverage of cable news shows to come. All O.J., all the time.\n King had panels packed with characters from the Simpson menagerie. I had my own encounter when I got a surprise telephone interview from Simpson a day after his acquittal. As soon as the first edition of The New York Times \u2014 with my story at the top \u2014 hit the street that night at about 9 p.m. in the East, Larry's producer was on my phone, asking if I had really talked to O.J.\n The word \"yes\" was barely out of my mouth when she said, \"You're on the air!\" And there I was, talking to Larry King, my words echoing through the television. That show's sweep was so vast the next day I had calls from Ireland to Australia to talk about my \"scoop.\"\n I was on with Larry a few other times. It was as billed: Relaxed, direct, a couple of guys from Brooklyn who might as well have been sitting together at the soda fountain sipping egg creams. Did that ever qualify as good television?\n Well, Larry King was on CNN for 25 years, most of them as the biggest show on cable. The guy knew what he was doing.",

        "body_text": "The Senate will in the coming weeks begin an impeachment trial to decide whether to convict former President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol, but Democrats will have time before it gets underway to confirm more Cabinet nominees to help the Biden administration get up and running.\n The House will send the article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday. That would typically trigger a process for a trial to start the next day, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Friday evening that instead the trial will begin the week of February 8.\n \"Once the briefs are drafted, presentation by the parties will commence the week of February the 8th,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding, \"The January 6th insurrection at the Capitol incited by Donald J. Trump was a day none of us will ever forget.\"\n There were incentives on both sides to push back the start of the trial. Biden suggested earlier in the day on Friday that it could be helpful to his administration to have more time prior to the start of a trial. \"The more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better,\" he said.\n McConnell, meanwhile, has proposed that the Senate give Trump's legal team two weeks to prepare for a trial once the Senate receives the article and delay its start until mid-February.\n A later start date will mean more time for Democrats to confirm Cabinet officials and will allow more time for preparations for the former President's legal defense.\n A number of Republicans have been sharply critical about the proceedings -- and have already made clear that they see virtually no chance that at least 17 Republicans would join with 50 Democrats to convict Trump and also bar him from ever running from office again.\n \"I don't know what the vote will be but I think the chance of two-thirds is nil,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of his party's leadership who called the Democratic push to begin the trial \"vindictive.\"\n The GOP arguments are now coming into sharper focus, claiming the proceedings are unconstitutional to try a former President and contending that the trial is moving on too short of a time frame to give due process to Trump, claims that Democrats resoundingly reject.\n Those arguments, Republicans believe, will allow them a way out of convicting Trump without endorsing his conduct in the run up to the deadly mob that ransacked the Capitol on January 6. McConnell is likely to land in the same spot as much of his conference, GOP senators believe, although the Republican leader has said he would listen to the arguments first before deciding how to vote.\n It's not yet clear exactly what defense will be presented on the former President's behalf, but it appears Trump now has at least one lawyer for the trial.\n Trump's campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, confirmed on Twitter on Thursday that South Carolina lawyer Butch Bowers will represent Trump at his impeachment trial. \"Excited to announce that Columbia, SC-based Butch Bowers has joined President Trump's legal team. Butch is well respected by both Republicans and Democrats and will do an excellent job defending President Trump,\" Miller tweeted.\n Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and ally of the former President, told reporters that he would urge Trump's legal team to \"focus on the unconstitutional argument\" that a former president cannot be convicted by the Senate.\n \"They didn't present any evidence in the House, so I don't know if you can present evidence in the Senate that you didn't present -- I guess you could -- but we'll make our own decisions about did the President go too far, was this incitement under the law, what's the right outcome there? So it should be a quick trial really, quite frankly,\" Graham said.\n Given the limited language in the Constitution on impeachment, legal experts disagree about whether the Senate can convict a former president. However, with Democrats holding slim control of the Senate, there's no reason to think the trial won't go forward.\n But Democrats have pointed to legal scholars on both ends of the political spectrum who say a trial is constitutional. Legal analysts say there's precedent for a Senate impeachment trial of a former official, as the Senate tried Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 after he resigned just before the House voted to impeach him.\n A January 15 Congressional Research Service report notes that while the Constitution \"does not directly address\" the issue, most scholars have concluded that Congress does have the authority to impeach and convict a former President.\n CNN's Manu Raju, Jeremy Herb, Ted Barrett, Nikki Carvajal, Holmes Lybrand and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Susannah Hills is a pediatric airway surgeon at New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center. She also serves as assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nLast week, a Covid-19 patient of mine told me he is finally going home after four months in the hospital. His tracheostomy tube has been taken out and he's breathing on his own. He's finally able to walk again, with some help. It's a new beginning for him and as he wished me a happy New Year, I felt hopeful for the first time in a long time.\n The Covid-19 statistics in our country have been truly devastating. We surpassed 24 million cases and we are closing in on nearly 500,000 American lives lost to the pandemic. Even here in New York City, after the overwhelming sickness and death we experienced in the spring, hospitals are again nearing capacity, staff are being redeployed to care for Covid patients, and military volunteers are being sent to provide support. It feels like we started 2021 by taking a huge step backward in this pandemic.\n But a new administration came into office on Wednesday, and that's a reason for hope. The Biden administration is already demonstrating a renewed commitment to science-based public health strategies. Last week, Biden announced a new team of scientific advisers and created a Cabinet position for the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n The incoming director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has publicly committed to leading with science and restoring public trust in the agency. This marks a significant shift from the Trump era, when the White House repeatedly interfered with the CDC's guidance and data, heavily editing official health recommendations, blocking publication of guidance for reopening restaurants and other public places, and downplaying the risks of reopening schools.\n After health care workers spent the last year fighting simultaneous battles against Covid-19 and misinformation about the virus \u2014 which oftentimes originated from Trump and other elected officials \u2014 the Biden administration's support of science-based public health messaging feels like a huge burden lifted from our shoulders.\n It is true that the vaccine rollout has been fraught with problems. Federal officials projected 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of 2020, but actual numbers reported by the CDC fell far short of this goal with only 2.8 million people receiving a vaccine by the new year. While vaccinations have been ramping up, with the US averaging roughly 1 million doses a day in the last week, it would still take until spring 2022 to vaccinate every adult in the US at this rate, according to a CNN analysis. And as of Friday, nearly 40 million vaccine doses had been distributed, but only about 48%, or 19 million doses, had been administered.\n Along with delays in administering the vaccine, there are concerns that supply is running out. Last week, after the Trump administration promised to release a stockpile of vaccines reserved for second doses, it became clear that such a reserve did not exist.\n Despite these setbacks, Biden's administration has vowed a substantial increase in federal support with a goal to administer 100 million shots in 100 days, and I am hopeful that this will happen. The administration has plans to use the Defense Production Act to further scale up production of the materials needed to administer the vaccines.\n For states that are struggling with the vaccine rollout, there is also promise of increased support. The President has stated plans to deploy the National Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency to help set up vaccination sites across the country. He has committed to ensuring that these federal resources are directed to Black, Latino and rural communities that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, and he has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and mobile units to serve areas that are most difficult to reach.\n Finally, I am hopeful that the new administration will also restore the global partnerships and goodwill which are so critical during this worldwide health crisis. Trump's decision to abandon the World Health Organization and his threats to pull funding would have had a negative impact on the global fight against diseases like polio, tuberculosis, HIV, malaria and measles, and placed Americans at a higher risk for global persistence of the pandemic. Biden has promised to rejoin the WHO and face this pandemic as part of the global community.\n These are still mostly plans and promises that the new administration has yet to follow through on. But I am hopeful. I am hopeful that we will stand together against this pandemic, and I am hopeful that we now have a federal government that will stand with us.",

        "title": "This town powered America for decades. What do we owe them?",
        "body_text": "John D. Sutter is a CNN contributor, National Geographic Explorer and MIT science journalism fellow. He is director of the forthcoming BASELINE documentary series, which is visiting four locations on the front lines of the climate crisis every five years until 2050. Visit the project's website. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nThis Wyoming coal town is a place of contradictions. At dawn, the land looks heavenly: Winds rattle the sagebrush; cotton-candy skies make a dusting of snow glow in pastel hues. Later in the afternoon, though, you look to the horizon and see the Earth hemorrhaging gray dust as trucks haul coal from pits the size of suburbs.\n Gillette is the hub of a region called the Powder River Basin, which produces roughly 40% of US coal. West Virginia's coal country gets more attention, but Wyoming produces more coal at this point. Gillette is the town that powers America -- at least it did for decades.\n But as the urgency of the climate crisis has become more apparent, markets have shifted toward cheaper and cleaner electricity sources -- wind, solar and natural gas. Residents here know that the Biden administration, which rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and promises a 100% clean electric grid by 2035, could help push Gillette out of existence.\n Moving away from coal is essential to fighting back against worsening droughts, storms and sea-level rise around the world. That fight will only get harder if America keeps burning coal.\n To some degree, Gillette understand this. It's a place that simultaneously calls itself the \"Energy Capital of the Nation\" while also planning for a future in which the fossil fuel industry may not exist.\n I drove here in January after Steve Gray, a 56-year-old resident who's been laid off from both the coal and oil industries in northeastern Wyoming, left CNN a voicemail after the 2020 presidential election. I've been exploring your questions about the climate crisis as part of an ongoing series for CNN Opinion, and Gray's message seemed to bring up some of the toughest questions concerning what must be a rapid transition away from fossil fuels.\n \"Everybody in this town is afraid that it is going to become a ghost town,\" he said.\n Implicitly, Gray seemed to be asking: What will happen to Gillette -- and other fossil fuel towns -- as the coal industry recedes and clean-energy goals are realized? And what difference could the Biden administration or Congress make for a dying town built on coal?\n Climate advocates tend to lump solutions to all of these issues under an umbrella term: \"just transition.\" Not like, \"just get on with this transition already.\" \"Just\" as in fair.\n Gray, the man who called CNN, doesn't see anything fair about it.\n \"People are getting left behind,\" he told me.\n He and others I met in Gillette want the rest of the country to realize that they've worked hard, for decades, to supply the United States with electricity. They didn't own the companies that got rich off the boom in coal and other fossil fuels -- companies that hid research showing the disastrous effects of climate change, or that funded disinformation campaigns.\n They were just working.\n Working in an industry created by federal policies that failed to price carbon pollution -- that encouraged the mining of coal on land owned by the US government.\n And now they're being asked to stop.\n Both by markets, which value cheaper energy sources.\n And, importantly, by climate advocates like myself, who understand, based on science that's been amassing for decades, that global warming poses an existential threat to humanity.\n What do we owe Gillette and its workers?\n There's an important irony hidden in the story of Gillette.\n The US government willed much of this place into existence.\n This nudge came in a few forms. One was federal support for domestic energy production in the early 1970s -- a time when overseas markets were seen as volatile and problematic.\n Another was environmental regulation.\n The Clean Air Act of 1970 and its 1990 amendments targeted, among other pollutants, sulfur dioxide, which is a component of smog and acid rain. Powder River Basin coal just so happens to be naturally lower in sulfur than coal found in Appalachia and elsewhere.\n Before 1970, there were a few coal mines and oil rigs in the Gillette area, Robert Henning, director of a local history museum, the Campbell County Rockpile Museum, told me. We were standing in front of a wall-sized image of 1920s Gillette, which had the look of a sepia-tone Western outpost -- a dusty landscape with wooden fences and magnificent rolling hills on the horizon. Gillette was founded in the late 1800s as a railroad town -- named for a surveyor. But after 1970 and the Clean Air Act, Henning told me, the then-localized mining industry exploded.\n In 1960, the population of Campbell County, which includes Gillette, was about 5,800.\n By 1970, it had more than doubled -- to nearly 13,000.\n During the boom, the town was so crowded and chaotic that some families lived in tents, said Jim Ford, a Gillette resident who advises local government agencies and non-profits on economic and energy issues. Ford told me that when he was a child, his elementary school adopted a two-shift schedule to accommodate all the students. One group started at 6:00 AM and went until noon. Then the other started, ending at 6:00 p.m.\n Steve Gray told me that his family was one of the ones that came to the region to work in the fossil fuel industry in the early 1970s. His dad worked in the oil fields, and so did Gray, at least for a time.\n That was when life was good. Work was free-flowing. Wages were high.\n The coal in the Powder River Basin sits near the surface and is mined with giant trucks carrying shovels so big you can fit a large family inside. The scale of the operation is difficult to comprehend. \"Our largest mine is roughly 90 square miles,\" said Shannon Anderson, staff attorney at the Powder River Basin Resource Council, an environmental group.\n These mines grew and grew.\n But any boomtown worker knows that kind of growth can't last forever.\n The year 2016 -- that was the worst of it, according to the mayor.\n That was when the \"economy just collapsed.\"\n \"The energy industries always have been boom-and-bust, but this was a big one,\" said Gillette Mayor Louise Carter-King, who keeps an image of her father, who also was mayor of Gillette, hanging behind her desk. Her roots in the community are deep, and her husband works in coal. From her office window, you can see one of two coal-fired power-plants puffing smoke into the sky. \"It was like a perfect storm because oil went down, coal went down, natural gas -- everything.\" The bust was caused primarily by lower natural gas and renewable energy prices, less demand from coal-fired power plants, which continue to close, and concerns about climate-change regulations, according to economists.\n Most of the coal mined near Gillette sits on public land, meaning that the state government collects royalty payments and other taxes on its production. Wyoming doesn't have a state income tax and its property and sales taxes are notoriously low. Many years, well over half of the state's tax revenue comes from the coal, oil and gas industries.\n After the bust, Carter-King said she knew Gillette would have rethink everything.\n Gray told me that his call to CNN was influenced by how things fell apart with the oil and coal industries shortly before and after 2016, the year US voters elected President Donald Trump -- who'd promised to bring back \"beautiful, clean coal.\" Nearly 90% of Campbell County residents voted for Trump again in 2020. But you won't find too many people in Gillette who believe Trump kept his promises to coal workers -- or that it was even possible to keep them.\n Wyoming coal production peaked in 2008 at 468 million short tons, according to the US Energy Information Administration. By 2016, it was 297 million tons, creeping down to 277 million in 2019, nearing the end of Trump's term. Last year's figures are not yet available, but the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on demand for energy is known to have contributed to widespread collapse in the energy industry.\n Gray says he was laid off from an oil field job in 2015, then subsequently from another job in oil and then one in coal last year. His wife left him shortly after the first layoff, he said.\n These days, Gray is working again, driving railroad workers to and from job sites -- part of a broader industry that supports the mines and fossil fuels. (Mayor Carter-King estimates most people's jobs in Gillette are linked to coal and other fossil fuel industries -- whether directly or indirectly). But Gray said that he's eaten through his savings.\n My \"bank accounts were drained -- lost my house, all the repossessions,\" he said.\n \"It was tough.\"\n He's living on the razor-thin margins of a bust economy.\n Here's an inconvenient truth: Towns like Gillette tend to fail.\n I asked economists, environmentalists and policy experts. None could provide a sunny case study -- the story of a town whose main industry didn't take the initiative to remake itself.\n \"There's not a sterling example,\" said Jake Higdon, a senior US climate policy analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund who has contributed to several reports on fossil fuel communities.\n Timber towns, auto towns, military town, mining towns -- the logical progression is toward \"ghost town\" status if the town isn't big enough, or industries aren't diverse enough.\n In even trying to rebuild, then, Gillette aims to do something unprecedented.\n That doesn't mean it's impossible. \"Maybe our chances of remaking our community in a generation -- so my kids have something to come back to -- are 10%,\" said Ford, the county consultant. \"But I know if we don't try, the chances are zero.\"\n On a recent snowy morning, I dropped by Lula Belle's Caf\u00e9 -- \"non-smoking as of 4/1/2020\" -- near the railyard in Gillette. It's a welcoming, chatty kind of place -- fruit pies on display behind the diner counter. I wanted to learn whether people here were in denial about coal's demise.\n \"Will the mines bounce back? No,\" said Doug Wood, a retired coal miner with a mustache that's twirls at the tips. \"The coal industry's kind of on its last leg.\"\n What's next then?\n \"I don't know if you're familiar with a TV show called 'The Jetsons?'\"\n I found that sentiment -- the coal part, not the Jetsons -- to be a common refrain in Gillette. Frankly, I was stunned by the degree to which the mayor, county development officials and people like Gray accept the unsettling facts of coal's decline.\n Phil Christopherson, CEO of Energy Capital Economic Development, a local non-profit that's funded by industry as well as city and county government, told me that he hopes children who are growing up in Gillette 50 years from now won't even know that this was a coal town.\n \"It's going to be a tough transition for this community,\" Christopherson said, \"and we're doing our best to prepare for that, so we still have a community here in five, 10 or 50 years.\"\n Yet, Gillette remains conflicted.\n While claiming it wants something new, local and state leadership continues to push coal products and technologies -- many of them expensive and unproven -- as the future.\n You'll hear some people calling Gillette \"Carbon Valley\" -- as in the Silicon Valley of coal. Coal research, they say, is what's next. As are new and supposedly cleaner uses for coal.\n One such project, called the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, or ITC, sits at the base of a coal-fired power plant -- painted blue and white as if it might blend into the sky.\n Jason Begger, the project's managing director, told me to think of the site as an \"RV park\" for researchers interested in capturing carbon-dioxide pollution from the power plant and doing something else with it -- potentially \"sequestering\" the gas deep in the rock underfoot.\n The idea is that if most of that CO2 pollution is captured and stored away somewhere, coal can keep burning, because it wouldn't contribute heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. It's reasonable to place some hope in the technology given the fact that carbon pollution needs to reach \"net zero\" by about 2050 in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. But carbon-capture and storage has proven to be costly and troublesome compared to alternatives.\n Begger told me the world needs to recalibrate its expectations.\n \"I have a 2-year-old daughter, and it's kind of like saying, 'Well, in 20 years, she'll be in the Olympics,\" he said. \"We [would] have to see if she can crawl and walk\" before signing her up for the Olympics.\n The state has been trying coal-spending technology for years, said Anderson, the environmentalist, with little to no results. She says she remains \"very skeptical\" of it -- as do I.\n Wyoming, meanwhile, also has some of the nation's greatest potential for wind energy, according to the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. PacifiCorp, the massive power company that is retiring some of its coal power plants in Wyoming, recently opened a large wind farm -- 520 megawatts, enough to power about 150,000 homes, according to Laine Anderson, the company's director of wind operations -- about an hour-and-a-half drive south of Gillette.\n Yet, Wyoming is a rare state that also taxes wind power -- rather than incentivizing its production as a much-needed clean energy source.\n \"Wyoming's leaders have done little to pivot our state's economy away from this volatile industry,\" the Casper Star-Tribune's editorial board wrote of coal in 2019.\n Perhaps Gillette is less a place of contradictions than one of surprises.\n Steve Gray lives in a small apartment complex near the highway. He answered the door on a recent blizzardy morning wearing a denim, pearl-snap shirt and fuzzy red slippers.\n After his layoffs from the oil and coal industries, he lost the house he shared with his ex-wife and son, who is now 25. For a while, he moved back in with his father. But now here's here, and when he welcomes you in you can feel the pride he takes in the place.\n On the living room walls are the portraits he's taken with his son, an oil field worker in a community south of Gillette, and Steve's grandchildren. In these photos, Steve wears his trademark cowboy hat, a broomstick mustache and a contented grandfather's grin.\n Nearby, you'll find the military honors -- a Purple Heart and Bronze Star -- bestowed on his elder relatives. Gray says he, too, served in the Navy and he values service to country.\n It's hard to talk here about a \"just transition\" for fossil fuel workers -- as if any transition for workers in dying US industries ever has been \"just.\" Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which aims to unite labor and environmental interests around the issue of a transition for dislocated fossil fuel workers, told me there's no justice in what happened to auto workers or timber workers -- or in what's happening to fossil fuel workers now.\n \"We are insisting that policy makers pay attention,\" Walsh said. \"It is not acceptable to leave any workers or any communities behind. We have an obligation to fulfill to workers and communities that have powered this country for generations and have often paid a very stiff price in terms of the health of their environments and their people and their workers.\"\n I agree with that sentiment. In seeking a transition away from fossil fuels -- which, again, is required by science if we want to continue living on a habitable planet -- we must learn from the mistakes of the past. That's the only way America can inch closer toward justice.\n Among history's lessons, according to Walsh: The investments must be bigger than before.\n Walsh advised the Obama administration on a grants program -- called the POWER+ Plan -- that aimed to help diversify the economies of coal towns in the Appalachian Mountains.\n That program and others failed to fully address the full needs of these communities, according to policy experts I interviewed. But there's a consensus emerging on what's needed now, including: job retraining, community college investments, wage replacement, healthcare extensions, pension extensions -- and jobs that help repair land scarred from decades of intensive mining. Advocates are, smartly, in my view, pushing the White House to create an office focused on this economic transition -- assisting fossil fuel communities and creating new jobs, according to advocates involved in these efforts.\n Colorado recently took a step in this direction by creating an Office of Just Transition. Wyoming and other fossil-fuel states should do the same. And, importantly, it would be wise of the Biden administration to make good on its campaign promises to fight climate change aggressively -- getting to \"net zero\" emissions as soon as possible -- while also creating jobs.\n Their focus should be on struggling towns like Gillette.\n Listening to them -- and helping -- could be both a political and moral victory.\n Wyoming is a state as red as they come.\n President Joe Biden and the Democrats who now control Congress could earn respect, if not votes, for telling coal country the truth -- that coal must be phased out of the national energy mix, but that workers will not be left behind. That means they should get job training, health care, wage replacement and, when possible, jobs in the new industries that are popping up to replace fossil fuels. This suite of policy solutions is complex, but they must be taken seriously, and the discussion must forward the voices of fossil-fuel workers. Workers need to know that climate advocates respect and support them before we can move forward.\n This requires risk.\n It requires trust.\n That's something Gray showed when he reached across cultural lines to call CNN.\n \"I figured, well, yeah, I'm going to call. I'll never get any return, but it'll make me feel better, you know?\" Gray said. \"I just -- I'm kind of glad that you guys did contact me.\"\n The Biden administration should answer the call, too.",

        "title": "Foods that can reduce stress",
        "body_text": "Stress levels may be high these days, but did you know that what we choose to eat can help to reduce stress, ultimately allowing us to take charge of our mental health?\n \"Instead of thinking of food as 'stress eating' or 'guilty pleasures,' we can think of using food to shape the lens in how we experience stress,\" said psychiatrist Dr. Drew Ramsey, an assistant clinical professor at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and author of the upcoming book \"Eat to Beat Depression and Anxiety.\"\n Taking control of stress with the foods we eat can help to counter inflammation throughout the body, as well as elevated levels of the hormone cortisol, which can otherwise lead to high blood sugar, increased appetite and weight gain, among other symptoms, according to Felicia Porrazza, a Philadelphia-based registered dietitian who helps stressed-out clients find natural ways to improve their overall wellness.\n Feeling less stressed already? I hope so!  Here are some food suggestions to help you live in a state of calm in 2021.\n Try out anchovies, sardines and herring, in addition to salmon, trout and mackerel. These foods are a rich source of stress-busting omega-3 fatty acids known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), which play an important role in brain health.\n \"Increasing omega-3 fatty acids can help to regulate how our bodies handle stress,\" Porrazza said. Stress can increase inflammation in the body so if we can reduce inflammation by consuming more omega-3s, we could also potentially reduce cortisol levels, which could improve health and wellness, Porrazza explained. In fact, omega 3s help to blunt the cortisol response after acute stress, some research has shown. On the flip side, low levels of omega 3s may affect the function of the HPA, or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, axis, which plays a role in how our bodies respond to stress, according to Porrazza.\n Omega-3 fats might help to reduce the symptoms of clinical anxiety, concluded a recent review and meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials involving over 2,200 participants from 11 countries.\n Consuming high amounts of these fatty acids in fish may help protect us from depression, too, according to other research.\n Need some ideas besides grilled salmon? Try a Caesar salad with an anchovy vinaigrette dressing, or add some herring to your Sunday bagel order.\n Mussels, clams and oysters are rich in vitamin B12 in addition to omega-3s, which are both prominent nutrients in diets connected with lower anxiety, Ramsey explained.\n In fact, B vitamins, including vitamin B12, help to maintain the nervous system, and stress can cause a slight increase in the body's requirements of these B vitamins, explained Martha McKittrick, a New York City-based registered dietitian who provides nutrition counseling and wellness coaching to many stressed-out New Yorkers.\n Vitamin B deficiencies can increase the risk of developing stress-related symptoms such as irritability, lethargy and depression.\n Since vitamin B12 is not produced by plants, if you are vegan, you should ensure that you are consuming vitamin B12 from fortified foods or a supplement.\n Foods such as red and green peppers, oranges, grapefruit and kiwi are rich in vitamin C, which in high doses has antidepressant effects and improves mood, and may be helpful in treating stress-related disorders.\n Other research has revealed that vitamin C may help reduce anxiety among high school students.\n To boost your vitamin C intake, aim to include one vitamin C-rich food with a meal, and another for a snack. You could also try one of my favorites: dark chocolate-dipped kiwis or oranges for dessert!\n Carbohydrates can help to boost serotonin production in the brain, which is key in influencing our mood. \"Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for happiness and well-being,\" Porrazza said.\n Serotonin has a calming effect and also promotes sleep and relaxation, McKittrick explained. In fact, low levels of brain serotonin, research has suggested, can lead to increased vulnerability to psychosocial stress.\n Tryptophan is an amino acid that is necessary for the production of serotonin in the brain. Complex carbs including whole grains and vegetables can help boost levels of serotonin because they make tryptophan more available in the brain.\n Carbs like soybeans and peas also deliver a small dose of protein, which can help to balance blood glucose levels. This benefit is important, since fluctuations in blood glucose can cause irritability and worsen stress levels.\n Additionally, if you eat too many highly processed carbs that are loaded with sugar and lack protein or healthy fats, like cookies and sweets, you can experience blood sugar spikes and crashes, \"and that can make you feel more stressed,\" McKittrick added.\n Fermented foods such as yogurt, kombucha, kefir, tempeh and sauerkraut contain friendly bacteria known as probiotics, which have the ability to reduce stress and cortisol levels.\n In fact, randomized controlled trials featuring probiotics suggest a causal link between the gut microbiota and stress responding.\n Feeling shy? Fermented foods may help reduce symptoms of social anxiety, too, research has shown. These probiotic-rich foods may also help control negative thoughts that are associated with low moods.\n How does it all work? Our gut bacteria produce about 95% of our body's serotonin supply, which can positively affect how we feel, according to Porrazza. On the flip side, stress can increase inflammation and gut dysbiosis, which is basically an imbalance of the gut microbiota, and this can negatively influence mood.\n Other fermented foods include sourdough bread, kimchi, miso and pickles.\n Ramsey fights stress with a kefir-rich banana smoothie. \"I get a good dose of potassium from the banana and I add nuts, cinnamon and cacao for its anti-inflammatory properties. It's a great energy and brain boost.\"\n Bananas are also a source of vitamin B6, which helps in the conversion of tryptophan into serotonin.\n A lot of times when you are stressed out, your magnesium levels can become depleted, McKittrick explained. \"If you have a magnesium-deficient diet, it can raise stress hormones, so it is important to eat magnesium-rich foods, like leafy green vegetables, nuts and seeds; legumes; and whole grains,\" she said.\n \"A lot of my clients, when they think about crunchy foods, they think of chips, but sometimes you can manage stress with healthier crunchy foods like celery and carrots with hummus,\" Porrazza said.\n Cutting up an apple and then munching on it can also release stress, as Porrazza has observed with her clients. \"Doing something with their hands can help them take themselves out of their head and give them a little bit of a mindful moment, which can take them out of the stress of the moment,\" she added.\n Green, black and oolong teas are rich in theanine, an amino acid that helps reduce stress and promote calm feelings.\n These teas are also rich in antioxidants, which can help reduce oxidative stress in the body, which helps protect against disease.\n Black tea in particular has been studied for its role in stress recovery and reduction in cortisol levels.\n And while there isn't enough research to show that chamomile reduces stress, the act of sitting and drinking a cup of this herbal tea may be calming for some, Porrazza explained.\n Lastly, there are a few diet strategies to avoid, in order to feel less stressed.  One is to consume less caffeine.\n \"Caffeine has effects on the brain and nervous system and can elevate cortisol levels and exacerbate the effects of stress on the body,\" McKittrick said.\n Because of caffeine's effects, it's important to pay attention to how your body responds to caffeine. \"If I am stressed, I can only have half a cup of coffee,\" McKittrick added.\n And it's important to not go too long without eating. Doing so can cause low blood sugar, which can make you feel more irritable and worsen stress. \"It's very individual, but for most I would say don't go more than four to five hours without food -- but pay attention to your own body,\" McKittrick said.\n Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.",

        "body_text": "Warm temps across the northern US have led to below-normal snowfall across many cities, but Southern states are getting more than their normal share.\n For instance, Amarillo, Texas, has had more than 15 inches of snow -- surpassing Green Bay, Wisconsin, which has had 11, as well as Chicago and Grand Rapids, Michigan, with about 9 inches each.\n When calculating snowfall, the 2020-21 Winter Season is defined as July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021.\n San Angelo, Texas, has had 5.8 inches, which is more than Cincinnati (3.1 inches), Indianapolis (5.4 inches), and Louisville, Kentucky (3.5 inches).\n Shreveport, Louisiana, has had more than 3 inches, which is more than Washington, DC, and St. Louis.\n The science behind this shift of snowfall is simple. In addition to the milder temps in the northern part of the country, there hasn't been a big amplified jet stream this year -- and both of those factors are limiting snow systems from moving through the region. So we have had a more southerly storm track, which has brought more snow to some Southern locations.\n Temperatures have been one of the main contributing factors, because without cold air, you can't have snow.\n Since January 1, much of the Midwest and Northeast -- including Minneapolis, Chicago, Cleveland and Buffalo -- have had air temperatures at least 5 to 10 degrees above average. This may not sound like a lot, but it is enough to often make the difference between rain and snow.\n \"In addition, several snow events in Milwaukee this year have featured lower than average snow-to-liquid ratios due to warmer temperatures, so what precipitation has fallen has not produced as much snow as might have otherwise been,\" says Andy Boxell, the lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in Milwaukee.\n Statistically, January is the coldest month for Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, and many Midwestern cities. What is noticeably missing is a cold snap from the polar vortex.\n We've already had one such instance of a polar vortex disruption where a large section of Arctic air has moved south into the lower latitudes, but that mostly affected Europe and northern Asia this month. So far, no such blast of cold air from the polar vortex has made it to the US, and that has limited the cold air needed to keep northern precipitation as snow.\n It doesn't look like robust cold air is coming soon.\n The one-month outlook from NOAA shows warmer than average temperatures across much of the country.\n Even without super-cold temperatures, some Northern cities have a shot at snow this weekend.\n Winter weather alerts are in effect for over half a dozen Midwestern states Saturday in preparation for heavy snowfall. Multiple systems are moving through the region over the next few days.\n Still, the upcoming snow might not be enough to bring them back to normal.\n \"As far as making up the deficit in Milwaukee, a few inches are possible Saturday night and Sunday morning,\" says Boxell. \"Monday's system may also bring some snow, though for now it appears that the heavier amounts will be closer to the Chicago area. At this point, we will likely need multiple systems in fairly short order to make up the difference.\"\n From Madison, Wisconsin, to Milwaukee, the forecast calls for at least 2 to 3 inches through Monday.\n Chicago, Green Bay, and Des Moines, Iowa, are all forecast to pick up 1 to 2 inches this weekend.",

        "body_text": "The Washington Monument will be closed \"until further notice\" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Park Service said Saturday in a statement.\n The monument had been closed since January 11 due to security concerns in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and the then-upcoming Inauguration Day.\n \"National Park Service will monitor public health conditions in the Washington, D.C. area, as well as the opening status of other nearby visitor attractions, and reopen the Washington Monument and other indoor park facilities as soon as it deems it is safe to do so,\" the Park Service said in the statement. A reopening date has not been determined yet.\n The monument closed in March, along with a handful of DC landmarks over the pandemic, before reopening again in October, though there was another short closure in December.\n There have been 870 deaths from Covid in Washington, DC., since last January. In the US, Covid-19 has killed at least 416,907 people and infected about 25 million, according to data by Johns Hopkins University.\n This newest closure comes under the new Biden administration, which has generally taken a sharply different approach to coronavirus preventative measures compared to the Trump administration.\n On Thursday, President Joe Biden used his first full day in office to unveil his national strategy for combating the pandemic, which included signing several executive actions.\n \"Our national strategy is comprehensive, it's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it's detailed,\" Biden said, speaking from the White House. The Biden administration's 198-page plan is posted on WhiteHouse.gov.",

        "title": "Spending more on DoorDash and UberEats? This fee may be why",
        "body_text": "Late last year, some DoorDash customers started getting hit with a puzzling new fee on their order total just before checkout.\n The extra roughly $1 to $2 charge was labeled by city. Some people got a \"Denver\" fee, others a \"Chicago\" one.\n Across the country, people who ordered delivery through the service were charged more, seemingly just for living in those places.\n The actual reason for the new fees? In those cities, local governments have passed temporary caps that limit how much third-party delivery platforms can charge restaurants to help struggling business. To try to recoup those losses, DoorDash has put in new customer fees in cities that have enacted caps, including Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Oakland, Philadelphia, Portland, Seattle, St. Louis, and a handful of others. (Customers can find the explanation when they click on the fee line before placing their orders).\n DoorDash isn't alone in adding fees. Uber Eats has had a similar customer fee in place since the summer in Portland, where the cap is 10% per order.\n As restaurants struggle to make it through the pandemic, they're fighting back against high commissions charged by delivery platforms \u2014 either by looking for alternatives, or with the help of legislation. But someone has to pay those fees. Increasingly, it's the consumer.\n Before the pandemic, many restaurants shied away from third-party delivery services, like DoorDash, Uber Eats or Grubhub. Those platforms can charge commission fees as high as 30% per order, which can leave restaurants in the red.\n But now, with dining rooms completely closed or open with limited capacity, many restaurant operators feel they have to offer delivery or go out of business. With less money coming in, the pain of those high commission fees is even greater.\n In an effort to help restaurants, a number of municipalities enacted commission fee caps. The temporary limits, usually around 15%, will expire eventually \u2014 in some cases after indoor dining has been fully reinstated for two or three months, in other cases on a specific date. Some cities that enacted temporary fee caps have already extended them.\n Delivery services have taken varying approaches to the caps\n DoorDash argues that the fees it gets from restaurants cover its own costs. If they can't get them from restaurants, they have to charge customers instead, according to the company.\n \"Operating our platform, paying and insuring Dashers, and ensuring high-quality service can be expensive, which is why in many markets, where local governments have passed pricing regulations, we have begun charging customers a small additional fee,\" a DoorDash spokesperson told CNN Business in an emailed statement.\n Uber echoed a similar sentiment.\n \"In order to maintain a reliable delivery marketplace we are instituting several temporary local fees in certain US markets,\" an Uber Eats spokesperson said. \"Fees collected by Uber Eats from both merchants and consumers on transactions are what fund our services, including maintenance of the app, consumer support, safety, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 pay for delivery people.\"\n Unlike its competitors, Grubhub, which merged with Seamless in 2013, is not adding explicit fees in cities that have put commission caps in place, according to a company spokesperson. Instead, it's using its rivals' actions to try to lure people to its monthly subscription service, Grubhub+, which costs $9.99 per month. In December, it said it would offer three months free to people who join the service in Chicago and New York City.\n Some restaurant advocates are afraid that the higher fees will drive customers away. \"We oppose any additional fees that could potentially dissuade diners from ordering in,\" said Sam Toia, president and CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association.\n There's good reason to be afraid.\n \"Consumers are really hesitant to incur any additional fees and costs\" on delivery, said Jill Failla, senior foodservice analyst at Mintel. \"Third-party companies need to be really aware of this barrier around consumer fees, and need to be really careful about what they're trying to pass on to the consumer.\"\n That doesn't mean that they won't end up charging more for delivery, she said.\n Though the pandemic has given them a boost with online ordering surging, many of these companies have struggled with profitability.\n For now, some restaurant operators are saying they haven't seen any slowdown in orders because of the new fees.\n \"I haven't seen a meaningful change in our third-party percentage sale,\" said Ruth Jones, chief financial officer at Maria Empanada, a small Colorado-based empanada chain.\n The commission caps have been helpful, Jones said. But once they go away, restaurants will once again face those higher commission fees. When that happens, they might have to start charging customer fees themselves. \"You're seeing a lot of restaurants add delivery fees for using the third parties,\" she said. \"We have to continue to try to make money as a business, so we have to make choices that make the third party make sense.\"\n That's especially the case in an environment where restaurants are struggling to survive.\n \"Restaurants recovery is going to require above average revenue and margin growth for some time, and unfortunately that will mean some higher prices for consumers,\" said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic.  \"Ordering delivery has and will continue to get more expensive.\"\n \u2014 CNN Business' Sara O'Brien contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The man third in the line of presidential succession has been in five 'Batman' movies",
        "body_text": "For as many foes as the superhero fends off, Batman has a formidable team of supporters starting with his sidekick Robin, Gotham City Commissioner James Gordon and his ever-loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth.\n But one of the Caped Crusader's most fervent supporters lies not in a comic book, but in the US Senate, and he's known the Bat for more than 80 years.\n Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont and the longest-serving member of the current Senate, is a Batman aficionado who's turned his fandom into philanthropy. He's even used the comics to forward his legislative agenda.\n Now President pro tempore of the Senate, Leahy is third in the presidential line of succession. Though it's unlikely he'll ever have to serve as President, his high-profile position shines a brighter light on his colorful resume -- which includes multiple appearances in the \"Batman\" films.\n When he's not working in the Senate chambers in Washington, Leahy retreats to Gotham, where Batman fights cartoonish villains and mans the Batmobile. It's a comfort he took up when he was 4 years old.\n \"If you live in the real world all the time, it can be kind of boring,\" the senator told Vermont alt-weekly newspaper Seven Days in 2008.\n Leahy declined an interview for this story through his spokesman, but his affinity for all things Batman is well-documented. As he wrote in the foreword of \"Detective Comics: 80 Years of Batman,\" he was born just one year after Batman's first comic published in 1939.\n He first discovered Batman at age 4, when he received his first library card. He frequented the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Montpelier, where he spent many an afternoon poring over comics. While his school friends raved over Superman, Leahy found a \"kindred bond\" with the Bat.\n \"Entering Batman's world through my imagination opened an early door into a lifelong love of reading,\" he wrote in his foreword.\n He'd continue spending hours at the library each day until adulthood, and even after he moved to Washington, he'd make time to pop in. He's a vocal advocate for literacy and the preservation of libraries so children can have similarly formative experiences with books.\n \"Some of my fondest memories as a child were at the library, where everyone fit in and possibilities were limitless,\" he writes on his Senate website.\n Leahy was elected to the Senate in 1974 and until the mid-1990s, his affinity for Batman didn't have much to do with his duties on Capitol Hill.\n That changed in 1996, when Leahy collaborated with DC Comics to create \"Batman: Death of Innocents: The Horror of Landmines,\" a graphic novel warning of the dangers of landmines. Leahy has long advocated to end the use of landmines, and he told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that he placed copies of the comic on every senator's desk that year.\n Leahy's first foray into screen acting -- something he does strictly when Batman is involved -- came in 1995, when he appeared in the critically reviled \"Batman Forever.\" The same year, he voiced a character billed as \"Territorial Governor\" in \"Batman: The Animated Series.\"\n Since then, Leahy has appeared in nearly as many \"Batman\" films as the Caped Crusader himself. He usually appears as a scowling politician (though in \"Batman & Robin,\" which his son Mark also had a cameo in, he was allowed to enjoy a raucous party). He even met an explosive end as the curiously named Senator Purrington in \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"\n \"I explain to everybody that getting blown up was OK 'cause my wife's a registered nurse,\" he joked to Roll Call in 2016. \"She put me back together and I never missed a vote.\"\n His most notable cameo, though, came in 2008's \"The Dark Knight,\" when he confronts Heath Ledger's Joker and famously tells the villain that he's \"not intimidated by thugs.\" The Joker, true to form, responds by grabbing Leahy's character and menacing him with a knife.\n Ledger, who died before the film's release, is Leahy's favorite Joker.\n \"He scared the heck out of me, when he came at me with the knife,\" he told Roll Call. \"I didn't have to act.\"\n He'll be absent from the upcoming reboot \"The Batman,\" starring Robert Pattinson in the titular role. Citing a busy schedule, he told the Burlington Free Press he \"didn't even seek to be in it.\"\n \"I have too many other things going on with Covid, with appropriation bills,\" he told the paper in August.\n While his film roles have certainly satisfied his inner fanboy, Leahy does it for the library where his love for reading bloomed. He donates every fee from his appearances and royalty checks from residual showings to his beloved Kellogg-Hubbard Library, where he helped finance a children's wing named for him. From his roles in \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy alone, Leahy has donated more than $150,000 back to his hometown library, said Carolyn Brennan, co-director of the library.\n In 2012, the library hung a plaque honoring Leahy, who staff called their \"super hero.\"\n Leahy found Batman when he was a boy, but his love for the fictional hero is foundational to who he is and the lawmaker he became. Batman instilled in Leahy a love of reading and promoting literacy and of delivering justice (though as a government servant, not a caped vigilante).\n Leahy preferred Batman to other characters because, unlike the god-like Superman or the super-powered Spider-Man, Batman was just a man, albeit an extremely rich one, with \"human strengths and human frailties.\" The danger Batman faced was different than that of other heroes -- his felt real, Leahy wrote in the DC collection foreword.\n \"The Batman prevailed through superior intellect and detective skills, through the freedoms afforded by great wealth and through sheer will,\" Leahy wrote in his foreword. \"Not superpowers, but skill, science and rationality.\"\n Much like Bruce Wayne, Leahy is just a man, albeit one with more power than most and the chance to make real, tangible changes in his own Gotham. Following Batman's example, he's vowed to use that power wisely.",

Well, I thought, 'Oh my God this is such a TV iconic moment.' Well ... our lovely, loving boss that we love so much, Tom Johnson, called me and said, 'Why did you let them kiss?' \" she said, referring to Tom Johnson, CNN's president at the time.\n \"And I said, 'I guess I forgot ... to tell them that if they were having a really good time that they shouldn't kiss at the end of the show.'\"\n Johnson smiled as he recalled the Brando interview on CNN Saturday. \"Larry King Live\" was the only CNN show that reported directly to the network president.\n \"It wasn't just a light kiss. It was a full frontal kiss of the two of them,\" he said.\n Such an event on television was a rarity: That same year two men on MTV's \"The Real World: San Francisco\" kissed at the first ever commitment ceremony broadcast on U.S. television.\n \"And I just sat there ... ready to get under the desk. I received a lot of calls from time to time but I knew that I would have them then -- as I did. But my call to Wendy ... it really was, 'Wendy, Why? Why did you let that happen?' \"",

        "body_text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a new interview that he supports his Republican colleague Rep. Liz Cheney following her vote to impeach former President Donald Trump in the House, but added he has \"concerns\" and didn't know her thoughts ahead of her announcement on impeachment.\n \"Look, I support her, but I also have concerns,\" he told Gray TV's Greta Van Susteren, according to a transcript released Saturday of an interview set to air Sunday. \"She took a position as a No. 3 member in conference, she never told me ahead of time. One thing about leadership, if we're going to work together, we should understand. We know that this is going to become a difficulty. She can have a difference of opinion, but the one thing if we're going to lead within the conference, we should work together on that as a whole conference because we're representative of that conference. So I support her, but I do think she has a lot of questions she has to answer to the conference.\"\n His remarks come as a group of House conservatives' effort to oust Cheney from GOP leadership is viewed as a long shot by GOP aides watching the process. While it is expected the Republican conference will hold a special meeting on the topic, actually ousting Cheney as conference chairwoman is much harder. The conference would have to vote on a resolution asking her to step down and a majority would have to support it, something that aides don't believe is possible right now.\n Aides previously told CNN that McCarthy is focused on tamping down intra-party fights as the House GOP recalibrate and focus on winning back the House in 2022. A former senior GOP official told CNN that ousting Cheney would be a massive step backward for the party.\n McCarthy told Van Susteren he believes that holding the special meeting will \"help bring people back together.\"\n \"Look, everybody's able to vote their district or what they think is most important. Leadership is a little different job, especially when you're the communications arm of it and the number three person. I think it's best that within the Republican Party, that we have a lot of different voices,\" he said. \"I think there's a lot of questions that have to be answered and we've got to be able to do that in a family meeting to help bring people back together.\"\n He also said \"everybody across this country has some responsibility\" for the US Capitol insurrection on January 6.\n \"I also think everybody across this country has some responsibility. Think about four years ago after President Trump was sworn in. What happened in the very next day? The title was resist with people walking in the streets, (Rep.) Maxine Waters saying to confront people, confront them in the restaurants. We had people poor, (Rep.) Steve Scalise got shot,\" he said, referring to the 2017 shooting of Scalise and four others at a Republican congressional baseball practice.\n He continued, \"What do we write on our social media? What do we say to one another? How do we disagree and still not be agreeable even when it comes to opinion?\"\n When asked about changing his tune on Trump's responsibility in the attack, he said, \"No, I have not changed in that.\"\n Later Saturday, McCarthy's office sought to clarify his comments to Van Susteren, saying in a statement, \"He has maintained since the attacks that we all have a responsibility to lower the political temperature across the spectrum that has been building for years and unite as Americans -this isn't the first instance of political violence.\"\n McCarthy on Thursday broke with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Trump's role in the insurrection saying, \"I don't believe he provoked if you listen to what he said at the rally.\" Those comments came after he had said earlier this month, \"The President bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\"\n CNN's Lauren Fox, Veronica Stracqualursi and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.",

        "title": "History teachers revisit their curriculum after the Capitol riots",
        "body_text": "Brianna Davis was listening to a documentary of famous people reading the Declaration of Independence with her class when news broke of the riots at the US Capitol.\n \"We were listening to the words that built America\" as she began getting alerts and seeing images of chaos in Washington DC, she told CNN.\n The history and government teacher at Rancho Campana high school in Camarillo, California had to cancel her class early, she said. She knew what was unfolding was historic in a way like nothing she had ever experienced in real-time with her students -- and she just didn't have the words to explain it to them.\n Davis and other history teachers across the country have faced a dilemma since January 6: How do you put a historical moment into context as it is happening and what does teaching history look like in the years that follow?\n It's a problem they feel compelled to address for the younger generations.\n \"There's no curriculum for that,\" said sixth-grade history teacher Hayden O'Rourke of Wagner Middle School in Philadelphia. \"You have to think on the fly.\"\n After Davis finished her classes, she turned to the news and tried to digest what was taking place. Before long, she was back to work, pulling the images she thought would one day end up in the history textbooks and creating an assignment that would pull what her class witnessed together into their lesson plan.\n The image that stuck out most to Davis' students was that of the Confederate flag being carried inside the US Capitol.\n She spent much of the class periods discussing the photos as well as comments made by her students as part of a project she assigned. And to put what they saw into context, she relied on articles about American history, including the Preamble to the Constitution and the origins of the Confederate flag.\n \"They saw and understood this situation enough to know that democracy is bigger and better than just them,\" Davis said. \"Their role in the process was to make sure something like this never happened again, or at least understand how this happened.\"\n Jeff Robinson, a history teacher at Chilhowie High School in Virginia, said with the cyclical nature of history, there was plenty in the curriculum that could help put some context around the riots.\n Just as immigration has been a contentious issue in current political conversations, so too was it in the 1920s, he said. And although the images from the US Capitol were shocking, they could be connected to the War of 1812 when British troops set fire to the same building, Robinson said.\n What has taken a new shape in their courses is the history of protest in the US. While Robinson's students used to be shocked by images of Vietnam War protests, now, he says, they are used to seeing chaos and clashes. \"These students grew up in an era of protest,\" he said.\n Even in O'Rourke's classroom, where many of the sixth-grade students are learning the basics about political parties and trying to wrap their heads around what happened on January 6, their teacher says some are making clear connections to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n \"One said, 'Well if there were Black people doing that, we would get shot at,'\" he recalled one student saying in response to the images from the Capitol.\n The theme of protests is one that keeps coming up for Davis. She said she is grappling with how to teach it: What makes a protest peaceful and what makes it violent? What does it mean to have the right to protest?\n Across all of their classrooms,  the teachers said their students brought up questions around how to keep the Capitol riots from happening again.\n Curriculum standards move slowly, Davis said, and it is unlikely there will be a large-scale response in lesson plans. \"It feels like it is all up to the history department,\" she said.\n Some schools may require teachers to talk about the topic, O'Rourke said, but ultimately teachers will have to make their own decisions about if and how to talk about the riot.\n The teachers say they worry that teaching such politically charged issues will be seen as influencing the viewpoints of their students.\n \"I'm just going to present the facts and try to be balanced on both sides and let the chips fall where they may,\" Robinson said.\n But some of the issues that need to be covered, such as social movements for racial equality, involve walking a difficult line, Davis said.\n \"I'm still learning and I'm still trying to be a better teacher of tackling the tough subjects of 'Let's break down the system of oppression,'\" Davis said. \"How can we talk about slavery and the history of the US and not talk about White supremacy. That's kind of the biggest frustration ... walking that line of what you need to know (for the education standards) versus how it really happens.\"\n From this experience, Davis said that the biggest change she plans to make to her curriculum is the addition of media literacy. It's important, she says, to understand how events are portrayed and how people access information.\n O'Rourke, for his part, said he has made the comparison to Instagram influencers. \"If they talk about a special product, you're probably going to buy that,\" he said. \"[The protestors] heard their president, so they followed.\"\n O'Rourke said he will continue to emphasize the importance of looking deeper into the differences across the political spectrum: not just what it means to be Left or Right, but what extremism looks like and why people think the way they do.\n Robinson said he will continue to emphasize American ideals, including the long history of peaceful transfers of power.\n \"I said, 'Guys what you have witnessed for the last four years of politics, that's not really what it's supposed to be,'\" Robinson said. \"They've never lived in a society where Americans see themselves as one place.\"",

        "body_text": "After a big breakfast at a Colorado restaurant, a generous customer left employees a $1,400 tip and a message that said \"COVID Sucks!\"\n Notchtop Bakery & Cafe owner Nailya Khametvalieva says the patron, who she only identified as David, came into her Estes Park eatery on Wednesday for some eggs, bacon, sausage and biscuits and gravy.\n When it came time to pay the $20.04 check, David asked his server how many people were working that day.\n He ended up leaving the $1,400 tip with instructions to give each of the seven employees $200.\n \"That brought truly tears to all the servers [and] cooks -- you know, nobody ever thinks of cooks -- the cooks were just so surprised and shocked. We were all shocked,\" Khametvalieva said. \"We did thank him, but I felt like we didn't do it enough.\"\n She said David lives in the area, but it was only the second time he's been to the restaurant.\n Gloria Fuentes waited on David both times he came in and told CNN affiliate KMGH that she couldn't believe it when she saw the bill.\n \"I was like 'Oh my God, am I dreaming or what's going on?'\" Fuentes told KMGH.\n Another server tolkd KMGH that the money would be a big help to her family.\n \"It's $200 to me, but it's also $200 for my husband. It's also $200 for my daughters, for things that we needed to make it,\" Jayme Johnson said.\n Khametvalieva never closed the restaurant that she's run for almost 10 years because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but said business has been tough. Last year's wildfires also added to the challenge.\n She said she's been able to give all of her employees hours and also got a PPP loan.\n Estes Park is about 70 miles outside of Denver, and Khametvalieva says she gets a lot of business in the summer from out-of-state tourists.\n She said many of those customers have bought gift cards to support the restaurant, since they haven't been able to come in person.\n \"I wanted to thank everybody who actually feel for small businesses and people have been so grateful and kind and nice. They have a big heart, especially David,\" she said.",

        "title": "How Black barbers have become mental health advocates for African American men",
        "body_text": "Ray Conner traces his ambition to be a barber back to when he was a kid in Detroit. Growing up, he was abused. He watched his mother battle drug and alcohol addictions. He often went to bed hungry. When he needed to get away, he went down to A Cut Above Barber Shop on Eight Mile Road for a fresh cut and some companionship from his barber, Jessie. The relationship carried him through some of the darkest days of his life.\n \"Jessie may not remember me but him being my barber as a kid saved my life and it is now because of him that I am not only a Master Barber but a Barber Instructor,\" Conner wrote on the shop's Google reviews a few months ago.\n Conner, based in Johnson City, Tennessee, was inspired to become both a barber and a mentor for other young Black men facing adversity.\n \"If I can give what he gave to me, then I know I'm doing something great.\" Conner told CNN.\n The Confess Project Barber Coalition, a non-profit created to help Black men and boys become the best version of themselves, hosted a workshop in his town early last year. Conner immediately knew he needed to get involved. He was struck by how the organization's founder, Lorenzo Lewis, spoke frankly about his own hardships. Through the coalition, he was shown not only how to better take care of his mental health, but also given the tools to provide that same support system to his clients.\n Systemic racism has created a unique need for support in the Black community, yet national data shows many African American communities are woefully under-resourced and underrepresented in behavioral health care. The past year has exacerbated these challenges. The pandemic has disproportionately affected African Americans, and the repeated instances of racial injustice and police brutality have led to an increased need for mental health services in the Black community.\n The Confess Project's mission is to bridge the gaps in mental health care by providing a safe space for people to talk openly about the struggles they face. In turn, it has created a network of support among the barbers. Since it began in 2016, the Barber Coalition has spread to sixteen cities across the Southeast and Midwest and trained more than 200 barbers to be mental health advocates for their communities.\n Coronavirus has forced much of its outreach online but has also allowed them new opportunities for growth through an expanded digital presence. The group hosts online training courses, group support calls and individual check-ins for its member barbers to circumvent the lockdowns and social distancing guidelines the pandemic has brought on.\n For African American men, the self-care of sitting in the barber seat goes far beyond personal aesthetic. \"It's the Black mecca of the community,\" said Darnell Rice, the Director for Engagement and Membership for the Confess Project. \"We go to the barbershop to talk about everything.\" Studies have indicated barbershops can be effective at promoting and improving public health in the Black community. The intimacy gave Lewis his avenue to start a mental health movement.\n Most barbers are already trained to build relationships and trust with their clients. Lewis takes that one step further by teaching his members how to engage in active listening and guide their clients to talk about issues in their lives. From there, the barbers have undergone training on stigma reduction and validation so they can provide clients with positive reinforcement for whatever they are facing.\n For Conner, cutting hair and being an advocate for mental health go hand in hand: it's all about attention to detail.\n \"If you're paying attention, you'll be able to identify if something is wrong, even if it's a first -time client, you'll be able to tell if energy is off,\" he said.\n Earlier this month, Conner had a first-time client tell him about how his brother was addicted to methamphetamine and how detrimental it was on his family. Conner shared his own experiences about how hard it was to have a mother who was an addict to show him that he wasn't alone. He made an appointment to come back the next week.\n \"He got to the point he was comfortable and that's what I wanted. It's not even about the money or the tips, he's going to know Ray cares ... It almost makes me want to cry. I'm so happy that they know that I'm here and I care, and that they feel comfortable enough to share this with me.\"\n The barbers are quick to say they are not therapists. If they come across someone who needs more help than they are equipped to offer, the Confess Project has connected them with local resources in the community they are able to pass along to their clients.\n In Louisville, Divine Alexander's impact has gone far beyond his work at LAB Professional Barbering Services.\n \"When I step into his shop, it's like I'm stepping into another planet, I'm free,\" said Dominic Collins, one of Alexander's regular patrons. Collins describes himself as a trendsetter and talking with Alexander gave him the confidence to be himself. It's a message he shares all the time with his four younger siblings. \"I tell them every day 'Hey, you go out there and you make a difference. Be who you want to be.'\"\n Alexander has also been able to connect and promote mental health with other members active in the community. One workshop hosted at his shop led him to mentor Elliot Kelly Jr., a student at the University of Louisville.\n \"It was my first time seeing adult men just embrace their vulnerabilities, so it was just a powerful sight,\" Kelly said.\n Kelly was so touched by what he saw that he created \"Barber Shop Talks\" in its image tailored specifically to university students. The themes of the meetings ranged from politics to relationships to police brutality, with the common goal of discussing how these dynamics take a toll on mental health and overall well-being.\n Before the pandemic, Kelly also worked with young boys through the Louisville Urban League and as an assistant wrestling coach at the local high school. He saw a lot of the same anger and rage in his students that he felt in his life growing up. He says that young Black children are usually treated according to their anger in schools but are not helped deal with the root of that anger.\n \"When I went to the event, I not only thought about myself, but I thought about my students. It made me want to be better, so I can teach my students how to heal from their trauma and how to unpack it and how to deal with it, but I have to know how to do it for myself first,\" Kelly said.\n He plans to pick the work back up as soon as the programs resume. When he finds himself in need, he calls up Alexander for advice.\n Going \"Beyond the Shop\" has been the ultimate goal of the Coalition. Lewis and his colleagues hope the work they do will have a domino effect by showing Black men and boys it's OK to talk openly about their emotions and ensure men of color know they are loved and valued in a society that often makes them feel otherwise.\n \"The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth,\" Lewis told CNN, quoting a famous African proverb. \"When we think of the barbershop, I look at it like it's part of their village,\" he continued. \"It's providing warmth and that accommodation and that support so people will feel seen, heard, and celebrated.\"",

        "title": "Why Biden will have to help Mexico",
        "body_text": "Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda served as Minister of Foreign Relations of Mexico (2000-2003) and was an advisor to two candidates for the presidency of Mexico, Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas and Vicente Fox. He is a professor at New York University, and his latest book, \"America Through Foreign Eyes,\" was recently published by Oxford University Press. He is a CNNE contributor. Read more opinion at CNN.\nDuring his first months in office, President-elect Joe Biden will have more than enough on his plate to deal with besides peaceful and essentially non-conflictive neighbors like Mexico and Canada. Covid-19, the question of what to do about Donald Trump, the slumping economy, and Biden's ambitious social agenda are almost overwhelming. Foreign-policy issues such as Iran, the Paris Agreements on Climate Change, China and Venezuela will probably concentrate his international attention.\n But he shouldn't procrastinate in excess with regard to Mexico; there is a fire kindling next door.\n While there are a number of specific bilateral issues that Trump neglected and that Biden will have to concentrate on regarding Mexico, his task may be driven by another, more abstract notion: Mexican stability. Migration, drugs, security, the border, enforcement of the USMCA trade agreement, and climate change, along with a smattering of \"third country issues\" -- including how the two countries approach, Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua -- will dominate the US--Mexico agenda in the short term.\n Migration, in particular, will demand immediate attention. The rise in immigrant apprehensions on the border since October, along with Biden's commitments to roll back the most odious facets of Trump's policies, will need deft and bold handling. The drug-enforcement agenda is also a challenging one, as a result of Mexico's new law restricting Mexican authorities' abilities to work with American DEA and ATF agents in Mexico and the lingering damage from the arrest on drug charges last October by US authorities of Mexico's former Defense Minister, Salvador Cienfuegos, whom Mexico has exonerated after he was sent back to Mexico by the Department of Justice.\n In recent years, some foreign energy companies have sued or considered suing Mexico over a recent move they see as discrimination in favor of Mexico's state-run oil company and public energy utility, Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported. Earlier this month, three Cabinet members of the outgoing Trump administration complained to the Mexican government that it was not complying with USMCA provisions on energy investments. Tensions over the USMCA deal have been felt by organized labor, too: AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said this month that his federation of unions would file an unrelated labor dispute against Mexico in the early days of the Biden administration.\n Biden's green agenda is diametrically opposed to the inclinations of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as AMLO, who has a penchant for oil and coal and an explicit dislike for wind and solar energy. And, of course, Covid-19 and vaccines will be a central matter for the two neighboring countries for months to come.\n But another issue may well push all of these aside. Mexico is facing a major economic, social and political crisis. Its economy was contracting even before the pandemic; slightly in 2019, then by 9% in 2020. Its president has shown on various occasions that he can fall prey to authoritarian temptations, by verbally attacking journalists and news organizations during his morning press conferences, and also by going after the country's autonomous agencies.\n Unemployment, crime, and even hunger have all stricken the country, in many ways as a result of L\u00f3pez Obrador's misguided policies. Trump appeared to be uninterested in these dangers, as long as AMLO did the United States' dirty work by keeping Central American migrants at bay. Biden may not be able to ignore them.\n At some point, he might have to sit down with his colleague and read him the riot act. In a nutshell, he may have to lay out to AMLO that if Mexico continues to slide down the cliff, why and how it does so becomes a US affair. It would no longer be an exclusively Mexican sovereign matter. Biden may have to explain to AMLO that Mexican macroeconomic policy, the rule of law, compliance with international agreements, respect for representative democracy and human rights are all legitimate bilateral issues, not exclusively domestic Mexican concerns.\n Making all of this explicit will not be simple. AMLO is an extremely insular president, uninterested in foreign affairs and devoid of experience in this field. He is also prickly and obsessed with his domestic agenda. Including Mexico's domestic problems in the US-Mexican agenda will not be easy for Biden, but it may become inevitable.\n Since President Clinton bailed out Mexico of its 1994-1995 financial meltdown, relations between the chief executives of the two countries have been limited to the traditional specifics of the bilateral relationship. I have long wondered if at some point, Clinton encouraged then-Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to finally lead his country toward a full-fledged representative democracy, possibly implying that this might entail his party's loss in the 2000 presidential elections. Recurrent economic crises, with concomitant American rescue packages, in 1976, 1982, 1987 and again in 1994-95, suggested that the Mexican political system had become dysfunctional, and that Washington was repeatedly picking up the broken dishes.\n President Biden may find himself in a similar situation. The Mexican economy's 9% shrinkage in 2020 was twice the decrease seen by Brazil and the US (according to Deloitte's estimate of where the US economy sat in the fourth quarter of 2020), and worse than the global and Latin American averages, according to IMF estimates. Violence continues to rise in Mexico, with homicides reaching a record high in the first half of 2020.\n The pandemic was gravely mishandled, with lethality rates and infections among the highest in the world.  Economic growth in 2021 is not expected to rise above 3.7%; apprehensions of Mexicans and Central Americans at the US southern border hit a 13-month high in September. Tensions with American companies over investments in Mexican energy production are likely to endure. New laws either passed by the Mexican Congress or scheduled for very soon have provoked explicit warnings from the Trump administration for their bias and content. Last, but certainly not least, the Mexican military is being assigned responsibilities for traditionally civilian matters, like illegal immigration and infrastructure, and acquiring power like never before.\n At some point, Biden may have to share his concerns over this situation with L\u00f3pez Obrador, instead of just going over the traditional items on the two countries' agenda. This implies treading a delicate path. AMLO could well respond: \"This is none of your business. The Mexican people elected me to carry out my program, and that is what I am doing.\" Moreover, AMLO has already been disdainful of Biden, to put it mildly. He practically endorsed Trump by visiting him at the White House last July, by declining to congratulate Biden on his election win until December 15, by offering asylum to Julian Assange, and by declining to condemn the assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters.\n Biden would have to explain how, at least since Woodrow Wilson's time, Mexican economic, political and social stability has been a major national interest for the United States, for the obvious reasons one can see on a map or on a TV news show. One and a half million Americans live in Mexico; millions more visit every year. Mexico is the US's second-leading trade partner, ranking between Canada and China. A large share of the illegal drugs consumed in the US pass through Mexico.\n As of 2017, there were 4.9 million Mexicans living in the US without legal immigration status, according to the Pew Research Center; yearly, hundreds of thousands of legal, temporary immigrants from Mexico harvest American crops, build American skyscrapers, work in the US hospitality industry and take care of American babies and the elderly. Biden has already halted construction of Trump's US-Mexico border wall, and he is expected to propose an immigration-policy overhaul that would offer a multi-year pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the US.\n The absence of any serious convulsions since 1920 has been a major Mexican achievement. Helping to keep it that way has been a major American contribution and source of tranquility.\n A stable Mexico is a longstanding American national interest. AMLO is not only threatening the people of Mexico by not solving poverty, violence, illness and corruption -- he is also jeopardizing a US national interest. It is not a minor one.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nJoe Biden's presidency is still brand-new and already Washington is struggling to deal with his core inaugural demand like it's a foreign concept: unity.\n It's not just that the idea of working together is completely at odds with the division pushed during the past four years by President Donald Trump.\n It's that the two parties have been so focused on being at each other's throats for the past few decades that the idea of doing anything together is, at this point, just plain weird.\n The major legislative achievements of recent years -- tax cuts by Trump, health care and banking reform by President Barack Obama -- were all achieved by one party steamrolling the other.\n The pandemic, particularly early on, offered an exception to the rule, when lawmakers from both parties came together to throw resources at saving the economy as the country shut down to slow the spread of the virus.\n And even now, as Biden pushes for a new, $1.9 trillion relief package, there's some indication both parties could buy in. Trump's former top economist broadly supports what Biden's trying to do, he told CNN in an interview.\n But economists can broadly agree on lots of things. That rarely translates into Senate votes. And far from handing over the reins to Democrats, who have a hair's-breadth majority with Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote, top Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is locked in a disagreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over how to keep the chamber running at all. That's why Republican senators are still running confirmation hearings even though Democrats are technically the majority party.\n There is also Trump's pending impeachment trial, his second, which is now scheduled to begin February 9. (Latest on that here.)\n The main problem for unity, as Peter Baker writes in the New York Times, is that it's rarely rewarded by voters:\n \"Where politicians used to perceive a political reward for at least appearing bipartisan, today they perceive risk of being accused of selling out by the more fervent elements of their own party. Compromise is seen by many as a vice not a virtue.\"\n Beyond the simple optics -- do voters prefer someone fighting for their interest or compromising for results? -- there's also a general disagreement over what unity looks like.\n Is it passing legislation most people agree on?\n It's not entirely clear the additional relief checks Biden is pushing will actually help the people who most need it. CNN Business' Chris Isidore explains it all in this headline: Stimulus checks are a lousy way to fix the economy.\n The looming impeachment trial may not be the best way to achieve that, although the Trump-inspired insurrection demands it.\n Certainly the political press is as confused by the concept as everyone else. Here's a roundup of opinion pieces I saw about \"unity\" on Friday. The single-word quotation marks are like stand-ins for cynical air quotes. Unity!? HA!\n Biden gets a cold dose of 'unity' (Politico)\n Forget 'unity': Biden's moralizing mantra is more likely to divide\n (New York Post)\n 'Unity' Is Not What America Needs Right Now\n (The Atlantic)\n Goofus and Gallant try unity and healing (The Washington Post)\n It's not all cynics out there. New York Times columnist David Brooks, who I think is still considers himself conservative, is all about it.\n \"I was shocked by how moved I was by the Biden inaugural,\" Brooks wrote. \"We've been through an emotional hailstorm over four years. Suddenly the sky has cleared. It's possible America may emerge from this trauma more transformed than we can imagine.",

        "title": "Families find throwing laptops and Wi-Fi at students isn't enough to bridge digital divide ",
        "body_text": "Every education expert knew that when the pandemic shuttered school buildings last March, America's persistent digital divide would be a huge problem. A 2017 US Senate report found 12 million children didn't have access to broadband internet at home. And administrators across the country warned that even students who had access may not have enough devices or a reliable enough connection to go to school online.\n It was a huge problem, but one that appeared to have a relatively easy solution -- governments, philanthropies and tech companies banded together to push out hundreds of thousands of devices to students who didn't have them. Governments and internet service providers worked to provide reduced-cost or free broadband connections and Wi-Fi hotspots to families who couldn't afford them.\n Ten months into this pandemic, there's now evidence that those measures were not enough to close the gap. Failing grades are rising in school districts across the country and attendance is an enduring problem. The impact is hardest felt among underserved students -- those who are poorer or minorities.\n One parents' group in Oakland, California, has an idea of what went wrong. Simply dropping off a laptop and a hotspot just isn't enough, they've found.\n \"We don't appreciate just how much of a steep curve that this is for families,\" Lakisha Young, a founder of Oakland REACH, told CNN. \"We're not having enough conversations about tech support, tech trainings, workshops, putting parents in a power position around technology.\"\n Oakland REACH provides intensive tech support for families who may be trying to use internet tools for the first time. Without that, Young says, the shiny new laptops and hotspots may just sit in the box they came in. And even if they don't, the frustration over using technology that Americans with more means may take for granted can lead those who are unfamiliar with it to throw up their hands.\n Connie Williams is one of the caregivers REACH works with. She is a strong advocate for her grandkids, who are all students in Oakland schools. She knows what it takes to be a good student, and she drives the children in her house to those goals. But she doesn't know much about computers, and when school shifted online, it was a challenge.\n \"It was very frustrating, very frustrating, because I have very little knowledge of computer technology,\" she told CNN. \"But here I am: grandparent-slash-teacher now. So I got to get up to speed.\"\n Williams recalls how her grandkids came undone  because they needed help with the digital tools their education now requires and Williams wasn't able to help them.\n \"I'm in tears. I'm crying. My babies come snotting and crying to me,\" she said. \"And they're like 'Grandma, this is just too much.' And I said, 'I know it's too much because it's too much for me.'\"\n REACH gives people like Williams an intensive tech support program, as well as a dedicated person who checks in regularly and makes sure things are running smoothly. Young said some families they work with have never set up an email account or used a system like Zoom.  It can take a long time to get people comfortable with technology that seems daunting to first-timers, she said.\n REACH's program worked for Williams and, according to Young, it's worked for a lot of other families in Williams' situation.\n But it takes a lot of resources to do what REACH does. And not every student's family can get access to that kind of assistance.\n And so, as American students head toward the second half of this pandemic school year, Young says the lasting digital divide means a lot of students are going to be left behind.\n \"I definitely think that there's going to be significant learning loss, especially where folks have not adapted to providing innovative and creative ways to really, really support families holistically,\" she said. \"It's just really hard.\"",

Victims may not self-identify as being trafficked or may not even realize they're being trafficked,\" the FBI statement said.\n Some of the other victims located during the operation were sexually exploited in the past and were considered vulnerable missing children, the statement said.\n One suspected human trafficker faces state charges as a result of the operation and several other investigations were opened, the FBI said.\n Some of the rescued minor victims \"were arrested for probation violations, robbery, or other misdemeanors\" while one child a victim of a noncustodial parental kidnapping, according to the statement.\n January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month and the caseload \"for both sex and labor trafficking-related crimes has increased significantly in the past several years,\" the statement said.\n \"The FBI considers human trafficking modern day slavery and the minors engaged in commercial sex trafficking are considered victims,\" said Kristi Johnson, assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles field office. \"While this operation surged resources over a limited period of time with great success, the FBI and our partners investigate child sex trafficking every day of the year and around the clock.\"\n The operation involved the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and more than two dozen other law enforcement agencies along with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the California Department of Child and Family Services, and victim advocacy organizations, according to the FBI.\n The FBI is working with its partners to provide resources to the rescued children, including medical care and legal services.\n \"Human trafficking is a pervasive and insidious crime that threatens the safety of our young people, who are the future of our communities,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said. \"We can only begin to take back the future of our youth with the strong partnerships forged between outstanding service providers and law enforcement.\"\n Anyone who believes they may be a victim of human trafficking can call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center Hotline at 888-373-7888 or visit the hotline's website. The FBI also has a human trafficking section on its website.\n CNN's Carma Hassan and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.",
