The FBI has warned that armed protests are being planned in the capitals of all 50 states.\n DC-area hotels are now left to wrestle with the risks of potentially hosting people who rioted last week at the Capitol, or those who might be planning on or involved in further violence.\n Thomas Penny, president of Donohoe Hospitality Services, which operates 12 DC-area hotels, told CNN Business that people involved in the Capitol events stayed at some of his hotels. But he said his hotels don't know who exactly was involved in the insurrection.\n Penny said that his hotels dealt with a few \"issues,\" but that by and large guests were peaceful last week. He declined to elaborate on what the issues were. He said that his hotels near the Capitol will remain boarded up as a security precaution until after the inauguration, but they will be open for business.\n \"We require is that folks are respectful our team and follow the guidelines of our hotels,\" Penny said. \"As long as they do that, they're respectful of our people and they follow our guidelines, we're here to welcome everybody.\"\n Several hotel chains including Hilton and Marriott said they would remain open during inauguration week with security plans in place.\n The Hotel Association of Washington, D.C. did not respond to requests for comment.\n -- Additional reporting by CNN Business' Brian Fung and Sara O'Brien.",

        "title": "Three-quarters of Wuhan patients hospitalized for Covid-19 still had symptoms 6 months later, Chinese study finds",
        "body_text": "Most patients who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 still suffered a variety of symptoms -- including fatigue and sleep difficulties -- six months after infection, a Chinese study has found.\n The study of more than 1,700 patients treated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, shows 76% suffered at least one symptom months after they were discharged from hospital.\n The findings indicate that even people who recover from Covid-19 could suffer long-lasting health impacts from their bout with the coronavirus, which has infected more than 90 million people worldwide.\n The study, the largest of its kind yet carried out, was published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet.  It found that fatigue and sleep difficulties were the most common post Covid-19 symptoms, occurring in 63% and 26% of the patients, respectively, six months after the onset of their initial diagnosis.\n The disease could also have long-lasting psychological complications, with anxiety or depression reported among 23% of the patients, the study found.\n Patients who were more severely ill tended to have continued evidence of lung damage on X-rays, according to the researchers.\n \"Because Covid-19 is such a new disease, we are only beginning to understand some of its long-term effects on patients' health,\" Dr. Bin Cao of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University, who led the study team, said in a statement.\n \"Our analysis indicates that most patients continue to live with at least some of the effects of the virus after leaving hospital, and highlights a need for post-discharge care, particularly for those who experience severe infections. Our work also underscores the importance of conducting longer follow-up studies in larger populations in order to understand the full spectrum of effects that Covid-19 can have on people,\" the statement said.\n Scientists around the world are studying the long-lasting effects of the virus, commonly referred to as \"long Covid\" symptoms.\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, joint pain and chest pain as the most commonly reported long-term symptoms. Others, such as difficulty with thinking and concentration -- known as \"brain fog,\" depression and headache, are also reported among coronavirus long-haulers.\n \"While most persons with Covid-19 recover and return to normal health, some patients can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness. Even people who are not hospitalized and who have mild illness can experience persistent or late symptoms,\" the US CDC says.\n A study published in the British Medical Journal in August found that around 10% of patients had a prolonged illness from Covid-19 lasting more than 12 weeks.\n But the Chinese study is the largest, with the longest follow-up duration, to investigate the long-term impact on discharged patients, according to its authors.\n The patients of the study, with a median age of 57, were all discharged between January 7 and May 29, 2020, from Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, a designated Covid-19 facility that treated the world's first known people to contract the disease from December 2019.\n In total, the study included 70% of all discharged Covid-19 patients in that period, after excluding those who died, who were unable to participate due to severe mental or physical conditions, and who declined to participate.\n All participants were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms. They also underwent physical examinations, a six-minute walking test and blood tests, the study said.\n Unexpectedly, 13% of patients who did not appear to have acute kidney injury while hospitalized exhibited signs of kidney malfunction.\n However, a team of researchers at the Institute of Pharmacological Research in Bergamo, Italy, who were not involved in the study, wrote in an accompanying commentary in The Lancet that the findings \"must be interpreted with caution\" as there were limits to the way it was measured.\n However, the findings on fatigue, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression fit in with previous research following patients who had a related coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and 2004, according to the Chinese researchers.\n A follow-up study of SARS survivors showed 40% of patients had chronic fatigue symptoms more than three years after infection, the researchers said.\n Another study showed that 38% of SARS survivors had evidence of lung damage 15 years later, the researchers at the Institute of Pharmacological Research noted in their commentary.\n China largely contained the initial coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan in March, and has been able to swiftly curb sporadic local outbreaks in its territory since then.\n But it is now facing the country's worst coronavirus flare-up in months in the northern province of Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, just weeks before the Lunar New Year festival -- the most important time for family reunion in China.\n Last week, the province rolled out mass coronavirus testing on 13 million people in the cities of Shijiazhuang and Xingtai, which identified 364 positive cases, Hebei officials said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon.\n Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital and epicenter of the ongoing outbreak, was placed under a strict lockdown last week. Residents have been barred from leaving the city, as major highways were blocked, train and bus stations closed and flights canceled.\n Within the city, public transport and schools have been suspended, and residential communities and villages are also closed off, with residents ordered to stay home for seven days after completing their coronavirus tests.\n On Sunday, Hebei province detected 82 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, with 77 reported in Shijiazhuang and five in Xingtai, according to China's National Health Commission.\n Local coronavirus infections are also being reported in several cities in northern China, including Beijing, and the provinces of Liaoning and Heilongjiang.\n In Beijing, an online ride-hailing driver was identified as an asymptomatic case on Saturday, prompting authorities to track down 144 passengers who had been in his car. Starting from Monday, all passengers must present a QR code from Beijing's Covid-19 health app on their smartphones, before they are allowed to get in any taxis or ride-hailing cars.",

        "body_text": "For millions of small businesses still struggling to make ends meet, they may now apply for a new, potentially forgivable federal loan.\n The US Treasury and the Small Business Administration said Wednesday that on January 15 the program would be open for businesses applying for a loan at 5,000 more lenders, including community banks, credit unions, and farm credit institutions. Then, on January 19, the program will be open for businesses applying at all PPP lenders, including the major banks.\n The latest Covid relief package signed into law at the end of December included $284 billion for additional lending to eligible businesses, including those that already received a loan months ago.\n The package also included measures intended to make PPP loans more flexible for all small businesses, more helpful to hard-hit restaurants and more accessible to micro businesses than it was in the first two rounds of lending.\n Here are six ways the program has changed for this latest round:\n No loan, however, may exceed $2 million, down from the previous cap of $10 million.\n Beyond mortgage interest, rent and utility payments, the loan now may be used to cover the costs of personal protective equipment and other expenses incurred to meet Covid restrictions, as well as certain operations, property damage and supplier costs.\n This should help many small businesses that got PPP loans during earlier lending rounds. A full 87% of the loans were below $150,000, according to the Small Business Administration.\n Businesses normally deduct their payroll and operating expenses from their gross income. Now, even if those expenses were largely paid for by the tax-free loan, they will still be deductible.\n For more information on the reopening of the program and changes to it, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration put out guidance here on Friday.",

        "title": "A plea to acting Attorney General Rosen: Stop all of this week's federal executions",
        "body_text": "Jeffrey D. Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. Mario Marazziti is part of the Community of Sant'Egidio, co-founder of the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, and author of Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Death Penalty (Seven Stories Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\nLast Wednesday's insurrection left five dead. More than 3,000 Americans are dying on average each day from Covid-19, partly because of  President Donald Trump's disregard for public health.  Less known is that Trump has also unleashed a mad rush of federal executions, with three more scheduled for this week at the Terre Haute federal prison facility in Indiana.\n This, even as demands rise for Trump's immediate departure from office. These rushed executions must be stopped so that the Department of Justice under President Joe Biden can review these cases and the federal policy on death sentences generally.\n Trump's frenzy of federal executions began last year. There had been no federal executions since 2003.  Since July, the federal government has executed 10 people, more than in any presidency since 1896. The federal spree took place in a year with a 37-year low in executions nationally, just seven by the states.\n If there was any lingering doubt about Trump's use of American institutions for his personal delusional motives, there should be none now. Trump's support for the unleashing of federal executions is a reflection of the same apparent glee that led Trump to pay for full-page ads calling for the state to adopt the death penalty after the infamous Central Park Five case in New York in 1989.\n Lisa Montgomery is scheduled for execution on Tuesday for murder. She would be the first woman to be executed on federal death row for a murder committed by a person that society should have given support and treatment since childhood, and never did. Court documents show that Montgomery herself was a victim of incest, child sex trafficking, gang rape, physical abuse and neglect, largely at the hands of family members, and  has resulted in \"incurable and significant psychiatric disabilities.\" Those who kept her in slavery for half her lifetime were never punished.\n Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be executed on Thursday for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of three women. Higgs did not personally kill the victims, and the person who did received life without parole.\n Corey Johnson is also scheduled for execution on Thursday for his involvement in the murder of seven people. His lawyers argued in a brief in December that he is intellectually disabled. \"When he was in his early twenties, achievement testing measured his grade-equivalent levels no higher than second grade in reading and writing. When he was last tested at age 45, Mr. Johnson was still at an elementary school level,\" his lawyers wrote. This is important to note because Johnson's co-defendant was spared the death penalty because of his intellectual disability.\n To be clear, we are not arguing that these three people haven't done terrible things. They have, but details of their cases should be enough not to rush their deaths.  While we oppose the death penalty as a matter of principle, those who favor it should never overlook powerful reasons to spare a life. The executions this week can and must be stopped.  Trump bent the Department of Justice to his bloody plans while it was under former Attorney General William Barr.  Now the last three executions are in the hands of acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, and could also be postponed by the warden of the Terre Haute federal prison complex, T. J. Watson.\n Each execution could also be a Covid-19 super-spreader event that puts at risk the guards, inmates, lawyers, journalists, relatives, observers, general population, and spiritual counsellors.  A fact that Watson is surely aware of, since a federal court recently stayed the executions at Terre Haute until Covid-19 protections could be put in place. In mid-December it was reported that Higgs and Johnson tested positive for the virus.\n The attorney general or the warden need only to say the word, and the scheduled executions will be postponed until the Biden administration.  To allow these executions to proceed at this moment would be a life-defining tragedy of acting Attorney General Rosen.\n We call on Rosen to put a halt to these judicial murders.  We call on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to call on the Department of Justice to desist, and to make it clear that it is the will of Congress that we have suffered far too many deaths as a result of decisions by Trump.  Justice requires that all three scheduled executions be stayed until President Biden and his attorney general can decide on these three cases and on federal death sentence policy generally.\n (Update: After this article was published, Lisa Montgomery was executed by lethal injection on Wednesday.)",

Deutsche Bank (DB) has decided to refrain from future business with the president and his company, a person familiar with the bank's thinking told CNN Business. The news was first reported by the New York Times.\n The Trump Organization owes Deutsche Bank approximately $340 million in the coming years, the person familiar with the bank's thinking said. A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, citing a prohibition on discussing potential client relationships.\n New York state criminal investigators looking into Trump's business practices have subpoenaed the bank about its lending relationship with the Trump Organization. Late last month the two private bankers at Deutsche Bank who worked most closely with Trump resigned their positions.\n On Monday, Signature Bank said it had started closing Trump's personal accounts and called for Trump to resign. The US bank also said it \"will not do business in the future with any members of Congress who voted to disregard the Electoral College.\"\n Some of the Trump properties could be particularly hard hit by last week's events, top among them the Trump hotel in the former post office building in Washington, DC. During the last four years businesses and foreign governments that wanted to curry favor with the Trump administration booked rooms or other events at the hotel.\n \"It could be that the opposite will be true now,\" said D'Antonio. \"Anyone going to DC on business would be crazy to stay at the Trump hotel unless all their business is with the Republican National Committee.\"\n Trump's contract to operate the hotel in the government-owned property could even come under attack. Critics have argued it was improper for him to be operating it during his administration. Last week's events could increase the calls on the government to end its contract with the Trump Organization.\n \"As we view it, for four years he violated the terms of that agreement by having a federal office holder benefit from that contract. There should be consequences of that,\" said Noah Bookbinder, executive director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group that has been a frequent critic of Trump and his businesses.\n Bookbinder said that Trump was already likely to lose some business at his hotels, including his Washington property, when he is no longer president. But the actions of last week only accelerated companies deciding to no longer do business with Trump, Bookbinder said.\n \"I think unquestionably he would have held on to more of it without last week's events,\" he said. \"If he had emerged from this as the power center for the Republican party and the likely candidate in 2024, there would have been a lot of incentive for the RNC and others to keep holding events at his hotels.\"\n Bookbinder said the violence at the Capitol could also give businesses that have contracts with the Trump Organization a way to get out of those commitments.\n \"It's standard for a lot of contracts to have outs if there is illegal or immoral conduct,\" he said. \"My guess is that a lot of companies will be eager to take advantage of those kinds of legal openings.\"\n Other properties with the Trump name on them could be at risk going forward. Many of those agreements are marketing deals, in which he licenses the use of his name -- and brings in big bucks for doing so.\n \"Those branding deals were worth millions to him. Not having them would be significant,\" D'Antonio said.\n But it's not clear how long lasting the backlash against Trump from last week's riot will last.\n \"There are many times in recent years that it seemed the president crossed a line and yet things quickly went back to normal,\" said Bookbinder. \"I suspect that won't be the case here.\"\n Trump does leave office with tens of millions of fervent fans, D'Antonio said, opening up the possibility for new business ventures and new sources of revenue, even if he's closed the door on other business relationships.\n There was a lot of speculation before last Wednesday that Trump would start his own media company upon leaving office. Despite the blowback from the Capitol attack, that's still a possibility D'Antonio said.\n Conservative networks OANN and Newsmax have picked up viewers since the election from Trump fans who felt that Fox News was not being supportive enough of the president. If he were to have a show on either network it would instantly become their best rated program, D'Antonio said.\n \"How long would broadcasters or others be able to resist the money?\" he said.\n And there is a chance he could start a streaming network of his own, even if he doesn't go on a cable system that might be resistant to air a Trump TV network. If he attracted 7 million subscribers, or less than 10% of his vote total, and they paid $5.99 a month, that would be more than $500 million in annual subscriber revenue, D'Antonio said.\n So it's possible that even if Trump severely damaged his brand last week, his overall business outlook is in better shape today than it was before he started his campaign for president in 2015, just because of the loyalty he's built up with a large part of the country over the last five years.\n \"I don't know that the demographic of his absolute die hard base is a good fit for his high end businesses,\" D'Antonio said. \"They can't pay hundreds of dollars a night to stay at some of his properties or belong to his country clubs. But the whole campaign was started as a branding exercise. I think in terms of mass market, he's better off.\"\n \u2014 Charles Riley contributed reporting.",

        "body_text": "Facebook will begin removing all content that mentions the phrase \"stop the steal,\" a full 69 days after Election Day.\n The social media giant said in a blog post that it will ramp up enforcement against the phrase because it was used by those who participated in last week's riots at the US Capitol.\n \"With continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday's violence in DC, we're taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration,\" Guy Rosen, Facebook's VP of integrity, wrote in a post about the company's preparation for Inauguration Day.\n On Election Day, the slogan \"stop the steal\" quickly became a rallying cry among President Donald Trump's supporters, many of whom were egged on by Trump himself and his allies with false claims of election fraud. As a hashtag, its origins date back years, according to Facebook's CrowdTangle analysis tool, but it became wildly popular in recent months as a gathering place for conspiracy theories about the election outcome.\n Facebook added that it will continue its weeks-long ban on all US political advertising, including by Trump, whose account Facebook suspended indefinitely on Jan. 7. Rosen said Facebook rolled out new \"emergency measures\" last week -- for example, Rosen said, group administrators will increasingly be required to review posts before they can be published, and comments that contain hate speech or incitement may be removed from group posts entirely.\n The blog post comes as tech companies confront mounting skepticism about whether they did too little, too late to prevent the violence that swept the Capitol \u2014 and that continues to be a risk heading into President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next week.",

        "title": "US reports over 200K new Covid-19 cases every single day for a week straight",
        "body_text": "The US set a grim milestone Monday as the country recorded over 200,000 new Covid-19 cases for seven straight days, according to John Hopkins University.\n The nation has never hit this milestone before, JHU data shows. Over the last week, the US has tallied over 1.7 million total Covid-19 cases and over 20,000 deaths.\n On top of that, Covid-19 hospitalizations have surpassed 100,000 for the last 40 straight days and officials are trying to ramp up the pace of vaccinations across the country.\n \"We really need to get this vaccine out more quickly, because this is really our only tool,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n Experts have long said the best combined defense against surging cases includes preventative measures such as masks and social distancing -- as well as widespread vaccination.\n Nearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine against coronavirus in the US and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n \"We don't have a public health infrastructure for mass vaccination,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n Many states are diverging from vaccine prioritization guidelines set by the CDC, according to a report issued Monday by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy.\n \"On some level it's understandable and on some level, the more people that are getting vaccine, especially two doses of vaccine -- that's more people who then aren't going to transmit this virus, and we get a greater and greater level of herd immunity,\" Offit said.\n As of Monday morning, 35.3% of doses distributed had been administered, compared with 30.2% on Friday.\n Health officials had hoped to get 20 million people vaccinated by the start of the new year, but the administration of vaccines has met with delays and roadblocks.\n \"We need to acknowledge that it's not working,\" Gottlieb said Sunday of the vaccination plan. \"We need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get that out to patients.\"\n Gottlieb's warning came just days after the US crossed a grim threshold for the first time -- reporting more than 4,000 new Covid-19 deaths in a single day on Thursday. Since the pandemic began, more than 376,000 people have died in the US and more than 22.6 million people have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n As the surge ratchets up infection, hospitalization and fatality numbers across the country, officials are working to make it easier to access vaccinations.\n California Gov. Gavin Newsom promised Monday to have one million state health care workers, nursing home residents and staff vaccinated by week's end. This \"all hands on deck\" push to get the vaccine to more vulnerable residents comes as the state continues to see an unrelenting surge of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths.\n As of Monday, the state has received more than 2.9 million vaccine doses, but administered about 783,000 of them, amounting to just 27% given.\n The announcement came the same day California surpassed 30,000 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. California is one of only three states to reach the milestone.\n In order to loosen the backlog, California plans to use Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Padres Stadium in San Diego and CalExpo in Sacramento as mass vaccination sites, and Newsom said more large-scale sites will be announced in the coming days.\n In New York, more vaccination sites have opened, including more 24/7 sites in New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that he's confident the city will reach its goal of administering 1 million doses by the end of January.\n On Monday, New York state expanded the people eligible for the vaccine to include those 75 and older, first responders, teachers and school workers, public-facing grocery store workers, transit workers and people living and working in homeless shelters.\n New Jersey will have a network of about 300 vaccination sites across the state to assist with its Covid-19 vaccination plan, state officials said at a news conference.\n \"Our objective and aspiration is 70% of the adult population in the state within six months, that's 4.7 million New Jerseyans,\" said Gov. Phil Murphy, speaking at Rowan College at Gloucester County, one of six \"mega-site\" vaccination locations.\n The Georgia Department of Public Health launched a Covid vaccine locator website in hopes of increasing access in the state that has administered the fewest vaccines per capita, according to the CDC Covid Data Tracker.\n The website will not allow for scheduling but will provide contact information for people to schedule vaccinations once available, according to a news release.\n The CDC updated its guidance Monday, saying there's no maximum time between a first and second coronavirus shot.\n \"You should get your second shot: for the Pfizer-BioNTech 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first shot; for the Moderna 1 month (or 28 days) after your first shot,\" the CDC said.\n \"You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. \"\n The World Health Organization said last week that people can wait for as long as six weeks between doses. However, Pfizer and Moderna say they don't have any data on how long people can wait between doses and still get good protection.\n More than 28,400 new Covid-19 deaths have been reported in just the first 11 days of 2021, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\n At this rate, more people could die from Covid-19 in January than in any other month of this pandemic. December had a record high of 77,431 deaths due to Covid-19.\n In hard-hit Arizona, the crisis will get worse, said Joe K. Gerald, associate professor at the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health.\n \"We should expect to set new records for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the coming weeks. Policy action is urgently needed to mitigate the worst possible outcome,\" Gerald wrote.\n He also expressed concern about \"the inevitable arrival of the more highly transmissible\" strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the United Kingdom and has spread to at least 10 US states.\n As of Monday, there have been 72 cases of the new variant, including at least 32 in California, 22 in Florida, five in Minnesota, four in New York, three in Colorado, two in Connecticut, and one case each in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia.\n \"If it gathers a foothold, it will accelerate, lengthen, and deepen Arizona's outbreak,\" Gerald said.\n On Monday, Arizona set a record with 4,997 people hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons, according to the state's data dashboard. Before the winter, the state's record for hospitalizations was 3,517 on  July 13, 2020. The state surpassed that record December 11 and the tally of patients has, with a few exceptions, risen every day since then.\n Arizona recently opened a 24/7 site to administer vaccines. The operation at the home of the Arizona Cardinals NFL team is being overseen by the National Guard. Adjutant Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire said at a news conference more resources are needed to implement the idea across the state.\n President-elect Joe Biden received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware.\n He received the first dose last month live on national television as part of an effort by his incoming administration to reassure the country of the vaccine's safety.\n The President-elect expressed his confidence in the vaccine and encouraged Americans to receive one as soon as it becomes available to them.\n The incoming administration is planning to \"carefully\" ensure people get their second Covid-19 vaccine doses, according to Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden's Covid-19 advisory board and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n \"The incoming administration is planning very carefully to make sure that that second shot is delivered on time,\" Osterholm said in a Washington Post Live event.\n Meanwhile, a new analysis found that states are increasingly abandoning guidelines from the CDC and taking their own approaches to giving people coronavirus vaccine.\n \"Overall, we find states are increasingly diverging from CDC guidance and from each other, suggesting that access to COVID-19 vaccines in these first months of the U.S. vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives,\" the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report.\n \"In addition, timelines vary significantly across states, regardless of priority group, resulting in a vaccine roll-out labyrinth across the country.\"\n US Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat, said Monday that she has tested positive for Covid-19.\n A statement from her office said Coleman \"believes she was exposed during protective isolation in the US Capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots. As reported by multiple news outlets, a number of members within the space ignored instructions to wear masks.\"\n CNN has previously reported that six House Republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the US Capitol insurrection. It's unclear whether Watson Coleman was in the safe location with those members.\n CNN's Holly Yan, Hollie Silverman, Naomi Thomas, Cheri Mossburg, Jenn Selva and Evan McMorris-Santoro contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Years of bad leadership from Trump, and now no leadership at all",
        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nThe more new video we see of the storming of the Capitol by Trump-inspired rioters, the more aggravating it becomes.\n Specifically, the violent dragging of a Capitol Police officer from his perch into the mob to be beaten is incredible and sickening.\n The Capitol Police officer distracting charging rioters from the Senate floor is heroic and affirming.\n \"Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the US Capitol from 17 January through 20 January,\" it says.\n The bulletin, which was circulated after rioters stormed the US Capitol last week, also suggests there are threats of an \"uprising\" if President Donald Trump is removed via the 25th Amendment before Inauguration Day.\n The FBI and Department of Justice have promised accountability and the FBI has asked for the public's help identifying the rioter who brought a massive Confederate flag into the building, among many others.\n Hundreds could ultimately be charged, but we have not seen charges for crimes against the nation, like insurrection. At least not yet. Perhaps these more consequential charges will follow.\n Rather than focus on any of these pressing issues, Trump is going Tuesday to Alamo, Texas -- not to be confused with The Alamo -- to talk about the border wall as his last stand.\n After years of bad leadership from Trump, we're learning what it's like to have no leadership at all -- and during a deadly pandemic killing thousands every day, a botched vaccine rollout and an attempt to overthrow the next government.\n Jake Tapper pressed National Guard Chief Gen. Daniel Hokanson about the allegation. He tried to explain why it took hours to mobilize the troops. This gets awkward. Watch it.\n Nobody seems to agree on what happened.\n The Pentagon argued Friday night in a timeline that DC and Capitol Police didn't request enough backup beforehand and specifically didn't want armed National Guardsmen involved.\n The result was thousands of rioters swarming 1,400 Capitol Police officers and Sund said he thinks pipe bombs were set nearby to distract officers as the main assault force approached the West Front.\n \"As soon as they hit the fence line, the fight was on,\" Sund said. \"Violent confrontations from the start. They came with riot helmets, gas masks, shields, pepper spray, fireworks, climbing gear \u2014 climbing gear! \u2014 explosives, metal pipes, baseball bats. I have never seen anything like it in 30 years of events in Washington.\"\n This story of the Pentagon version vs. the Capitol and DC police is going to continue.\n One thing is for sure: This city is going to be crawling with thousands of armed police and National Guardsmen on Inauguration Day.\n DC's mayor wants you to stay away.\n I spent a good portion of the day distracted by the calls to invoke the 14th Amendment against lawmakers, and potentially Trump, for their roles inciting the insurrection.\n Enacted in the wake of the Civil War to impose national standards of rights -- natural-born citizenship, equal protection under the laws -- the amendment also prohibits people who have taken an oath to protect the Constitution from serving in office after they've engaged in \"insurrection or rebellion\" against the country.\n There's an effort, led by freshman Rep. Cori Bush, to apply it against sitting members of Congress, like Rep. Mo Brooks, who spoke at Trump's rally, or even Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz, the senators who gave objections to the Electoral College life in the Senate.\n It could be invoked against Trump if he tried to run again.\n It would be a novel use of the amendment, Indiana University law professor Gerard Magliocca told me. He, conveniently, has just written a paper on the amnesty from the 14th Amendment that Congress ultimately gave Confederates after the Civil War.\n He said we can't entirely separate that from what happened last week.\n \"It's not totally remote from what just happened. There weren't even people with Confederate flags that entered the Capitol during the Civil War. So there is a kind of comparison you could make -- this (the 14th Amendment) is an outgrowth of the Civil War and now you see the emblems of the Civil War being used in this event on Wednesday.\"\n Read the full story here.\n Here's the argument from Frank Bowman and Brian Kalt, the overall impeachment historical experts, in The Washington Post, that Trump can and maybe should be impeached after he leaves office, which is technically called a \"late impeachment.\"\n \"The two most important reasons to pursue a late impeachment are, first, to deter presidents' misbehavior during their waning days in office, and second, to permanently remove them from public life if their conduct suggests they would pose a continuing danger to the country if they ever returned to a position of national authority.\"\n Even an impeached and banned Trump could have some power, writes CNN's Fredreka Schouten. He's still got all that money he's been raising off the fiction of election fraud. And he could continue to do so in the future.",

The number of new infections, the number of hospital admissions, and the deaths that continue to take place come far higher than it has ever been since the first case was recorded in our country in March of 2020,\" Ramaphosa said in a live national address.\n In addition to extending the existing measures, Ramaphosa announced that 20 land borders will be closed until February 15. The closures will have several exceptions such as those traveling for medical emergencies, he said.\n Ramaphosa said that the speed and intensity of the second wave in South Africa is due to the 501.v2 variant discovered by genomic scientists late last year.\n \"We do know that this new variant of the virus tends to spread much faster than the earlier variant. This explains that many more people have become infected in a far shorter space of time,\" he said, adding that there was no evidence that the new strain caused people to get sicker.\n Ramaphosa said the restrictions will be reassessed when the current peak of infections eases.\n South Africa has reported at least 1,246,643 Covid-19 cases, including 33,579 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.",

        "title": "Democrats delaying impeachment is totally nonsensical",
        "body_text": "House Democrats want you to believe these two things -- at the same time:\n 1) The threat posed by Donald Trump is so dire that, if Vice President Mike Pence won't remove him from office this week, then they must immediately vote to impeach the President (again).\n 2) In order to avoid cluttering Joe Biden's first days in office with an impeachment trial, they may wait for up to 100 days to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.\n If those two ideas seem directly contradictory to you, well, good! It means you are paying attention. Because they are directly contradictory.\n It can't be both incredibly urgent that the House impeach Trump with just more than a week left in his term AND totally cool for the House to sit on the articles of impeachment until the Biden administration gets off the ground.\n Right? Right.\n The logic breakdown here is obvious if you spend more than five seconds thinking about it. Which is why some House Democrats voiced opposition to that sort of delay on Monday.\n \"My view is no,\" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Maryland) when asked about delaying sending any impeachment articles to the Senate.\n \"This is urgent,\" said Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, who co-authored the impeachment language in the House. \"This President represents a real danger to our democracy and, you know, obviously I'm not in control of the Senate, but they ought to come back immediately respond to this.\"\n Why the contradictory messaging? Because what the average House member wants is entirely different from what Biden and his incoming administration want.\n Biden wants to get Trump in the rearview mirror as quickly as possible so he can focus on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and his own major policy initiatives.\n The rank-and-file in the House -- especially liberals -- want action NOW on Trump for his incitement of the crowd that stormed the US Capitol last week.",

        "title": "Doctors test popular anti-depressant to see if it fights off Covid-19 ",
        "body_text": "Doctors are running a clinical trial to see if a popular anti-depressant might keep someone from becoming severely ill with Covid-19.\n The researchers at Washington University of St. Louis are recruiting 1,100 people in the beginning stages of Covid-19 to test out the drug fluvoxamine, also known as Luvox.\n While an anti-depressant may seem like an unlikely candidate to fight Covid-19, a small study in November indicated it might have some success, and it's been known for years that modern anti-depressants, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation plays a key role in Covid-19, resulting in complications such as blood clots and swollen \"Covid toes.\"\n In order to get results in weeks instead of months -- an important time difference while thousands are dying of Covid-19 every day - researchers are conducting the study in an unorthodox way. They're mailing the medicine to patients' homes around the country, and patients will monitor their health and report back to study staff, instead of having patients go to the researchers.\n Lenze said it has gone well so far -- with one little hiccup that was easily overcome.\n \"I have a funny story about a participant in New Hampshire. We shipped him the study medication, and he called saying it got left in a snow drift a quarter mile from his house,\" said Dr. Eric Lenze, the study's principal investigator. \"He asked if it was still OK to take it, and we said yes, it's fine. I'm a veteran of clinical trials, and that was a new one for me.\"\n The study started in December and has recruited a few dozen participants so far. The researchers say they could have results by February.\n In the study published in November in the Journal of the American Medical Association, among 80 patients took fluvoxamine, none developed low oxygen levels. Of 72 patients who took a placebo -- a pill that does nothing - six developed low oxygen levels.\n One of the patients who took fluvoxamine was hospitalized with dehydration. Four of the patients who took a placebo were hospitalized with Covid-19 related symptoms, and one ended up in the intensive care unit on a ventilator. The researchers did not look to see whether the hospitalization differences between the two groups was statistically significant.\n \"Because of study limitations, these findings need to be interpretated as hypothesis generating rather than as a demonstration of efficacy,\" the authors wrote in the November study.\n Lenze and his colleagues are currently doing the larger study because the earlier study was too small to make definitive conclusions.\n The Washington University researchers are looking for participants who have tested positive for Covid-19 and have had symptoms for a week or less.\n Several aspects of the study are unorthodox.\n The researchers won't physically check the patients. Instead, along with the study drugs, the researchers send the participants a thermometer, blood pressure cuff, and pulse oximeter, a device placed on the fingertip to measure blood oxygen levels. Patients record their measurements on the study's website, and research staff call patients daily during the early part of the trial.\n This new way of doing clinical trials has already proven to be efficient.\n The Washington University researchers modeled their study on one done this spring by Dr. David Boulware at the University of Minnesota, who shipped hydroxychloroquine and placebo pills to participants all over the US. Within a matter of weeks, the study revealed that hydroxychloroquine, a drug hyped by President Trump, didn't work against Covid-19.\n \"The story of how quickly they got that done is extraordinary,\" Lenze said. \"We borrowed their techniques for our trial and they're working well.\"",

        "body_text": "Officials in South Korea have withdrawn recently published guidelines for pregnant women, following a backlash over their use of outdated sexist stereotypes.\n The guidelines also said pregnant women \"should prepare undergarments, socks, shirts, handkerchiefs and outers in the drawer for the husband and children to wear for 3 to 7 days while you're at the hospital,\" and advised buying a hairband \"so that you don't look disheveled, as you won't able to wash your hair for a while.\"\n While some parts of the guidelines remain online, the points that came in for criticism were recently deleted. However, screenshots of the original version continue to circulate on social media.\n The advice also suggested women lose weight by performing household chores such as washing dishes and cleaning.\n \"Extending your hand forward when wiping the floor will help with stretching the back, shoulder and arm muscles,\" read the guidelines.\n \"Hang out clothes that you wore before getting married or small-sized clothes that you'd like to wear after giving birth and look at them when you want to eat more than necessary or want to skip workout,\" they continued.\n Shocked South Koreans started a petition asking that the official responsible for the post be punished and make a public apology.\n Others expressed their outrage on Twitter.\n \"The person who wrote that, the one who revised it, even the Seoul city manager who posted it. They're all mad,\" wrote one.\n \"It's not even any individual that posted it, it's Seoul city's Pregnancy and Childbirth Information Center... I wonder what they think of women and pregnant women,\" wrote a third. \"I hate this country.\"\n Seoul city government declined to comment when contacted by CNN.",

        "title": "'Extraordinary' corporate revolt over campaign donations shakes political world ",
        "body_text": "Some of the country's largest firms are scrambling to distance themselves from last week's insurrection at the US Capitol by freezing or reassessing their political donations -- sending tremors through a political system that has relied for decades on the predictable flow of corporate financial support.\n Companies such as Google, Coca-Cola and UPS all have pledged to suspend contributions across the board, while others took aim specifically at lawmakers they viewed as complicit in President Donald Trump's effort to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's election.\n \"This is extraordinary. It's corporate America saying, 'Enough,' \" said Richard Levick, the CEO of LEVICK, a Washington-based public relations firm. \"Capitalism is trying to ride to the rescue of a political system that doesn't have an answer\" for Trump's conduct.\n The Democrat-led House of Representatives plans to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for \"incitement of insurrection,\" but convicting Trump would be a tall order in the narrowly divided Senate.\n Business PACs are significant players in politics, accounting for more than $360 million in federal contributions during the 2020 cycle -- with about 57% of the money flowing to GOP candidates, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political donations.\n \"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Fred Wertheimer, who runs the watchdog group Democracy 21, of the corporate retreat in the wake of the riot by pro-Trump supporters. \"The key is: Is this temporary or is this real?\"\n \"To do this for two or three weeks, and after the heat falls off, go back to business as usual isn't going to solve anyone's problems,\" he added.\n House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, the new chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, were among those in Congress who objected to the presidential election results. The backlash among the business community to that vote after the Trump-incited attack on the Capitol could impair Republicans' fundraising effort to flip both the House and Senate in 2022.\n \"Rick Scott will spend the next two years at the NRSC explaining his vote to the donors,\" said a GOP strategist involved in congressional races who requested anonymity.\n Chris Hartline, a NRSC spokesman, told CNN, \"We have no interest in engaging with nonsense from DC consultants who have no idea what they're talking about and I have no intention of responding to anonymous quotes, ever.\"\n \"Rick Scott will raise a ton of money,\" he added. \"He will help build a strong grassroots operation. He will stay on message. And we will win back the Senate majority in 2022.\"\n Wertheimer and others in the campaign-finance reform world said the corporate reexamination could provide a needed push to overhaul election laws and center them on small-dollar contributions. A measure advanced by Democrats, who will soon control both congressional chambers and the White House, would give federal candidates as much as a 6-to-1 match of public funds for small donations.\n Democrats have become increasingly adept at attracting small-dollar donations: In the 2020 election cycle alone, nearly 15 million grassroots donors contributed a staggering $4.8 billion to Democratic groups and candidates up and down the ballot via the online fundraising platform ActBlue.\n Other reformers on Monday blasted companies that opted to freeze donations to Republicans and Democrats alike -- given that only Republicans voted against certifying Trump's decisive White House loss.\n \"These corporations' announcements are nothing more than a PR stunt -- and a bad one at that,\" Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United, said in a statement. \"There's only one party -- and specifically 147 members of Congress -- who incited the violent and deadly assault on our Capitol,\" she added.\n At least one firm, greeting card maker Hallmark, has asked for refunds, requesting that two GOP senators who objected last week, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas, return their PAC donations.\n In announcing their decisions, many companies described their actions as only temporary suspensions to review their political giving. The chemical company Dow, however, promised a more lasting punishment for those who backed Trump in Congress. It said it would cut off donations to lawmakers who voted against certifying the election for the entire two-year terms of the House members involved and the six-year terms of senators.\n The Lincoln Project -- the group of Republican and former Republican strategists responsible for searing ads opposing Trump's reelection -- is pledging to keep the pressure on companies that bankroll the politicians it views as backing Trump's actions, along with those that try to add loyalists to the President to their corporate boards.\n \"If you are a member of the Trump administration right now ... and you don't take action on what are obviously illegal and dangerous things that Trump is doing, then when you go out to get a seat on a corporate board, people are going to remember that,\" Rick Wilson, a Lincoln Project co-founder, told CNN in a recent interview.\n \"We are going to be very diligent about making sure actions have consequences,\" he said.\n Even more important than halting contributions is the new message that corporate America delivered to Washington this week, said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University of Albany and an expert on campaign money.\n \"The fact that major organizations are saying that they are disgusted matters,\" he said. \"This is a public statement about what they believe is right and wrong.\"\n This story has been updated with comments from Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson.\n CNN's Alex Rogers contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Mayor urges people to avoid DC as Secret Service begins inauguration prep early",
        "body_text": "Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday urged Americans to avoid the city during President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next week and the Secret Service has been instructed to begin its preparations for the inauguration ahead of schedule.\n Meanwhile, the National Guard has plans to have up to 15,000 National Guard troops to meet current and future requests for the inauguration, Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Monday. The dramatic increase in troops comes as law enforcement in the nation's capital and around the country brace for further extremist violence amid the transition of power.\n Speaking at a news conference Monday, Bowser, a Democrat, stressed that she was concerned about more violent actors potentially coming to the city in the run-up to the inauguration, saying, \"if I'm scared of anything, it's for our democracy, because we have very extreme factions in our country that are armed and dangerous.\"\n \"Trumpism won't die on January 20,\" said Bowser, who has asked Trump and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf to declare a pre-disaster declaration for DC.\n \"Our goals right now are to encourage Americans to participate virtually and to protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its grounds on January 6,\" Bowser said.\n The White House said in a statement Monday night that Trump approved the emergency declaration requested by Bowser.\n \"Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that an emergency exists in the District of Columbia and ordered Federal assistance to supplement the District's response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from the 59th Presidential Inauguration from January 11 to January 24, 2021,\" the statement read.\n Bowser is also asking the Trump administration to cancel public gathering permits between January 10 and 24.\n The emergency declaration request by Bowser would unlock additional funding for the city's security efforts for the inauguration. The mayor ultimately assessed in a letter to Trump over the weekend that despite the security assets the city has in place, \"significant preparedness gaps remain that cannot be remedied without this emergency declaration and direct federal assistance.\"\n Bowser told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that she will also ask the Department of Homeland Security to begin a \"national special security event\" timeline sooner than planned, as well as include the US Capitol in their coverage area for the inauguration.\n Wolf said on Monday that he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin the National Special Security Event operations for Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, instead of January 19, the day before Biden is set to be inaugurated.\n \"In light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration and at the recommendation of Secret Service Director James Murray, I have instructed the U.S. Secret Service to begin the National Special Security Event operations for the 2021 Inauguration effective Wednesday, January 13th instead of January 19th,\" Wolf said in a statement. \"Our federal, state, and local partners will continue to coordinate their plans and position resources for this important event.\"\n The preparations come as the FBI is warning that there will be protests around the country this weekend.\n The bureau has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington in the days leading up to Biden's Inauguration, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN.\n \"Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the US Capitol from 17 January through 20 January,\" the bulletin states.\n Last month, Biden's camp urged people not to travel to DC for the inauguration, citing the worsening coronavirus pandemic. The scaled-back festivities will instead feature a virtual program to allow Americans to participate from home.\n The National Park Service also announced Monday that it will close the Washington Monument to visitors for more than two weeks, a time period that includes the inauguration.\n The park service said it also \"may institute temporary closures of public access to roadways, parking areas and restrooms within the National Mall and Memorial Parks if conditions warrant, to protect public safety and park resources.\"\n A senior defense official told CNN on Monday that National Guard troops who are already earmarked for the inauguration are beginning to arrive, and the plan is to have 10,000 in the city by Saturday.\n There is a full rehearsal with troops this week in DC. The Justice Department command center will be extra robust with virtually every Cabinet department and law enforcement agency plugging in, the official said.\n Currently there 6,200 National Guard members who already been mobilized in the wake of last week's attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump supporters.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting and background information.\n CNN's Ali Main, Gregory Wallace, Pete Muntean and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has announced that he is declining the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he was scheduled to receive from President Donald Trump on Thursday.\n Belichick cited the \"tragic events of last week\" as leading to his decision. Pro-Trump rioters rampaged in the US Capitol last Wednesday. Five people died as a result of the chaos, including a US Capitol Police officer. House Democrats want to impeach Trump, accusing him of \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n \"Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,\" Belichick said in a statement. \"Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award. Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy.\"\n A White House official told CNN the White House was made aware of the decision.\n Belichick has been the Patriots' head coach since 2000 and has won six Super Bowls, a NFL record for a head coach.\n In 2016, he wrote a letter of support to Trump. He told reporters after Trump gushed about the letter: \"Our friendship goes back many years. Anybody who spends more than five minutes with me knows I'm not a political person. My comments are not politically motivated. I have a friendship with Donald.\"\n Still, Belichick had faced repeated calls to decline the Presidential Medal of Freedom given the President's response to the US Capitol breach.\n Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern told CNN earlier Monday that Belichick should \"refuse it.\"\n \"This President has made a mockery of the Presidential Medal of Freedom,\" he said. \"Look at who he is giving it to in the last weeks -- people like Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan -- I mean, please. Bill Belichick should do the right thing and say: 'No thanks.'\"\n Several people close to Trump have noted that, as his time in office comes to an end, one of the things he'll likely miss the most is not the work of the presidency but the trappings that come with it: the motorcades, rides on Marine One, tours of the Lincoln Bedroom given to dinner guests, a constant press corps at his side -- but also Medal of Freedom ceremonies.\n Trump often delights in them and has done so for multiple friends, political donors and athletes over the last four years.\n Belichick concluded his statement Monday acknowledging, \"I also represent my family and the New England Patriots team.\"\n \"One of the most rewarding things in my professional career took place in 2020 when, through the great leadership within our team, conversations about social justice, equality and human rights moved to the forefront and became actions,\" he said.\n \"Continuing those efforts while remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information Monday.\n CNN's Jim Acosta, Paul LeBlanc, Kaitlan Collins, Maegan Vazquez and David Close contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Sales of unapologetically ugly Crocs soar due to Covid",
        "body_text": "Crocs' bittersweet moment has arrived in the midst of a global pandemic. The foam clog, derided by many for being \"ugly,\" expects 2020 to be a record sales year.\n On Monday, Crocs raised its fourth-quarter (ended Dec. 31) outlook and full-year outlook for 2021, now forecasting fourth quarterly year-over-year revenue to have increased about 55% to between $407 and $410 million, up from its previous estimate of a 20% to 30% increase.\n The company expects sales to have increased over 12% in 2020, to a record $1.38 billion, up from its previous forecast of about 5% to 7% growth. It also anticipates sales growth of 20% to 25% in 2021. Crocs has not yet released the date of its fourth-quarter results.\n Investors cheered the news, lifting Crocs  (CROX)shares up over 12% to $74.91 on the Nasdaq.\n \"Amidst a global pandemic in 2020, we will deliver the strongest revenue in Crocs' history,\" Crocs CEO Andrew Rees said in a statement. \"Our brand momentum is exceptional, and we anticipate another record year in 2021.\"\n \"We definitely benefited from consumer casualization,\" said Rees, adding that the clogs are also easy to clean and sanitize, thereby enhancing their pandemic-time appeal. Looking ahead, he said value and comfort will continue to be important for shoppers.\n More younger consumers also gravitated to the brand during the pandemic, said Rees.\n \"They were younger, predominantly female consumers. This was a big driver of growth in North America. As the year progressed, it broadened to new younger male consumers,\" he said.\n A couple of quirky collaborations, too, likely helped sell millennial and TikTok-loving Gen Z'ers on the clogs. In 2020, Crocs teamed up with a number of artists and brands, including Post Malone, Justin Bieber and fast-food chain KFC on special edition collections. Its glow-in-the-dark collaboration with Latin trap artist Bad Bunny quickly sold out after its September launch.",

        "title": "Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf resigns; FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor to take over",
        "body_text": "Chad Wolf is resigning as the acting secretary of Homeland Security, he said in a letter to the department Monday obtained by CNN.\n Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor will be the new acting secretary, taking over in the wake of the US Capitol attack and as the national security apparatus prepares for possible violence leading up to Inauguration Day.\n \"I am saddened to take this step, as it was my intention to serve the Department until the end of this Administration,\" Wolf wrote, citing ongoing litigation challenging the validity of his appointment.\n \"Unfortunately, this action is warranted by recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as Acting Secretary. These events and concerns increasingly serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power,\" Wolf added.\n Wolf was in the chief role at the department in an acting capacity for 14 months. His tenure has repeatedly come up in litigation against the Trump administration's immigration actions, most recently last week regarding asylum limits.\n Wolf is the latest Cabinet secretary to resign in recent days, though his letter did not cite last week's riots. Betsy DeVos, who served as education secretary, and Elaine Chao, who was transportation secretary, have also resigned.\n House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson called the timing of Wolf's resignation \"questionable,\" citing the concerns about the legality of his appointment.\n \"He has chosen to resign during a time of national crisis and when domestic terrorists may be planning additional attacks on our government. Unlike others, he is apparently not leaving the Trump Administration on principle,\" the Mississippi Democrat said, adding that Wolf's number two, Ken Cuccinelli, should also resign over questions about his authority.\n Heading into a week with the FBI warning of warning of possible armed protests at all 50 state capitols and at the US Capitol, almost all the key national security agencies are being run by acting leaders, including the Department of Justice and Department of Defense. DHS will now have a new chief with only nine days until Inauguration Day.\n Before announcing he was stepping down Monday, Wolf said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin National Special Security Event operations for the  inauguration on Wednesday instead of January 19, citing in part \"events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration.\"\n Last week, Wolf urged President Donald Trump and all elected officials to condemn the violence on Capitol Hill in a sharply worded statement, while vowing to stay in his position until President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\n \"What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening. While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends,\" Wolf said. \"This is unacceptable.\"\n On Thursday, it was revealed that the White House had withdrawn Wolf's official nomination to the secretary post, sparking concerns among DHS officials about whether Wolf could legally stay, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n Last Friday, DHS legal counsel spoke to the Office of Legal Counsel about the withdrawal and the legal implications for the secretary role, according to another source.\n Wolf's legitimacy has been a struggle for the department and has threatened to derail policies and other actions put in place during his tenure.\n Former DHS General Counsel John Mitnick, who served in the Trump administration, wrote that the withdrawal of Wolf's nomination \"raises the issue of whether he \"can continue to perform the functions of the Secretary.\"\n \"Chaos to the last,\" Mitnick tweeted last week.\n Wolf has been serving as chief of the Department of Homeland Security -- the third largest federal department -- since November 2019 after the resignation of his predecessor, Kevin McAleenan.\n In late August, weeks into the unrest in Portland, Oregon, Trump announced his intention to nominate Wolf to serve as Homeland Security secretary -- a surprising maneuver given Trump's preference to have Cabinet officials serve as acting because, he says, it gives him \"more flexibility.\" DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed secretary since April 2019.\n The nomination came on the heels of a Government Accountability Office report that found the appointments of Wolf and his deputy Cuccinelli were invalid.\n While the Senate Homeland Security Committee cleared the way for a Senate confirmation vote in the fall, it did not come for a floor vote, leaving Wolf to continue serving in an acting capacity.\n His tenure has repeatedly come up in litigation against the administration's immigration actions. Wolf's appointment was notably cited in a challenge against new rules limiting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n In November, a federal judge found Wolf had not been legally serving as acting Homeland Security secretary when he signed rules limiting applications and renewals for DACA, which shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation, and said those rules are now invalid. The program -- which Trump pledged to terminate -- was later restored.\n In a previous attempt to self-correct the succession order, DHS had Gaynor, who is the Senate-confirmed FEMA administrator, temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf's legitimacy as acting chief of the department. Under one interpretation, Gaynor would be the lawfully serving acting secretary based on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n According to his FEMA bio, Gaynor, who was confirmed last January, has more than 11 years of experience in emergency management. Under his tenure, the agency juggled natural disasters as well as response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n Gaynor told his workforce he will assume the role of acting Homeland Security secretary until January 20, when Biden is inaugurated, according to a message obtained by CNN.\n FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton will serve as the senior official performing the duties of the FEMA administrator, Gaynor said, until the next administrator is confirmed.\n This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "source": "cnn",
        "title": "What's the 14th Amendment and how does it work?",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump did not act alone in provoking a mob to storm the US Capitol and stop the counting of Electoral College votes.\n While Democrats pursue efforts to use either the 25th Amendment or impeachment to remove him from office in his final full week as President, they're also considering how to deal with senators and congressmen who acted with him.\n One potential avenue getting more attention is a provision of the 14th Amendment, which bars from federal or state office any officeholder who takes part in insurrection or rebellion against the US.\n Democrats who introduced an article of impeachment on Monday against Trump cited the 14th Amendment in the text as an argument for impeaching him.\n That language could also be employed against members of Congress who supported Trump's effort, according to Rep. Cori Bush, a freshman Democrat from Missouri.\n \"Tomorrow, I'm introducing my resolution to expel the members of Congress who tried to overturn the election and incited a white supremacist coup attempt that has left people dead. They have violated the 14th Amendment,\" Bush said Sunday on Twitter. \"We can't have unity without accountability.\"\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked members of Congress for their input on whether to pursue such an effort.\n The 14th Amendment was an incredibly consequential addition to the Constitution back in 1866 after the Civil War. It gives citizenship to anyone born in the United States and guarantees \"equal protection under the laws\" to all citizens and imposed the Bill of Rights on the states.\n Trump has argued during his presidency that the birthright citizenship clause of the Amendment should be changed.\n But it's the much less-known language of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment that deals with acts of insurrection:\n No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n Clearly all officeholders took an oath to uphold the Constitution. And the Constitution calls for an election an Electoral College vote to determine the next president. Anyone complicit in inciting the riot bent on stopping that process could reasonably be considered to have violated it.\n But expelling lawmakers is not something Congress does lightly. A handful of lawmakers were expelled at the outbreak of the Civil War for supporting the Confederacy. No lawmaker has ever been dismissed using the 14th Amendment since its ratification after the war.\n Only two other congressmen were expelled, for ethics violations, in the intervening 160 years. Usually, lawmakers with massive legal issues resign.\n Lawmakers who may be targeted by Bush's effort to apply the amendment in Congress include Republican Reps. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Louis Gohmert of Texas took part in the Washington rally the sparked the storming of the Capitol. \"Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass,\" Brooks told Trump's supporters on Wednesday, before they tried to disrupt the American government.\n Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas have also been discussed as 14th Amendment violators. They're the senators who objected to counting electoral votes, along with many more colleagues in the House, and Hawley raised a fist to the rioters in solidarity before they stormed the Capitol.\n The 14th Amendment case might be easier to make against Brooks and Gohmert than Hawley and Cruz.\n \"Those who spoke words of violence, incitement to riot at the rally before the attack on the House, they are potentially culpable for insurrection,\" Norm Eisen, who served as an attorney for Democrats during Trump's impeachment, told CNN.\n It might be more difficult to make the 14th Amendment case against Cruz and Hawley, who, despite the fact that they spread lies about the election on the Senate floor, could argue they were trying to defend democracy, not incite the riot.\n Not even all Democrats are ready to definitively say they're ready to pursue a 14th Amendment case against their colleagues.\n \"I think it is applicable. But this is something we have to talk about,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, who chairs the House Rules committee, during an interview on CNN, although he certainly thinks they should resign.\n \"The people who helped cause this are not the people who can lead in healing. They need to move out of the way. To try to overturn a legitimate election and trample on the will of the American people is something that is unforgivable. These people do not belong in office,\" he said.\n While Congress does have the ability to expel members, the language of the 14th Amendment suggests, which refers to Congress enforcing the provisions of the amendment \"by appropriate legislation,\" suggests a President would also have to sign off.\n Congress does have the ability, with a two-thirds supermajority, to expel a member. That would require support from Republican lawmakers.\n Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania and now a CNN political analyst, said Congress should let the voters decide the fate of their representatives.\n \"Many of these members have exercised terrible political judgment, particularly senators Hawley and Cruz, but at the end of the day, I think they have should be judged by their voters for their deeds and their horrible judgment,\" he said.\n The 14th Amendment could also be applied against Trump, should he seek office in the future, to exclude him from the ballot, said Gerard Magliocca, a law professor at Indiana University who recently wrote about the history and application of the amendment's third section. Read his paper here.\n Magliocca said the 14th Amendment had excluded Confederates from running for office after the Civil War. That is, until Congress passed a sort of blanket amnesty removing that penalty from most Southern men as part of an effort at reconciliation. (There was, bizarrely, a symbolic effort that granted the same courtesy to Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis in the 1970s.)\n Today, if a state decided Trump had violated the 14th Amendment, he might have to sue to get on the ballot. If lawmakers from both chambers of Congress pass resolutions that he had violated the Amendment, it could also have the effect of keeping him from federal office in the future.\n \"It's something more than a censure, which just says, \"you were bad and don't do it again, right? But it's something less than an impeachment because it doesn't require an impeachment trial and the two thirds vote in the Senate and so on. So it's a way of thinking about this in a more of a compromise kind of fashion,\" Magliocca said, although he added it would previously would have been impossible to imagine using a provision written to keep insurrectionists out of government against a sitting US President who is already in charge of the government.\n \"That part is more novel,\" he said. \"But I think it's consistent with the sort of underlying purpose of it, which is to keep people out of office who have so severely betrayed the public trust that they cannot be trusted with all this again.\"\n He also pointed out that when the amendment was first passed, Congress passed a law, which is still on the books, to give the Department of Justice power to remove ineligible people from office.",

        "title": "FBI warns 'armed protests' being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington DC",
        "body_text": "The FBI has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington, DC in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN.\n The news comes as security measures are being stepped up ahead of Inauguration Day, with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies preparing for the possibility of more violence after rioters stormed the US Capitol last week leaving five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.\n Even as federal investigators continue to track down suspects from last week's attack, the bulletin highlights concerns that the US Capitol siege was perhaps just the beginning of potentially violent actions from supporters of President Donald Trump who have been animated by his lies about a stolen election.\n \"Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the US Capitol from 17 January through 20 January,\" the FBI bulletin states. It also suggests there are threats of an \"uprising\" if Trump is removed via the 25th Amendment before Inauguration Day.\n \"On 8 January, the FBI received information on an identified group calling for others to join them in 'storming' state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event POTUS is removed as President prior to Inauguration Day. This identified group is also planning to 'storm' government offices including in the District of Columbia and in every state, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump, on 20 January,\" the bulletin adds.\n The FBI is also tracking reports of \"various threats to harm President-Elect Biden ahead of the presidential inauguration,\" the bulletin states. \"Additional reports indicate threats against VP-Elect Harris and Speaker Pelosi.\"\n ABC News was first to report the FBI bulletin.\n The FBI said in a separate statement that its \"efforts are focused on identifying, investigating, and disrupting individuals that are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity,\" and that its \"focus is not on peaceful protesters, but on those threatening their safety and the safety of other citizens with violence and destruction of property.\"\n The government, meanwhile, held Continuity of Government Operations -- a standard practice in the event that someone tries to disrupt the transition that took on new urgency in light of threats surrounding this year's inauguration.\n According to a senior administration official, the interagency rehearsal aimed to ensure a seamless chain of command in the event of a national emergency in the days leading up to the inauguration and on that day itself. Monday's rehearsal focused heavily on \"readiness in the event that somebody tries to disrupt or stop the inauguration,\" the official said.\n The calls for new protests in Washington and states across the country have law enforcement and local officials bracing for more possible violence in the coming days.\n Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday urged Americans to avoid the city during Biden's inauguration next week and to participate virtually following last week's deadly domestic terror attack on the US Capitol.\n Speaking at a news conference Monday, Bowser, a Democrat, stressed that she was concerned about more violent actors potentially coming to the city in the run-up to the inauguration, saying, \"If I'm scared of anything, it's for our democracy, because we have very extreme factions in our country that are armed and dangerous.\"\n The mayor had told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that she will also ask the Department of Homeland Security to begin a \"national special security event\" timeline sooner than planned, as well as include the US Capitol in their coverage area for the inauguration.\n Security preparations were further complicated when Wolf, one of the key figures coordinating the effort, resigned on Monday.\n In one of his last acts, Wolf said Monday that he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin the National Special Security Event operations for Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, instead of January 19, the day before Biden is set to be inaugurated.\n \"In light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration and at the recommendation of Secret Service Director James Murray, I have instructed the U.S. Secret Service to begin the National Special Security Event operations for the 2021 Inauguration effective Wednesday, January 13th instead of January 19th,\" Wolf said in a statement.\n \"Our federal, state, and local partners will continue to coordinate their plans and position resources for this important event,\" he added.\n A Department of Homeland Security official told CNN that the breach of the Capitol will sharpen the response and planning for inauguration.\n \"Now that it happened people will take it much more seriously,\" the official said, referring to last week's violence. \"Now, the planners, they are all going to take it much more seriously.\"\n Additional security personnel are expected to arrive in Washington to help with the inauguration, CNN has learned.\n Law enforcement agencies in Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey that deployed to the US Capitol Wednesday to assist propel pro-Trump rioters expect to send officers to Washington, DC, for the inauguration.\n The New York Police Department will also be sending 200 officers to Washington to assist with the effort, according to Detective Christopher Pisano, a spokesperson.\n The National Guard has plans to have up to 15,000 National Guard troops to meet current and future requests for the inauguration, Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Monday. The dramatic increase in troops comes as law enforcement in the nation's capital and around the country brace for further extremist violence amid the transition of power.\n Law enforcement agencies are also ramping up security at the state level in preparation for potentially violent demonstrations leading up to Biden's inauguration.\n Shanon Banner, spokesperson for Michigan State Police, said they are aware of the march on state capitols that is being promoted online, and they will continue watching for security threats.\n \"Our security planning is fluid and adjustments are made as needed, from day-to-day,\" Banner said. \"Security enhancements that can be put in place include both seen and unseen measures. In general, we don't discuss security measures, but I can confirm that out of an abundance of caution, we are increasing our visible presence at the Capitol for the next couple of weeks starting today.\"\n The Michigan State Capitol Commission on Monday also banned the open carry of firearms inside the state's Capitol building, effective immediately.\n The policy change only affects public areas inside the building and does not change policy on the Capitol grounds, nor does it prohibit licensed concealed pistol carry that follows state laws, according to the commission policy.\n Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, citing armed protests at the Michigan state Capitol building in April and the recent violence at the US Capitol, said the commission should recognize the need for a ban on all weapons.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n CNN's Vivian Salama, Geneva Sands, Barbara Starr, Christina Carrega and Devan Cole contributed to this report",

        "title": "Pompeo accuses VOA of \"demeaning America\" in speech that whistleblowers blast as \"political propaganda\"",
        "body_text": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the Voice of America news service of \"demeaning America\" in a speech that a watchdog group criticized as \"political propaganda\" and a violation of the government-funded agency's own rules.\n Pompeo delivered remarks in person to a command audience of VOA staff despite the Covid pandemic, urging them to report that \"this is the greatest nation the world has ever known.\" Pompeo did not mention the pandemic, the insurrectionist violence that rocked the Capitol last week, leaving five dead, or President Donald Trump's role in encouraging the chaos.\n The speech was broadcast live, worldwide, through VOA channels in more than 40 languages in what the Government Accountability Project, a group representing VOA whistleblowers, called \"a violation of law, rule and policy.\" No questions were allowed after the remarks or the brief on-stage conversation with VOA Director Robert Reilly that followed, giving Pompeo a chance to tout Trump administration policies unchecked.\n VOA's White House reporter Patsy Widakuswara tried to ask the Secretary a few questions afterward. Hours later she was reassigned without explanation, according to several sources at the outlet who declined to be named. The White House Correspondents Association, an organization comprised of journalists who cover the White House, called the move \"an assault on the First Amendment\" and \"an affront to the very ideals Secretary of State Pompeo discussed in his speech Monday.\"\n When reached for comment, a VOA spokesperson told CNN that the news organization does \"not comment on internal personnel matters.\"\n The speech deepened concerns that Michael Pack, Trump's appointee to lead the US Agency for Global Media, which controls the purse strings for VOA and other services, is intent on reducing them to government mouthpieces, a step that many say would undermine the credibility and integrity of the media operations under the USAGM umbrella.\n VOA staff had been told the speech would be about \"the importance of VOA and the challenges facing the United States in the world today,\" according to the GAP letter sent to Pack and Reilly on January 8.\n The whistleblowers charged that Pompeo's appearance violated the statutory firewall that protects VOA journalists and editors from outside political meddling. \"A broadcast speech by the outgoing Secretary of State on topics on which he has been widely covered should be seen for what it is: the use of VOA to disseminate political propaganda in the waning days of the Trump administration,\" wrote David Seide, senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project.\n VOA's charter states that the agency will \"be accurate, objective, and comprehensive\" and that it \"will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.\"\n Pompeo had a different take on Monday, insisting that, \"your mission is to promote democracy, freedom, and American values in the world.\" After the Berlin Wall came down, he argued that VOA \"lost its commitment to its founding mission. Its broadcasts became less about telling the truth about America, and too often about demeaning America.\"\n \"It's not fake news for you to broadcast that this is the greatest nation the world has ever known. I'm not saying ignore our faults. Acknowledge them,\" Pompeo said. \"But this isn't the 'Vice of America,' focusing on everything that's wrong with our great nation. It certainly isn't the place to give authoritarian regimes in Beijing or Tehran a platform.\"\n Pompeo also asserted that it was \"morally wrong\" for VOA staff to object to his speech, using the whistleblower complaint as an excuse to launch into a culture war rant at the journalists listening to him in the auditorium.\n \"We are all parts of institutions with duties and responsibilities higher than any of us. And this kind of censorial instinct is dangerous. It's morally wrong. And it's against your mandate,\" Pompeo claimed. Minutes after seeming to suggest VOA journalists skew their coverage of the US to more positive news, Pompeo said, \"censorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction -- authoritarianism, cloaked as moral righteousness. It's similar to what we're seeing at Twitter, and Facebook, and Apple, and on too many university campuses.\"\n David Kligerman, the general counsel at USAGM until he was allegedly forced out by Pack last month, said Pompeo's reprimands of the VOA journalists betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the agency's mission and play right into the hands of the authoritarian countries, such as China, that he criticized in his speech.\n The secretary's allegations that VOA has \"a culture of Censorship, wokeness, political correctness in the wake of stories which Pompeo perceives as unfavorable, is unfortunately consistent with a larger assault on the press that we have long seen by this Adminstration,\" Kligerman said. \"It is a dangerous trope, particularly for the secretary of state, to be broadcasting into those audience in unfree countries, like China, Iran, and Russia, that we serve -- that journalists should toe the party line.  It is also a fundamental misunderstanding of the mission of the Agency, as set forth in the Agency's authorization statute.\"\n Pack, who took charge as CEO in June and is under investigation by the DC attorney general, made sweeping charges of bias against VOA employees, and conducted what some staffers called a pro-Trump \"purge.\"\n Pack's actions drew scrutiny from lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and legal actions from affected individuals. In one notable First Amendment case last month, a federal judge ruled that Pack and his team are forbidden from interfering in the newsroom.\n And just last month, the federal watchdog Office of Special Counsel found what it dubbed \"a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing\" at the agency, and directed Pack to order an investigation.",

        "title": "Yogananda Pittman named acting US Capitol police chief after riots",
        "body_text": "The US Capitol Police has appointed a Black woman as its acting police chief after the former head resigned in the fallout from the agency's inadequate response to pro-Trump rioters who staged an insurrection at the Capitol last week.\n Yogananda Pittman, who previously served as an assistant chief, will be the first woman and first Black person to head the Capitol Police, according to Morgan State University, the historically black school that Pittman graduated from in 1999. CNN reached out to Capitol police and has not been able to independently confirm this.\n Pittman will be replacing former chief Steven Sund, who resigned last week after he was criticized for being ill-prepared to respond to the deadly mob on Capitol Hill.\n \"Chief Pittman is a very progressive Chief,\" Sund told CNN on Monday. \"She's very concerned as well about the welfare of the officers.\"\n The police response spotlighted what many Black activists and civil rights leaders say is a double standard where police used more aggressive tactics -- such as tear gas and rubber bullets -- on Black Lives Matter protesters last summer but were more lenient with the pro-Trump White rioters.\n Images of police letting rioters through the Capitol gates, escorting them down the Capitol building steps and taking selfies with them, have sparked outrage among Black people. At least five people, including a Capitol police officer, were killed in the mob.\n Former Chief of the US Capitol Police Terrance Gainer called the Capitol riot a failure of Capitol police.\n Speaking on CNN's New Day last week, Gainer said police were \"outnumbered,\" they \"underestimated their strength\" and \"overestimated their ability to control the crowd.\"\n \"No one was supposed to get that close to the doors and windows of the building,\" Gainer said, adding that it must be thoroughly investigated.\n Pittman comes with a track record of making history as a Black woman in law enforcement. She joined the department in April 2001 and became one of the first Black female supervisors to achieve the rank of Captain, according to the Capitol police website. As captain, she managed more than 400 officers and civilians and led the security footprint for the 2013 presidential inauguration.\n Pittman's other assignments have included providing security and protective details for US Senators and visiting dignitaries and serving as an Inspector in the Office of Accountability and Improvement.\n Pittman has a Bachelor of Science in psychology from Morgan State and a Master's degree in Public Administration from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, according to a statement from Morgan State.\n Pittman's appointment will put her among the few Black women police chiefs in the nation.\n According to the Major City Chiefs Association, there are five Black women police chiefs leading major cities including Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams, Raleigh, North Carolina, Police Chief Cassandra Deck-Brown, Louisville, Kentucky, Interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry and Dekalb County, Georgia, Police Chief Mirtha Ramos.\n Juanita Holmes was named chief of patrol for the New York City Police Department last year making her the first Black woman to hold the post.\n Some of the women were among the police chiefs who came under fire last year when they were criticized for the police killings of Black men and how they handled the protests in their cities.\n Former Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields stepped down following the police killing of Rayshard Brooks and former Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best announced she would retire after City Council voted to cut nearly $4 million from the police department's budget. Former Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall announced her resignation last September.\n Outlaw, who previously served as Portland's first Black female chief, has publicly apologized for police tear gassing protesters in Philadelphia last June, saying it was not justified. She also met with the family of Walter Wallace Jr., who was killed by a police officer in October, and allowed them to review body cam footage of the incident before releasing it to the public.\n CNN's Peter Nickeas and Mark Morales contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump administration names Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism, frustrating Biden's efforts to boost relations ",
        "body_text": "The Trump administration has designated Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday, reversing an Obama-era decision to remove the label and potentially hindering the efforts of incoming president Joe Biden to normalize relations with the country.\n Pompeo said the State Department gave Cuba the designation \"for repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists,\" accusing the nation of reneging on its commitments made when President Barack Obama took them off the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2015.\n A top Cuban official responded by saying the move was hypocritical and \"political opportunism.\"\n The Trump administration's decision comes days before the inauguration of Biden, who has pledged to revive Obama's efforts at rapprochement between the two Cold War foes.\n Cuba rejoins just three other countries on the list of state sponsors of terrorism -- Iran, North Korea and Syria. Sudan was recently removed as part of its agreement to normalize ties with Israel.\n Pompeo claimed that \"(f)or decades, the Cuban government has fed, housed, and provided medical care for murderers, bombmakers, and hijackers\" and \"harbors several US fugitives from justice wanted on or convicted of charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades,\" he said.\n The administration did not provide any evidence that Cuba has sponsored terror attacks.\n The US justification for adding Cuba to its list emphasizes Havana's ties to the government of embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and reheats allegations that Cuba harbors 1970s American radicals, most of whom are now senior citizens. It ignores the fact that Cuba played a crucial role in ending the civil war in Colombia, for which the Obama administration applauded the communist-run island.\n The designation is the culmination of Trump's hardline stance on Cuba -- a position that was well-received by Cuban Americans and other voters in Florida, but which scuppered Obama's efforts to move on from the two nations' 20th century tensions.\n Cuba was removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list in 2015 amid Obama's efforts to restore ties between Washington and Havana. The Reagan administration designated Cuba in 1982, accusing the Castro government of sponsoring communist groups in Latin American and Africa.\n Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla tweeted Monday: \"We condemn the hypocritical and cynical designation of #Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, announced by the US. The political opportunism of this action is recognized by all who have an honest concern about the scourge of terrorism and its victims.\"\n A US diplomat with experience on Cuba issues told CNN last month that \"there simply was not a good argument to be made that Cuba actually sponsored terrorism,\" when plans to make the change were first reported. \"I don't know of anything that has changed since then in real terms -- they're just reinterpreting things to suit politics.\"\n Although the designation would likely get overturned by the incoming Biden administration, the diplomat said that it could do \"real damage to our credibility on state sponsorship of terrorism.\"\n Being put on the terror sponsor list entails restrictions on US foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales and sets certain controls over exports and various financial restrictions. It can also result in penalization against any persons and countries engaging in certain trade activities with Cuba.\n However, William LeoGrande, an expert on Latin America and professor at American University, told CNN that the designation would have little practical impact because Cuba is already subject to wide-ranging US financial sanctions.\n \"Almost all of the sanctions that a country suffers from being on the terrorism list are already imposed on Cuba as part of the broader embargo,\" he said.\n \"The only actual difference is that being on the terrorism list makes a state vulnerable to be sued by private individuals for the consequences of so-called acts of terrorism. You lose sovereign immunity if you are on the terrorism list.\"\n CNN's Vivian Salama contributed reporting",

And not just accepted it, but fully embraced it and came around to really loving the fact that I was gay right after college,\" Cooper said.\n Cooper shared that he struggled to come to terms with being gay because of limitations he and others faced in the late 80s. Anderson thought about joining the military, but in 1982, the US Army declared homosexuality to be \"incompatible with military service.\" Anderson wanted to travel, but being gay was illegal in some countries. In the late 80s and early 90s, a couple states allowed same-sex couples to register for domestic partnerships, but weren't allowed to marry.\n \"It wasn't what I envisioned for my life,\" he said. \"I imagined a family, getting married, and all those things which weren't possible at the time.\"\n \"I think about a year after college I realized I don't want to waste any more time worrying about this and wishing I was some other way,\" Cooper said. \"I think being gay is one of the blessings of my life. And it made me a better person, it made me a better reporter.\"\n \"It's enabled me to love the people that I've loved and have the life that I've had,\" Cooper said. \"So I'm very blessed.\"\n To watch the full segment, go to cnn.com/fullcircle",

        "title": "House Democrats plan to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump",
        "body_text": "House Democrats plan to vote Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told Democrats on a caucus call Monday, setting up an impeachment vote one week after rioters incited by Trump overran Capitol police and breached some of the most secure areas of the US Capitol.\n The House will vote Tuesday evening on a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power, and then plan to vote Wednesday at 9 a.m. ET on the impeachment resolution, Hoyer said.\n Democrats formally introduced their impeachment resolution Monday, charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" as they race toward making him the first president in history to be impeached twice. Wednesday's vote underscores Democrats' fury toward Trump and his supporters after months of false rhetoric about the election being stolen whipped the President's most ardent followers into a deadly mob Wednesday that ransacked the Capitol, forced lawmakers to evacuate both the House and Senate -- and could have been worse.\n The single impeachment article, which was introduced when the House gaveled into a brief pro-forma session Monday, points to Trump's repeated false claims that he won the election and his speech to the crowd on January 6 before the rioters breached the Capitol. It also cited Trump's call with the Georgia Republican secretary of state where the President urged him to \"find\" enough votes for Trump to win the state.\n \"In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,\" the resolution says. \"He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\"\n The resolution, which was introduced by Democrats David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Ted Lieu of California, also cited the Constitution's 14th Amendment, noting that it \"prohibits any person who has 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion against' the United States\" from holding office.\n House Republicans are urging Democrats not to pursue impeachment, arguing such a move would be divisive. Instead, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in a letter to GOP colleagues, listed four potential responses to the January 6 attack. McCarthy, citing feedback from members, floated the possibility of \"a resolution of censure under the rules of the House,\" as well as a bipartisan commission to investigate riots, according to the letter. He did not specify who would be censured.\n McCarthy also proposed overhauling the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which guides the electoral certification process, as well as \"legislation to promote voter confidence\" in future legislation. What these latter two issues have to do with the attack, other than the lies that stemmed from GOP lawmakers during the certification process and as it relates to non-existent widespread voter fraud, is unclear.\n Speaking on a call with House Republicans Monday, McCarthy indicated to his colleagues that Trump bore some of the blame for the riot, and that Trump acknowledged to McCarthy that he bore some blame for the riot, according to a person familiar with the call.\n Still, McCarthy said he was opposed to impeachment, instead proposing his proposed alternatives and suggesting there should be a bipartisan commission to get all the facts first instead, according to a source on the call.\n But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on the call with House Democrats Monday, called the idea of censuring Trump an \"abdication\" and made it clear it's not an option she's willing to consider, according to a person on the call.\n Pelosi told House Democrats on Sunday evening that the House would vote on impeachment this week unless Pence moves to invoke the 25th Amendment with a majority of the Cabinet to remove Trump from power.\n The level of unity in the Democratic caucus is being driven by the visceral reaction to what happened on January 6, when lawmakers had to be evacuated from the House and Senate chambers with rioters banging on the chambers' doors as the insurrectionists tried to stop the counting of votes to affirm President-elect Joe Biden would become president on January 20. Five people were killed, including a US Capitol Police officer.\n Still, House Democrats' race toward impeachment poses complications for the incoming Biden administration, as a Senate trial threatens to hamper the opening days of Biden's presidency. While some Democrats had suggested waiting to send the impeachment resolution to the Senate until after Biden's first 100 days in office, Hoyer and other top Democrats said Monday they wanted to do so immediately.\n Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he won't bring back the Senate from recess before January 19, that would push the trial into the beginning of the Biden administration.\n At a press conference Monday, Biden acknowledged that impeachment could make it more difficult for him to get his Cabinet confirmed or pass another stimulus bill. He said he was hopeful that the Senate could spend half the day on nominations and legislations and the other half on the trial, and he was waiting to hear back from the Senate parliamentarian.\n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will take control of the chamber when Biden is sworn in on January 20, is exploring whether to use emergency authority to try to reconvene the Senate and hold the trial before Trump leaves office, according to a senior Democratic aide. But this would require support from McConnell to carry this out under the authority granted to the leaders in 2004, though it does not require the support of all 100 senators.\n In another sign that little short of Trump's resignation will stop impeachment, Schumer told the Buffalo News on Monday he won't let a Senate trial stall Biden's agenda, even if it would make it more difficult.\n \"We're going to have to do several things at once, but we got to move the agenda as well,\" Schumer said. \"Yes, we've got to do both.\"\n While Biden and the Senate strategize for a potential trial, it's clear Democrats are pushing forward with an impeachment vote.\n Cicilline said Monday \"we have the numbers\" already to impeach Trump, and he predicted some Republicans would vote for it too, unlike the House's December 2019 votes to impeach Trump.\n \"I expect that we'll have Republican support,\" Cicilline said. \"I think it's urgent that the President be removed immediately.\"\n Democrats on Monday sought to take up a resolution from Raskin urging Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment. Hoyer asked for unanimous consent to bring up the resolution, but West Virginia GOP Rep. Alex Mooney objected to the request. Pelosi has said the Democrats will move to bring the resolution for a floor vote on Tuesday.\n Pelosi said in an interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that she liked the idea of invoking the 25th Amendment \"because it gets rid of him,\" but explained, \"one of the motivations people have for advocating for impeachment\" is to prevent Trump from holding office again.\n \"There's strong support in the Congress for impeaching the President a second time,\" she said.\n Multiple House Republicans are considering voting for impeachment, though none have come out publicly in support. Some House Republicans are also privately discussing whether to censure Trump as a way to express their disapproval of the President's actions without going along with the Democratic effort to impeach him, according to several GOP sources, though Pelosi on Monday closed the door to going that direction.\n \"I suggested this would have bipartisan support and makes more sense since the inauguration is a week away,\" Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement. \"But the Democrats I've talked to were not very receptive.\"\n A spokesman for Iowa GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said she \"believes that impeaching the President with only a few days left in his term would only further divide the American people and make it harder for President-Elect Joe Biden to unite the country.\"\n Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican and co-chairman of the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus, told his GOP colleagues he believes censuring Trump -- not a snap impeachment -- is the correct response, according to multiple sources on the call, a sign that Democrats may have a hard time winning significant number of Republicans on the impeachment vote.\n Still, there's been little to slow momentum toward impeachment since Wednesday. Two Senate Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, have called on Trump to resign in the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol.\n And some House Republicans are keeping their options open.\n \"I will wait to see the additional evidence presented, but again, this is something we're strongly considering,\" Rep. Peter Meijer, a Michigan Republican who succeeded independent Justin Amash, a Trump critic, told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"I would prefer that we have a more fulsome investigation into what happened. Most of what I know from January 6 came either from personal experience or from Twitter. But at the end of the day, it is obvious that the President is no longer qualified to hold that office.\"\n This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n CNN's Sarah Mucha, Ali Zaslav, Alex Rogers and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Chief Justice John Roberts has received his two doses of the coronavirus vaccine, the Supreme Court said Monday.\n \"The Chief Justice has taken steps to protect against infection, including minimizing contact with staff, regular testing, and receiving both doses of the Pfizer vaccine,\" public information officer Kathy Arberg wrote in an email, responding to questions from CNN about precautions to prevent exposure to the virus.\n She declined to say when Roberts, who turns 66 on January 27, received the second dose.\n The nine justices are hearing oral arguments via teleconference and most are working from home. But Roberts goes into the building regularly. Other justices occasionally work at the court.\n About 100 of the 350 non-security court staffers have been working in the building.\n Members of Congress, along with the justices, began getting their first doses of the vaccine in mid-December through the Capitol physician's office. Court officials have generally declined to reveal the status of the justices' vaccinations or other Covid precautions for staff.\n Arberg told CNN on Monday that, \"all employees adhere to recommended (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) health guidelines in the workplace and stay at home if experiencing any symptoms, have tested positive themselves, or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive or is experiencing symptoms.\"\n With few exceptions, the justices have remained behind closed doors since March because of the pandemic, and information about their health is rarely revealed.\n Court officials acknowledged last July, after The Washington Post received a tip, that Roberts had fallen a few weeks earlier at a Maryland country club. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital and spent the night. The court said physicians attributed the fall to light-headedness caused by dehydration and ruled out a seizure. Roberts previously had two reported seizures, in 1993 and 2007.",

        "title": "Crowds ignore warning and flood Tuscaloosa strip after Alabama crushes Ohio State for national football title",
        "body_text": "A college football season shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic ended Monday with a familiar team and coach on top, and familiar -- even if warned-against -- scenes of celebrations.\n For the sixth time under head coach Nick Saban, the top-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide are national champions, pulling away to defeat No. 3 Ohio State 52-24 on Monday night at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, in front of a crowd of 14,926.\n Saban now has seven national titles, more than any other coach in history, surpassing the late legendary Crimson Tide coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who had six.\n When asked by ESPN if he was able to process that, Saban replied, \"Not really.\"\n \"I'm just happy that we won tonight,\" Saban said. \"I really haven't thought about that because you're always looking forward. I just love this team so much and what they've been able to do. I can't even put it into words.\"\n In addition to his six championships with Alabama, Saban won the national title when he was at the helm at LSU, with the Tigers winning the BCS title game in 2003.\n After the game, hundreds of revelers packed several blocks of University Boulevard in Tuscaloosa -- the University of Alabama's home -- celebrating the win on a strip known for its bars and restaurants near the western edge of campus.\n The university and the city's mayor had asked fans before the game to avoid large gatherings, keep 6 feet of distance between others and wear masks. Many of the postgame revelers were not wearing face coverings, images on social media show.\n The state also is under a \"safer at home\" order, which generally requires people to wear masks when they're in public and within 6 feet of others. The celebrations came as Alabama -- like the country as a whole -- was hovering at or near all-time highs for  average daily new Covid-19 cases and deaths, Johns Hopkins University data show.\n On the field, Alabama has won six national titles with Saban in the last 12 seasons, and it's the 11th time in the last 15 seasons that a team from the Southeastern Conference has lifted the national crown.\n When speaking to reporters, Saban, 69, said he didn't think anyone compares to Bryant.\n \"His legacy lasted over a long, long period of time,\" Saban said. \"We all have to adjust with the times. Obviously things are a little different now. The challenges are a little bit different with the spread offense, the things that make it more difficult I think to play good defense in this day and age.\n \"I think Coach Bryant is sort of in a class of his own in terms of what he was able to accomplish, what his record is, the longevity that he had and the tradition he established. If it wasn't for Coach Bryant, we would never be able to do what we did. I mean, he's the one that made Alabama and the tradition at Alabama a place where lots of players wanted to come. We've been able to build on that with great support.\"\n Alabama quarterback Mac Jones was asked if Saban is the greatest college football coach of all time.\n \"Come on, man. Of course he is,\" Jones said. \"How could he not be? He does it the right way. He recruits well, but more importantly develops great players and young men. I'm just so blessed that he gave me a chance to come here along with all my teammates. I wouldn't trade it for anything. He's the greatest to ever do it. He'll be the greatest for a long time.\"\n At 13-0, Alabama ended a dominant season as the nation's only undefeated team. The Crimson Tide also avenged their loss to the Buckeyes in the inaugural College Football Playoff semifinals in the 2014 season.\n Jones, despite being hobbled in the second half with what he said was a bone bruise, set or tied multiple CFP title game records: His 36 completions (out of 45 attempts) tied Clemson's Deshaun Watson. Jones' 464 passing yards surpassed LSU's Joe Burrow by one yard, and his five touchdown passes tied Burrow for the record.\n Before leaving after suffering a dislocated finger, DeVonta Smith, the winner of this season's Heisman Trophy and named the offensive MVP on Monday night, set the CFP title game record with 12 receptions (for 215 yards -- a record for most receiving yards in a half of the national championship game) and three touchdowns. Najee Harris rushed for 79 yards and two touchdowns and also caught seven passes for 79 yards and one touchdown.\n Heading into the fall, the initial outlook for these two teams were quite different. As throughout the US, the pandemic wasn't handled in the same manner across the college football landscape.\n The SEC didn't waver, opting to play a conference-only schedule for the 2020 season. Though at times impacted by Covid-19 -- including Saban having to miss his team's game against Auburn after a positive test -- Alabama had just one game postponed, which would eventually be played later in the season, against LSU.\n \"To me, this team accomplished more almost than any team,\" Saban said. \"No disrespect to any other teams that we had or any championship teams. But this team won 11 SEC games. No other team has done that. They won the SEC, went undefeated in the SEC, then they beat two great teams in the playoffs with no break in between.\n \"This is our fifth game in a row, from LSU to Arkansas to Florida to Notre Dame to here. Played 13 games, went undefeated with all the disruption that we had in this season. I think there's quite a bit to write about when it comes to the legacy of the team.\"\n For Ohio State (7-1), vying to become the first team to win a national championship with just an 8-0 record since Minnesota did it in 1941, it wasn't so straightforward. In fact, it initially looked like Buckeyes wouldn't get to play at all.\n On August 11, the Big Ten Conference announced it was suspending fall sports, including football, because of health and safety concerns related to the pandemic. Just over a month later, on September 16, the conference reversed course, saying football season would resume in late October, which would include a specification that a team would need to play at least six games to be eligible for the conference championship game.\n But Covid-19 wreaked havoc on the schedule, and Ohio State had to cancel its game against Illinois, while two other schools (Maryland and Michigan) canceled against the Buckeyes because of their own Covid-19 concerns. That left the Buckeyes, at 5-0, on the outside looking in for the Big Ten title game.\n On December 9, officials from the Big Ten voted to amend its policy, which thereby extended Ohio State's season. The Buckeyes would come back against Northwestern in the Big Ten title game, and then went on to crush Clemson in the Sugar Bowl College Football Playoff semifinal.\n According to statistics provided by the College Football Playoff, Ohio State was one of 15 schools that had three games canceled and/or postponed without being made up. In all, according to the CFP, 111 games were canceled throughout the season because of the pandemic.\n The Buckeyes were without some of their key players on defense and special teams heading into Monday's game. Quarterback Justin Fields, banged up from the semifinal Sugar Bowl win against Clemson, wasn't 100%. Running back Trey Sermon left the game after one carry with an upper-body injury, with ESPN reporting he was hospitalized.\n After the game, Ohio State head coach Ryan Day said this loss would motivate his players that are returning next season and praised his team.\n \"I thought that the culture of our program, the leadership of our program, the way that our kids fought for a season and then came back, dealt with all the adversity along the way of games being canceled, guys being out ... for us to continually work through all of that and get to this moment right here was an unbelievable success,\" Day said.\n \"We wanted to win the game. The goal was not to get to here. The goal was to win the game. But all that being said, I couldn't be prouder of our culture, what our kids are made of and where the program is headed.\"",

        "title": "Democratic lawmaker confronted in airport by Trump supporters",
        "body_text": "Video posted to Instagram shows Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California being screamed at by apparent pro-Trump supporters in the Dulles International Airport last Thursday, the latest lawmaker accosted by the President's supporters at an airport.\n The video is edited, full of profanity and was taken by one of the individuals who yelled at Correa, who posted it on Friday. In it, Correa is seen being surrounded and confronted by people in the Washington, DC-area airport located in Virginia.\n Correa said he was looking forward to a long flight and to go to sleep after the House stayed up late to ratify the Electoral College results following the riot at the Capitol the previous day. He said he turned the corner to go to his gate and a number of President Donald Trump supporters were there from the day before. He said about 20 individuals confronted him once they realized he was a member of Congress.\n \"They picked me out, and boy, they came at me,\" Correa told CNN.\n \"It was going to be turning violent,\" said Correa. \"It wasn't a fear. It was just a matter of waiting for the first punch to happen.\"\n At one point, the video shows a tense standoff between Correa and a man that approaches him and gets in his face.\n \"Nobody here voted for you,\" someone is heard yelling at Correa. \"We don't want you.\"\n Later, Correa responds, \"That's okay, I don't work for you.\"\n When asked what went through his mind, the California Democrat said, \"stand my ground, not let them run me over and get ready for a major fight.\"\n The congressman said they were \"spewing hate,\" \"feeling anger\" and spreading misinformation that he was a Chinese agent, or on the payroll for a voting machine company.\n \"I don't blame them,\" Correa said. \"I blame the President because the President is the most powerful man in the world.\"\n \"He's essentially said, 'Yeah this is what's going on, go get them,' \" said Correa. \"He's the one that's been inciting all of this stuff.\"\n The crowd yells at Correa, \"Who voted for you?\"\n \"A lot of people,\" he responded. \"70% of people in my district.\"\n Later in the video, a woman screams at the congressman that he and others have ruined her children's future.\n \"No lady, it's because of you,\" he responded.\n \"You don't care about none of us,\" one man yells.\n \"Because I don't take your lies,\" Correa responded.\n Correa said that airport security eventually broke up the crowd around him.\n \"It shocked me that in an airport with all that security, this kind of an altercation took place,\" said the congressman. \"I've always thought of airports as being the most secure place in America to be in.\"\n He said that the security took down his name but \"didn't seem\" to get the names of the individuals harassing him. \"So that was another big shocker,\" he said.\n Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority spokesman Micah Lillard told CNN there are no arrests or charges in connection to the incident. He gave no further comment.\n Correa is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and supportive of the House Democratic effort to impeach the President for inciting the mob to attempt to overturn Trump's loss.\n News of Correa's confrontation follows several others involving high profile lawmakers and Trump fans as they traveled to and from the Capitol.\n Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Trump who was critical of the President last week, was confronted and screamed at by Trump supporters at Reagan National Airport, according to videos posted on social media Friday. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was also harassed by pro-Trump supporters on a flight from Salt Lake City to Washington, ahead of Wednesday's protests.\n Members of Congress will be getting increased security while traveling through airports in the aftermath of the attack on the US Capitol, according to a notice sent to lawmakers Saturday.\n The US Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms' office said they will coordinate with other law enforcement agencies, including the US Marshals Service to ensure their safety. Additionally, through the Inauguration on January 20, agents from the Capitol Police will be stationed at the three major airports in the Washington, DC area: Reagan National Airport, Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport.\n CNN's Manu Raju and Clare Foran contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Members of the general public in Kentucky were mistakenly allowed to sign up for Covid-19 vaccine appointments meant for health care workers, according to Louisville-based health system Baptist Health.\n Baptist Health provided the Kentucky Department of Health with an online vaccine appointment scheduling tool that could be linked to the state's vaccine website for health care workers, Kit Fullenlove Barry, Baptist Health public relations manager, said in a statement to CNN Monday.\n The state website linked to a page that outlined that vaccines are available for health care personnel as part of Phase 1a of the vaccine rollout. However, that information that was not included in the scheduling tool.\n \"As a result, many who viewed the site mistakenly thought the vaccines were open to the general public, although we do not know how many people registered who might be ineligible at this time,\" Fullenlove Barry said in the statement.\n Baptist Health sites have around 6,000 vaccination appointments scheduled over the next two weeks and the calendar is full. No additional appointments are being accepted at this time.\n Appointments made through the online system are still being honored in order to ensure those who are eligible receive a vaccine in a timely manner.\n \"We continue to ask the community's help to ensure these vaccines reach our Commonwealth's healthcare personnel first so we can continue to provide needed care,\" the statement said.\n \"Baptist Health has been working to provide a smooth process for cancellation for anyone who has scheduled a vaccination appointment in error, and will contact the 6,000 people who have registered for these appointments to provide that opportunity.\"\n Baptist Health said it will continue to partner with the state on vaccine rollout.\n \"We regret the confusion this has caused our communities and have updated the scheduling tool with the additional information.\"\n Kentucky is in its first phase of vaccinations, which includes health care workers and those living in long-term and assisted care facilities. The state has administered 130,355 vaccine doses, according to numbers updated by the health department Monday. Kentucky has received 169,350 doses for the state vaccination program and 93,600 doses designated for long term care facilities.\n CNN reached out to the Kentucky Department of Health for comment and has yet to receive a response.\n CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "A computer chip shortage has shut down the Louisville, Kentucky, Ford plant this week, the latest shutdown because of an industry-wide problem that is expected to spread to many other auto plants in the coming months.\n The Louisville plant employs 3,800 hourly workers, who will receive about 75% of their normal pay during the one-week shutdown. It assembles the Ford Escape and the Lincoln version of that SUV, the Corsair.\n \"The global semiconductor shortage is presenting challenges and production disruptions -- for the global auto industry, including Ford (F), which could have a significant knock-on effect on jobs and the economy given the importance of auto manufacturing,\" said Ford (F) in a statement.\n Automakers cut back orders for computer chips early last year when the pandemic slammed the brakes on auto sales and production because of temporary plant closings.\n When car sales bounced back sooner than expected, it left the industry struggling with a chip shortage. That was exacerbated by increased demand for laptops during the stay-at-home era -- and the electronic and computer industries snapping up the excess supply of chips, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank.\n \"It's temporary but it's not going to be short-term,\" she said. The problems are likely to last throughout the first three months or so of the year. Supplies should hopefully be back to normal in the second quarter.\n The average car has between 50 to 150 chips in it, she said. And all the chips are needed to proceed with assembly of the cars.\n The problem is not just affecting US auto plants -- plants in Europe and Asia are also dealing with chip shortages.\n Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Ford's shutdown was the industry's first because of a chip shortage. The Ford shutdown is just the latest auto plant idled by a chip shortage.",

        "title": "2 Capitol Police officers suspended and at least 10 more under investigation for alleged roles in riot",
        "body_text": "Two US Capitol Police officers were suspended and at least 10 more are under investigation for their behavior during last week's assault on the Capitol, and federal agents will look at whether current and former law enforcement officers played a role in the riot.\n One of the Capitol police officers took a selfie with someone who was part of the mob that overtook the Capitol and the other wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and started directing people around the building, according to Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat. He didn't disclose how many other officers were under investigation but confirmed it was between 10 and 15, and didn't say what they were being scrutinized for except that it was their behavior during the riot.\n Ryan told reporters that one individual had been arrested, but a spokesperson for the congressman later said he was wrong and no members of law enforcement have been arrested.\n The spokesperson said at least 10 Capitol Police officers are being investigated for their roles in the riot.\n A House aide separately said there are as many as 17 officers under investigation as part of eight investigations into the insurrection at the Capitol.\n In a statement Monday night, Capitol Police acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said several officers were suspended.\n She said the department \"has been actively reviewing video and other open source materials of some USCP officers and officials that appear to be in violation of Department regulations and policies. Our Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate these behaviors for disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination. Several USCP officers have already been suspended pending the outcome of their investigations.\"\n The federal investigative interest is a priority and a part of the broader investigation into the mob at the Capitol, sources said. The investigation into insurrectionist ties to law enforcement is a priority because the skills that officers are trained to use during their duties could be useful to an extremist mob, authorities say. This includes clearing rooms, taking custody of people, securing areas and handling firearms.\n Democratic members of the House have also raised questions about potential sympathies for the attackers among the ranks of US Capitol Police. That agency hasn't responded to CNN's request for comment.\n House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, is among those who have others questions about whether some Capitol Police officers aided the protesters and were complicit in Wednesday's insurrection. Clyburn, for instance, said it was fishy that the rioters knew the location of lawmakers' offices.\n Early videos -- one showing a Trump supporter taking a selfie with a police officer near an entrance to the Capitol and another appearing to show police letting protesters into the building -- went viral on social media.\n The second video was later found to have been taken an hour after the Capitol had been breached.\n Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who chairs one of the House committees that oversee Capitol Police, said there would be an investigation into those videos.\n \"A number of social media have indicated concerns about individual officers who, you know, if you look at the video, may have taken selfies with these seditionists or even let them in,\" Lofgren said. \"We need to thoroughly investigate that, but I also know there were many officers who responded with tremendous bravery. Many officers were injured protecting the Capitol and we do thank them for their patriotism in protecting this temple of democracy.\"\n At least seven officers in five other departments across the country have come under internal investigations as their presence in Washington during the assault comes to light through social media or other means.\n One officer in New York, one in Philadelphia, two in Seattle, two in Virginia and one in Texas are under investigation by their departments for potential rules violations. Additionally, some departments have been contacted by the FBI as part of their criminal investigation into the overrunning of the Capitol.\n The number may grow as investigators and the public sift through social media and lodge allegations that officers may have been involved in the siege.\n Police departments have said their investigation will hinge on what type of involvement officers are found to had with last week's assault.\n \"There's a big difference between walking down Pennsylvania Avenue and expressing yourself and going into a building where rioters pushed police and hit police and pushed them out of the way to get in,\" said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum.\n \"That will be the question. They just came and they marched, versus did they go inside the building and become part of a (riot).\"\n No law enforcement member has been charged with a crime.\n More than 70 million people voted for Trump in the 2020 election and he often touted police as strong supporters. An on-duty officer was killed in last week's assault and dozens of others were injured. The Fraternal Order of Police, which supported Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, released a statement calling on him to denounce those who attacked the Capitol and urging everyone to \"reject the use of violence and to obey the orders of law enforcement.\"\n The FBI is investigating the attack on the Capitol and members of Congress have promised investigations. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police has not responded to requests for comment.\n Wexler said almost every police department has a \"conduct unbecoming\" section of its rulebook that could be used to discipline officers for their conduct Wednesday. Officers can exercise their First Amendment rights but need to preserve credibility so they can testify, he said.\n \"Being a police officer really is different from other positions in that credibility is very important in terms of testifying in cases,\" he said. \"Your activity outside when you're a police officer becomes relevant to testifying. ... That worries police chiefs. That's why you have internal affairs investigations opened up when you have reason to believe officers were involved.\"\n \"I think it's worth investigating. It's totally worth investigating,\" Wexler said. \"You have a police officer who died as a result of these rioters. You have enormous concerns about safety, about police officers working the event.\"\n Wexler said investigators have will to determine whether they were just attending a rally or if they gained access to the Capitol with the mob seeking to overturn the election.\n \"Did they use the fact they were police officers to gain access in some way? That would be highly problematic. Did they go into the building and follow others who broke into the building? That would be highly problematic and could cost them their job,\" Wexler said.\n Spokespeople for the Houston, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Antonio, San Diego, Phoenix and Denver police departments have said their agencies have not been contacted by the FBI and there aren't any open internal investigations into officers.\n Chicago police are investigating whether members violated rules or laws but haven't found any evidence so far, a spokesman said. Dallas police haven't responded to a request for comment.\n The New York Police Department has opened an investigation into one member of the police department, according to New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea.\n \"There is one investigation that is active on one member,\" he told CNN affiliate NY1 Monday.\n \"There is no name yet released, because we don't know if it's true or not. ... Anyone committing crimes certainly would have a very short shelf life with the NYPD.\"\n The Philadelphia Police Department is investigating whether one of its detectives participated in the riots. A department spokesman said the department was aware of social media posts that allegedly show a member of its force at the Capitol on Wednesday.\n \"At this time, we are aware of social media posts that allege that a PPD detective may have been in attendance at the events on Washington, DC on January 6,\" Gripp said. \"An IAB investigation has been opened to determine if any PPD polices were violated by the detective, and if they participated in any illegal activities while in attendance. The detective's assignment has been changed pending the outcome of the investigation.\"\n The Seattle police department has placed at least two officers on administrative leave while officials investigate whether they took part in the riot, the department's chief -- Adrian Diaz -- said in a statement on Friday night.\n \"The Department fully supports all lawful expressions of First Amendment freedom of speech, but the violent mob and events that unfolded at the US Capitol were unlawful and resulted in the death of another police officer,\" the statement read. \"The incident has been forwarded to the Office of Police Accountability for full review of any SPD employee activities at the US Capitol.\"\n The chief added he will immediately fire any officer found to have taken part in the mob at the Capitol.\n Two Rocky Mount, Virginia, police officers are on administrative leave after attending the demonstrations in Washington, according to the Rocky Mount Police Department.\n \"The Town of Rocky Mount fully supports all lawful expressions of freedom of speech and assembly by its employees but does not condone the unlawful acts that occurred that day,\" the department said in a statement. \"Based on the available information, the Police Department has notified federal authorities and the individuals that were present at the event are on administrative leave pending review.\"\n In Texas, the Bexar County Sheriff's Office is initiating an internal affairs investigation after a lieutenant, who has been on administrative leave for an unrelated ongoing internal affairs investigation, posted selfies and photos to social media identifying herself as a Bexar County Sheriff's Office employee while attending the pro-Trump rally in Washington, according to the office.\n In a video statement sent to CNN, Sheriff Javier Salazar said he was notified about the posts to his personal social media account.\n \"I then took those screenshots and forwarded them to my chiefs and ordered them to initiate an internal affairs investigation on the administrative violations, if any,\" he said. \"Then I turned those same screenshots over to the FBI.\"\n \"Now, I know that the FBI is probably going to be the handling agency to look at the whole incident, and they're going to determine what, if anything, people did that was criminal and then maybe some people there were just peaceful protesters. At this point, to be fair, I don't know what her involvement is, but I turned this information over to the FBI to allow them to factor it into their ongoing investigation.\"\n The lieutenant has been on administrative leave since October, according to Salazar, and she had been stripped of all her agency property and her credentials.\n \"Right now, she doesn't wear a uniform, she doesn't carry a badge. It is unpaid administrative leave. It is not determined yet, at what point that investigation is over with. To be fair, we don't know what the outcome will be of that, but certainly this is going to tend to complicate that other investigation as it unfolds,\" he said.\n This story has been updated with additional information on police involvement in last week's riot at the US Capitol.\n CNN's Jessica Schneider, Mark Morales, Manu Raju, Dana Bash, Daniella Diaz, Michael Holmes, Josh Campbell, Jeremy Herb, Evan Perez, Kelsie Smith and Paul Murphy contributed to this story.",

        "body_text": "In the wake of the attack on Capitol Hill last week, and myriad questions about how rioters breached the building and what is happening in response, federal law enforcement agencies have yet to brief the public directly.\n The US Capitol Police, FBI, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security have yet to hold a press conference since Wednesday's incursion into one of America's most iconic buildings, prompting calls from lawmakers to call briefings for the public and Congress.\n Most public appearances and updates have been left up to Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who urged Americans to avoid the city during President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next week during a news conference on Monday.\n \"It has been five days since the most significant attack on a branch of the United States government since British forces set fire to the U.S. Capitol in 1814, and yet the American public has not heard from federal law enforcement authorities,\" Democratic Reps. Joe Neguse of Colorado and Veronica Escobar of Texas said in a letter Monday.\n The two House Judiciary Committee members urged federal law enforcement authorities -- including the FBI and Departments of Justice and Homeland Security -- to immediately hold a briefing for the public, as well as schedule a briefing for members of Congress, to discuss last Wednesday's riot at the Capitol.\n Generally, after such an attack, it is common practice for the DOJ, the FBI and DHS to hold a media briefing to provide an official account of the incident to the American people, the lawmakers said.\n In the days since the armed insurrection, the media and public have relied on first-hand accounts from Members of Congress, reporters on the scene, Capitol Hill staff, and Capitol Police officers, as well as pictures and videos on social media \"to attempt to piece the events of the day together,\" they added.\n \"Given that it's 2021, what happened at the Capitol in terms of a communications plan was unacceptable,\" Julie Parker, a law enforcement communications consultant and former spokesperson for multiple police departments, told CNN. \"There is no reason that a police department with a half billion dollar budget that has a police PIO (public information officer) on staff, should not have put out anything that day.\"\n Parker said the same type of public communications response would \"not be tolerated\" at the country or local level.\n \"On one of the worst days in our country's history, anyone who wanted to hear about what was happening and hear from the police department with the facts of the case, they were stymied,\" she said.\n A spokesperson for US Capitol Police did not respond to a request for comment.\n DHS did not respond to questions on whether the department plans to hold a news conference in the coming days and why it hasn't done so already.\n Jeffrey Rosen, who became acting attorney general following the resignation of William Barr last month, has not spoken publicly about the attack on the Capitol, but issued a statement last week saying that DOJ is committed to ensuring that those responsible for the attack \"face the full consequences of their actions under the law.\"\n DOJ spokesman Marc Raimondi told CNN that a press call would be likely on Tuesday to talk about additional criminal cases.\n Acting DC US Attorney Michael Sherwin and FBI's Steven D'Antuono held a press call last week.\n \"I think our response to the Capitol Police request for support has been well documented with the more than 520 DOJ personnel who raced to the Capitol and helped clear and restore operations there,\"  Raimondi said.\n DOJ provided law enforcement personnel from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, US Marshals Service, Bureau of Prisons and FBI as well as leadership from the Department of Justice, according to Raimondi.\n On Monday, the FBI said it wants the public's help to identify the man seen in photos, widely circulated online, carrying a large Confederate flag inside the US Capitol. The agency has posted a number of bulletins asking for help in identifying dozens of others whose images were captured amid the attempted insurgency.\n \"The FBI is involved in this. They're looking for information for the public. We can only help if we hear from them,\" Parker said.\n Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf, who announced Monday that he was stepping down, issued a sharply worded statement in the immediate wake of the attack, urging President Donald Trump and all elected officials to condemn the violence on Capitol Hill.\n \"While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends,\" Wolf said. \"This is unacceptable.\"\n Wolf, who was in Qatar at the end of a Middle East swing when the Capitol riot took place, has also not held a press conference. He returned from his overseas trip as soon as possible, and has been seen at least twice at White House several since last week's incident.\n His deputy, Ken Cuccinelli, has made several media appearances in the wake of the Capitol attack, trying to ensure the public that there will be a safe inauguration and promising that the federal government would bring charges against the people involved.\n \"We are fully  -- across the administration -- pursuing every avenue of justice available,\" he said on CBS News last week.\n Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified the state Rep. Joe Neguse represents. He is from Colorado.\n CNN's Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

        "title": "On these 9 days, police in DC arrested more people than they did during the Capitol siege",
        "body_text": "Sixty-one: That's the number of arrests Washington, DC, police made the day rioters laid siege to the Capitol in protest of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n More have been arrested since, and several jurisdictions are now involved in hunting down the supporters of President Donald Trump who invaded and ransacked the Capitol during a joint session of Congress to affirm Biden's win. Some are already facing federal charges.\n Yet during an episode described as insurrection and an attempted coup, police made only 61 \"unrest-related\" arrests that day -- and only about half of those were on Capitol grounds, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee said last week.\n Numerous media outlets, including CNN, have provided comparisons between the arrests during Wednesday's siege and those made during the summer's Black Lives Matters protests in the capital.\n It's valuable context, for sure, and raises important discussions about police and race, but a longer view shows the BLM protests were but one example where police in the nation's capital seemed ready to respond with the full force of the law.\n Here are some examples, by the numbers:\n Just across First Street from the Capitol, the US Supreme Court was set to hear arguments in three cases that many gay rights supporters felt would dictate the level of protection they'd receive under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title VII's employment rules.\n Activists sat in First Street in an act of civil disobedience, reported the Washington Blade, an LGBTQ news outlet that quoted US Capitol Police saying the demonstrators were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.\n Actor Jane Fonda's \"fire drill Fridays\" produced numerous arrests -- many of them celebrities -- in late 2019 and early 2020, as the ex-wife of CNN founder Ted Turner took her anger over climate change inaction to the capital.\n In the 14th week of protests, Joaquin Phoenix and Martin Sheen were among the stars who found themselves in custody, as Capitol Police verified scores of people were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.\n The largest single-day arrest count from the protests, however, came in September, when demonstrators -- many of whom, Reuters reported, were in wheelchairs (most of them belonged to a disability rights group) -- delayed a Senate hearing. Capitol Police began rounding them up en masse.\n Fifteen were charged with disrupting Congress and 166 were charged with crowding, disrupting or incommoding, with 23 of those facing an additional charge of resisting arrest, according to Capitol Police.\n As demonstrations broke out across the country, police in the nation's capital dealt with ugly street clashes between police and antifa in downtown Washington.\n Six officers were injured, and police deployed pepper spray after, CNN reported, \"Bursts of chaos erupted on 12th and K streets as black-clad 'antifascist' protesters smashed storefronts and bus stops, hammered out the windows of a limousine and eventually launched rocks at a phalanx of police lined up in an eastbound crosswalk. Officers responded by launching smoke and flash-bang devices, which could be heard from blocks away, into the street to disperse the crowds.\"\n Several days of protest over the nomination of Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court yielded hundreds of arrests, but many of them came on a single day, as lawmakers reviewed an FBI report outlining allegations against the would-be justice.\n It was another star-studded affair, as comedian Amy Schumer and model Emily Ratajkowski were among those taken into custody.\n The arrests began mid-afternoon with 293 people arrested for unlawfully demonstrating in a Senate building and nine more arrested later in another Senate building, a Capitol Police spokeswoman said. All were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, the department said.\n Many found themselves asking Wednesday: Where are the police and military?\n No one asked such questions in June, when Black Lives Matter protesters, decrying the deaths of George Floyd and other African Americans at the hands of police, took to the streets to find military helicopters hovering over the city, National Guard troops patrolling the streets and tear gas filling the air.\n An analysis of Metropolitan Police Department data shows local police arrested five times as many people during the Floyd protests as they did during last week's insurrection.\n As President Barack Obama's administration reviewed plans for the $5.3 billion Keystone XL pipeline, almost 1,000 demonstrators marched from Georgetown University to Secretary of State John Kerry's home and then to the White House, where they acted out a \"human oil spill.\"\n Other demonstrators zip-tied their hands to the White House fence and lay on tarps in front of White House, urging Obama to reject the project. In the end, Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for US Park Police, told The Washington Post that 372 people were taken into custody.\n It began in Philadelphia with protesters from several groups marching 150 miles south to stage a sit-in on the Capitol steps, denouncing the influence of big money on politics and Congress' refusal to reverse it. On a single day of the lengthy protests, Capitol Police arrested more than 400 people for \"unlawful demonstration activity,\" and they were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.\n While the Progressive Change Campaign Committee cast the demonstrations as \"nonviolent civil disobedience,\" aimed at starting conversations on \"key democracy issues,\" numerous media outlets reported more than 900 arrests during the protests. Salon pegged the final tally at 1,240 over a week of protests.\n More than 1,000 women marched through Washington, protesting the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, was among the hundreds arrested, according to Capitol Police.\n The demonstrations were largely peaceful. Protesters scarcely argued with the officers arresting them, who in most cases declined to even employ handcuffs in taking the women into custody. Several Democratic lawmakers -- including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who arrived with her infant in tow -- showed up to express their support for the demonstration.\n This isn't officially included on this list. It isn't the fairest comparison, given that half a century has passed and the country looks markedly different than it did in 1971. But the May Day protests against the Vietnam War have been described as the \"largest mass arrest\" and \"largest mass acquittal\" of demonstrators in US history.\n Five thousand police, backed by 1,400 National Guardsman, greeted the 35,000 protesters descending on Washington that day, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n \"Anyone and everyone who looked at all freaky ... was scooped up off the street,\" one protester said, according to an ACLU article. A federal court later agreed, saying, \"The innocent as well as the guilty were in large numbers swept from the streets and placed in detention facilities.\"\n An ACLU victory resulted in acquittals for almost all of the protesters, allowing them to collect monetary damages for their mistreatment, the civil rights group said.\n CNN's Casey Tolan, Gregory Krieg, Leah Asmelash, Sophie Tatum and Mary Grace Lucas contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Los Angeles woman whose mom died of Covid-19 had to hold the funeral in a parking lot ",
        "body_text": "Juliana Jimenez Sesma stared down at her mother's casket. Her mother's face was made-up, and her hair done just so. Her expression was frozen.\n As Sesma mourned, mariachi music sliced through the silence. \"I'd rather be asleep than awake because of how much it hurts that you're not here,\" the band belted in Spanish.\n The song's lyrics capture how Sesma has felt since losing her mother and stepfather to coronavirus.\n She buried her mom last week in South Los Angeles. But she had to say her farewell in a parking lot.\n There, the casket was placed in one corner, under a pop-up canopy -- with flower arrangements and photos all around. Chairs were spaced apart in parking spaces.\n It was the only safe space, where people could socially distance while grieving, that Calvary Chapel -- located near the Sesma family in South LA -- had available.\n And with funeral homes backed up because of the surge of Covid-19 deaths across Los Angeles, Sesma said she and her brother had to wait three weeks to hold a funeral.\n \"Waiting to bury her, that felt like torture,\" Sesma told CNN. \"We worried about how she'd look.\"\n She said she worried that her mother's body would become distorted and begin to decompose before she was able to see her face for the very last time.\n At the funeral, Sesma stood while praying. Her faith, she said, is the only thing buoying her in the aftermath of such loss.\n Sesma said she left her job as a real estate agent to live with her mother and stepfather because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Her mom, a retired machinist, had lung disease. Her stepfather was a handyman, with asthma and diabetes. Her brother lived next door with his young family.\n In December, she said they all contracted Covid-19. Her parents ended up so sick they had to be admitted to Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital in South LA.\n The state-of-the-art hospital -- which is teeming with patients -- is a haven in what has long been a health care desert in the heavily Black and Latino area of the city.\n \"Our emergency department was designed to treat 40 to 45,000 patients a year. In 2019 -- before Covid -- we were seeing 110,000 patients a year,\" hospital CEO Dr. Elaine Batchlor said. \"That's largely because of a lack of access to quality care in the community.\"\n Now, with coronavirus, there are even more patients everywhere, she said.\n Los Angeles reported 12,617 new cases Monday, bringing the total number of cases in the county to 932,697, as the county nears the grim milestone of 1 million cases. An additional 137 new deaths were reported, raising the total number of deaths to 12,387.\n Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital normally has a 135-bed capacity, but it is now treating more than 200 people inside, according to Batchlor. More than 60% are coronavirus patients.\n Batchlor said the hospital gets some of the city's and state's sickest patients.\n \"Diabetes is three times more prevalent here than in the rest of California. Mortality is 72% higher. The life expectancy is 10 years shorter here than in the rest of the state,\" Batchlor said. \"All of that is related to this being an under-resourced and an underserved community.\"\n And that means that what happened to the Sesma family tends to be the norm, not the exception.\n \"We have had the misfortune of seeing this disease run through families and, and all too frequently take multiple members of a single family,\" Dr. Jason Prasso, who treated both Sesma's mother and stepfather, said.\n The pain of the losses for the doctors and nurses sits on their shoulders like a dull weight that won't got away. For families, losing someone to Covid takes a devastating toll.\n \"We lost both my mom and stepdad to coronavirus,\" Sesma said. \"Don't let this be you. If you truly love your loved ones, don't let this be you. Continue to take all the precautions, take extra precautions, exaggerate if you have to.\"",

        "title": "Videos of passengers being removed from planes do not indicate federal no-fly status yet, TSA says",
        "body_text": "Videos of belligerent passengers at airports \u2014 some donning pro-Trump outfits \u2014 being forced off planes or denied boarding are circulating widely on social media, with many users describing the scenes as airport officials informing people that participated in the Capitol riot that they're on a no-fly list. But that's not necessarily the case.\n Though at least one member of Congress and airline worker unions have called for known riot participants to be put on the FBI-managed no-fly list, which is designed to prevent known and suspected terrorists from getting airline tickets, it's not clear if that step has been taken.\n The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.\n Federal officials and DC police are still working to identify and track down many of the rioters, though at least 20 federal criminal defendants have been arrested across the country.\n When a person is put on the federal no-fly list, they would be stopped or undergo additional screening before going through a TSA checkpoint, according to the TSA.\n That means the widely circulated footage of angry travelers being forced off of planes or screaming in a terminal likely aren't reacting to news that they've suddenly been put on the federal government's no-fly list, according to the TSA. Rather, they're more likely to be depictions of a well-known issue that has been plaguing airlines for months: Flight attendants and airline workers being forced to handle situations in which angry passengers refuse to comply with Covid-19-related safety policies.\n Though airline CEOs have said the vast majority of passengers comply with the rules, anti-mask wearers vocally refusing to wear protective gear have disrupted flights in several high-profile cases.\n (Conspiracy theories that the President has not disavowed \u2014 and that he has occasionally egged on \u2014 have attempted to paint Covid-19 as a \"hoax.\")\n Last year, airlines warned passengers that they can enforce their own no-fly lists intended to ban disorderly customers from flying in the future. Hundreds of passengers are currently on those lists.\n Airlines and two unions representing flight attendants, however, have said they are concerned about in-flight security as the pro-Trump rioters who stormed the US Capitol last week left the Washington, DC, area \u2014 particularly after several altercations on flights to DC ahead of the insurrection.\n \"We are incredibly concerned about recent politically motivated incidents on board passenger aircraft,\" read a statement from the APFA president Julie Hedrick. \"Regardless of one's political beliefs, the cabin of a commercial aircraft must, out of necessity, be a calm environment for the safety of everyone onboard.\"\n Alaska Airlines said in a statement that it banned 14 passengers that were on board a flight from DC to Seattle a day after the riot because they refused to wear masks and were \"rowdy, argumentative and harassed our crew members.\"\n Alaska said it has so far banned a total of 302 passengers for violating its mask policy since it went into effect last August 7.\n The airlines don't necessarily share their no-fly lists with each other. Delta's CEO, for example, said last month that about 700 people are on the company's no-fly list. The discrepancy means that unruly passengers could simply book flights on different aircraft.\n Meanwhile, union representatives are calling for the FBI to add as many rioters as possible to the federal no-fly list, and are encouraging federal regulators to do more to discourage dangerous or disturbing behavior on flights.\n \"Airlines and law enforcement agencies have bolstered security at Washington-area airports this week after reports of 'mob behavior' on flights in and out of the region surrounding Wednesday's siege on the US Capitol,\" according to a January 9 statement from the Association of Flight Attendants. \"Every airline flying out of the region over the last several days has experienced incidents onboard. Flight Attendants House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) on Thursday urged TSA and the FBI to add 'violent perpetrators' who participated in the Capitol riots to the federal No-Fly List.\"\n Democrat Rep. Peter DeFazio, chair of the House Transportation Committee, said in a statement Monday that he is urging the FAA and its administrator, Stephen Dickson, \"to limit the chance that the Nation's commercial airline system could be used as a means of mass transportation to Washington, DC, for further violence in connection with the inauguration.\"\n The FAA issued a separate statement, announcing \"unruly behavior on an airplane may violate federal law\" and it can result in jail time and fines of up to $35,000.\n Additional reporting by Gregory Wallace and Pete Muntean.",

Instead of applause, many of Trump's aides -- even those who have stuck with him through myriad scandals and embarrassments -- were voicing shame and disappointment. His circle has shrunk. Many have resigned and others are still considering it.\n On Monday, after an extended period of silence, Trump and Pence spoke for the first time after a deadly riot of Trump supporters broke out at the US Capitol with Pence inside, according to two administration officials.\n A senior administration official told CNN they met in the Oval Office, had what was described as a good conversation and discussed the week ahead while \"reflecting on the last four years of the administration's work and accomplishments.\"\n \"They reiterated that those who broke the law and stormed the Capitol last week do not represent the America First movement backed by 75 million Americans, and pledged to continue the work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term,\" the senior official said.\n Trump had spent the weekend largely in isolation, as aides either distanced themselves from him or limited their time in his presence. Trump canceled a planned trip to Camp David, where his closest aides were hoping he would get into a good mindset ahead of his final stretch in office. Instead, he spent the weekend stewing to his deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino, and entered his final full week angrier than ever.\n The attempted insurrection that Trump incited at the US Capitol last week prompted the permanent suspension of his Twitter account, a looming second impeachment and a wave of administration resignations. But among the more significant repercussions had been the apparent collapse of Trump's relationship with Pence.\n Pence finally got \"a glimpse of POTUS' vindictiveness,\" one source familiar with the situation said, using the acronym for President of the United States.\n Trump's treatment of a man who served him faithfully for more than four years outraged those in Pence's orbit -- but also many in Trump's, who view Pence as the most loyal of lieutenants whose treatment they regarded as deeply unfair. And while Pence now appears unlikely to entertain invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, he has not weighed in on it publicly, allowing the idea to persist, which people close to him described as intentional.\n Pence, who is often internally mocked for how deferential he is toward Trump, has taken a quiet but defiant stance in their final days in office. One source close to the vice president said Pence is hoping to spend his remaining days in office telegraphing \"to our allies and adversaries that we have a fully functioning government.\"\n After the two men spoke Monday, a source close to the vice president told CNN's Jim Acosta that Pence's advisers are trying to cool the temperature with Trump after their initial outcry.\n \"The feeling is we made our point,\" the source said.\n The mob event, and Trump's fury at Pence in the lead-up to it, left their relationship in tatters. Before their Oval Office meeting Monday, the pair had not spoken since before Trump's rally on the Ellipse last week. Their last conversation was punctuated by a vulgarity the President uttered after Pence informed him, for a final time, that he could not unilaterally reject the results of the election, something he had already told Trump in previous meetings that often dragged on for hours.\n On several occasions, Trump had sent a random assortment of lawyers, such as Jenna Ellis, to the vice president to explain, in his mind, that he could disrupt the results process.\n The final conversation left Trump irate, and his anger emerged during the rally itself, when he told the crowd he hoped \"Mike has the courage to do what he has to do\" and ignores \"the stupid people that he's listening to.\"\n It was the first time in their more than four years as political partners that Trump's vengeance had been trained on a man known mostly for his fealty. Even as others once close to Trump -- from his personal attorney Michael Cohen to his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to any manner of former aides -- met similar fates, Pence was spared.\n The turn of events has left Pence shaken and caused him to exclaim in anger to a fellow Republican: \"After all the things I've done for (Trump)!\"\n Pence also recently learned that pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell was involved in the lawsuit filed by Trump's Republican allies against him. Trump was not only aware, but had encouraged the effort, people close to the situation said.\n Even when the President returned to the White House while his crowd set off for the Capitol, Trump's anger at Pence did not abate. And as the crowd broke down doors, mobbed the building, and in some cases appeared to be hunting Pence himself, Trump remained focused on the perceived disloyalty.\n The threats against Pence have not been limited to the particular actions of the rioters on Wednesday. Pence's staff has received two threatening emails sent to an internal distribution list from an outside sender in the past days, both before and after the insurrection attempt at the Capitol on Wednesday, according to a White House official. Pence himself is not on the distribution list.\n Pence's office declined to comment on the threatening emails sent to the staff distribution list. On Saturday, deputy press secretary Judd Deere said the White House \"strongly condemn(s) all calls to violence, including those against any member of this administration.\"\n After Wednesday's events, Pence allies were aghast the President did not call to ensure the vice president's safety, or the safety of his wife and daughter, who had accompanied him as he performed the ceremonial role of overseeing the Electoral College tally. Pence's brother, Rep. Greg Pence, an Indiana Republican, was also inside. Instead, the President was trying to phone Republican allies to convince them to persist in their futile rejection of the election results.\n \"Was he concerned at all that an angry mob that he commanded to march on the Capitol might injure the vice president or his family?\" a person familiar with the matter asked.\n Inside the besieged Capitol, it was Pence and not Trump who coordinated phone calls with law enforcement and security agencies. Afterward, Pence phoned the family of the fallen Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, even as Trump remained silent. And after Trump finally conceded he would not serve another term in office, it is Pence who will attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration while Trump says he will boycott it.\n Pence's actions earned him praise within the administration, including from national security adviser Robert O'Brien, who tweeted on Wednesday that Pence \"is a genuinely fine and decent man. He exhibited courage today.\"\n Democrats, however, remain frustrated at Pence's unwillingness to move on the 25th Amendment, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer made an unsuccessful attempt to phone the vice president to discuss the matter last week, but were placed on hold with a military aide for 20 minutes before being told Pence wasn't available.\n \"I was at home, so I was running the dishwasher, putting my clothes in the laundry. We're still waiting for him to return the call,\" Pelosi said Sunday on CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\"\n Other Democrats are skeptical that after four years of standing by Trump -- including through his attempts to cast doubt on the election results using false claims of voter fraud -- Pence can recover his moral standing now.\n \"All of us, including Speaker Pelosi, will prefer that Donald Trump simply do the right thing and resign, or that Vice President Pence actually shows some spine, at least for himself and his own family, and invoke the 25th Amendment,\" Rep. Ted Lieu said on \"CNN Newsroom\" on Sunday.\n A day later, an attempt by House Democrats to bring up a resolution urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power was blocked by Republicans. If that resolution ends up failing, Democrats plan to to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for his role in the Capitol riot.\n On Saturday, a source close to the vice president told CNN that Pence had not ruled out entirely an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment, and wants to preserve the option in case Trump becomes more unstable. But he hasn't held discussions on the issue with members of the Cabinet, and still appears unlikely to move forward with it.\n Instead, Pence and his advisers seem to be looking toward their final week in office with an eye toward his legacy, hoping to tout the administration's achievements. Advisers have been encouraging Trump to hold similar events, including on Middle East diplomacy and deregulation, but it's unclear whether he will agree to do so as he remains consumed with his permanent suspension on Twitter.\n Last week, second lady Karen Pence was looking at available homes for rent in Virginia, according to a source familiar with her schedule.\n Advisers have said Pence hopes to provide a bridge to the next administration and do as much as possible to assist Biden's team in preparing for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Pence and Biden consulted regularly in the early days of the Trump administration, including on foreign policy matters.\n On Monday, Pence's schedule listed a coronavirus task force meeting -- one of the final times the group meets before the end of the administration. Pence did not bring up the siege at the Capitol during the discussion, a person close to the task force said.\n Trump, meanwhile, had nothing on his schedule.\n CNN's Jim Acosta, Alex Marquardt and Kate Bennett contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Bitcoin prices surged to a new all-time high of nearly $42,000 on Friday, only to plunge all the way back to about $31,000 Monday morning. That's a more than 20% drop -- which means bitcoin is now in a bear market, as bizarre as it sounds.\n Bitcoin is still up a lot over the past few months, not to mention from where it was trading  just a few weeks ago. But the drop highlights how the stunning rise has raised alarm bells among some on Wall Street.\n \"It's scary when the price of bitcoin just goes straight up,\" said James Putra, vice president of product strategy for TradeStation Crypto. \"This pullback was needed.\"\n Just last week a strategist at Bank of America said bitcoin's surge may be the \"mother of all bubbles,\" noting that the recent spike is larger than other notorious manias of the past few decades: gold in the 70s, dot-coms/tech in the late 1990s and housing in the mid-2000s.\n So the drop of the past few days is a \"healthy correction\" that \"was due a long time ago,\" according to Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade.\n Bitcoin first surpassed the $20,000 level in mid-December and soared above $30,000 earlier this month --  a huge rebound from a low of just above $4,000 as the Covid-19 outbreak sent global financial assets plummeting last spring.\n Even with the drops over the weekend and Monday, bitcoin is still up more than 10% already in 2021 -- and it has soared about 300% in the past 12 months.\n Aslam said in a report that bitcoin might fall to the $28,000 to $30,000 level before bottoming out.\n \"This is not the time to panic but to look at this opportunity from a more optimistic lens,\" Aslam said, \"as the bull run is not over yet, and it is still likely to make its journey to the upside.\"\n Many bitcoin bulls remain optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies, citing the fact that digital payment giants Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL) let users buy and sell it, and many top institutional investors including Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and Anthony Scaramucci are investing in it.\n A top executive at BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, recently said bitcoin could supplant gold as the main asset that investors can use to hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar.",

        "body_text": "Theodore Lumpkin Jr., one of the last surviving members of the famed Tuskegee Airmen who served during World War II, has died at age 100.\n Lumpkin passed away on December 26, just a few days shy of his 101st birthday, from complications due to Covid-19, his alma mater Los Angeles City College said Friday.\n \"Ted Lumpkin represents the best of our distinguished alumni in his service to our country as a member of the groundbreaking Tuskegee Airmen and his other accomplishments during a long and highly productive life; he will be missed by all of us,\" Robert Schwartz, executive director of the Los Angeles City College Foundation, said in a statement.\n Lumpkin's legacy extended from fighting for his country in the decorated 100th Fighter Squadron of the Tuskegee Airmen to his work as a social worker and later a real estate agent. The Tuskegee Airmen were a pioneering group of all-Black fighter pilots and service personnel who served in World War II.\n \"We're carrying on his [legacy], but it's an end of an era,\" his son Ted Lumpkin III told the Los Angeles Times.\n In 2009, Lumpkin and a group of Tuskegee Airmen attended the inauguration of President Barack Obama to see the first Black US president sworn in.\n Obama spoke of the importance of the aviators when he was a US senator in 2007. \"My career in public service was made possible by the path heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen trailblazed.\"\n Lumpkin was born and raised in Los Angeles, where he attended Los Angeles City College from 1938 to 1940 and received an associate's degree, the college said.\n He was studying mathematics at UCLA when he was drafted in July 1942 at age 21.\n After basic training, he was assigned to the 100th Fighter Squadron as a second lieutenant with the US Army Air Corps. He was shipped to Italy in February 1944 with the 332nd Fighter Group.\n Lumpkin became an intelligence officer with the squadron, where he briefed pilots for their combat missions. He also wrote intelligence reports and presented briefings about the overall progress of the war.\n Lumpkin used the money he received from the GI Bill to pursue an undergraduate degree in sociology at the University of Southern California. He met his future wife, Georgia, while he was a student, according to the LA Times.\n In 1947, he became a social worker with Los Angeles County. He also volunteered for the Air Force Reserves, serving as an air intelligence officer from 1947 to 1968.\n Lumpkin never forgot his roots. He served as a national board member, western regional representative and the Los Angeles chapter president for Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., a national nonprofit.\n Lumpkin also became a member of the board of directors of the Tuskegee Airmen Scholarship Foundation in 2007, according to the organization. He raised money and donated thousands of dollars for scholarships for \"financially and academically deserving underserved students,\" according to a TASF campaign set up in his name.\n \"The Tuskegee Airmen were not recognized after the war,\" Lumpkin said in 2000, according to USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work's website. \"People didn't believe us when we told them what we did, and our work wasn't documented anywhere.\"\n It wasn't until 60 years after World War II that the bravery of Lumpkin and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen was officially recognized by the US government. In 2007, the group received the Congressional Gold Medal.\n Lumpkin is survived by his wife, 99-year-old Georgia. They had four children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild.",

        "title": "GOP lawmaker 'strongly considering' impeachment: Trump is 'no longer qualified to hold that office'",
        "body_text": "Michigan GOP Rep. Peter Meijer said Monday evening he is \"strongly considering\" voting to impeach President Donald Trump following last week's riot at the  US Capitol, assessing that the President is \"no longer qualified to hold that office.\"\n \"I would prefer that we have a more fulsome investigation into what happened. Most of what I know about January 6 came either from personal experience or from Twitter. But at the end of the day, I think it is obvious that the President is no longer qualified to hold that office,\" Meijer told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"Out Front.\"\n Pressed on whether he'd made a definitive decision on impeachment, Meijer maintained that he will \"wait to see the additional evidence presented, but again, this is something we're strongly considering.\"\n His pointed comments came the same day Democrats formally introduced their impeachment resolution, charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" as they race toward making him the first president in history to be impeached twice. The chamber will vote on the resolution Wednesday.\n While some GOP lawmakers have called on Trump to resign -- notably Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania -- Meijer's public position is a notable break from the majority of House Republicans who are urging Democrats not to pursue impeachment, arguing such a move would be divisive.\n Instead, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in a letter to GOP colleagues, listed four potential responses to the January 6 attack. McCarthy, citing feedback from members, floated the possibility of \"a resolution of censure under the rules of the House,\" as well as a bipartisan commission to investigate riots, according to the letter. He did not specify who would be censured.\n But Meijer -- who replaced Justin Amash, the Republican-turned-independent former congressman who supported Trump's first impeachment -- said Monday Trump's response to the Capitol breach amounted to an \"abject failure of leadership\" and that while some colleagues have told him they are concerned about the timing of the impeachment process, he hasn't heard anyone \"arguing the merits.\"\n Drawing on his personal experience as an Iraq war veteran, Meijer added that he's \"deeply\" worried about more violence in the coming weeks as the country grapples with \"a vacuum of leadership.\"\n \"Right now we just have silence. That's incredibly worrisome,\" he said. \"I'm very worried about the violence not only that's occurred already which was horrific, it could have been far worse, but also I go forward with the expectation there will be more violence.\"\n CNN's Jeremy Herb, Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

        "title": "House Democrats to fine lawmakers who don't wear masks on the floor after 3 Dems test positive and blame GOP colleagues",
        "body_text": "House Democrats plan on setting up a system to fine members who don't wear masks on the House floor after three Democrats said they tested positive for Covid-19 after sheltering in place with other members of Congress who did not wear masks during the violent attack on the US Capitol last week.\n A senior House Democratic aide told CNN on Tuesday that a procedural vote on the resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office will also include the fine system. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has required that masks be worn on the floor, but those rules are occasionally flouted by some House Republicans.\n There will be a $500 fine for a first offense and a $2,500 fine for a second offense. The fines will be deducted from lawmakers' pay, the aide said.\n The fine system comes after Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Brad Schneider of Illinois announced their positive test results early this week.\n \"Following the events of Wednesday, including sheltering with several colleagues who refused to wear masks, I decided to take a Covid test. I have tested positive,\" Coleman tweeted Monday.\n A statement from her office said that the congresswoman \"believes she was exposed during protective isolation in the US Capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots. As reported by multiple news outlets, a number of members within the space ignored instructions to wear masks.\"\n Jayapal tweeted early Tuesday morning that she \"received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one.\"\n CNN has previously reported that six House Republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the US Capitol insurrection.\n An aide told CNN that Watson Coleman was in the room in the secure location with the six conservative Republicans who refused to wear masks.\n \"Unfortunately, I received a positive COVID-19 test this morning following being tested yesterday on the advice of the House Attending Physician,\" Schneider said in a statement Tuesday.\n \"Last Wednesday, after narrowly escaping a violent mob incited by the President of the United States to attack the Capitol and its occupants, I was forced to spend several hours in a secure but confined location with dozens of other Members of Congress. Several Republican lawmakers in the room adamantly refused to wear a mask,\" the congressman said.\n \"Today, I am now in strict isolation, worried that I have risked my wife's health and angry at the selfishness and arrogance of the anti-maskers who put their own contempt and disregard for decency ahead of the health and safety of their colleagues and our staff. I am at least the third Member from that room paying the price, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a 75-year-old cancer survivor,\" he said.\n Democratic Reps. Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Anthony Brown of Maryland introduced a bill on Tuesday that would impose $1,000 fines on any lawmakers who refuse to wear a mask on Capitol grounds amid the pandemic.\n \"We're done playing games. Either have some common sense and wear a damn mask or pay a fine. It's not that complicated,\" Dingell said in a statement.\n Lawmakers and Capitol staff on Sunday received a memo from the Capitol's attending physician warning of a possible risk of Covid-19 exposure after a large group of lawmakers were forced to gather in a secure location during the breach of the US Capitol.\n \"On Wednesday January 6, many members of the House community were in protective isolation in (a) room located in a large committee hearing space. The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others. During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection,\" Dr. Brian P. Monahan wrote.\n In the memo, Monahan instructed lawmakers and staff to monitor for possible Covid-19 symptoms and to be tested for Covid-19 as a precaution.\n This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n CNN's Keri Enriquez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Key arrests from the Capitol riot so far",
        "body_text": "Twenty federal criminal defendants related to last week's deadly pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol have been rounded up across the country since the insurrection, with the allegations showing the danger of the mob.\n Some of the defendants are accused of bringing weapons and bombs to Capitol Hill, indicative of the extremism of parts of the crowd. Others were photographed ransacking the building, smiling while posing with congressional items such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern or at her staffer's desk, or publicly bragged about the crowd's violent and destructive joyride.\n The most unsettling of the allegations so far appear to be those against Lonnie Coffman, an Alabama man charged after authorities found 11 homemade bombs, an assault rifle and a handgun in his truck parked two blocks from the Capitol. The truck had sat there all morning during the pro-Trump rally, and Coffman was arrested as he tried to return to the vehicle after dusk.\n In another startling complaint, Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr. is accused of writing in text messages that he wanted to shoot House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that he had brought hundreds of rounds of ammunition and three guns to Washington, DC, having driven from Colorado, according to court records.\n On Sunday night, authorities arrested two more men, Eric Munchel of Tennessee and Larry Rendell Brock of Texas. Both had drawn attention online because of photos showing them wearing body armor inside the Capitol building and carrying plastic ties that could restrain a person.\n Munchel, who was arrested Sunday, had been first stopped by law enforcement on January 6 because he was carrying a Taser for self-protection while attending the rally, according to his newly released charging documents.\n The FBI followed images of Munchel leaving the hotel without a face mask and carrying a drink just before President Donald Trump began to speak that day to his supporters.\n Munchel is charged with entering restricted grounds of the Capitol and violent entry or disorderly conduct. He has not yet appeared in federal court in DC, where he is charged.\n As new details emerge, it has become obvious that lawmakers faced more imminent danger than was understood as the attack unfolded on live television.\n \"What was going through my head was frankly terror,\" Democratic Rep. Susan Wild said on CNN's New Day last week after having to take shelter on the floor of the House.\n \"We were trapped ... I had a pen in my pocket that I could use as a weapon and was looking for other weapons as well\" as the vicious crowd breached the building, Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, who served as an Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan, also said in the CNN \"New Day\" interview.\n The top federal prosecutor in Washington, DC, Michael Sherwin, said he expected hundreds of people could be charged in the aftermath of the attack, and investigations may take months to understand it fully.\n \"I would not be surprised if we find loose affiliations of groups that were organized and had plans in place,\" Sherwin said Sunday. \"We saw in some of these individuals we identified -- they look paramilitary almost, right? You've got the uniform, you've got communication, you have all the paraphernalia. Those show indications of affiliation and a command-and-control. So I believe we are going to find those hallmarks.\"\n One of the federal defendants so far, Jacob Chansley -- who wore into the Capitol no shirt, a bearskin headdress, face paint and horns and was captured in many images of the crowd -- has already told the FBI he came to Washington \"as a part of a group effort, with other 'patriots' from Arizona, at the request of the President that all 'patriots' come to D.C. on January 6, 2021,\" according to his court documents.\n Others charged with taking part in the melee, such as Proud Boys Hawaii founder Nick Ochs and Joshua Pruitt, who is identified in a November video reciting an oath to the Proud Boys, appeared to have allied with fringe groups like the Proud Boys and QAnon that have followed Trump.\n Ochs, who was charged with one count of unlawful entry into restricted buildings or grounds, was released from jail Monday ahead of his next court date.\n In court in Honolulu on Monday, Magistrate Judge Wes Reber Porter found that Ochs had no prior convictions and granted a $5,000 bond. Ochs' attorney, Myles Breiner, told CNN that Ochs was set free on a \"signature bond,\" meaning he did not have to put up any money for release.\n Ochs was arrested last Thursday at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu as he was returning from Washington. Investigators cited his interview with CNN and a tweeted photo captioned \"Hello from the Capital lol\" in their charging document.\n The magistrate judge ordered Ochs to remain on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, where he lives, prior to his next court appearance on January 27 before a magistrate in Washington.\n Several others who were not charged with crimes have lost their jobs for attending the rally at which Trump spoke. One man, Derrick Evans, resigned from his recently won seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates after federal prosecutors charged him. He said he took responsibility for his actions -- which included allegedly livestreaming his entry into the Capitol building and shouting \"We're in! We're in, baby!\" A man later approached him and shakes his hand, saying, \"Welcome to Congress.\"\n Several of the federal defendants are set to appear in court for initial proceedings and detention hearings in the coming days, with more arrests likely to come that may reveal how armed and prepared others in the crowd were.\n None of the 20 federal defendants have been formally indicted by a grand jury yet, a process that is likely to provide more details publicly about the seriousness of the breach.\n The far-ranging criminal investigation is still at its earliest stages. Sherwin said on Sunday hundreds of people could be charged, while the FBI has released more than 40 images of people inside or around the Capitol it seeks help to identify.\n That includes a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters buildings near the Capitol. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 to help with finding the person.\n CNN's Andy Rose and Caroline Kelly contributed to this report.",

WarnerMedia is the parent company of CNN.\n Stars Parker, Nixon and Davis all teased a trailer for the new series to their Instagram pages, though the preview, which featured shots of New York City alongside the text \"And just like that... the story continues...\" gave little detail about potential story lines for the women.\n Based on the book by Candace Bushnell, the groundbreaking HBO series about four friends living in New York City premiered on HBO on June 6, 1998 and ran until 2004.

Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, all of whom will attend the inauguration on January 20.\n \"This inauguration marks a new chapter for the American people -- one of healing, of unifying, of coming together, of an America united,\" said Tony Allen, the committee's chief executive officer. \"It is time to turn the page on this era of division. The inaugural activities will reflect our shared values and serve as a reminder that we are stronger together than we are apart, just as our motto 'e pluribus unum' reminds us -- out of many, one.\"\n President Donald Trump announced he will not attend the ceremony. A source with knowledge says first lady Melania Trump is also not expected to attend, joining her husband as they leave Washington the day before for their Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, though the source cautioned that plans could change.\n Former President Jimmy Carter -- who, at 96, is America's oldest living president -- will not be there as he is unable to travel, and neither will former first lady Rosalynn Carter.\n Vice President Mike Pence will attend the inauguration, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n As Biden's team continues to urge Americans not to gather in the nation's capital for the inauguration in light of the pandemic, the inaugural committee announced that it will install an \"extensive public art display\" on the National Mall, which will include thousands of US flags, along with flags representing each state and territory, and 56 pillars of light.\n Biden ran on a message of hope and unity, urging Americans from the launch of his campaign to band together despite differences that continue to tear at the nation's fabric. He has continued to carry that message as his central theme, stressing its importance as the key to overcoming the multiple crises plaguing the country.",

        "title": "This Republican senator is apparently totally unfamiliar with Donald Trump",
        "body_text": "Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt offered a very odd warning to President Donald Trump on Sunday.\n Here it is:\n \"The President should be very careful over the next 10 days that his behavior is what you'd expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. Now, my personal view is that the President touched the hot stove on Wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again.\"\n Oh man! Look out, President Trump! You had better not incite another riot that leads to the storming of the Capitol! But you probably won't because you learned your lesson!\n It's the last part of Blunt's warning that, to me, is the most disconnected from the reality of who we know Donald Trump to be.\n He touched the stove? And he's not going to touch it again?\n There's absolutely nothing in how Trump acted amid the overrunning of the Capitol -- or how he had conducted himself over the past four years in the White House -- that backs up Blunt's idea that Trump has been somehow daunted by what happened over the past week.\n Let's start with last week. As his supporters swarmed the Capitol building, did Trump dissuade them? No! Quite the opposite! Tweeted Trump: \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\"\n And then there's what Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Friday about the President's behavior during the insurrection: \"As this was unfolding on television, Donald Trump was walking around the White House confused about why other people on his team weren't as excited as he was as you had rioters pushing against Capitol Police trying to get into the building.\"\n Trump wasn't chastened! He was confused that people weren't more celebratory amid the Capitol riot!\n Which is in keeping with how Trump has acted during not just his entire presidency but his entire life.\n Remember back in April 2016 when Trump pledged that he would \"be so presidential ... you will be so bored\"? Or how, after every marginally normal speech, his congressional enablers insisted he was turning over a new leaf and would be a more measured presence? Or how, after major crises like his botched handling of the white supremacist riot in Charlottesville, Virginia, or his poor performance in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic we were told that he got it now and would behave himself?\n All of that was total bull. Because who Donald Trump is today is who he has always been. Go back and read articles about him as a young businessman in the 1980s. He was exactly the same person -- hugely full of himself, spinning a web of exaggerations (and lies) about his successes and using absolutely every tool at his disposal to reward his friends and punish his enemies.\n The idea that Trump would change once he came to the White House ignored human nature. The fundamental core of people rarely, if ever, changes. And that goes double (or triple) for a wealthy and deeply vain businessman who has just been elected president. Trump's election didn't make him consider how he could act differently. It convinced him that how he acted and treated people was entirely justified.\n There was never any Trump 2.0 waiting around the corner -- no matter how much Blunt and the rest of the GOP establishment wanted there to be. There was only Trump and he had zero interest in ever changing his behavior.\n So, no, Trump will not recoil in the face of criticism following the Capitol riot. If past is prologue, he will find ways to dig even deeper -- absolutely certain that he is right and everyone else is wrong.",

Sign up here.)\n Since last week's violent breach at the US Capitol, President Trump has been banned from Twitter and other social media outlets. Companies have distanced themselves from him in other ways,\u00a0and Trump is facing the very real possibility of becoming the first president ever to be impeached twice. Since there are only a few days left in his presidency, impeachment proceedings for Trump, led by House Democrats, could stretch into the Biden administration. Meanwhile, federal authorities are looking into the planning and coordination\u00a0among Capitol insurgents, including members of law enforcement and the military. Officials are also planning for the possibility of more violence leading up to next Wednesday's inauguration, and as part of a security ramp-up, members of Congress will get increased security as they travel through airports. One more social media note: Parler, the alternative app favored by conservatives, has been booted by Amazon, Apple and Google for posts inciting violence.\n We're at a strange stage of the coronavirus vaccine rollout. In nations where vaccines have been authorized, criticism is mounting over shortages and delays in getting the shots into people's arms. However, some hospitals in the US have had to throw out doses (remember, the vaccines have to be kept in cold storage) because their supply and demand levels don't match up. Countries are also struggling to keep up with new coronavirus variants, and in the US, that effort is complicated by out-of-date data. Because the US is so slow at collecting virus samples, compared with other countries, the data used to track the variants is several months old.\n The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden is nine days away, and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser has asked the Trump administration for emergency funding to bolster security ahead of the event. President Trump has said he will not attend, making him only the fourth President to boycott his successor's inauguration. (The other three? Van Buren, Wilson and Nixon.) Mike Pence, however, has said he will attend, further underscoring the critical break between Trump and his VP. The event will be significantly pared down in the face of the pandemic. Usually, 200,000 tickets are offered up to spectators. But this year, the event will be largely virtual, and members of Congress will receive tickets for themselves and one guest only. Meantime, Biden continues to build his leadership team, this morning naming respected veteran American diplomat William Burns as his nominee for director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency is still searching for some of the 62 people aboard Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, which crashed into the ocean Saturday shortly after taking off from Jakarta. Rescuers have located the black box flight recorder from the Boeing 737-500, but their recovery efforts have been largely hampered by debris in the water. The Boeing 737-500 model that crashed is not the same as the 737 Max, and it does not have the flawed cockpit software that contributed to two fatal 737 Max crashes. Still, the wreck is the latest tragedy to plague Indonesia's burgeoning airline sector. In 2007, the European Union banned all 51 Indonesian airlines from its airspace after a crash killed 140 people; the airlines were reinstated in 2018.\n US federal prosecutors say Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez helped an alleged drug trafficker deliver thousands of kilos of cocaine to the United States in exchange for hefty bribes, allegedly vowing he was going to \"shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos.\" Court documents allege Hern\u00e1ndez and other top officials took bribes while he was running for the presidency in 2013, and in exchange offered military support and the use of the country's armed forces \"as security\" for drug-running operations. Hern\u00e1ndez has not been charged and called the claims \"100% false.\" The Honduran President in 2019 admitted he had been investigated by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Allegations surfacing in this US drug trafficking investigation have renewed calls among Hondurans for Hern\u00e1ndez's resignation.\n C'mon intelligence agencies, don't be shy.\n Condolences to all the people who moved to the South specifically to avoid heavy, wet snow.\n He's either the Green Bay Packers guy or the State Farm guy, depending on what part of the football game you watch.\n He'll probably have no idea what's going on, but he'll be very excited to be a part of it.\n Hold on to your crispy breading, an unexpected challenger has appeared!\n That's about how many Americans have been out of work for at least six months due to the persistent economic challenges of the pandemic.\n \"No matter who is in power in the US, the true nature and the true spirit of the anti-North Korea policy will never change.\"\n North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who says his country is building new tactical nukes and advanced warheads to deter US engagement\n He was the one inside Jabba the Hutt, and he was pulling the strings on Yoda when he was just 19.

        "body_text": "The Ford Mustang Mach-E won the 2021 North American SUV of the Year Award. The award was presented in an online ceremony Monday along with the North American Truck of the Year and Car of the Year awards.\n The awards are voted on by a jury of 50 automotive journalists from publications and shows such as MotorWeek, CNet, and Car and Driver who make their selections from the all-new and substantially redesigned vehicles for the new model year. This year, 43 models were eligible for the award and more than half of those were some sort of SUV, said Gary Witzenburg, president of the North American Car, Truck and Utility of the Year Awards.\n The awards committee narrowed those down to three finalists for each of the three awards.\n For the SUV of the Year award, the Mach-E beat out the Genesis GV80, a large luxury SUV produced by Hyundai, and the Land Rover Defender, which had already been named \"SUV of the Year\" by Motor Trend, an automotive enthusiast magazine.\n \"The Mustang Mach-E leapfrogs European [electric vehicles] as the Tesla Model Y's most formidable challenger yet,\" said Detroit News auto critic Henry Payne, one of the jurors.\n The Mach-E is priced similarly to the Model Y and also offers similar performance.\n The redesigned Hyundai Elantra, won the Car of the Year award, beating the Genesis G80 full size luxury car and the Nissan Sentra compact car.\n While some automakers are dropping out of the compact car market altogether due to declining sales, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, chief operating officer of Hyundai, said the Korean automaker is still committed to that market segment. Younger buyers, in particular, still prefer small, inexpensive cars like the Elantra, he said.\n \"We firmly believe in this segment and we will continue to invest and create great products within it,\" he said.",

        "body_text": "Wall Street banks are shaking up their offerings in Hong Kong, pulling the plug on hundreds of products to comply with the US ban on several Chinese businesses.\n Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) will delist certain products over the course of this month, according to Hong Kong Stock Exchange filings.\n Fund manager State Street Global Advisors said in a statement that its Hang Seng (HSI) index tracker TraHK will no longer invest in businesses deemed to be affiliated with or supporting the Chinese military that have been sanctioned under President Donald Trump's November executive order.\n Meanwhile, BlackRock (BLK) said in a note to clients that its iShares ETFs have also been adjusted in accordance with the underlying indexes response to the sanctions.\n Last week, the New York Stock Exchange banned Chinese telecom companies to comply with the executive order -- although only after flip-flopping on the issue multiple times. The reason for NYSE's initial indecision remains unclear, but it isn't a great look for the worlds' largest stock market. And despite the apparent hesitation, China Mobile (CHL), China Telecom (CHA) and China Unicom (CHU) ceased trading Monday.\n Trump also signed an executive order last week banning transactions with eight Chinese payment apps, including Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Group's Alipay. On top of that, the White House is considering prohibiting Americans from investing in Alibaba and Tencent (TCEHY), though it's unclear how likely it is that this ban will come to fruition.\n The outgoing Trump administration hasn't made it easy to keep up with the government's view on Chinese firms doing business in the United States. The failed executive orders to ban TikTok and WeChat are prime examples.\n Trump's term is coming to an end, but President-elect Joe Biden isn't expected to reverse the government's position on China when he takes office later this month.\n \"There is bipartisan pressure to remain tough on China,\"  said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen, noting that Biden will have \"much bigger priorities to advance, such as secure another stimulus [package].\"\n This could mean US capital markets, as well as accessing the US consumer base, could continue to be a tricky task for Chinese companies.\n In fact, Biden could get even tougher on China, Seiberg said.\n \"That could include asking Congress to shorten the three-year period Chinese companies have to open their audits to inspections before US exchanges have to delist them.\"",

        "body_text": "Prince Charles is leading a fresh charge to tackle the climate crisis, this time with the support of several major companies including Bank of America (BAC) and BP (BP).\n The Prince of Wales is launching a \"Terra Carta,\" or Earth Charter, and urging other firms to commit to practical action to set the planet on a more sustainable trajectory. One goal is to direct $10 billion to green causes by 2022.\n The charter, which will be unveiled during the One Planet Summit in Paris on Monday, seeks to protect the world's natural resources and accelerate the transition to a greener future. It contains nearly 100 actions that businesses can take, including a commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner and protecting natural ecosystems.\n BlackRock (BLK), AstraZeneca (AZN), EY, Unilever (UL), Heathrow Airport, HSBC (HBCYF) and Fidelity International are also supporting the initiative.\n In an exclusive interview with CNN Business on Monday, Prince Charles said that \"we have to be much more ambitious\" and bring forward efforts to achieve net zero emissions from 2050 to 2035. Very few listed companies have climate action plans in place and there are still \"a lot more people to convince,\" he told Richard Quest of Quest Means Business.\n The fact that the United States is poised to rejoin the Paris Agreement under President-elect Joe Biden \"will make an enormous difference and help to leverage even further support around the world,\" he added.\n A lifelong environmentalist and heir to the British throne, the Prince of Wales warned at last year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that the planet faces disaster without a revolution in the way the global economy and financial markets work.\n \"What good is all the extra wealth in the world, gained from 'business as usual,' if you can do nothing with it except watch it burn in catastrophic conditions?,\" he said in an interview with CNN at the annual gathering of the global elite.\n At that event, he launched the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), co-chaired by Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, to put people and planet \"at the heart of global value creation.\"\n It will direct money to businesses that try to harness or preserve the power of nature, such as those using nature-based materials or deploying zero waste strategies. It will also seek to capitalize on the growing number of companies investing in sustainable development projects in order to offset carbon emissions and reach net zero targets.\n \u2014 Richard Quest contributed reporting.",

        "title": "Impeaching Trump is only the start",
        "body_text": "Lincoln Mitchell (@LincolnMitchell) teaches in the political science department at Columbia University. His most recent book is \"San Francisco Year Zero: Political Upheaval Punk Rock and a Third-Place Baseball Team.\" (Rutgers University Press, 2019) The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nFollowing the violent storming of the Capitol by pro-Trump demonstrators, Democrats are preparing for an unprecedented second impeachment of Donald Trump. The argument for impeaching him is relatively straightforward: that he incited an insurrection and, as demonstrated last Wednesday, he remains a threat to the stability and national security of the country.\n It is imperative that there should be some consequence for Trump's behavior. The question for Americans now is how best to impose them. Predictably, opponents of impeachment have argued both that there is simply too little time remaining in his term, but also that impeachment would further destabilize a highly polarized country.\n Because Trump's term expires in only a few days, the issue of timing cannot be ignored. it would be difficult to complete the impeachment and removal from office process before noon on January 20, when Joseph Biden will become president.\n However, the substantive point that impeachment would not allow the country to move forward is deeply flawed. It suggests the choice is between either moving forward toward restoring some kind of normalcy or remaining focused on the Trump era and adjudicating the past.\n This choice is false. The only way we can move forward and restore rule of law is by having some kind of process to document what occurred during the Trump era, how it culminated in violence that left five dead and ensuring that it has consequences for those responsible.\n Failing to do this would send a message that inciting people to take to the streets of Washington, DC for a \"wild\" protest that led to them breaking into the Capitol, threatening the lives of those inside and disrupting one of the most important functions of government -- ensuring that the winners of elections are able to take office -- is somehow not that big of a problem.\n The question of whether or not to impeach Trump is best understood as part of the need for a larger transitional justice process following the end of his administration. One of the unintended consequences of another impeachment, which could even occur after Trump leaves office, is that by focusing the inquiry too narrowly on the soon-to-be former President, the public would pay less attention to the role that others in the administration may have played in facilitating these events.\n A post-Trump presidency impeachment which, as some have called for, includes a ban on him seeking office again, might bring premature and incomplete closure to this ugly chapter of American democracy.\n There can be little doubt that the country remains polarized and that, despite comments from some prominent Republicans, no consensus has emerged about either the riot at the Capitol or the Trump presidency more broadly. This is what makes the idea of moving forward and not revisiting the Trump era so appealing.\n However, burying the avarice, corruption, alleged crimes and democratic rollback that characterized the Trump presidency because a large, loud and at times violent minority does not see it that way only lets the problems and polarization fester further.\n By contrast, learning the truth about the last four years and holding key actors responsible is essential to restoring the rule of law, the integrity of our political institutions and to meaningful movement beyond the Trump era.\n There are many possible forms a transitional justice project could take. The Department of Justice could launch an investigation into not just the events of January 6 and Trump's effort to intimidate Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, but also other possible criminal activity in the White House such as the business dealings of the Trump family.\n This approach might satisfy some critics of Trump who just want to see more people from the President's circle in prison, but the bar for convictions on all of these charges is high.\n Additionally, high-profile criminal cases such as those involving tax write-offs would be unlikely either to bring the country together or shed enough light on what occurred over the previous four years. Moreover, a narrow focus on indictable federal crimes would not be a sufficient reckoning with the impact of the Trump years.\n Another possible approach would be to establish high-level inquiries similar to truth and reconciliation commissions that have been convened in countries like South Africa. Ideally, these would be chaired by respected retired leaders from both parties and including representatives from sectors like civil society, the military, clergy and activist groups.\n It might be best to establish one large commission to look into the entire administration. Another approach would be to establish several smaller commissions. There might, for example, be one on the January 6 insurrection, one focusing on the administration's catastrophic mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis, one on allegations of corruption in the Trump administration and perhaps others as well.\n The primary functions of these commissions would be to record what occurred during the Trump presidency and to articulate ways to balance the need for legal consequences with the need to move forward.\n The commissions could begin to do this by taking statements and testimonies from witnesses, experts, people who worked in or close to the administration and even those effected by the policies and missteps of the administration. This information could be rapidly shared with the American people through commission websites and various media platforms.\n It is critical that these commissions not only establish the fact of what occurred during the Trump years, but that they are empowered to recommend indictments as well.\n It is true that America must move forward, but it's dangerous to believe that it can only do that by ignoring the recent past. American democracy can only be rebuilt and strengthened when we begin by processing not just how close we came to losing it, but the extent to which not just one man, but many around him, including the leadership of one of our major political parties, may have contributed to that.\n If we ignore that, we don't simply run the risk of it happening again. We all but guarantee it.",

        "title": "Enraged Trump may lash out at big tech after Twitter ban but plans not final",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump is itching to lash out at Big Tech after many companies banned him from their platforms and could deliver public remarks at some point Monday but plans haven't been finalized, people familiar with the matter say.\n Trump's suspension from Twitter in particular has enraged the President, who spent the weekend apoplectic about what he's determined is illegal censorship by the company. He has signaled internally a desire to try executive actions to punish Silicon Valley but it's unclear what precisely that would look like.\n Trump is expected to award the Medal of Freedom to Rep. Jim Jordan,R-Ohio, at the White House on Monday and to New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick on Thursday. His visit to the Texas border town Alamo comes Tuesday.\n Between those events, aides are trying to convince Trump to hold events celebrating his legacy items like helping broker normalization agreements in the Middle East, rolling back regulations and taking a hard line on China.\n He has not shown as much enthusiasm for those but they are still possible between now and when he is expected to leave the White House on January 19.\n Trump and some of his top aides spent part of the weekend phoning Republican allies in Congress to ask them to come out against a second impeachment, which Democrats are intent with pressing forward with. Trump and his allies have argued the country doesn't support it.\n In some conversations, Trump has told allies he does not believe he should be blamed for what happened at the US Capitol on Wednesday, saying he never intended for the crowd to turn violent.\n As a result of Wednesday's riot, five people have died, including a Capitol Police officer. Some of Trump's supporters were armed and ready for war: an Alabama man allegedly parked a pickup truck with 11 homemade bombs, an assault rifle and a handgun two blocks from the Capitol hours before authorities discovered it, according to federal prosecutors.\n Another man allegedly showed up with an assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, telling acquaintances he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pipe bombs were found near the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee as authorities tried to dispel the mob and secure the Capitol.\n Trump appears no more aware of the consequences of his actions than on the day of the riot when he delighted in the mayhem. Bunkered at the White House with an ever-shrinking circle of aides, he has offered no remorse for inciting the crowd and offered only a forced denunciation of their actions. Aides, weary and disgusted, refuse to come near him.",

        "title": "A distant galaxy dies as astronomers watch",
        "body_text": "Galaxies die when the stars that live in them stop forming. Now, for the first time, astronomers have witnessed this phenomenon in a distant galaxy.\n Scientists were able to glimpse a galaxy as it ejected almost half of the gas it uses to form stars. They captured this rare observation using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of telescopes in Chile.\n The light from this galaxy, known as ID2299, has taken about nine billion years to reach Earth. That means astronomers are essentially observing how it appeared when the universe was only 4.5 billion years old (it's now an estimated 14 billion years old).\n The ID2299 galaxy is losing 10,000 suns-worth of gas per year, which is diminishing the fuel it needs to form stars by removing 46% of the galaxy's total cold gas so far.\n But the galaxy is still quickly forming stars at a rate that is hundreds of times faster than our own Milky Way, which will use up the rest of the gas in the galaxy. This will effectively cause ID2299 to die in a few tens of million years.\n The study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n \"This is the first time we have observed a typical massive star-forming galaxy in the distant Universe about to 'die' because of a massive cold gas ejection,\" said Annagrazia Puglisi, lead study researcher and postdoctoral research associate from Durham University in the UK and the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre in France, in a statement.\n It's possible that this galaxy's demise was caused by a collision with another galaxy, which eventually merged to create ID2299.\n The telling evidence that a collision may have led to a loss of gas is a tidal tail, which is a long stream of gas and stars that extend out into space after two galaxies come together in a collision.\n Typically, these tidal tails are too faint to be seen in such distant galaxies, but the astronomers were able to observe the bright tail as it was extending out into space.\n If a merger led to this galaxy's loss of gas, astronomers may need to reconsider theories on the end of star formation in galaxies. Previously, scientists have believed that the winds created by the formation of stars, combined with active black holes at the centers of giant galaxies, sent the material needed to form stars hurtling out into space and ending star formation.\n \"Our study suggests that gas ejections can be produced by mergers and that winds and tidal tails can appear very similar,\" said Emanuele Daddi, study coauthor and astronomer at the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre in France. \"This might lead us to revise our understanding of how galaxies 'die.' \"\n Perhaps the best part about this discovery is that it was made while the astronomers were working on a different survey of cold gas in distant galaxies. They only observed ID2299 for a few minutes, but it was enough to capture the tidal tail.\n Future observations of the galaxy could reveal more about the gas being ejected from the galaxy.\n \"ALMA has shed new light on the mechanisms that can halt the formation of stars in distant galaxies. Witnessing such a massive disruption event adds an important piece to the complex puzzle of galaxy evolution,\" said Chiara Circosta, study coauthor and researcher at the University College London, in a statement.",

        "title": "This snake turns its body into a lasso to climb up smooth surfaces",
        "body_text": "Snake-haters, look away -- and, whatever you do, don't look up.\n Scientists have discovered that brown tree snakes can use a lasso-like movement to climb large, smooth cylindrical objects -- a way of moving never seen before in the reptiles.\n Experts from Colorado State University and the University of Cincinnati made the discovery by chance while working on a project aimed at protecting the nests of Micronesian starlings on Guam -- one of only two native species remaining on the island.\n People accidentally introduced brown tree snakes to the Western Pacific territory in the 1940s-50s, and the invasive species has since decimated forest bird populations on the island, as well as being responsible for power outages.\n Using a three-foot metal baffle -- often used to keep birds safe from racoons and other snakes -- researchers attempted to keep the tree snakes from climbing up to bird boxes.\n Snakes generally use one of four types of locomotion -- known as rectilinear, lateral undulation, sidewinding and concertina modes -- in order to move. When climbing steep and smooth surfaces, like branches or pipes, the animals typically use a \"concertina\" movement, bending sideways to grip in at least two places.\n But by \"lassoing,\" the snakes are able to form a single gripping region, with little bends formed in the loop of the lasso, allowing them to advance slowly upward, researchers said.\n \"We didn't expect that the brown tree snake would be able to find a way around the baffle,\" study co-author Thomas Seibert, of Colorado State University, said.\n \"Initially, the baffle did work, for the most part,\" Seibert said. But after four hours of video footage, \"all of a sudden, we saw this snake form what looked like a lasso around the cylinder and wiggle its body up. We watched that part of the video about 15 times. It was a shocker. Nothing I'd ever seen compares to it,\" he said.\n Researchers say this way of moving isn't necessarily easy for the snakes, which often slipped, moved slowly, breathed heavily and stopped to rest.\n \"Even though they can climb using this mode, it is pushing them to the limits,\" said co-senior author Bruce Jayne of the University of Cincinnati.\n But however difficult, researchers say the movement allows the reptiles to attack unsuspecting prey, and could explain how they are able to climb power poles, which leads to electrical outages.\n \"Understanding what brown tree snakes can and cannot climb has direct implications for designing barriers to reduce the dispersal and some of the deleterious effects of this highly invasive species,\" Jayne said.\n The researchers say they want to use their new knowledge of how the snakes move to better protect birds in the area.\n \"Given that brown tree snakes can use lasso locomotion to defeat poles or cylinders of a certain size,\" Seibert said, \"we can design baffles to better protect bird houses used for restoring some of Guam's birds.\"\n The study was published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",

        "body_text": "A common parasite people get from contaminated water and undercooked meat may be associated with rare brain cancers, researchers reported Monday.\n They found evidence that people infected with Toxoplasma gondii, or T. gondii, have a higher risk of developing rare but highly fatal gliomas.\n The parasite can sometimes form cysts in the brain and the inflammation associated with these cysts might be responsible, the researchers reported in the International Journal of Cancer.\n A team of researchers led by epidemiologist James Hodge, of the American Cancer Society's department of population science, and Anna Coghill, of the department of cancer epidemiology at the H. Lee Moffit Cancer Center and Research Institute in Florida, looked at the association between antibodies for T. gondii in blood samples and the risk of glioma in two groups of people.\n The study involved 111 individuals enrolled in the American Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort and 646 people listed in the Norwegian Cancer Registry.\n \"In both cohorts, we observed a suggestive positive association between seropositivity for T. gondii antibodies and glioma risk,\" the researchers wrote. The glioma associations were stronger for the people who had higher levels of T. gondii antibodies.\n T. gondii is a common parasite that most commonly infects people through contaminated food or water from raw or undercooked meat from infected animals. Twenty percent to 50% of the global population have been exposed to the parasite, according to the study.\n Gliomas make up the majority -- 80% -- of malignant brain tumors. Glioblastomas are the most common subtype. Glioblastomas have five-year relative survival rates of only 5%.\n \"Our findings provide the first prospective evidence of an association between T. gondii infection and risk of glioma, results that should be confirmed in independent studies,\" the researchers wrote.\n \"This does not mean that T. gondii definitely causes glioma in all situations. Some people with glioma have no T. gondii antibodies, and vice versa,\" Hodge said in a statement.\n \"The findings do suggest that individuals with higher exposure to the T. gondii parasite are more likely to go on to develop glioma,\" added Coghill. \"However, it should be noted that the absolute risk of being diagnosed with a glioma remains low, and these findings need to be replicated in a larger and more diverse group of individuals.\"\n If the findings of the study are replicated, \"reducing exposure to this common food-borne pathogen would offer the first tangible opportunity for prevention of this highly aggressive brain tumor,\" the researchers said.\n CNN's Katie Hunt contributed to this report.",

And President Trump's cheering section is desperately trying to bury the riot down the memory hole.\n Speaking of memories, let's go back in time. One week ago on our \"Reliable Sources\" telecast, \"On Tyranny\" author Timothy Snyder warned that \"we are now moving dangerously towards the territory of a big lie.\" He said \"the idea that Mr. Biden didn't win the election is a big lie. It's a big lie because you have to disbelieve all kinds of evidence to believe in it. It's a big lie because you have to believe in a huge conspiracy in order to believe it. And it's a big lie because, if you believe it, it demands you take radical action. So this is one way we have really moved forwards towards authoritarianism and away from democracy. It's coming to a peak right now.\"\n Wednesday was the peak -- maybe. Every day, more evidence of the attack comes to light. Much more reporting is still needed. I agree with Yashar Ali, who said Sunday night: \"I feel like we know just 5% of the insurrection story.\"\n But we also need to look ahead. As Jake Tapper said at the end of \"SOTU\" on Sunday: \"Will there be any consequences? Will Kevin McCarthy remain the Republican leader of the House?\" Are Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley \"just going to be allowed to pick up their committee assignments and try to move on? And what about the President of the United States? Will he be allowed to fly out of Washington on January 19th to spend his days luxuriating on the golf course, spreading more lies through the TV networks that were also part of this treason?\"\n Tapper concluded: \"What happens to us? What happens to our country if we continue to pretend leaders who played a role in this attempted coup, in this terrorist attack, end up doing just fine without no consequences at all? Will January 6th, 2021 be remembered as only the beginning?\"\n Was Wednesday the peak, or just the beginning?\n That's what brings me back around to Snyder, whose book has skyrocketed back to #1 on Amazon. He wrote the cover story for next week's New York Times Magazine, and it is already online. The story is another warning, and it inspired the headline of tonight's newsletter.\n \"The lie outlasts the liar,\" Snyder wrote. \"The idea that Germany lost the First World War in 1918 because of a Jewish 'stab in the back' was 15 years old when Hitler came to power. How will Trump's myth of victimhood function in American life 15 years from now? And to whose benefit?\"\n He concluded that \"America will not survive the big lie just because a liar is separated from power. It will need a thoughtful repluralization of media and a commitment to facts as a public good.\" Read on...\n Right now CNN.com's headline says the House \"will move quickly on impeachment if push for 25th Amendment fails.\"\n \"It will be the first time any American president has been impeached for a second time,\" Wolf Blitzer said on air Sunday night.\n \u2192 Big picture: More than 104 hours have elapsed since Trump incited a riot at the Capitol. And he is still in office.",

        "title": "US to designate Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization",
        "body_text": "The Trump administration will designate Yemen's Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization in a move that diplomats, members of Congress and international aid groups fear could further inflame the situation on the ground, upend UN peace talks, and exacerbate the country's humanitarian crisis.\n In a statement released just before midnight Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the State Department would notify Congress of its intent to designate the group as a foreign terrorist organization as well as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity. Pompeo said he also intends to designate three of the group's leaders -- Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi and Abdullah Yahya al Hakim -- as specially designated global terrorists.\n \"These designations will provide additional tools to confront terrorist activity and terrorism by Ansarallah, a deadly Iran-backed militia group in the Gulf region,\" Pompeo said. \"The designations are intended to hold Ansarallah (the Houthi rebels) accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.\"\n Yemen has been embroiled in a years-long civil war that has pitted a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, a Shia political and military organization from the north of Yemen. The conflict has cost thousands of civilian lives and plunged the country into a humanitarian crisis.\n The group's leadership condemned the designations, which were praised by Yemen's Saudi-backed government. The news was also welcomed by the Saudi and Emirati governments -- some sources believe that the designation was a parting gift to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.\n The foreign terrorist designation will go into effect on January 19, just a day before the administration leaves office.\n \"It's a big mistake,\" said former US Ambassador to Yemen Gerald Feierstein. \"It mostly is a problem for the US government more than for the Houthis.\n \"The Houthis will be more or less unaffected by this. Obviously, Iran doesn't care whether we designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization or not,\" he told CNN Monday. \"But it does make it much more complicated for the US government to play a positive role in helping to resolve the conflict.\"\n The move was rebuked by Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Democratic House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks called the designation \"short-sighted\" and accused the administration of politicizing sanctions authorities. Republican Sen. Todd Young said it \"comes at the worst possible time as it will prevent the critical delivery of food, medical supplies, and other items necessary to combat both COVID-19 and famine.\"\n The top Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Michael McCaul, said in a joint statement they \"fully support efforts to compel the Houthis to end their dangerous and destabilizing behavior\" but \"are concerned designating them as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, without mitigation measures in place, will have devastating humanitarian impacts.\"\n One congressional aide said that a Monday call with State Department officials about the action was \"an absolute dumpster fire\" and that the designation appeared rushed out without proper assurances that it wouldn't do significant damage to the ability to deliver crucial outside humanitarian assistance to the war-torn country.\n A State Department spokesperson told CNN they \"don't comment on internal deliberations or our conversations with Congress.\"\n The United Nations warned in December that the number of people facing catastrophic food insecurity could triple in the first six months of 2021, and the opportunity to prevent famine in Yemen \"is slipping away with every day that passes,\" in the words of the World Food Programme executive director.\n Pompeo said in the statement that the United States is \"planning to put in place measures to reduce their impact on certain humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen.\"\n \"We have expressed our readiness to work with relevant officials at the United Nations, with international and non-governmental organizations, and other international donors to address these implications,\" he said.\n A UN spokesperson said they \"are studying the announcement closely to assess its potential impact. But the decision is likely to have serious humanitarian and political repercussions.\"\n International aid groups swiftly condemned the 11th hour move.\n The head of the International Rescue Committee called the decision \"pure diplomatic vandalism.\"\n \"This policy, in the name of tying up the Houthis, will actually tie up the aid community and international diplomacy. The opposite is needed -- effective pressure on all parties to the conflict to cease using civilians as hostages in their war games,\" David Miliband said. \"The further immiseration of Yemenis, which will be the product of this policy, is a disgrace to the name of the US, and will have the perverse result of strengthening precisely the forces it claims to oppose.\"\n Mercy Corps CEO Tjada D'Oyen said the Trump administration's designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization will \"undermine the overstretched humanitarian response in Yemen, threatening the lives of millions of Yemenis who rely on humanitarian assistance.\"\n OXFAM America's humanitarian policy lead, Scott Paul, said this \"dangerous policy will put innocent lives at risk.\"\n The Norwegian Refugee Council said the \"sanctions will hamstring the ability of aid agencies to respond, and without additional safeguards and broader exemptions for the commercial sector, Yemen's faltering economy will be dealt a further devastating blow.\"\n \"Getting food and medicine into Yemen -- a country 80% dependent on imports -- will become even more difficult,\" NRC Yemen Country Director Mohamed Abdi said in a statement on Monday. \"We are calling on the US government to provide unambiguous safeguards and guarantees so that humanitarian aid can still be delivered without delays and across conflict territories regardless of who is in control, and protect aid workers from being criminalized.\"\n Even if humanitarian organizations are able to continue to operate in the country, a source familiar with the situation noted that it could deter the shippers who bring affordable food to the population in Houthi-controlled areas of the country, as the rebels control the docks and customs in the key port city of Hodeidah.\n \"They provide food to 15 million people who are now one step closer to famine because of this,\" this source said.\n Some of the organizations called on President-elect Joe Biden to reverse the decision, with Paul of OXFAM saying, \"in this instance, acting 'on day one' cannot be only a figure of speech, as lives hang in the balance.\"\n Feierstein, the former US ambassador to Yemen who also worked on counterterrorism issues at the State Department, said that while bureaucratically it is possible for Biden to reverse the foreign terrorist organization designation, it is also a question of politics and bandwidth.\n \"You have the Trump administration saying these people are terrorists. That now requires the Biden people to come in and say no they're not terrorists,\" he said. \"And that is fraught, and it requires a political decision that they may not be willing to make.\"\n \"And then the other reality is, look, Joe Biden and his administration are going to have a gazillion things that are going to occupy their time and attention that are going to be higher on their priority list than the Houthi designation. And so it's not so much a question of can they do it, will they do it -- it's also a question of when they can get around to it. And I'm not sure that the answer is going to be very quickly,\" Feierstein said.\n The source familiar echoed this, noting that the incoming administration \"cannot be seen to coddle one of the most abusive insurgent movements in the world.\"\n Houthi leader Mohamed Ali Al Houthi condemned the designation on Twitter Monday, saying \"we reserve the right to respond against any designation issued by the Trump administration, or any other administration.\" He did not provide further detail of how the group is planning to respond.\n The source familiar with the situation said it is likely that the Houthis will retaliate and that they could do so by breaking up UN peace talks, banning UN entities, or taking hostages.\n The UN spokesperson said they \"are concerned that the designations may have a detrimental impact on efforts to resume the political process in Yemen, as well as polarize even more the positions of the parties to the conflict.\"\n \"Notwithstanding possible political repercussions, we will continue to work with all parties to resume and continue an inclusive political process to reach a comprehensive negotiated settlement to end the conflict,\" they said.\n Yemen's Saudi-backed government expressed support for the US government's designation.\n \"[The government] will continue to provide full support to all UN-led efforts to reach a comprehensive peace,\" it said on Twitter.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.\n CNN's Greg Clary, Richard Roth, Mostafa Salem, Hande Atay Alam, Lindsay Isaac, Sam Kiley and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.",

Geely (GELYF), the largest privately-owned carmaker in China, will invest as a strategic partner, added Baidu.\n The new company will use Baidu's autonomous driving technology and Geely's electric vehicle modular platform, Baidu (BIDU) said. Geely confirmed the news on Monday in a separate statement.\n Carmakers are increasingly open to collaboration with rivals and tech companies as they begin seriously to confront the huge challenge of ditching the internal combustion engine to tackle the climate crisis. The investment required to develop electric cars has helped spark a wave of partnerships, with companies teaming up to spread the costs.\n Last week, Hyundai's stock had its best day in at least two decades after the South Korean automaker was reported to be in early talks with Apple to develop electric cars. Shares in Hyundai (HYMTF) continued to surge on Monday, up 8.7%.\n Baidu's car company will focus on passenger vehicles and operate as an independent subsidiary, according to its statement on Monday. Baidu will also utilize its artificial intelligence capabilities and mapping systems.\n Geely, which owns Volvo, said in its statement that the company has been trying to transform from a car manufacturer to \"a tech company\" focused on \"intelligent, electric transport.\"\n No further details about the partnership have been disclosed.\n Shares in Geely hit a record high on Monday before closing down 2.6%. The stock soared nearly 20% on Friday, its best day since November 2008, after Reuters reported the company would team up with Baidu.\n Baidu shares closed higher last Friday on Wall Street, up 16% to $240.25.\n Jill Disis contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Can you smell what \"The Rock\" is cooking?\n The wrestler-turned-actor-turned-entrepreneur is entering the energy drink business with ZOA, a health drink made with natural caffeine and superfoods.\n The venture partners Dwayne Johnson -- aka \"The Rock\" -- with his ex-wife and fellow fitness entrepreneur, Dany Garcia, Garcia's husband Dave Rienzi and beverage industry veteran John Shulman.\n The foursome teamed up with Molson Coors Beverage Company -- the same company that produces some of the country's most popular brands of beer like Coors Lite and Blue Moon -- to distribute the product to retail stores nationwide starting in March.\n \"I'm humbled and grateful for the opportunity to serve our eager consumers with ZOA -- the ultimate healthy and immunity-supporting energy drink that's the first of its kind, thanks to our unique combination of ingredients,\" Johnson said in a news release. \"My co-founders and I spent the last 18 months formulating this healthy and great tasting product that we could all use now more than ever.\"\n This isn't Johnson's first beverage launch, in March of last year the Hollywood star launched Teremana Tequila which quickly broke sales records.\n Even with Johnson's seemingly everlasting energy, it is quite a crowded market to be entering.\n Nearly $13 billion worth of energy drinks were sold last year, a 9.3% increase from the previous year, according to data from Chicago-based Information Resources Inc. Red Bull and Monster Energy accounted for a large majority of those sales.\n What makes ZOA different from the other energy drinks on the market, according to Molson Coors, is that it is the only energy drink that fuels you with the recommended daily amount of vitamin C, D and B.\n \"Each 16-ounce can of ZOA boasts a clean blend of green tea and green unroasted coffee, added electrolytes and amino acids, as well as carefully selected superfoods like turmeric, camu camu and acerola while avoiding any preservatives, artificial ingredients or additives,\" a spokesperson for Molson Coors said.\n For Molson Coors, the launch represents its latest effort to expand beyond beer, a move that has diversified its portfolio to include an expanding roster of non-alcoholic beverages, better-for-you offerings and CBD beverages.\n \"Adding Zoa is another indication of our commitment to transforming Molson Coors into a beverage company,\" Pete Marino, head of the emerging growth division at Molson Coors said. \"We are entering an undoubtedly competitive category but doing so with a product and partner group that offers a tangible point of difference.\"\n If anyone can sell an energy drink in today's market, it's Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.",

        "body_text": "The New York State Bar Association has opened an inquiry into removing Rudy Giuliani from its membership for his role in provoking a pro-Trump mob to storm the US Capitol and attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, the group said Monday.\n The NYSBA is a voluntary bar association that cannot disbar Giuliani, a former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York who is now President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, so the ousting would not prevent him from representing the President in an impeachment trial or other pending litigation against him. But the rare step by the association adds to the layer of criticism Giuliani has faced from the legal community over his defense of Trump.\n Giuliani has continuously spread baseless claims and conspiracy theories about the election despite no evidence of voter fraud.\n \"If we're wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we're right a lot of them will go to jail. Let's have trial by combat,\" Giuliani said at Wednesday's rally.\n The NYSBA, which condemned the siege at the US Capitol, said in a statement that it has received \"hundreds of complaints in recent months\" regarding Giuliani's efforts to challenge the election on Trump's behalf and that his statements at the rally have prompted the group's president, Scott M. Karson, to determine if the attorney should be removed.\n \"This decision is historic for NYSBA, and we have not made it lightly. We cannot stand idly by and allow those intent on rending the fabric of our democracy to go unchecked,\" NYSBA said in a statement.\n CNN reached out to Giuliani for comment Monday.\n According to its bylaws, \"no person who advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States, or of any state, territory or possession thereof, or of any political subdivision therein, by force or other illegal means, shall be a member of the Association.\" And the NYSBA said Guiliani's remarks at the rally were \"intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election's outcome to take matters into their own hands.\"\n \"Their subsequent attack on the Capitol was nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power,\" the NYSBA said.\n Giuliani will have the option to contest his removal and \"explain and defend his words and actions,\" the NYSBA said.\n CNN's Elizabeth Hartfield contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Investigative report offers up-close look at Jacob Blake shooting in Wisconsin",
        "body_text": "The encounter that ended with the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin last summer began with a \"family trouble\" call to 911 from the mother of his children.\n Laquisha Booker had made such calls before, according to an investigative report by Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley, who on Tuesday outlined a review of more than 40 hours of video and hundreds of documents in an effort to determine what happened the day of the shooting.\n Booker's emergency call at 5:10 p.m. on August 23 concluded with Rusten Sheskey, a White Kenosha Police officer, shooting Blake, a 29-year-old Black man who was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n The confrontation, caught on video, became part of a long summer of unrest and racial reckoning in America ignited in part by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.\n The district attorney said he hoped the Blake shooting leads to a \"complicated conversation\" that permits \"all points of views and allows for all the parties -- even those that feel so disenfranchised -- to have a voice.\"\n But criminal charges against Sheskey would be hard to prove, according to Graveley. It would be difficult to convince a jury the officer did not \"reasonably believe that the shooting at Jacob Blake was necessary to prevent being stabbed ... or necessary to prevent someone else from being in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.\"\n \"This case is really all about self-defense and can it be proven that it does not exist,\" he said.\n That Sheskey and two other officers were on a domestic disturbance call was \"urgently important,\" Graveley wrote in the report.\n \"They knew they were responding to a domestic disturbance and they knew the man who was the subject of the call, Jacob Blake, had a warrant for his arrest from a prior incident where he was charged with domestic violence offenses and a sexual assault. Every decision the officers made during this incident, in response to this call, must be interpreted in light of those facts.\"\n Blake's attorneys maintain their client did not pose a threat to police and the decision to not charge the officer fueled the community's longstanding distrust of the justice system.\n Graveley's investigative report and comments he made Tuesday provided the most detailed account of events leading up to the shooting.\n On the 911 call, Booker told a dispatcher that Blake had taken the keys to an SUV she had rented. She feared he would crash it.\n Blake, she told the dispatcher, was \"not supposed to be here. Today is his son's birthday, so I allowed him to spend a couple hours with him, but he's not giving me the keys to this rental. And that's all I'm asking for.\"\n \"Is Jacob there right now?\" the dispatcher asked.\n \"Yes and he is trying to kiss his kids, so he can hurry up and leave. He was here talking all types of crazy and now he's walking off now. Now he's getting ready to leave.\"\n She provided the plate number and repeated that Blake was kissing his children.\n \"He's is pulling off right now,\" she said.\n On a computer screen in their squad cars, the officers learned the complainant said Blake was not supposed to be at the home and had taken the keys to her rented Dodge SUV. They also learned Blake had a felony warrant for domestic violence, disorderly conduct and a felony sexual assault.\n Sheskey told investigators that, as he approached a man on the street, a woman screamed: \"It's him! It's him! He has my keys! It's my car! It's registered to me!\"\n \"I'm taking the kid and I am taking the car,\" the officer recalled the man saying.\n \"Let's talk about this,\" the officer told the man, according to the investigative report.\n Blake reached for his \"waistline area\" at one point, according to Sheskey, who said he believed the man was going for a weapon. Sheskey discharged his Taser but Blake broke the wires with his hand.\n Sheskey said he then placed the Taser's metal ends in the area of Blake's neck and back -- a technique known as \"drive stun\" intended to cause pain but not incapacitate -- but the suspect again slipped away. When Sheskey tried to take Blake down, both men fell to the ground. They got back up and Blake moved to the front of the SUV.\n \"Stop resisting!\" Sheskey said he told Blake numerous times. He said he also made numerous other verbal commands.\n Blake told investigators from his hospital bed that he put his children in the back of the SUV after an argument with their mother. Booker had rented the SUV for him to use while his car was in a repair shop. He said he had a knife and believed the blade was still enclosed, but dropped it to the ground when he was first grabbed by Sheskey.\n \"Why would I pull a knife on a cop?\" said Blake, who spoke with investigators days after the shooting and then again in September. \"What am I? A knife thrower? I ain't going to pull no knife on no damn cop.\"\n He added, \"That's just stupid. I just didn't want to...I just grabbed it, man, honestly.\"\n Blake told investigators that he later picked up the knife after dropping it during the tussle with the officer.\n Blake said he wanted to \"drop\" the knife in the car and did not intend to use it. He was thinking: \"Get in the truck or they are going to kill you,\" according to his statement. He said he opened the driver's side door to put the knife in the center console when he felt his shirt being pulled.\n Blake said \"he did not point the knife at anyone; he did not swing the knife at anyone; he did not make any forward motion towards anyone with the knife; and he did not raise the knife towards anyone,\" according to the report. \"Jacob Blake stated that he did not hold the knife in a way which could be interpreted as being pointed towards anyone, especially the officer.\"\n He believed he was trying to get rid of the knife when he was shot, according to Blake's statement.\n Sheskey told investigators he first saw the knife as Blake moved across the front of the SUV. He ordered him to drop it. Blake then headed for the driver's side door.\n \"I don't know what he is going to do,\" Sheskey recalled thinking to himself at the time, according to his account to investigators.\n \"Is he going to hurt the kid? Is he going to take off in the vehicle? Will we have to pursue the vehicle with a child inside of the car? Is he going to hold the child hostage? Are his actions going to put others at risk?\"\n As Blake tried to get in the SUV, Sheskey said he grabbed and pulled the man's shirt. Sheskey told investigators that Blake then \"turned his torso right to left\" toward the officer. The knife was now in Blake's right hand, moving toward the officer's torso, Sheskey told investigators. The officer said he fired his weapon and did not stop until he saw Blake drop the knife in the SUV's floorboard.\n Sheskey said he \"feared Jacob Blake was going to stab him with the knife, but knew that he could not retreat because the child was in the car and could be harmed, taken hostage, or abducted by Jacob Blake,\" according to the investigative report.\n \"Step it up. Shots fired. Shots fired,\" Meronek yelled into her radio. Officers laid Blake on the ground and provided medical assistance, she said.\n In a second-floor apartment across the street, a witness, identified in the investigative report as RW, captured part of the encounter on cell phone video. The witness told investigators that officers had Blake in a headlock and were punching him at one point. He said Blake did not go down when one officer Tased him.\n In the video, Blake walked around the front of the SUV with a knife in his hand. The officers had their guns drawn. A male voice is heard yelling, \"Drop the knife!\" as Blake approached the door.\n Moments later, seven shots are heard after Sheskey grabbed Blake's shirt.\n Blake had four entrance wounds to the back, and three to his left side.\n \"They didn't have to shoot me like that,\" he said. \"I was just trying to leave and he had options to shoot my tires and even punch me, Tase me again, hit me with the night stick. I work armed security and I have gotten into it with cats that are bigger than me and my first thing is, I grab my Taser first and then my baton.\"\n Asked by an investigator why he didn't surrender, Blake said, \"Because he instantly grabbed my hand and he was trying to put me in handcuffs and I am just like not in front of my kids, not on my kid's birthday.\"\n Graveley said Blake had been named in five reports of domestic disturbances involving Booker dating to 2012. Four disputes involved vehicles. The warrant for Blake was issued last summer on criminal trespass, domestic abuse, third-degree sexual assault and other charges in a case involving the mother of his children.\n On May 3, Booker told police that Blake had broken into her home, sexually assaulted her and stolen her car keys and her vehicle and her debit card. Prosecutors were unable to locate her before trial in November, according to the investigative report.\n Blake pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct and domestic abuse while the third-degree sexual assault charge was dismissed, according to Kenosha County court records.  A judge ordered Blake's sentence withheld and he was placed on probation for two years.\n Blake told investigators after the shooting that Booker \"made up the whole thing\" about the sex assault.\n Investigators have not been able to speak with Booker since the day of the shooting, according to the investigative report.\n The officers involved in the August call remain on administrative leave, police said.\n An attorney for Blake's family disputed that he posed a threat that day.\n \"There was no point in the video that is articulable for an officer to say that he was under harm at that particular point. I think that's completely bogus and I think that is just a rationalization to try to show what is really, essentially, an intentional act,\" attorney B'Ivory LaMarr told reporters shortly after Graveley's announcement on Tuesday.\n \"It's not against the law to have a knife, people have knives for a variety of different reasons. Jacob Blake is privy to having a knife,\" the attorney added.\n Blake family attorney Ben Crump, along with LaMarr and co-counsel Patrick A. Salvi II, expressed disappointment in Graveley's decision.\n \"We feel this decision failed not only Jacob and his family, but the community that protested and demanded justice,\" the attorneys said in a statement.\n \"Officer Sheskey's actions sparked outrage and advocacy throughout the country, but the District Attorney's decision not to charge the officer who shot Jacob in the back multiple times, leaving him paralyzed, further destroys trust in our justice system. This sends the wrong message to police officers throughout the country.\"\n Federal authorities are conducting a civil rights investigation related to the shooting.\n Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha Professional Police Association, said in a statement: \"The facts from this incident are finally known. The officers attempted to take Mr. Blake into custody by giving him verbal commands, physically struggling with him AND deploying their Tasers.\n \"Mr. Blake was also armed. At any time during his interaction with the officers, Mr. Blake could have and should have complied with their lawful orders. If he had, nobody, including the entire Kenosha community would have had to endure the pain and suffering that ensued.\"\n Police association attorney Brendan Matthews, who represented Sheskey, said the officers \"did an outstanding job under challenging circumstances.\"\n \"Officer Sheskey was presented with a difficult and dangerous situation and he acted appropriately and in accordance with his training,\" his statement added.\n \"The video remains difficult to view but that does not change what actually occurred. False and misleading narratives to the contrary need to stop. Kenosha can and will move forward from this. That process begins now.\"\n Graveley said he spoke briefly with Blake before announcing his decision.\n \"This was a tragedy first and foremost for Jacob Blake, who still suffers from grievous injuries. These are life lasting injuries,\" he said.\n The prosecutor recalled telling Blake he has thought often about the lasting impact that witnessing the shooting will have on the man's children.\n \"This is a tragedy for those who love Jacob Blake,\" he said.\n \"He is a father, a son and a nephew. And I want to acknowledge and say that I really feel like the Blake family and Mr. Blake himself have tried to be real, truly positive forces in ... asking the community to have peaceful but real dialogue about change that I think is necessary in this community outlined by the issues exposed in this case.\"",

        "title": "The most hardcore Trump backers have *always* taken him literally",
        "body_text": "Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that he was stunned at the storming of the US Capitol by pro-Trump forces last week because he hadn't thought that people took the President \"literally.\"\n \"I never thought I'd see that,\" Mulvaney told NBC's Chuck Todd.\n What?\n Or, more appropriately, WHAT?\n What evidence could Mulvaney possibly have that President Donald Trump's most ardent supporters didn't take every word out of the President's mouth literally? Because the four-year bullying campaign by his backers of politicians who disagreed with him suggested that Trump's supporters took him literally. As did the white supremacist march on Charlottesville, Virginia, that left a counter-protester dead. And the fact that hate crimes have risen 20% during the course of Trump's presidency.\n In fact, any inspection -- close or otherwise -- of how Trump's supporters have responded to his pleadings and urgings over the past four years would lead you to the exact opposite conclusion that Mulvaney attempted to draw on Sunday: The most hardcore Trump backers have always taken him literally. Always.\n It's the Republican political class -- populated by the likes of Mulvaney -- that has spent Trump's term deluding themselves that no one really takes Trump seriously because a) who could? and b) it soothed their consciences as they enabled and abetted Trump's worst instincts out of fear of what would happen to them if they didn't.\n The justification went something like this: Yeah, what Trump is saying is dangerous and crazy. But no one believes he means what he says. So, no harm, no foul! Right? Right?!?!\n That has never been anything more than a weak -- and easily debunked -- excuse for not standing up to Trump's erratic and irresponsible behavior. That whistle-past-the-graveyard attitude is typified by this now-infamous quote from an anonymous Republican official to The Washington Post in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election.\n \"What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?\" the official asked. \"No one seriously thinks the results will change. He went golfing this weekend. It's not like he's plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20. He's tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he'll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he'll leave.\"\n \"No one seriously thinks the results will change.\"\n Nope! Lots and lots of people -- fed Trump's lies over the past four years and without any significant push-back to them by Republicans who knew better -- 100% believed that not only had the election been stolen from them but that their only recourse when faced with such a titanic steal was violent insurrection.\n So, when the President of the United States told a large group of supporters last Wednesday that \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,\" moments after encouraging them to march to the Capitol building, well, they did what he said. They fought like hell, in their minds, to save the country they love.\n As Ezra Klein put it in a terrific New York Times column on Trump's supporters: \"They did not experience this as performative grievance; they experienced it as a profound assault.\"\n This wasn't new. Trump's supporters had been taking him literally since he first began running for president. They really thought he was going to build a \"big, beautiful\" wall along our southern border and make Mexico pay for it. And that Ted Cruz's father might just be involved in the JFK assassination. And that every prominent Democrat should be tried (and convicted) for their roles in the Russia counterintelligence investigation.\n What happened at the Capitol last Wednesday, then, wasn't the first time Trump's base took him literally. It was the culmination of having taken him literally the entire duration of his presidency.\n Mulvaney and Trump's other most prominent enablers can try to comfort themselves with this who-could-have-seen-this-coming junk. But the truth is that anyone who wasn't purposely ignoring what was right in front of their faces saw what happened last Wednesday at the Capitol coming. Including Donald Trump himself.",

        "title": "No, Mike Pence isn't going to invoke the 25th Amendment",
        "body_text": "On Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Vice President Mike Pence to immediately invoke the 25th Amendment -- removing Trump from office in the wake of the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of the President last Wednesday.\n He's, um, not going to do that.\n Yes, Pence is pissed at Trump for his incitement of a riot. And for the fact that Trump turned his ever-loyal vice president into a scapegoat for not trying to overturn the election results. And for, at least potentially, destroying his own political career. (It's no surprise the two haven't spoken in days.)\n But there's no way that Pence is going to invoke the 25th Amendment -- at least right now.\n Here's why:\n 1) Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the part that deals with how to remove a president (with a majority of the Cabinet and the vice president) has never been invoked since it was put into law in 1967. (Other parts of the 25th Amendment have been used -- it's how Vice President Gerald Ford assumed power following the resignation of President Richard Nixon.) Pence isn't going to make that sort of history unless he feels as though he absolutely has to. And he's not there yet.\n 2) It's not at all clear that a majority of the remaining Trump Cabinet members would support removal -- even if Pence pushes it. The resignations of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao last week in protest of Trump's role in the Capitol riot actually makes it less likely that a majority of the Cabinet would back Trump's removal.\n While, according to sources cited by CNN, there are several Cabinet officials trying to build momentum among their colleagues to force a Cabinet meeting with Trump so they can confront him, even that is a far cry from those same officials being willing to support a 25th Amendment removal. At the moment, there are zero Cabinet officials who have gone public with their support for such a move.\n 3) Trump is only president for nine more days. Pence -- and much of the rest of the Republican Party -- is really hoping that the worst is behind them when it comes to Trump. De-platformed from Twitter and Facebook late last week, Trump's ability to drive news cycles (not to mention foment violence) has been significantly reduced. Pence has to be hoping that Trump is chastened enough by the events of last week (and the condemnations of the President that swiftly followed) that he will lie low for the next week. Of course, Trump doesn't appear to be chastened in the least, which is why Pence continues to keep the 25th Amendment option in his back pocket.\n Remember that at this time last week, Pence still thought his four-year project -- subjugating himself to Trump in hopes of inheriting the outgoing President's political base in 2024 -- was on track. Now the vice president is being forced to grapple with an entirely new political reality that includes his one-time benefactor not only turning from him but in fact blaming him for not changing the results of the election.\n My educated guess is that Pence doesn't want to antagonize Trump any more than he has to over the coming days.\n Which means that if Trump stays quiet -- or at least doesn't do something as or more dangerous than inciting a riot at one of the government's most visible symbols -- Pence will let all of the 25th Amendment talk stay purely in the realm of the hypothetical. Although it's not at all clear doing so will salvage his relationship with Trump.",

        "title": "What NASA must focus on during the Biden administration ",
        "body_text": "Moriba Jah is an associate professor of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at The University of Texas at Austin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n As administrator of NASA over the last two and a half years, Jim Bridenstine did many great things for the space agency, not the least of which was to become successful at getting Americans back into space on American rockets from American soil. He also set a vision for space exploration through the Artemis program, with the objective of human exploration of space, initially focused on getting people back to the moon and women there for the first time by 2024.\n As America transitions to the Biden administration, it is clear that there will be a new administrator of NASA put in place. It is important that this new administrator focus on continuing our space exploration efforts whilst extending environmental protections to include outer space. This means being better stewards and custodians of life both here on Earth and on other celestial bodies.\n This is more important now than ever before as we are in the midst of a new space race -- this time among information and technology-driven companies seeking to capitalize on new markets and pushing the limits of miniaturization, speed and technology, from earth observation to global satellite-based internet. Additionally, the Department of Defense has recently birthed another service branch called the US Space Force, which will provide safety and security for US commerce and activities in space.\n With the current pandemic, the Biden-Harris administration will likely be less focused on space exploration and commerce than the outgoing administration. But given the incoming administration's emphasis on climate change, the new NASA administrator could be most effective by focusing on how space services, capabilities and activities can help underwrite achievable environmentalism. Much of the data used to monitor and assess climate change, for example, are collected from space-based assets.\n But the near-Earth space in which our satellites travel has become increasingly congested, leaving our assets unprotected from space traffic hazards and threats. If any of the climate change data-gathering satellites suffer damage from space junk, that would greatly diminish our ability to understand the scope of environmental sustainability. The incoming administrators must seek ways to make space traffic more predictable (where it is and where it will be on the orbital highways), which will greatly help space safety. By widely sharing satellite locations and planned maneuvers, the rest of the satellite operators can plan accordingly.\n Space traffic is increasing significantly without agreed-upon space traffic rules. Each country is free to use space, peacefully, as it wishes, but in near-Earth orbit, multiple entities behaving individually without a strategy could result in tragedy.\n A 2018 policy directive lays out the national priority for space situational awareness and traffic management to aid exploration and support space commerce, recently congressionally supported under the Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce. This knowledge is required to understand when to launch a satellite and when to move out of the way of a possible collision. The number of predicted near misses -- any pair of space objects predicted to come within 10 kilometers of each other -- in space has doubled in the past two years, as can be visualized in The University of Texas at Austin's Conjunction Streaming Service (CSS). The next NASA administrator must mitigate this hazard to space exploration.\n It's unlikely that the next NASA administrator will be able to continue the path initiated by Bridenstine through the Artemis program due to its ambitious time frame and funding requirements. But space environmentalism is a critical issue to be addressed and NASA has a clear role from a science and technology perspective. Under the next administrator, NASA should continue to research clean energy and aviation, while also helping mankind understand the impact and scope of climate change.",

        "title": "Toxins in marijuana smoke may be harmful to health, study finds",
        "body_text": "Smoking weed may expose you to the same type of toxic chemicals found in tobacco smoke, a new study finds.\n People who only smoked marijuana had higher blood and urine levels of several smoke-related toxins such as naphthalene, acrylamide and acrylonitrile than nonsmokers, according to the study published Monday in the journal EClinicalMedicine.\n Naphthalene is associated with anemia, liver and neurological damage, while acrylamide and acrylonitrile have been associated with cancer and other health issues.\n \"Marijuana use is on the rise in the United States with a growing number of states legalizing it for medical and nonmedical purposes - including five additional states in the 2020 election,\" said senior author Dr. Dana Gabuzda, a principal investigator in cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, in a statement.\n \"The increase has renewed concerns about the potential health effects of marijuana smoke, which is known to contain some of the same toxic combustion products found in tobacco smoke,\" Gabuzda said.\n The new research presented data from three studies of 245 HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants. Researchers said they chose to study people with HIV infection because of the high prevalence of tobacco and marijuana smoking typically found in this population.\n Medical records were compared to blood and urine samples of various chemicals produced by the breakdown of nicotine or the combustion of tobacco or marijuana.\n Tobacco and tobacco-marijuana smokers had higher levels of naphthalene, acrylamide and acrylonitrile than marijuana-only smokers. Tobacco smokers also had increased levels of a chemical called acrolein in their blood and urine. Acrolein is a known contributor to cardiovascular disease in tobacco smokers.\n Marijuana smokers, however, did not have higher levels of acrolein in their bodies.\n \"This is the first study to compare exposure to acrolein and other harmful smoke-related chemicals over time in exclusive marijuana smokers and tobacco smokers, and to see if those exposures are related to cardiovascular disease,\" Gabuzda said.\n Acrolein is a chemical with a burnt, sweet, pungent odor created by the burning of fuels such as gasoline or oil and organic matter such as tobacco. The chemical is not added to cigarettes; acrolein is produced by the burning of sugars present in tobacco when smoked.\n Short-term exposure to acrolein can cause upper respiratory tract irritation and congestion. At extreme levels, it can be toxic to humans following inhalation, oral or dermal exposures, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n While weed smokers had higher amounts of naphthalene, acrylamide and acrylonitrile in blood and urine than nonsmokers, even higher levels were found in people who smoked tobacco or a combination of marijuana and tobacco.\n Acrylamide is a chemical used to make paper, plastics and dyes, but is also produced when vegetables such as potatoes are heated to high temperatures. It is also a component of tobacco smoke.\n \"People are exposed to substantially more acrylamide from tobacco smoke than from food. People who smoke have three to five times higher levels of acrylamide exposure markers in their blood than do non-smokers,\" stated the National Cancer Institute.\n According to the American Cancer Society, the International Agency for Research on Cancer  classifies acrylamide as a \"probable human carcinogen,\" while the US National Toxicology Program says it's \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,\" based on animal studies.\n Acrylonitrile is typically used in the manufacturer of plastics and fibers. \"Cigarette smoking can be a significant source of acrylonitrile indoor air pollution,\" according to the World Health Organization.\n The EPA classifies acrylonitrile as a \"probable human carcinogen.\"\n Naphthalene, which is used in mothballs, can cause \"headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, confusion, anemia, jaundice, convulsions, and coma,\" according to the EPA.\n The highest concentrations of naphthalene in indoor air occurs in the homes of cigarette smokers, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.",

Daniel Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado said in a statement Sunday that the\u00a0Department of Defense is aware\u00a0of \"further possible threats posed by would-be terrorists in the days up to and including Inauguration Day.\"\n President Donald Trump, who incited the riot at the Capitol, has said he will not attend Biden's inauguration. He will be the first outgoing president to skip his successor's swearing-in in more than 150 years. Vice President Mike Pence, however, will attend the inauguration, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n House Democrats are planing to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for his role in last week's riots, and formally introduced their impeachment resolution Monday charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection.\"\n In the hours leading up to the violence on Wednesday at the Capitol, Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that was taking place in the building at the time, repeating lies about the election being stolen from him and promising to join them.\n If there is a Senate trial, Biden spoke about the possibility of the Senate spending half of the day \"dealing with the impeachment, and half day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package.\"\n \"That's my hope and expectation,\" Biden said.\n Biden's inaugural committee on Monday announced that the theme of the inauguration would be \"America United,\" in the spirit of a core pillar of the President-elect's campaign.\n \"This inauguration marks a new chapter for the American people -- one of healing, of unifying, of coming together, of an America united,\" said Tony Allen, the committee's chief executive officer.\n The committee said one of Biden's first acts as President, along with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and their spouses, will be to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery. In a show of bipartisanship and unity, they will be joined by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, all of whom will attend the inauguration.\n CNN's Geneva Sands and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "title": "6-foot megalodon shark babies were cannibals in the womb, study says",
        "body_text": "These extinct sharks gave birth to some really large babies -- about the size of a full-grown human adult.\n At birth, megalodons were about 6.6 feet, or 2 meters, in length, according to a study published Sunday in the Historical Biology journal.\n Megalodons, scientifically known as Otodus megalodon, were huge sharks that grew up to 50 feet in length and roamed the oceans 15 million to 3.6 million years ago, said study author Kenshu Shimada, professor of paleobiology at DePaul University in Chicago.\n The 6.6-foot measurement is fairly accurate and aligns with other findings at megalodon nurseries in Panama and Spain, said Jack Cooper, a fossil shark researcher and doctoral student at Swansea University's department of biosciences in Wales, United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study.\n The study is significant because there is not much research out there about the megalodon's reproduction, he said.\n To find the animal's length at birth, researchers looked at CT scans of a megalodon's vertebrae that was originally found in Belgium in the 1860s. Much like the rings of a tree, a megalodon's vertebrae have annual growth bands that allow scientists to track the shark's age.\n The specimen was believed to be 46 years old when it died, so Shimada counted the growth bands back to the birth ring and calculated the length of the animal at birth. This particular shark was estimated to be about 30 feet in length at death.\n These extinct sea creatures didn't grow that large in the womb by luck.\n While growing inside its mother, megalodons would eat other unhatched eggs, which is known as intrauterine cannibalism.\n \"The consequence of the egg-eating behavior is that only a few pups will survive and develop, but each of them can become considerably large in size at birth,\" Shimada said.\n Their large size at birth reduces the chances of the baby megalodons from being eaten by other predators.\n Some modern-day sharks that are a part of the order Lamniformes -- the same one the megalodons belong to -- also practice this behavior.\n Sand tiger sharks eat other unhatched eggs in the womb, and Shimada said that they sometimes also eat other hatched siblings.\n It costs female sand tiger sharks a lot of energy to raise such large babies, he says, but similar to the megalodon, this evolutionary strategy reduces the chances of them being eaten after birth.\n Much is still unknown about the giant shark, said Shimada, who wants to discover more. He has had an interest in the megalodon since he was 13 years old when he found a 2-inch megalodon tooth at a geology site outside Tokyo.\n While this study has revealed much about the birth of a megalodon, the specimen was only 46 years old, which is middle age for this animal.\n Shimada hopes to research the shark's later years, which is estimated to be between 88 to 100 years old, to learn its growth pattern.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in the January 11 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\nPolitical leaders across the world are promising that mass vaccination campaigns will see life return to normal. But the rollouts are slower than promised, raising doubts about an imminent way out of the crisis.\n An estimated 70-90% of the world's 7.8 billion people would need to receive the vaccine before achieving the so-called \"herd immunity\" required for people to return to normal life. Most of the vaccines require two doses per person, which means distributing roughly 10 to 14 billion doses.\n That's a logistical challenge the likes of which the world has never seen, Eliza Mackintosh writes. Researchers at Duke Global Health Innovation Center estimate the last people in line may not receive vaccines until 2024.\n The problems are near universal. Just weeks after the United Kingdom became the world's first nation to begin vaccinating its citizens with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 shot, its government is facing questions over how many doses are available. France has been under fire for its sluggish pace -- only 516 people were vaccinated in the first week of the program. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has admitted even he is frustrated to see vaccines in freezers and not in people's arms.\n Federal officials in the US have been struggling to explain why only 6.7 million people have been vaccinated, when three times that number of doses have been distributed; they had promised 20 million people would have been inoculated by the end of 2020.\n Much can go wrong in the complex chain from production to vialing, distribution and administration to patients. Each individual batch of vaccine has to undergo independent testing before it can go into the distribution chain, a process that can take up to three weeks. Another difficulty has been the vaccines' complicated ultracold storage and transport needs -- systems that have largely had to be set up from scratch.\n Grappling with a slower-than-expected pace, officials are rushing to find workarounds and solutions to the massive demand -- even lowering required dosages to stretch out supplies.\n British health officials are scrambling to cope with the new variant of the virus that was first detected in the UK as it spreads through the public. Are you working in a health care setting in the UK?  If so, you can share your experiences with us here.\n According to the CDC, some local public health authorities might allow the quarantine to end after day 10 without testing or after day seven after testing negative for the virus on day five or later. Check the full guidance here.\n Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19? Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415.\n As part of the hunt for new coronavirus variants, an international database shows the United States ranks 61st in how quickly virus samples are collected from patients, analyzed and then posted online. Countries with far fewer resources, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Suriname, process samples more quickly than the United States does.\n Genetic sequencing is the key to hunting for new mutations, Elizabeth Cohen writes. When too much time elapses before a sequence is posted, it can make it more difficult for scientists to catch a new mutation, warn the world, and take proper steps to control it.\n As Covid-19 tore across the globe and wealthy countries began to pre-order stockpiles of vaccines for their citizens, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that African vaccinations were a \"priority\" for Beijing.\n With negative sentiment towards China hardening in Western democracies due to trade wars and human rights issues, African allies have arguably become an even more vital bloc for China to keep on side with its so-called vaccine diplomacy. But the promises have stayed vague. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded his tour of Africa this weekend without making a single concrete vaccine commitment to the continent, Jenni Marsh writes.\n As doses of Covid-19 vaccines arrived in Florida by the tens of thousands, Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order on distribution. But instead of following guidelines from the CDC to prioritize essential workers and those over 75, he offered the vaccine to all the state's 4.5 million seniors 65 and older.\n That sparked overwhelming demand. Thousands of seniors across the state waited in lines, some sleeping overnight in their cars or on lawn chairs to get inoculated. Others maneuvered through jammed phone lines and crashed websites. But tens of thousands of others -- perhaps less healthy, perhaps with fewer resources -- were left out.\n The US has reported more than 100,000 coronavirus hospitalizations 40 days in a row. Hospitals thought they'd see Covid-19 vaccine shortages. Sometimes, they have to throw away doses. A World Health Organization team investigating the origins of the pandemic will arrive in China on Thursday, Chinese officials say.Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh have received their Covid-19 vaccines.China's northern Hebei province has tested 17 million people in an effort to contain the country's worst coronavirus flare-up in months. Pope Francis said the Vatican will begin Covid-19 vaccinations next week and that he is in line to receive the shot. The Pope's personal doctor died from the virus on Saturday. Restaurant workers and bartenders in need are getting 'adopted' through Facebook.\n What happens when older adults are vaccinated, but their children and grandchildren aren't?  We turned to CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, for guidance.\n She says that if your grandkids live in the area, you could definitely safely see them outside, six feet apart. If you want to see them indoors, there is still going to be some level of risk. The vaccines are not 100% effective. Also, vaccines have not yet been shown to reduce transmission of the virus.\n So if you really want to spend time with the grandkids indoors, the safest way to do this is still for everyone to quarantine for at least 10 days and lower their risk during these 10 days.\n \"[The vaccines] are 95% effective at keeping you from getting sick, which is great ... but again they may not keep you from potentially carrying the virus ... that is the reason you are told you should wear a mask and practice physical distancing even after receiving both doses.\" -- Dr. Sanjay Gupta",

        "body_text": "Just 39% of Americans would be able to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to a new report from Bankrate.com.\n That's down from 2020, when 41% of people said they could cover a $1,000 cost with their savings.\n Another 38% would need to borrow money, either by using a credit card or borrowing from family to pay for a surprise cost such as a medical bill or emergency repair.\n \"The precarious state of Americans' emergency savings has been further set back by the pandemic, with nearly as many needing to borrow to cover a $1,000 unplanned expense as those that can pay for it from savings,\" says Greg McBride, Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst.\n Many households have been able to stockpile savings because they can work from home or have eliminated travel or entertainment spending. But for millions of others, job losses and pay cuts have sent them on a precarious downward slide.\n Older people are more likely to be able to pay for an unexpected expense, with only a third of Millennials (aged 24-39) able to afford it. That's compared with 46% of Gen Xers (aged 40-55) and 45% of Baby Boomers (aged 56-74).\n Handling emergency expenses is hardest for lower income households. Only 21% of those earning less than $30,000 a year can cover emergency costs with savings, while 58% of those earning $75,000 or more per year have the money available.\n The lowest-earning households were also the most likely to borrow from family or friends or take out a personal loan.\n But many Americans remain optimistic for 2021, the report found, with 44% of people reporting that they expect their finances will get better this year. Some people, 40%, expect their personal financial situation will stay about the same, while 14% expect their finances to get worse.\n Older Americans are less optimistic about the future. Just 28% of those aged 66 and older expect a better financial situation this year. That's compared to 53% of Millennials.\n \"Widespread vaccine availability brings the hope of normalcy we've all been craving, and optimism that this year will be better for our finances,\" explains McBride. \"For many households, 2021 will be a year of trying to right the financial ship.\"",

After an arduous season amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it's an accomplishment that the game is even being played.\n Here is everything you need to know about the match-up.\n Monday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida.\n The game will be aired on ESPN.\n Ohio State and Alabama will face off Monday.\n The road to the championship has not come without controversy. Due to Covid-19, Ohio State, which plays in the Big Ten conference, has only played half the amount of games than other teams in the the SEC and ACC conferences. The Big Ten was not allowed to begin play until October 24, leaving the Buckeyes with only seven wins coming into their game against Alabama, which has played 12 games.\n Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney held it against them when the playoff teams were announced by placing Ohio State in 11th place in his AP Coaches Poll vote. Even after the Buckeyes thumped Clemson 49-28 in the Sugar Bowl, he said he did not regret the ranking.\n Needless to say, it's the Buckeyes that come into this game with something to prove.\n Alabama's DeVonta Smith, the newly minted member of the Heisman club, is the man to keep an eye on. Smith has scored 20 touchdowns this year, with over 1,600 yards and 105 receptions. He scored three touchdowns against Notre Dame in the teams' playoff match-up alone.\n Buckeye quarterback Justin Fields was on fire against Clemson in their playoff game. He had over 380 passing yards, with a completion percentage over 78%, resulting in 6 touchdowns. It's safe to say if Fields can put up similar numbers, Alabama will have to watch out.\n The Crimson Tide's quarterback, Mac Jones, a Heisman finalist, had similar numbers against the Fighting Irish. He threw at a 83% completion rate, with four touchdowns. He is second overall in yards and touchdowns this season, only behind Florida's Kyle Trask, another Heisman finalist.\n Ohio State's Chris Olave will be the deep threat to watch. Over the team's seven games, he has managed to score seven touchdowns and make 42 receptions. He scored two touchdowns against Clemson and had over 130 receiving yards.\n The last time the college championship game was held in Florida, in 2017, Tampa hosted the game, which saw Alabama lose to Clemson. There were reports that the Buckeyes were going to seek to delay the game due to a Covid-19 outbreak on their team last week, according to ESPN.The last time these two teams met was during the first round of playoffs during the 2015 Sugar Bowl. Ohio State won the game and went on to beat Oregon in the first ever College Football Playoff championship.",

        "title": "Congress' impeachment fight: What could happen this week",
        "body_text": "The fear, the anger, the pain about what unfolded Wednesday is only beginning to sink in on Capitol Hill.\n As members and aides watch new footage of the mob tearing through the US Capitol and as more stories emerge about what happened inside the halls where they work, the calls for accountability -- no matter the political cost to the incoming President Joe Biden -- have grown. People are dead. Security is shaken. No one who watches what happened or lived through it Wednesday feels like Democracy is out of the woods yet. Four days ago, no one imagined the House would be on track to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time.\n House Democrats unveiled their resolution impeaching Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection on Monday morning.\n The bottom line: If there is an off ramp for moving ahead with impeachment, it's not clear what that is of Monday morning.\n There are 214 original co-sponsors on the articles of impeachment right now, according to aides. It only takes 217 votes to pass. In other words, the momentum is there. The genie is out of the bottle. Members don't need an investigation or hearings to know what happened Wednesday. They lived through it. Aides are confident that while there are no Republicans who have signed onto the bill, a handful of them will vote for it when it comes to the floor. If impeachment is going to be a distraction for Biden, if it further divides the country, there is no indication that is enough to stop House Democrats, at least for now.\n In her letter to members on Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave the vice president one last chance to invoke the 25th Amendment over the next 24 hours to remove the President. If Pence doesn't exercise that power or promise to invoke it within the next day, Pelosi pledged that impeachment would be the way forward.\n We expect that the House to be poised to vote on the impeachment article by Wednesday or Thursday, following a possible full House vote on a resolution urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment. The exact timing is subject to change based on developments. Pelosi holds a call with her caucus Monday at 2 p.m. ET.\n Also Monday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy holds a call with his members at 4:30 p.m. ET. It may be a first indication of how McCarthy -- who got into a heated exchange with the President on Wednesday -- is thinking about the final days of Trump's presidency.\n McCarthy -- a California Republican who voted in support of the electoral objections even after the insurrection Wednesday -- has faced backlash from donors and even some members for his relationship with Trump. Still, McCarthy is leading a conference that is still loyal to the President. How McCarthy strikes the balance between what donors want right now and what his conference wants is something to keep an eye on. Pay attention to the fact that major Wall Street companies and other corporate entities have announced in the last several days they are pausing political donations and reviewing giving for anyone who voted against certifying the results of the election.\n On Wednesday afternoon, when the Cannon Office building was evacuated, Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California and a staffer were wandering around Longworth House Office Building trying to figure out how to get away from the masses of people circulating the halls amid coronavirus. They ended up in Rayburn House Office Building in Rep. David Cicilline's office. While there, Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and Lieu began talking about what was unfolding before their eyes. Huddled together in the office, the staffers were getting reports from others who were inside the Capitol. One of those reports came from a staffer who worked for Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland who was literally with Raskin's family as the Capitol was under siege.\n Lieu and Cicilline decided as the event was unfolding that if Trump's actions that day were not impeachable, nothing ever would be. They began working on the draft while the Capitol was still under attack. By evening, they'd begun sending drafts to the House Judiciary Committee and Raskin had gotten involved.\n Senate Democrats held a two-hour caucus call Sunday to have an open, frank and family discussion about how to handle the House's impeachment. One person familiar with the call told CNN that nothing has been decided at this point and there is a range of options on the table, including everything from having the House leadership wait 100 days to send over the articles to holding a one-day trial in the early hours of Biden's presidency.\n \"You have a mix of those who are saying this is a really bad idea. Then there are those who are saying let's wait and see,\" the person said.\n No matter what route the Senate takes, it is becoming abundantly clear that if the House goes through with this, there are no good options for the Senate and for the incoming Biden administration.\n In his memo to members Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made it abundantly clear that he won't be bringing the Senate back to hold an impeachment trial and the Senate does not return until January 19. The Senate stands in recess and Senate floor experts to whom CNN has spoken over the last several days don't believe the House could present articles of impeachment during a pro-forma session.\n That means that the earliest the Senate could begin a trial would be the afternoon Biden was inaugurated. Remember, once the articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate, the chamber must begin an impeachment trial at 1 p.m. ET the following day unless senators strike another agreement. In order to get that agreement they must have the buy in of all 100 senators. That means that Trump will no longer be the President if and when the Senate begins consideration of impeachment.\n In upcoming days, keep your eyes on what a group of Republicans says about the process to impeach Trump. Democrats in the House want this process to be bipartisan. They are confident that they can get two to four GOP votes, but if they could get more than a dozen, it has a multiplying effect for how GOP senators might look at this process. Already, GOP Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah have signaled they are tired of Trump and want to see him go. They might be willing to vote for impeachment. But, if only a handful of House Republicans vote yes, the momentum for the Senate diminishes significantly.\n This post has been updated with additional developments Monday.",

        "body_text": "Viral social media posts have falsely claimed that President Donald Trump invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 law to deploy American soldiers to police US streets. That didn't happen.\n The unfounded posts have gained traction in the wake of the US Capitol breach on Wednesday that engulfed the nation's capital in chaos and left five dead, including an officer with the US Capitol Police.\n While the law provides ample legal footing for presidents to deploy the military if they so choose, in practice it's been used sparingly. The most notable application of the law was perhaps its invocation to enforce desegregation in the 1950s.\n The main provision of the Insurrection Act states that troops can only be deployed to an American state by the President if the governor or state legislature requests it.\n Another provision of the law, however, outlines that under certain limited circumstances involved in the defense of constitutional rights, the President can send troops unilaterally.\n \"Historically and practically, such a request is not necessarily a prerequisite to the President using regular federal troops for domestic law enforcement,\" Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and CNN contributor, previously told CNN of the law.\n The Insurrection Act hasn't been invoked since 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n Congress amended the law after Hurricane Katrina in 2006 to give more clarity about its use during natural disasters, but dropped some of those changes a year later after objections by state governors who did not want to cede their authority.\n There are examples of presidents using troops over the objections of governors, as Dwight Eisenhower (and later John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson) did during the Civil Rights era.\n In particular, Eisenhower invoked the Insurrection Act when he federalized the Arkansas National Guard and then sent the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock to integrate the schools.\n A separate law, the Posse Comitatus Act -- read a long description of it here -- does seek to prohibit the use of the military to enforce laws unless expressly authorized by Congress or the Constitution.\n But there are exceptions in that law for insurrection of rebellion and, after the Patriot Act, for terrorism.\n While he's never invoked the law, the President did threaten to use it last year.\n Following the police killing of George Floyd in May, Trump touted the Insurrection Act as a way to break up anti-fascists, or Antifa, who he said were organizing violent riots that led to looting.\n \"If the city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residence, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" Trump said at the time, though he never did.\n CNN's Zachary B. Wolf contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Ben & Jerry's is already irresistible to most humans \u2014 and now, they're looking to hook man's best friend with a new line of dog treats.\n For the first time in the brand's history, Ben & Jerry's is now selling non-dairy frozen treats called \"Doggie Desserts\" in supermarkets and pet stores. The ice cream-like concoctions are available in two flavors named after employees' dogs: \"Pontch's Mix,\" which features peanut butter with pretzel swirls and \"Rosie's Batch,\" a combination of pumpkin and mini cookies.\n The treats are made with dog-friendly ingredients including a sunflower-butter base and other \"high quality ingredients\" that are found in Ben & Jerry's traditional ice cream, including sugar, coconut oil and wheat flour. They cost $2.99 for a 4-ounce cup or $4.99 for a pack of four.\n Ben & Jerry's, which is owned by Unilever (UL), is chomping into a growing space sparked by an increase in pet adoptions during the pandemic as people stuck at home seek companionship. Sales of dog treats specifically jumped 8% last year to $4.6 billion, according to data Nielsen provided to CNN Business.\n And that's part of a wider trend: Sales of pet supplies, toys, beds and grooming products leaped by double-digit percentages from late March through early July, compared to the same period a year earlier, according to research from market research firms SPINS and IRI.\n Pet adoption isn't slowing down, either. UBS estimates that about 92 million households in United States will have at least one pet by the end of 2023, up from 85 million in 2018. And 90% of dog owners consider dogs to be part of their family, the firm said.\n Against that backdrop, the pet industry has proved to be recession-resilient, if not recession-proof. Consumer spending on pet essentials climbed during the Great Recession, even as overall spending declined.\n \"Pets don't eat less during recessions,\" Chewy founder Ryan Cohen previously told CNN Business. \"The last thing people typically pull back on is their pet.\"\n --CNN Business' Alicia Wallace and Matt Egan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "She helps Google workers be productive. Here are her pro tips",
        "body_text": "We can all use a little help when it comes to being more productive, especially these days.\n Whether we're working from home or still going into the workplace, many of us have struggled to stay as productive as we were before the pandemic.\n Google said last month that its employees won't be returning to the office until September. That means the company will have to make a concerted effort to keep its workforce motivated and effective.\n CNN Business spoke with Google's executive productivity advisor Laura Mae Martin about how employees can stay focused and be more efficient when working from home. Here's what she had to say:\n (Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length. This conversation took place before Google employees announced they had formed a union. Google's director of people operations said the company supports the employees protected labor rights. \"But as we've always done, we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees.\" But Google and Martin didn't offer any further comment on that news.)\n Productivity was always a focus at Google and I think when [the pandemic] happened, it just kind of shifted what that means, what that looks like.\n People are so used to being productive at work, but how does that look at home? Right away I developed my top tips for working from home and how to have that same sort of stride that you hit in the office:\n You want to think about how your race is going to be affected by working from home. How you can be more productive and what races the people on your team are running. If you are a marathoner you might be able to have a meeting at any time of the day. But your teammate might be sprinting so it might be better to ask them when is the best time to meet.\n First, I tell people to get anything out of their inbox they don't need to see. Even if you don't open an email, seeing an email uses a little piece of your energy. So if you are on aliases that you don't need to be on, anything from a past job, any newsletter you don't need to see, take time to create a couple rules or filters and get those out of there. One nice way is searching for the word \"unsubscribe\" because that is usually an indicator it's not sent directly to you.\n Two, anything you do need to see and needs to be important -- like emails directly from your manager to you -- have those show in a certain way. Have the [email] pop up with a star, flags, anything you want. Maybe your boss emails the whole org, that should look different than your boss emailing you.\n The final step...is to think about your laundry. Think of your dryer as your inbox: put your emails into piles, saying this is something I need to do later or I need to fold. This is something I am waiting on a response from or something I need to hang. Put everything in piles, and then do the basic definition of batch-tasking -- you fold, fold, fold or you respond, respond, respond in a certain time and you put them all away at once. That is how I think of inbox zero. It's dryer zero. It's not, 'I've addressed every single thing and I am done' because that is unrealistic. But it means I've sorted everything and I know what I need to do, and I have it in piles so that my future self can do it quickly.\n There is this misstep that the more hours you work the more productive you are. I think productivity is a little different than efficiency or output. You want to think: Did I set intentions, did I complete them and did I do them well?\n So all those things are important. What it comes down to is the planning piece. In that daily plan I actually have a box at the top that says \"tomorrow will be successful if...\" What is that? There is always going to be more, always going to be new things, but you're really thinking about: What are my plans, what can wait and what am I accomplishing? It's more about defining what your goals are to know if you hit them.\n The number of hours you work does not always equate to the output. A lot of times it is a negative effect if you are working way too many hours. People are having so many more meetings because they are not getting those touch points at work. But you also want to think about being in meetings constantly all day -- is that really the goal for your job?\n People think of downtime or white space or think time as unproductive time, whereas really it's like pour-over coffee where the longer you let these ideas and conversations soak in, it's going to be much, much richer. And so having breaks, having downtime, having days off, all those things actually propel you forward.\n I am the kind of person who works really well before 9, but after 3 I need a little bit of a break, so if I was required to be in my seat from 9 to 5, I wouldn't be as effective an employee. I hope people are figuring out for themselves what are those ebbs and flows so that when we go back into the office they can start to tailor their schedule more toward that.\n For me, it's thinking about the time that I do have, and how do I make the absolute most of it? So if you know that your kids are doing virtual school, and you have two hours, maybe that's all you have in a day, you should be so buttoned-up on those two hours: preparing everything you need to get things done, setting yourself up, there is no sitting at the computer getting lost in your email thinking 'Ugh I have so much to do, I only have two hours.'\n So taking that time and making the absolute most of it. Doing too many things at once I think is really pulling yourself in multiple directions. So the same way we would prioritize for a brand new project, that is how you need to prioritize this. Maybe you aren't doing everything you were before, maybe you are getting more help from others than you were before, figuring how you can fit that in in a way that still makes you feel like you can be a good parent, a good worker -- all of those things versus stretched thin trying to do it all at one time.",

        "body_text": "Yesenia Lara spoke to her uncle on the phone nearly every day until May 1. Raul Rodriguez, 61, who was in a Texas county jail after a DUI conviction, had struggled with alcoholism but was a loving man who was \"outgoing, always laughing,\" she said.\n He told her there were about 15 to 20 other inmates in his cell and that they cut up shirts to use as face masks. He mentioned his throat hurt.\n And then she didn't hear from him again. A little more than two weeks after their last conversation, she said authorities notified her family he had died of Covid-19.\n \"My uncle was a strong man,\" Lara said. \"He still had life in him. And I feel like that was just taken from him.\"\n Rodriguez is one among hundreds of thousands of people who have been infected with Covid-19 inside the country's jails and prisons -- and among hundreds who have died.\n There have been more than 330,000 cases among prison inmates, according to the Covid Prison Project, which tracks Covid-19 across the nation's correctional facilities, and more than 1,900 deaths. Thousands more cases have been detected across the nation's jails, where experts say Covid-19 data is scarce and hard to track. And it's not just inmates: More than 77,000 prison staff tested positive and more than 110 have died, according to the project.\n \"If we just purely look at the epidemiology of Covid-19 where the outbreaks have been, it's really hard to ignore jails and prisons,\" says Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, an assistant professor of social medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and co-founder of the project. \"They've really been the epicenter in many ways.\"\n As the pandemic enters a new chapter, with two authorized Covid-19 vaccines on the US market, leading public health professionals have called for incarcerated people and corrections staff to be prioritized in vaccinations. It's the nation's moral responsibility, several experts told CNN, but also a move that will help in the recovery of other communities.\n \"Prisons and jails are not a place apart, they're very connected to the communities that they're in,\" Brinkley-Rubinstein said. \"We have staff and people who are released from jail and prison, moving out of the correctional space into their home communities. And if you have exposure in prisons or jails, then you're likely to bring that exposure into the surrounding community.\"\n But weeks into vaccinations across the US, state leaders have offered few details on the vaccination of corrections facilities -- and their prioritization differs vastly across the country.\n Many worry that -- amid an already slow vaccine rollout -- hard-hit jails and prisons, and those who live and work inside, will again be left behind.\n Since the pandemic's start, jails and prisons have served as petri dishes for the virus.\n \"If you look at the housing areas -- cells, for example -- there may be a 45-foot square foot cell with two people in it. You can't socially distance in a cell that size,\" Michele Deitch, the study's lead author, previously told CNN. \"It's an open toilet next to the bunk bed. All of the things that you want to do to take precautions in the outside world, you can't do there.\"\n But that's not all. While jails and prisons struggled with proper isolation protocols, many did not provide adequate personal protective equipment, the commission's report said, and testing and contact-tracing strategies varied by area.\n Nonprofit Essie Justice Group and online racial justice organization Color of Change surveyed more than 700 people with an incarcerated loved one and found more than half of responders said their loved one had at least one underlying health condition the CDC deems at higher risk for Covid-19 complications. About 30% said their loved one did not have access to medical care. Only 16% said their loved one's corrections facility practiced any kind of social distancing.\n \"The conditions inside are abhorrent,\" said Rena Karefa-Johnson, director of campaigns and advocacy at the Essie Justice Group. \"Incarcerated people should have the same access to the vaccine, level of care and timeliness as people outside.\"\n Protective gear wasn't sufficient for staff either and it's often \"still a fight\" to get some, said Jeff Ormsby, executive director for AFSCME Texas Corrections Union.\n \"We're hearing issues all the time of officers having to wear the same mask for 10 to 15 days,\" he said. \"Being sent into quarantine units without the proper gear.\"\n Sharon Dolovich, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles and the director of the Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project says, jails and prisons -- like other congregate settings, including nursing homes -- continue to be hotspots for the virus.\n \"All the arguments that anybody would offer for prioritizing people who live in long-term care facilities also apply to prisons,\" she said. \"It's mystifying to me why there would be any distinction at all.\"\n Many other health professionals agree.\n More than 480 health experts signed an open letter last month urging the CDC advisory group and state leaders to prioritize incarcerated populations and corrections staff for vaccinations. A report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security also called for their prioritization, recommending both groups be placed in an equal tier as other high-risk congregate settings, such as nursing homes. The same call was made by the American Medical Association in November.\n \"It's not just people who have committed severe crimes against society, violent crimes that are affected here. It's also people who are incarcerated for having late fees and fines and for minor drug charges,\" said Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"We have a responsibility to ensure that their health is protected, just like we do for the rest of the population.\"\n And prioritizing jails and prisons would also mean helping the nation recover more quickly from the pandemic, experts say.\n \"If we have a limited supply initially of the vaccine, we're trying to get the biggest bang for our buck,\" Dolovich said. \"As a public health matter, it seems like a no-brainer that we would include incarcerated people and corrections staff in the highest priority distribution.\"\n The ripple effects that jails and prisons can have on surrounding communities have been documented for months. A study published in August found inmates coming in and out of Chicago's Cook County Jail appeared to have carried Covid-19 with them -- and researchers at the time said the jail may have been linked with about 15.7% of all documented cases in the state. In Ohio, a local newspaper reported on Marion County health officials' warnings that a massive outbreak at a local prison had seeped into the surrounding community.\n \"If you really care about what's spreading in your community, you have to care about what's going on in the jails,\" said Krish Gundu, co-founder and executive director of the grassroots advocacy group Texas Jail Project. \"That's exactly where this virus is going to be kept alive.\"\n Staff, she added, coming in and out facilities and then mingling with their home communities, have been \"super vectors\" for the virus.\n \"It's very hard because usually, when you walk out the prison door to go home, you're going home to your family,\" Ormsby, with the corrections officers union, said. \"You might be taking the virus home to your family now.\"\n Some officials say they have heeded experts' recommendations.\n Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly late last month told The Topeka Capital-Journal she would take action \"based on the science and what we know works,\" telling the newspaper she thought prison inmates should get vaccinated before the general population.\n \"We do know that congregate living centers are hotspots, whether you talk about prisons, you talk about nursing homes,\" she told the paper.\n On January 7, the governor announced the state's final vaccination distribution order, placing people who live and work in corrections facilities in the second of five phases.\n Meanwhile, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said last month, \"There's no way that prisoners are going to get it before members of a vulnerable population.\n \"As we do 65 (years) and up, I would think that would include prisoners that are in that category,\" he said. \"There's no way it's going to go to prisoners before it goes to people who haven't committed any crime.\"\n In Texas, where neither corrections staff nor inmates are explicitly mentioned in the vaccination plan, a corrections department spokesman said they've received more than 4,600 doses -- all of which will go to healthcare staffers.\n \"What I would like to ask the state legislators, US Congressmen, US senators, and everybody else that has anything to do with this vaccine,\" said Ormsby, with the corrections officers union, \"Would they send their family members to work in a prison without it?\"\n In Massachusetts, where corrections facilities are in the state's first phase of vaccinations, a corrections department spokesman said no vaccine doses have yet been distributed to the department. Rhode Island, where both groups were placed in the second of three phases in the state's draft plan, the corrections department said vaccinations began last month for frontline workers, correctional officers and high-risk inmates.\n Even though CDC's recommendations haven't placed incarcerated populations under a specific phase, Dolovich says that shouldn't mean those populations aren't included in the age groups they fall under.\n \"There are people in prison who are over the age of 75 and who live in long-term care, which, by the way is... (the CDC's) number one priority. There are people over the age of 65. There are people of other ages who have medical conditions.\"\n \"We should be saying, 'These are the highest-risk groups, these are the national priorities, and it should be irrelevant where you live, whether you are going to get the vaccine,'\" she added.",

        "body_text": "Michael Render \u2014 the Atlanta rapper better known as Killer Mike \u2014 says he got an early lesson in personal finance from his mom and grandfather, who bought him and his sister stock in Delta and Coca-Cola, two of Atlanta's largest employers, before he was old enough to drive.\n \"Even though I didn't understand stocks and I sold my stocks like a dummy at 18, what they did teach us financially was to invest in the future,\" Render said. \"Getting young people into stocks at 12 and 13, versus 23 and 33, helps people understand, 'I should put aside money to grow for me over the next 10, 15, 20 years.'\"\n One half of the rap duo Run the Jewels, Render has made Black financial empowerment a focus of his hit Netflix reality show \"Trigger Warning.\" In one episode, he embarks on the near-impossible task of spending money only at Black-owned businesses, and winds up sleeping on a park bench with a can of beans when he can't find a Black-owned hotel. In another, he works with rival Blood and Crip gang members to create a \"Crip a Cola\" soft drink.\n Now, the 45-year-old rapper and activist has a new project, with bigger ambitions and even bigger risks. Render, along with longtime friend Ryan Glover, is responding to a dire need in communities across the United States for a modern, Black- and Latinx-owned digital banking platform.\n \"This is a platform for the young person trying to get their piece of an American Dream,\" Render said in an interview last month.\n The financial services company, called Greenwood, is expected to launch later this year -- delayed because of Covid-19 and overwhelming early interest in the project, the company says. It had initially planned on launching this month.\n Greenwood is named after the early 20th century business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was known as \"Black Wall Street\" and was ultimately destroyed by white mobs in one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history.\n That racist history partly explains the need, now, for minority-owned lending institutions. Since 2001, the number of Black banks has shrunk by approximately half. The FDIC notes minority-owned banks lend to communities that have been on shaky financial ground for a host of reasons, not the least of which was the 2008 housing collapse that put particular stress on people of color. Those underlying challenges led to the failure of many minority-owned lending institutions.\n The typical White American family had eight times the wealth of the average Black American family, and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family, according to the Federal Reserve's 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances.\n The coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated these disparities. Black and Latinx Americans are overrepresented in the lower-income employment sectors in which millions of Americans were laid off or furloughed in response to Covid-19-related economic lockdowns. Almost all businesses have been hurt, but Black and Hispanic business owners have had a harder time securing loans via the government's Paycheck Protection Program, according to recent reports from the  New York Fed and the University of California Santa Cruz.\n \"I want the worker class to understand this is a platform that ... will not gouge you,\" Render says of Greenwood.\n One of the keys to bridging that racial gap is to ensure that Black and Latinx Americans can access financing \u2014 something mainstream banks have neglected to do for generations, according to the nonprofit National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\n Minority-owned depository institutions have a better track record than mainstream consumer banks of lending to Black and Brown businesses owners, according to the FDIC, but attracting enough clients and generating enough capital to stay in business has proven to be too challenging for some of those institutions.\n As of last September, there were only 20 Black-owned banks in America.\n Clearly, there is demand for more: Greenwood received tens of thousands of account requests in less than 24 hours after the company's site launched in October. To date, more than 430,000 people have pre-registered to open a Greenwood account, according to David Tapscott, Greenwood's chief marketing officer.\n In October, NBC and Hollywood Reporter parent company MRC committed to depositing a total of $1 million in the platform's coffers. A month later, actor and activist Jesse Williams invested in Greenwood and started to appear in commercials promoting it with Killer Mike.\n Render says the swift progress has been a surprise for Greenwood's leadership team. \"In two months, we're where we thought we'd be in two years,\" Render told CNN Business in December.\n But that advantage could also be a liability. The minority-owned banks that Greenwood plans to partner with are smaller institutions with limited resources, said David Tapscott, the company's chief marketing officer. If Greenwood has to work with mainstream banks that aren't minority-owned, it risks undermining its mission.\n Greenwood, like most fintech companies, is not FDIC-insured like a bank, but it has some strategic advantages over traditional lenders. Like its competitors Chime, Aspiration, and Money Lion, Greenwood exists almost entirely online \u2014 a big plus for younger customers and those who don't live near brick and mortar banks.  And it is partnering with minority-owned banks to provide essential checking and saving account services, as well as a global ATM network, Android and Apple Pay services and two-day paycheck advances for customers who sign up for direct deposit.\n And Render says Greenwood is in a prime position to capitalize on the American cultural movement toward Black financial empowerment, fueled by the 2020 protests over the killing of Black Americans by police. \"Part of the reason Greenwood will become successful right now is because it is literally in the right now,\" Render said.\n Both Render and Glover acknowledge the reason so many people are excited about Greenwood is, in part, because they know and trust Killer Mike, who has emerged in recent years as the unofficial steward of the Black financial empowerment movement.\n He's not a banker by trade, but the importance of financial literacy and the reality of income equality are never far from his music and activism. He was an outspoken supporter of Bernie Sanders, largely because of the senator's message of leveling the financial playing field embrace of universal health care.\n \"I'm honored to be trusted, but I don't take the responsibility lightly,\" Render said. \"I'm very much a reluctant leader in our community, but believe that's what we need.\"\n Render says he's determined not to join the ranks of others who have tried and failed to keep minority-owned banks alive.\n \"I don't know why so many of them have failed, \"Render said. \"If we lose all you guys, we've truly lost the last vestiges of hope we have economically in making this a fair game.\"\n Correction: A previous version of this article misconstrued the FDIC's statement about minority-owned banks. The story has been updated to reflect that many of those institutions have failed because of a host of underlying problems in the communities they serve.",

        "title": "How Americans can hold Trump accountable if Congress won't",
        "body_text": "Joe Lockhart is a CNN political analyst. He was the White House press secretary from 1998 to 2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. He cohosts the podcast \"Words Matter.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nTens of millions of Americans were glued to their televisions, laptops and mobile devices Wednesday as an act of domestic terrorism played out live for the whole world to watch. Fear, anger and disgust were the reactions I heard most from friends, family and on social media platforms.\n While the anger has not dissipated, another emotion seems to be rising to the surface: helplessness. Many Americans are skeptical of the ability of politicians in Washington, particularly the Republicans, to hold all of the terrorists and their supporters accountable.\n That helplessness is not without foundation. Time and time again for the last four years the American public has watched President Donald Trump avoid accountability for his outrageous and immoral behavior. Republicans have consistently enabled him, and our judicial system, with the exception of the election issues, has not been able to thwart his constant judicial stalling and obstruction. Color the American public skeptical that this time our institutions will deliver.\n There are two potential paths for the politicians in Washington to punish the President: Invoking the 25th Amendment at the direction of the vice president and the cabinet, or impeaching Trump for a second time and holding a trial in the Senate.\n The first of these seems unlikely to happen. It might require a broader deal -- if he were willing, Vice President Mike Pence could convince both Trump and the cabinet to remove the President in return for a full pardon from President Pence. It would be a risky move for Pence's future given the negative reception former President Gerald Ford received for pardoning Richard Nixon. And that kind of deal depends on Trump's emotional state and whether or not he believes he can pardon himself.\n The House is likely to move on impeachment this week. The timing of sending the articles over to the Senate is where this gets interesting. The House can pass articles of impeachment quickly, but it is unlikely the Senate could pull off a trial before the President's term ended. Some Democrats worry that trying him in the new Senate, which they are allowed to do, would take focus away from a new President Biden's agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can hold onto the articles of impeachment for as long as she wants. One scenario would be to hold them until after the first hundred days of the Biden Administration so as to not interfere with Covid-19 and vaccine efforts, cabinet confirmations and economic recovery initiatives.\n The bottom line is, while there are multiple options, it is still possible the President can run out the clock and once again avoid any legal responsibility for his actions. That's where the helplessness comes from for the majority of Americans. We've seen this movie before, and we don't like how it ends.\n The good news for all Americans is that they are not completely helpless in punishing Trump for taking the country to the brink of authoritarianism. We all have power to deny him the vast privileges and riches that come with the distinction of being the former president of the United States.\n How do we do that? Here's a few ideas to make sure former President Trump feels the pain he has inflicted on our country:\n If you work at a company, belong to an organization or trade association or an institution of higher education, let your bosses know that you won't tolerate paying Trump to come speak at events, conferences or any sort of engagement. Don't wait until he's booked, let them know in advance that he's not welcome. If you are a lecture agency and take Trump on as a client, understand that your other clients will go elsewhere for representation.\n We all buy books from the major publishers. Let them know you will no longer buy their books if they sign Trump to a book deal. Tell your local officials to stay away from Trump. No renaming of airports, highways or public buildings -- I might exclude toxic waste dumps and landfills from this list, however. If they don't listen, vote them out of office.\n Make sure the Trump Organization is not afforded any the tax breaks for building in your community. And no donations of land for a Presidential library. Let him build it in the smoking room at Mar-a-Lago.\n No awards or honors should be bestowed from your town, group or organization.  No commencement speeches or honorary degrees from colleges and universities. In fact, following the example of Lehigh University, revoke a degree if it has already been awarded. If you are an author, make clear you won't work with publishers that do business with Trump.\n No throwing out the first pitch at the World Series. No invitation to toss the coin for the Super Bowl or drop the ball at the World Cup.  And Olympics -- forget about it. Want to get him where it really hurts? Pressure the golf governing bodies to sever all ties with him and his golf courses.\n At a local club, make sure the pro knows they'll be no playing privileges. If he wants to play, he either has to own the course or join the hackers at the local public course. The PGA (who just announced the 2022 PGA Championship will not be played at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey) might offer him a deal -- privileges will be restored after a PGA official follows him for a year to record his real score and enter it into the handicap system.\n If you work in the finance industry, tell your leadership they must say no to any requests for financing from the Trump Organization. If they hold debt, tell them to call it January 21. If you're an investor, tell your broker or bank just say no to Trump or your money will walk.\n We can also pressure Congress to take further action. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a former President be afforded the protection of the Secret Service. Also, nothing that says he deserves a million dollars a year for travel and a generous pension and healthcare plan. And of course, there should be no right to a state funeral.\n Finally, and most importantly, show no tolerance for anyone in our judicial system who seeks special protection for crimes committed either before, after or during his presidency. Trump doesn't have to be found guilty of sedition to punished for his behavior. See the Al Capone example: By all accounts, Capone murdered dozens of people but only went to jail for tax evasion. And law firms that seek to help Trump can and should be boycotted by organizations large and small.\n Trump must be held accountable for crimes against the state. We all have some power to help with holding him accountable and should not hesitate to use it going forward. Trump screwed up the most important job in the world -- president of the United States. Let's make sure he doesn't benefit now from the best job in the world -- former president of the United States. And for those who say this is cancel culture run amok, I say it's perfectly legal citizen justice well earned by Donald J Trump.",

        "title": "Fact check: No, impeachment itself would not ban Trump from a 2024 run",
        "body_text": "A viral tweet claims that impeaching President Donald Trump for a second time would mean he would lose the ability to run for president in 2024.\n That's not true. Nor are other claims in the tweet.\n The tweet was posted on Friday, two days after a Capitol insurrection by a mob of Trump supporters sparked a new impeachment push from House Democrats. As of early Monday, it had more than 181,000 retweets and 725,000 likes. It says the following: \"For those wondering if it's worth impeaching him this time, it means he:\n 1) loses his 200k+ pension for the rest of his life\n 2) loses his 1 million dollar/year travel allowance\n 3) loses lifetime full secret service detail\n 4) loses his ability to run in 2024\"\n 1) Trump would lose his post-presidency pension only if both the House voted to impeach him and then the Senate voted to remove him from office; impeachment itself, without removal, would not result in Trump being denied any benefits.\n 2) The law makes clear that presidents who have lifetime Secret Service protection never get a $1 million travel allowance.\n 3) It is unclear that Trump would lose lifetime Secret Service protection even if the Senate voted to remove him and prohibit him from running.\n 4) Even a Senate vote to remove Trump would not prohibit him from running in 2024; for the Senate to ban him from the presidency, it would have to hold an additional vote on this question.\n Trump would not lose his pension if the House impeached him for his role in inciting the insurrection -- just as he didn't lose his pension when the House impeached him in 2019 over his effort to use the US' relationship with Ukraine for his own political ends. Rather, under the Former Presidents Act, he would lose his pension only if the Senate voted to convict him and remove him from office.\n Lots of average citizens use the word \"impeachment\" to refer to impeachment and removal, so we're not bashing Costiloe for this common error, but the statement is incorrect.\n Presidents who have not been impeached and removed are entitled to a lifetime pension equivalent to the annual salary of a head of an executive department. For Trump, like predecessor President Barack Obama, that would indeed amount to more than $200,000 per year.\n Neither a second House impeachment nor even a Senate vote to convict Trump and remove him from office would prevent him from running again, in 2024 or beyond.\n Rather, after two-thirds of senators present voted to remove Trump, a simple majority of senators present would have to approve an additional vote to bar him from the presidency in the future.\n The Senate could not skip the conviction-and-removal vote that requires two-thirds of senators and go straight to the simple-majority vote for future disqualification, Ross Garber, an impeachment and political investigations lawyer who teaches at Tulane Law School, told CNN.\n There is at least some uncertainty about the disqualification issue, since no president has ever been removed from office by the Senate and only judges have been disqualified from future office. The disqualification language in the Constitution is \"disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States\"; Garber noted that no court or Congress has ever settled the question of whether the presidency counts as an \"Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States\" from which the Senate is able to ban an impeached and convicted person. (Garber said he personally thinks the presidency does count.)\n Would Trump lose Secret Service protection if he was removed from office? It is not clear -- to us or to two legal experts we consulted, law professors Stephen Vladeck and Josh Blackman.\n There are two relevant laws that use different language on who counts as a \"former president.\"\n One law, the Former Presidents Act we mentioned earlier, specifically says that a president who gets booted by the Senate does not count as a \"former president\" for the purpose of certain post-presidency perks.\n However, another law signed by Obama in 2013, the Former Presidents Protection Act, simply authorizes lifetime Secret Service protection for former presidents -- without defining \"former president\" in any particular way.\n It is not clear which definition the federal government or the courts would use when it came to deciding whether an impeached and removed Trump should get lifetime Secret Service protection. (The Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment.)\n In summary, the tweet was too definitive on a point that is very much up in the air.\n Trump was not certain to get a $1 million travel allowance in the first place. In fact, the travel allowance -- technically, a security and travel allowance -- is only for former presidents who are not getting lifetime Secret Service protection. An official from the office of a former president confirmed to CNN that the former president they work for does not have access to a $1 million security and travel allowance.\n In other words: under normal circumstances -- if Trump finished out his term as scheduled and then accepted the lifetime Secret Service protection he would indisputably be entitled to in that case -- there would be no $1 million security and travel allowance for him.\n When we called Costiloe to tell him that we were planning a fact check and that much of the tweet was inaccurate, he said good-naturedly: \"Tear it a new one. Go for it, baby.\" He said he is \"nobody,\" a man who lives with diabetes in Texas and did the tweet because he had seen the information pop up somewhere on his Facebook feed and \"it made me feel good.\"\n He said he was never sure the content was correct and was amazed the tweet went so viral. He said he had only 200 Twitter followers at the time he posted it.\n \"I don't want to mess up the world. I just wanted to make me feel good,\" he said. \"It turns out it made a lot of people feel good.\"",

I'm not a fellow of anything right now. I'm just a citizen who has voted Republican, voted Democrat throughout my entire career. And right now I'm just watching my country and not concerned with parties,\" he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on \"GPS.\"\n The announcement by Powell, a grandee of the Republican Party who served in multiple administrations and at one point was considered a potential presidential nominee, underscores the ongoing estrangement of the so-called establishment wing of the GOP from its modern direction under Trump.\n The first Black secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has long criticized Trump and voted for President-elect Joe Biden in the 2020 election after voting against Trump in 2016. He has criticized Republicans for not condemning Trump in the past and admonished them on Sunday for putting political interests ahead of the interests of Americans.\n \"They should have known better, but they were so taken by their political standing and how none of them wanted to put themselves at political risk. They would not stand up and tell the truth or stand up and criticize him or criticize others,\" Powell told Zakaria. \"And that's what we need. We need people who will speak the truth, who remember that they are here for our fellow citizens. They are here for our country. They are not here simply to be re-elected again.\"\n As House Democrats move toward an impeachment resolution unless Vice President Mike Pence acts to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power, Powell said he would back a Senate conviction if he were serving in the chamber.\n \"I would have done it last time if I had the opportunity,\" he said, referring to the effort to remove Trump from office following the Ukraine scandal.",

        "body_text": "A controversial advertisement for make-up removal wipes has been pulled from the internet in China, after it prompted widespread backlash on social media over claims it \"demonized\" victims of sexual assault.\n The advertisement, produced by Chinese cotton product brand Purcotton, shows a woman walking down a dimly lit street at night followed by a masked man. As the man begins to approach her, the woman is shown using a Purcotton wipe to remove her make-up, seemingly horrifying her would-be attacker and causing him to run away.\n Though it is unclear when the advertisement was first released, social media users in China have seized on the short video, decrying its apparent victim-blaming message, and labeling it \"disgusting\" and \"wrong.\" Some have even called for a boycott of the company's products.\n \"You use what scares women the most for an advertisement, which is beyond comprehension and unacceptable,\" one user said on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform.\n China Women's News, a website which is operated by the government-affiliated All-China Women's Federation, denounced the ad on their social media for \"demonizing the victim.\"\n \"(It is) full of prejudice, malice, and ignorance. Women are consumers and not consumer goods. It is inevitable that 'creative' advertisements that insult women will be criticized by the public,\" the social media post said.\n Purcotton, which is owned by Winner Medical Group, has more than 240 stores in China and an estimated 20 million customers, according to the company's website.\n Purcotton originally defended the advertisement as a creative way to advertise the \"cleaning function of the product,\" but as the calls for a boycott grew, the company removed the video from their accounts and eventually apologized on January 8.\n \"We have set up a team to hold people to account for the problem and, in the meantime, we will improve content production and the review process to prevent similar incidents from happening again,\" the company's post said. Purcotton posted a second apology letter to their Weibo account on Monday.\n It isn't the first time that a Chinese company has been forced to apologize over accusations of sexism.\n In 2020, supermarket chain RT-Mart apologized after one of its stores displayed a sizing chart which labeled women who wore large or XXL clothes \"rotten\" and \"terrible.\"\n One year earlier, China's top ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing had to backtrack on a curfew for female passengers using its service after 8 p.m., which had been put in place following the murder of two women who used the app.\n CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this article.",

        "title": "Corporate America pulls the plug on President Trump",
        "body_text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.\nCorporate America has long had a complex relationship with President Donald Trump. Many executives have been critical of his unpredictability, restrictions on immigration and ready use of tariffs \u2014 all while benefiting from his 2017 tax cuts and deregulation agenda.\n But in the wake of deadly riots at the US Capitol last week spurred on by the president himself, the tide of opinion has clearly turned.\n What's happening: Companies that are in a position to do something are finally taking action. Twitter and Facebook have now barred Trump from their platforms, depriving him of a critical megaphone. Stripe will stop processing payments for Trump's campaign website, while the PGA has canceled plans to play its 2022 championship at Trump's Bedminster golf course.\n Facing an unprecedented threat to US democracy, companies appear to be recalculating the benefits and risks of being associated with Trump.\n My CNN Business colleague Matt Egan points out that the Business Roundtable cheered on the CEO president after his election in 2016, applauding his tax plans and appointment of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker.\n Last week, the influential business lobby struck a very different tone, slamming US politicians for spreading the \"fiction of a fraudulent 2020 presidential election.\"\n \"After the unconscionable and tragic events we witnessed, it could not be clearer that it is time for the nation and lawmakers to unite around President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris,\" the group, which is chaired by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, said in a statement.\n Business leaders that previously supported Trump have also taken public steps to distance themselves from the president. Take Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who had been one of Trump's most ardent corporate backers. In a statement last week, Schwarzman called the siege of the Capitol \"appalling,\" adding that \"the outcome of the election is very clear and there must be a peaceful transition of power.\"\n Yet the latest moves go beyond strongly worded statements.\n After years of hesitating to moderate Trump's social media accounts \u2014 arguing that the president should be given more slack as a powerful public official  \u2014 Twitter has barred the president from its platform for good, while Facebook has blocked Trump from posting for the remainder of his term.\n It's a reminder that when companies want to move swiftly, they can. But investors seem to be worried about the business consequences, sending Twitter (TWTR) shares down nearly 7% in premarket trading. Facebook's shares are off 1.6%.\n The direction of travel has been set, however.\n Other tech giants also entered the fray this weekend, banning Parler, the alternative social media platform gaining traction among some of the president's supporters. The company now finds itself virtually homeless on the internet after Amazon, Apple and Google have all booted it from their platforms in a span of a little more than 24 hours.\n \"[Amazon Web Services] provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site,\" AWS said in a letter to Parler, which had utilized its cloud hosting service. \"However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.\"\n US employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, signaling that the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is in reverse.\n A deeper look at the data also reveals a shocking gender gap: Women accounted for all the job losses, losing 156,000 jobs, while men gained 16,000, my CNN Business colleague Annalyn Kurtz reports.\n These are net numbers, which can mask some of the underlying churn in the labor market. Many men, of course, lost their jobs in December, too \u2014 but when taken together as a group, they came out ahead, whereas women fell behind.\n Big picture: Economists often warn against reading too much into a single month. But December's job losses capped off an already awful year for working women.\n Women are still down 5.4 million jobs from February, before the pandemic began, compared to 4.4 million job losses for men. They started 2020 on roughly equal footing, with women holding 50.03% of jobs, but ended it holding 860,000 fewer jobs than their male peers.\n The situation has been particularly dire for Black and Latina women, who disproportionately work in sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, and often in roles that lack paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. As schools and day cares closed, many were forced to make hard trade-offs between work and parenting.\n \"Those sectors are less likely to have flexibility, so when employers are inflexible or women can't come to work because of caregiving responsibilities \u2014 they have to exit the workforce,\" said C. Nicole Mason, president and CEO of the Institute for Women's Policy Research.\n Among women, Latinas currently have the highest unemployment rate at 9.1%, followed by Black women at 8.4%. White women have the lowest unemployment rate at 5.7%.\n Bitcoin has been on a huge tear at the start of 2021. But over the weekend, some investors appeared to have second thoughts.\n The latest: The cryptocurrency has plunged since Saturday to just below $35,000. That's still more than 150% above where Bitcoin stood at the beginning of November, but well below highs near $42,000 reached late last week.\n One driver could be the rise in US Treasury yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note is now above 1.1%, its highest level since last March. That puts pressure on assets that don't generate extra income for investors.\n A reminder: As Bitcoin investment goes mainstream, with greater interest from institutional investors like pension funds, regulators are warning it's still an incredibly risky enterprise.\n In a statement Monday, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said that investing in cryptocurrencies or related assets \"generally involves taking very high risks with investors' money.\"\n \"If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money,\" the watchdog said.\n The Consumer Electronics Show kicks off \u2014 all virtual this year, of course.\n Coming tomorrow: Data on small business optimism could provide clues on how vulnerable firms view the latest wave of US Covid cases.",

        "title": "CNN announces promotions for Jake Tapper, Abby Phillip, Dana Bash and others ",
        "body_text": "Some of the most respected faces of CNN's marathon election coverage are being promoted to more prominent roles, according to a series of announcements made by the network on Monday morning.\n Abby Phillip, Dana Bash, Pamela Brown and Jim Acosta are all being named to anchor positions. Kaitlan Collins is becoming the network's chief White House correspondent while Jeff Zeleny will be chief national affairs correspondent and Manu Raju will be CNN's chief Congressional correspondent.\n The new assignments all point in a hard news direction as CNN transitions from the Trump years to the Biden years. All the major television networks typically make anchor and reporter changes around the time of a presidential transition.\n On the air, viewers will start to notice the changes later this month, when Phillip becomes the anchor of \"Inside Politics Sunday\" on January 24. John King will continue to host the weekday edition of the iconic CNN program.\n That same day, Bash will become co-anchor of \"State of the Union,\" swapping Sundays with current anchor Jake Tapper.\n Bash will remain the network's chief political correspondent \"and will also host quarterly primetime interview specials,\" CNN announced.\n Tapper's role is also expanding. In April he will become the network's \"lead anchor for all major Washington events,\" CNN said, like election nights. This means, for example, that when it's time to project the winner of the 2024 presidential election, Tapper will break the news.\n Also in April Tapper's weekday afternoon newscast \"The Lead\" will expand to a second hour, stretching from 4 until 6 p.m. Eastern.\n Wolf Blitzer and \"The Situation Room,\" described by CNN as \"the network's signature evening newscast,\" will remain in place at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n Blitzer, a CNN legend who joined the network 31 years ago, \"will also have a principal anchor role for all major breaking news and continue to host CNN special reports,\" the network said.\n CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker, in making the announcements Monday morning, told staffers that Blitzer will remain with CNN for a long time to come.\n Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent during the Trump years and a frequent target of the outgoing president, will become chief domestic correspondent along with a weekend anchor role. His time slot will be announced soon, CNN said.\n Brown, currently a senior White House correspondent, will anchor on the weekends from 6 to 9 p.m. Eastern, a key period for breaking news coverage and analysis. She will remain in D.C. and will be senior Washington correspondent.\n All of Monday's announcements were about D.C. postings, and further announcements are expected about time slots and anchor roles in other cities.\n Some Biden beat reporters will also move into new roles in Washington now that the former vice president's campaign is over.\n Arlette Saenz and MJ Lee will become White House correspondents alongside Jeremy Diamond, John Harwood, and Kate Bennett. Jasmine Wright will become a White House reporter alongside Kevin Liptak. And Jessica Dean and Ryan Nobles, two veterans of the campaign trail, will move to Capitol Hill alongside Raju, Lauren Fox, and Daniella Diaz.\n Congressional correspondent Phil Mattingly will become a senior White House correspondent. \"The Hill will always be my home and my love for the Capitol has only grown in the last 5 days,\" Mattingly tweeted, referencing last week's riot, which he covered live. \"But stoked to move back down the street and work with these folks.\"\n All of the correspondent changes will take effect on Inauguration Day. \"Joe Johns will remain senior Washington correspondent and will shift his focus from the White House to a variety of Washington-related stories,\" CNN's press release said. \"Sunlen Serfaty will become Washington correspondent covering Washington at large. Suzanne Malveaux will continue in her role as national correspondent.\"\n Other networks have also made Washington-oriented announcements in recent days. Last week NBC named both Peter Alexander and Kristen Welker as chief White House correspondents for the Biden years. And on Monday CBS named Shawna Thomas, well known for her years running the D.C. bureau for Vice News, the new executive producer of \"CBS This Morning.\"",

        "title": "Fox News removes one of its only nighttime hours of news coverage",
        "body_text": "Fox News Channel is removing one of its only nighttime hours of news coverage and replacing it with a right-wing opinion show, signifying a further shift toward the incendiary programming that Fox viewers overwhelmingly prefer.\n The 7 p.m. hour, anchored by Martha MacCallum and called \"The Story,\" will become \"Fox News Primetime\" and will be led by a \"rotating\" cast of opinion hosts, a Fox spokesperson said Monday morning.\n MacCallum will move to the 3 p.m. hour next Monday, Fox said. The move will surely be seen as a time slot demotion, since 7 p.m. is a much more prominent position.\n The overhaul of the 7 p.m. hour is partly a response to ratings pressures. Fox News has been losing to CNN in the key 25- to 54-year-old demographic. Since the election, when many of President Trump's supporters were furious with Fox's acknowledgement of Joe Biden's victory, a far-right show on Newsmax has also been peeling away some of Fox's viewers in the 7 p.m. hour.\n Several Fox sources have described the Fox audience as \"pissed\" and \"furious\" about both Trump's loss and Fox's coverage, which has skewed to the right, but evidently not far enough for Trump loyalists.\n MacCallum, who co-anchored Fox's election coverage with 6 p.m. anchor Bret Baier, is one of the targets of the Trump base's post-election rage, as a quick peek at her social media footprint proves. The replies to her posts on Twitter and Instagram pages are often full of venom about being insufficiently pro-Trump.\n That's surprising, to some degree, since MacCallum's 7 p.m. show clearly leans conservative in its guest bookings and topic selections. But it is still considered by Fox to be a news program, not a full-blown opinion hour like \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" \"Hannity\" and \"The Ingraham Angle\" later in the evening. So the decision to install an opinion host at 7 is telling about Fox's direction.\n Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of Fox Corporation, was directly involved in the decision-making, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.\n Staffers at Fox said Monday that the shakeup was an admission that Fox has newfound competition all across the right-wing media world, from Newsmax and other outlets like One America News.\n One staffer offered a blunt interpretation of the moves: \"Newsmax won.\"\n Newsmax has a far smaller audience than Fox at any given time of day, but its sudden ratings surge in November has caused a great deal of consternation inside Fox.\n Shortly after the Fox schedule shakeup was announced, Newsmax issued a statement that began, \"the Fox is on the run. The rise of Newsmax TV has caused a major shake-up at Fox News.\"\n Newsmax's 7 p.m. host Greg Kelly has indulged Trump's lies about the election for months. He has promoted conspiracy theories and insisted that Trump could still serve a second term, giving his viewers false hope about the future.\n Not coincidentally, he has been the highest-rated host on the channel.\n MacCallum's move to 3 p.m. on Fox has several ripple effects. Bill Hemmer, who was only recently given the 3 p.m. hour after years of co-anchoring in the mornings, is now heading back to the mornings: He will be on from 9 to 11 a.m. alongside Dana Perino, who is also losing her solo hour at 2 p.m.\n Instead of anchoring a solo hour at 1 p.m., Harris Faulkner will anchor at 11 a.m., leading into the \"Outnumbered\" talk show that she helms.\n From 1 until 3 p.m., Sandra Smith will co-anchor with John Roberts, who is leaving his chief White House correspondent post for an anchor position.\n The shuffling was first reported by Variety on Monday morning.\n Two sources said further changes are expected to the programming lineup in the coming weeks.\n Fox rejected suggestions that Monday's moves were a result of post-election trouble, pointing out that the network said in October that it \"regularly considers programming changes, including to its daytime lineup, and will launch new formats as appropriate after the election.\"\n Other networks also tend to make programming changes after presidential elections. CNN on Monday announced several new anchor roles.",

        "title": "Trump faces shameful prospect of second impeachment with Democrats set to move quickly this week",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump's presidency is set to torment America up to and even beyond his final hours in power with Democrats moving inexorably towards making him the first President to be impeached twice after he incited a mob assault on Congress.\n The horror of last week's attack on the citadel of US democracy is only growing as frightening new details emerge of the chaos and anarchy inside the US Capitol and fears mount of more violence by radicalized Trump supporters and right-wing extremists in the run-up to Joe Biden being inaugurated as the 46th president next week.\n Trump's actions have again put the nation on the traumatic path of impeachment -- an always contentious process that leaves its own bitter legacy of political pain. Before Trump came to Washington, only two Presidents had been impeached in the near two-and-a-half century history of the United States. He is now staring at the shameful distinction of being impeached by the House of Representatives twice in just over a year -- a sequence that will leave a deep scar in Washington for a generation -- not least because despite his aberrant behavior, Trump retains strong support among Republican lawmakers because of his near mystical hold on the party's populist base.\n Democrats introduced a resolution to impeach Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection on Monday morning.\n The single charge points to Trump's repeated false claims that he won the election and his speech to the crowd on January 6 before pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol. It also cited Trump's call with the Georgia Republican secretary of state where the President urged him to \"find\" enough votes for Trump to win the state.\n But the compressed calendar as Trump enters his last nine days in office -- and the reticence of Republicans in the Senate, who are faced one again with a loyalty test they have always failed when choosing between Trump's base and the Constitution -- seems certain to thwart Democratic efforts to quickly eject Trump from power. This means the drama surrounding Trump's fate, and the possibility of another Senate trial, could outlast his presidency and his turbulent term could cast a toxic shadow over President-elect Joe Biden's first days in office.\n The aftershocks of the breaching of the US Capitol are being exacerbated by disturbing new accounts and footage of alarming scenes inside the insurrection that suggested an even worse tragedy was only narrowly averted.\n But it was also an eerily quiet weekend. For the first time in years, Americans were spared the extreme rhetoric and tantrums of Trump's Twitter feed after the social media platform muzzled the President over fears of more violence.\n As he begins his last full week in office, Trump is scheming to reclaim his megaphone with plans for a trip to visit his border wall \u2014 a concept that was one of the earliest precursors of his divisive presidency. The White House is also readying a new attempt to rein in big social media firms that have purged Trump after his inflammatory posts. And Trump is expected to unleash new and controversial pardons that may further test the rule of law before his time is up.\n Critical mass is building in the House behind the Democratic drive to impeach Trump over his extraordinary assault on the US political system last week.\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to seek unanimous consent Monday morning for a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare Trump is no longer fit to carry out his duties.\n In the almost certain event the gambit fails, she will call the House back for a full vote on Tuesday. Should Pence not act within 24 hours, Democrats will embark on the historic path towards a second impeachment.\n \"In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,\" Pelosi said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues. \"As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.\"\n Democrats are justifying the unprecedented push for a second impeachment on the grounds that after his most flagrant abuse of power yet, Trump presents a stark danger to the country and the world and must be removed immediately. Another motivating factor is that a conviction in a Senate trial would likely bar Trump from ever seeking public office again. They parry critiques that such a late-term impeachment would be academic by arguing that Trump's crime against the Constitution cannot go unpunished.\n But the complications of the timeline threaten to undercut the impeachment push. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a memo that the unlikelihood of securing unanimous consent to break a Senate recess meant that, practically, the earliest date a Senate trial could begin would be January 20, the day Biden takes the oath of office and control of the chamber will switch after Democrats won to Georgia runoffs last week.\n While it may seem strange that Senate rules would take precedence over a moment of rare national peril, this would mean Democrats would spend the start of a new presidency burning days or even weeks seeking to convict a President who has already left office. That scenario would not only complicate Biden's hopes of quickly turning Trump's poisoned page in US history, it would slow a desperately needed economic relief package and an effort by the new White House to muster a national fight against a pandemic that is worsening by the hour amid fears of a new more transmissible mutant strain of the coronavirus and the Trump team's misfiring vaccine rollout.\n House Majority Whip James Clyburn suggested a workaround for that contingency on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, when he said Pelosi may not immediately transmit one or more articles of impeachment to the Senate to trigger the process of a trial.\n \"It just so happens that if it didn't go over there for 100 days, it could -- let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running, and maybe we'll send the articles sometime after that,\" the South Carolina Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n This approach would satisfy the imperative Democrats feel to inflict serious costs on the President for his shocking conduct.\n But it would undercut their rationale that the peril posed by Trump is so acute that he must be removed now with only a week or so left in the White House. It also seems doubtful that the passage of three months would make it any more likely that sufficient Senate Republicans would join Democrats in building the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump.\n And a trial, possibly featuring the President's unmoored attorney Rudy Giuliani, would give Trump the opportunity to emerge from effective internal exile in Florida and corral the GOP behind him in what might turn into a circus.\n Still, the strength of Democratic outrage is such that it may be impossible for Pelosi or Biden to hold off an impeachment vote \u2014 even if it would cause logistical and political problems down the line.\n There is no sign that Pence, despite being the target of pro-Trump rioters who chanted that he should be executed, is ready to lead an attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment. Sources have told CNN, however, that he is holding the option in reserve in case the President \u2014 from whom he is now estranged \u2014 resorted to more extreme action. CNN's Jim Acosta reported that Pence and his aides are hoping to provide a bridge to the Biden administration and to offer the incoming team as much help as possible in dealing with the pandemic.\n CNN's Jeff Zeleny reported Sunday that Biden's team is working to find a middle ground to avoid the early days of his presidency being bogged down by another Trump impeachment. While Biden is not standing in the House's way, his team is also floating a possible censure of the President by Congress, through the impeachment train seems to be steaming off down the tracks.\n There is more backing within the House Democratic caucus for impeaching Trump now than there was in 2019, Pelosi has told her members. Among Republicans, Trump's malevolent behavior last week is further dividing the party.\n Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who has the luxury of criticizing Trump since he is not seeking another term, said the best solution would be for the President to resign.\n \"I think at this point, with just a few days left, it's the best path forward, the best way to get this person in the rearview mirror for us that could happen immediately. I'm not optimistic it will,\" Toomey said on \"State of the Union.\"\n Toomey said he thought that Trump had committed impeachable offenses but was unsure if a viable process to convict him was possible.\n The Pennsylvania senator said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that his colleagues like Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas needed to resort to soul searching after supporting Trump's \"big lie\" that he won the election.\n \"That's going to ... haunt them for a very long time,\" Toomey said.\n Many other Republicans were silent on Trump's behavior, as a flurry of conservative commentators appeared more concerned at a sudden loss of Twitter followers. It was unclear whether the departures were the result of purges against extremists by social media firms or if Trump supporters quit platforms in solidarity with their banned leader.\n While many Democratic senators have expressed support for an attempt to remove Trump, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia cautioned that judicial rather than political punishments were the correct response to Trump's insurrection.\n \"Joe Biden, first thing he needs to do, put his people in, get them confirmed. That should be the first thing we're doing the first week. And then get people vaccinated, and then get people back to work and get businesses opened up,\" Manchin said on \"State of the Union. \"He's got an awful lot on his plate right now. And I'm not sure that the impeachment route is the way that he can put that back together.\"\n Maneuvering on Capitol Hill unfolded against a backdrop of regular arrests as the FBI and local law enforcement officials tracked down the brazen perpetrators of an assault that resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer. An Iowa man named Doug Jensen, for instance, who allegedly led a mob after a Black police officer in the Capitol, is among many now facing federal charges. Shocking new details, meanwhile, emerged of the narrow escape some lawmakers had from the onrushing mob. And stories are still coming out about threats and violence perpetrated against journalists in the chaos.\n Trump, however, is showing no sign of repentance. He only ordered the flag on top of the White House to half-staff to honor slain Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick on Sunday after a barrage of media criticism. Another officer who was in the fray on Wednesday, Howard Liebengood, died while off duty and was also honored. The cause of his death has not be released.",

        "title": "John Roberts can't escape the shadow of Donald Trump",
        "body_text": "Chief Justice John Roberts will swear in Joe Biden on January 20 as the next president of the United States. But that historic ritual on the West Front of the US Capitol will not free Roberts of Donald Trump.\n The nation's 17th chief justice, who has tried to shield the Supreme Court from the politics of the day, seems destined to be entangled with the destructive 45th president for years to come.\n Most immediate, there is some chance Roberts would have the unwelcome task of overseeing -- for the second time -- a Senate impeachment trial of Trump. This one based on the deadly insurrection Trump instigated at the Capitol on January 6.\n Even if that Senate possibility does not materialize for Roberts because of timing or other factors, the chief justice and judicial colleagues could face a barrage of Trump litigation caused by his final actions in office and lingering cases dating to his 2016 campaign.\n The President has asked White House lawyers about his power to pardon himself, CNN reported last week. The constitutionality of such action is untested and would likely end up in the courts. Trump has already expansively invoked his power to pardon and grant clemency, notably on criminals who have been loyal to him.\n Separately, multiple Trump lawsuits, some tied to his financial records and alleged misconduct before he was elected in 2016, are underway in lower courts and could culminate with the nine justices.\n Roberts has avoided confronting the reckless president, and only once, in November 2018, provided any off-bench remark rebuking Trump, after the President criticized a jurist as an \"Obama judge.\" Roberts countered with a statement that began, \"we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges\" and that was intended to assert judicial integrity.\n In recent weeks, Roberts steered the ideologically divided court through thorny post-November 3 election litigation without major controversy. On December 11, in their last significant action, the justices unanimously spurned a meritless lawsuit brought by the Texas attorney general and heartily endorsed by Trump.\n That Supreme Court order effectively separated the nine justices, six of whom were appointed by Republicans (three by Trump), from other Republicans in Washington voicing baseless claims about voter fraud and a \"stolen\" election.\n The next day, Trump said in a series of tweets: \"This is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our Country disgraced.\"\n Trump may be banned from Twitter, but in the legal realm, Roberts and the high court will not soon escape his clutch.\n Last Wednesday, pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, which sits directly across from the columned Supreme Court building, leading to five deaths, several injuries and serious damage to the domed symbol of US democracy. The assault occurred as Congress began counting the Electoral College votes for president and has triggered efforts to drive Trump, who falsely asserts he won over Biden, from office.\n Members of Congress have been pressuring Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the President. House Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi plan to introduce an impeachment resolution this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said a Senate trial would not begin while Trump is president because senators are not scheduled to return to regular session before January 19.\n The US Constitution dictates that the Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments after House action, and, \"When the President of the United States is tried the Chief Justice shall preside.\" The implication is that the chief justice oversees trials only for sitting presidents. Senate Majority Leader McConnell said in a memo to senators outlining a possible trial timeline that whether Roberts would preside \"after President Trump ceases to be President on January 20 ... is unclear.\"\n \"I think Vice President (Kamala) Harris would preside,\" said University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt, an expert on impeachment, referring to the vice president's role as president of the Senate. \"The chief justice presides when sitting presidents are impeached, and Donald Trump would no longer be president.\"\n Roberts and other eight justices will return to scheduled oral arguments on Monday and hear cases this month through January 19.\n Separately, they are still weighing an October request from Trump lawyers trying to prevent the Manhattan district attorney from obtaining his tax returns. That case stems from an investigation tied partly to hush-money payments in 2016 to cover up alleged Trump affairs. (Trump has denied the affairs.) A federal appellate court in October rejected Trump's arguments that a state grand jury subpoena to his accounting firm for his financial records was overly broad and issued in bad faith.\n The Roberts Court has in some protracted Trump litigation taken as little action as possible, perhaps waiting for his tenure to expire and elements of cases to become moot.\n Based on the past 10 days, it is difficult to believe that the next 10 would pass quietly. All expectations over the past year have been crushed.\n When Roberts, in fact, finished presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in 2020, he told senators he looked forward to meeting again \"under happier circumstances.\"\n It may be a while, however, before the circumstances improve.",

        "body_text": "Iconic footwear brand Dr. Martens is considering a listing on the London Stock Exchange amid a bullish outlook for the UK IPO market in 2021.\n The company, which sells 11 million pairs of shoes a year in more than 60 countries, said in a filing on Monday that an IPO would entail the sale of at least 25% of its shares by existing owners, including private equity firm Permira. No new shares would be issued.\n Dr. Martens joins a growing list of companies that could IPO in London this year. While none have confirmed listings, food delivery company Deliveroo, McLaren Group, Jaguar Land Rover and craft brewer BrewDog could be looking at IPOs, according to stockbroker IG.\n The Brexit trade deal and an early rollout of Covid-19 vaccines have boosted sentiment towards UK investments, said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and market analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n After losing 14.3% in 2020, the FTSE 100 (UKX) is up 5.5% this year compared to the S&P 500's (SPX) 1.8% gain, data from Refinitiv shows. The S&P 500 climbed 16.3% last year.\n \"The interest in IPOs has also been boosted by the frenzy surrounding the Airbnb and Doordash IPOs in the US which were hugely oversubscribed,\" Streeter told CNN Business. Dr. Martens has profited from a shift towards online shopping during the pandemic, but it is also reliant on \"fickle fashion tastes,\" which could change in future, she added.\n The British brand launched its signature eight-holed 1460 boot in 1960. According to the company's website, it was initially worn by postmen and factory workers but later picked up by ska-loving young people who championed British working class style.\n Pete Townshend of English rock band The Who became the first celebrity to wear them, changing a work-wear boot into a symbol of rebellious youth culture.\n Permira bought Dr. Martens in 2014 for \u20ac380 million ($462 million) and has invested in its direct-to-consumer channels, including company-owned physical stores and e-commerce.\n Despite the majority of its stores being closed for months due to the pandemic, revenue over the six months to September 30 increased 18% to \u00a3318 million ($428 million) compared with the same period in 2019, according to the filing.\n CEO Kenny Wilson said the brand has \"significant global growth potential\" in the future. \"Our iconic brand appeals to a diverse range of consumers around the world who wear our footwear to express their individual style,\" he added.\n \u2014 Julia Horowitz contributed reporting.",

        "title": "White House counsel and Barr warned Trump not to self-pardon",
        "body_text": "White House counsel Pat Cipollone and former Attorney General Bill Barr have warned President Donald Trump that they do not believe he should pardon himself, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n Barr conveyed this position to Trump before resigning last month, sources say.\n Trump has in recent weeks raised the idea of pardoning himself, as well as members of his family, though it is not known if he has done so since Wednesday's attack on the Capitol. Trump has been heavily criticized for his role inciting the attack. Over the weekend, the acting US attorney for the District of Columbia told NPR that top prosecutors will follow every investigative lead they can to determine people's roles in the attack, even if that involves scrutinizing government officials.\n White House officials are also contemplating how the federal investigation into the insurrection affects other pardons Trump has discussed, such as for his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who called for \"trial by combat\" at Wednesday's rally before the Capitol was stormed.\n \"The situation in DC has raised issues within the White House even on the pardons,\" one person close to the White House said.\n Additional pardons are expected from the White House before Trump leaves office next week.\n CNN did not immediately hear back from the White House and Barr did not immediately provide a comment to CNN.\n Presidential pardon power is untested and sources say both Barr and Cipollone thought it would be a bad idea for Trump to try to pardon himself. Barr believes a 1974 Justice Department legal memo finding that the president cannot pardon himself should stand, and Cipollone has not asked the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel for a re-examination of the issue, according to two sources.\n The memo clearly states that under \"the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself.\"\n The memo does say, however, that a sitting president can resign the office and then be pardoned by his vice president once that person assumes the presidency. That is what happened when President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974.\n Two separate sources close to Vice President Mike Pence say it is highly unlikely that Pence would issue a pardon to Trump in this scenario. Pence had been a loyal supporter of the President, but now feels frustrated and disappointed with Trump for his behavior around the insurrection and not calling to check on him during and after the riots, multiple sources said.\n Trump could still pardon himself even if his administration officials don't approve of the action. A self-pardon would only extend to federal crimes, and not protect Trump from state actions, including an investigation by New York state prosecutors into Trump's personal and corporate finances. A self-pardon would also likely be contested in court.\n Typically, the White House Counsel's Office would ask the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to issue an opinion on weighty legal issues. This office is responsible for giving opinions on executive branch power, and in general tends to take an expansive view of presidential power.\n Barr and Cipollone's opposition to Trump pardoning himself is notable because both have been staunch defenders of Trump wielding an expansive executive authority during both the Russia probe and the 2020 impeachment proceedings over his call with the Ukrainian President.\n Both men have recently been at odds with the President over his election lie. Barr left his post in December after publicly stating there was no widespread election fraud and Cipollone has considered resigning in recent weeks after strongly disagreeing with the President and his desire to use his office to overturn the election results.\n This story has been updated.\n CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Biden to nominate William Burns as CIA director, turning to a longtime diplomat to lead agency in post-Trump era",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden on Monday will nominate William Burns as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, CNN has learned, tapping a respected veteran American diplomat who has served in posts around the world from the Reagan to the Obama administrations.\n \"The American people will sleep soundly with him as our next CIA Director,\" Biden said in a statement.\n If confirmed, Burns would become the first leader in the CIA's history whose lifelong experience comes from the State Department.\n \"Bill Burns is an exemplary diplomat with decades of experience on the world stage keeping our people and our country safe and secure,\" Biden said. \"He shares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect.\"\n Biden was drawn to Burns because of his diplomatic experience and his perceived ability to restore credibility to the intelligence agency in the post-Trump era, people familiar with the matter said, along with his expertise on Russia. His selection would bypass other contenders with more formal experience in the intelligence field.\n Burns, who is known as Bill, is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a respected international affairs think tank in Washington. He served as deputy secretary of State in the Obama administration after working for more than three decades in positions across the foreign service, which he joined in 1982.\n He also served under five American presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, and 10 secretaries of state in a variety of posts, including as ambassador to Jordan in the Clinton administration and to Russia under George W. Bush.\n Burns has talked extensively about the damage he believes the Trump administration has inflicted on the United States' foreign policy. He warned of the dangerous consequences of President Donald Trump not accepting election defeat in a prescient essay last August in the Atlantic.\n \"If he loses, I doubt that he will suddenly embrace the traditional bipartisan commitment to effective transitions. At best, he'll be consumed by efforts to rationalize his defeat and paint the election as rigged; at worst, he'll seek to contest or undermine the result,\" Burns wrote. \"Like so many other features of the Trump era, the transition would bear little resemblance to any before, or any of the many I served through as a career diplomat. The costs of confusion, mixed signals, and bureaucratic turmoil could be very high.\"\n Burns also has a long history at the center of Middle East peace negotiations and worked closely in the Obama administration on the Iran nuclear deal. He has limited experience with China, but otherwise has a extensive portfolio of work in key regions around the globe.\n While all Biden nominees face an easier path to confirmation in a Democratic-controlled Senate, Burns' role in the Benghazi investigation could also be revisited. He testified at a House hearing in 2012 after then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was unable to because of a concussion.\n \"We learned some very hard and painful lessons in Benghazi,\" Burns said. \"We are already acting on them. We have to do better. We owe it to our colleagues who lost their lives in Benghazi.\"\n The decision to select Burns to lead the CIA comes after other top contenders faced criticism for their previous support of torture programs. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell, who had been under consideration by Biden, was assailed as unacceptable by top Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Intelligence Committee, had criticized Morell as a \"torture apologist\" for his previous suggestions that \"enhanced interrogation\" of terrorists was effective and moral.\n Burns, who is respected by Democrats and Republicans alike in the foreign policy arena, is expected to receive far easier confirmation. The CIA director position is not expected to be a formal member of Biden's Cabinet, which represents a change from the Trump administration, but a return to the status it had in the Obama administration.\n Avril Haines, whom Biden nominated as director of national intelligence, will represent the intelligence community on the Cabinet. Haines and Burns have a long-standing relationship and during an appearance last year at Columbia University, she praised Burns for being well known for providing thoughtful feedback during his time in government.\n \"Everyone always wanted to send their memos to Bill,\" Haines told the audience.\n While Burns was initially mentioned as a secretary of state nominee for Biden, one longtime CIA analyst made the case for his selection to lead the CIA in a blog post late last year.\n \"The appointment of Burns would send an important signal about the revival of public service, which has been demeaned for the past four years, and for the importance of the entire intelligence community, not simply the CIA,\" Melvin Goodman, who served as a CIA analyst for three decades, wrote in a blog post for Counterpunch, arguing for the selection of Burns.\n \"Much of CIA's difficulty over the past 40 years can be attributed to mediocre leadership. The CIA would be the major beneficiary of such an exemplary appointment to an institution that has become too insular and parochial.\"",

        "title": "How Miami-Dade opened all its public schools -- and kept them open",
        "body_text": "Alberto Carvalho has been able to do what hundreds of his fellow superintendents have not: fully open his district's schools in the pandemic.\n The head of Miami-Dade County Public Schools said he's been able to rely on the advice of scientific experts and follow through on a plan that has worked and gained trust.\n \"We've been well-informed by public health and medical experts. We convened a task force of experts, in pediatric medicine, in immunology,\" he told CNN, adding that one of the experts is Dr. Vivek Murthy, whom President-elect Joe Biden has nominated for US Surgeon General.\n \"We've been in good hands ...  and that has translated into a set of protocols that has left very little room for doubting ourselves.\"\n Those protocols listed in the county website include: daily health checks before students leave home, the wearing of masks and more space around children on school buses and in classrooms and cafeteria.\n Carvalho's lack of doubt has helped win over many parents of the more than 350,000 students enrolled in his schools.\n \"When you communicate that to the parents, then there's a sense of calm and trust that parents need prior to sending their students to school,\" he said.\n Miami-Dade is the fourth largest school district in the country and the largest to reopen fully in the fall.\n Carvalho's determination stems from his belief that there is no good replacement for in-person instruction.\n \"There is no substitute, regardless of how great the technology may be,\" he said bluntly. \"You cannot Zoom effectively into a full understanding, a full level of engagement for students.\"\n Carvalho also sees schools as an indispensable safe harbor for children -- academically, physically and emotionally -- even or perhaps especially in the middle of a pandemic.\n \"I am a staunch believer that if we want to keep schools open ... if we want that normalcy and regularity to continue, if we want that protective umbrella for students, pedagogically speaking, academically speaking, in terms of their cognitive and emotional development -- if we will want that to happen, then the schools can do all they can in terms of preventative measures in terms of mitigating strategies in terms of protocols.\"\n He said the cases of coronavirus in his schools are lower than in the community at large. Miami-Dade alone has reported more than a fifth of all Covid-19 cases in Florida, according to Johns Hopkins University data. But Carvalho said schools had an advantage.\n \"Here in Miami-Dade, we see a greater adherence to protocols in schools -- because it is a controlled, safe environment -- than we see those same protocols being followed in their community in general, whether we're talking about the bars and restaurants at the beach or social gatherings,\" he said.\n New York City is seeing a similar outcome after it reopened its public elementary schools last month, despite an increasing coronavirus test positivity rate in the city as a whole.\n The city has conducted about 100,000 Covid tests in schools, and found a positivity rate of 0.68%, far below the citywide rate of just under 9%, according to New York City data.\n The evidence that schools are not hotbeds of virus spread led New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to reverse a policy requiring schools to close if the community positivity rate hit 9% or higher.\n \"If their schools are below the level of positivity in the community then they can keep the schools open,\" he said last week, returning more control to local school districts.\n While there is no official national database tracking the spread of Covid within schools, independent analysis suggests that schools can safely reopen if proper mitigation strategies are followed.\n It's an issue on which even governors from political opposites can share similar views.\n Last week Cuomo, a Democrat and frequent critic of President Donald Trump, said: \"The safest place in New York City is, of course, our public schools.\"\n And last October, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican ally of the President, said: \"Closing schools due to coronavirus is probably the biggest public health blunder in modern American history.\"\n But many school districts are not ready to reopen. Los Angeles, the second largest district behind New York City, remains fully online, as do San Francisco and Washington, DC.\n On Monday, some Chicago students in pre-K and special education got to return to school for the first time since March. But the push to reopen schools was met with heavy resistance from the city's teachers' union, which argued that the city had not invested enough in measures to make in-person learning safe for staff and children.\n That also appears to be the feeling among many Chicago parents. Students in kindergarten through 8th grade may go back to in-person learning next month, but so far less than one-third have signed up.\n Biden said reopening public schools is one of his priorities for his first 100 days in office.\n With Miami-Dade already having met that bar, Carvalho has his own next priority in mind: make sure teachers are among the first to be vaccinated.\n \"If our teachers are essential professionals, indispensable to our society, to our economy, then we ought to prioritize their status in terms of access to the vaccine,\" the superintendent said.",

        "body_text": "Staples is once again proposing to buy rival Office Depot in a $2.1 billion deal, five years after the US government squashed their prior merger agreement.\n The $40-per-share offer price for Office Depot's parent company, ODP Corp., is a roughly 60% premium over its average closing price for the last 90 trading days. The all-cash transaction, according to Staples, is a \"compelling value proposition\" and is a \"superior to the intrinsic, standalone value\" of Office Depot.\n Office Depot (ODP) shares soared about 10% in premarket trading. Staples went private in 2017, selling itself to Sycamore Partners, a firm focused on keeping distressed retailers afloat.\n Staples said it's \"prepared to take all necessary measures\" to get the merger approved by the Federal Trade Commission, which said in 2015 that the combination would give the combined companies too large a chunk of the office supply retail market and would violate antitrust law.\n To avoid antitrust scrutiny, Staples proposed selling its IT management company CompuCom or its business-to-business unit. Doing that might lead to Staples increase its proposal price, it said. The regulatory process could take about six months, the company estimated, and Staples is urging ODP's board to \"instruct management to cooperate with the regulatory authorities as soon as possible.\"\n Office Depot didn't immediately return CNN Business' request for comment. Monday's proposal is about a third of the purchase price of the original 2015 purchase agreement of $6.3 billion.\n This marks the third time in about 25 years that the companies have tried to merge, including once in 1997. Staples and Office Depot have faced intense competition from retail stores that are not traditional office suppliers like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT).",

        "title": "The benefits of approaching this year like a total newbie",
        "body_text": "Midway through his mission to learn chess, Tom Vanderbilt found himself facing off against an 8-year-old child.\n Vanderbilt had a successful writing career, a college degree and decades of real-world experience. The kid, though, had superior skills. Vanderbilt lost in a few dozen moves.\n Defeat, however, couldn't dampen Vanderbilt's enthusiasm for chess, one of five hobbies the best-selling author pursued as research for his new book \"Beginners: The Joy and Transformative Power of Lifelong Learning,\" released January 5 by Knopf.\n In the book, he delves into the science of learning, a project inspired by his experience as a parent.\n For years, Vanderbilt had encouraged his daughter to take on all kinds of challenges. He told her that learning new things was great \u2014 even as he stuck to the relative safety of what he already knew.\n \"Parents are always foisting their children into new things,\" he said. \"We ourselves are not always following our own advice.\"\n When his daughter started learning chess, though, Vanderbilt finally decided to follow her lead. (That's what landed him at a chess tournament, getting matched against \u2014 and beaten by \u2014 an 8-year-old boy.) After chess, he added juggling, drawing, surfing and singing.\n His ensuing adventures were sometimes humbling: He lost endless chess matches and two wedding bands. (They slipped off while he was surfing.)\n Adults willing to undergo similar trials have more to gain than juggling skills. Research into adult learning shows the effort can pay off in increased well-being, plus mental and physical health.\n As the new year unfolds, Vanderbilt's book is, above all, a call to action for a world facing ongoing lockdowns and pandemic fatigue. That's because the greatest benefit of learning something new might be starting 2021 with a fresh pair of eyes.\n If pouring yourself into brand-new skill sounds more awkward than exciting, you're not the only one to see it that way.\n In adulthood, Vanderbilt said, \"you get used to a certain level of competence.\" It can be hard to give that up for something new, because beginning again means embracing repeated slipups.\n If you take up roller skating in adulthood, you're likely to end up with bruises. Try out newly acquired phrases in a foreign language, and you might get some strange looks from native speakers.\n \"Chances are, you're going to look foolish in the beginning. You're going to ask dumb questions. You're going to fall down,\" Vanderbilt said. For him, those experiences nevertheless were easily offset by the excitement of discovering new things.\n \"There's this whole new world that's open to you,\" Vanderbilt said. Practicing a nascent skill can be like opening a door, he explained, one that might lead to unexpected places. \"You go through that door, and suddenly there are other doors that you didn't even know existed.\"\n When Vanderbilt learned to surf, for example, he picked up knowledge about oceanography and tracked incoming swells using obscure buoy readings. He bonded with fellow newbies struggling among breaking waves, and he felt empowered by each small success.\n In the same way, if you try a cold-weather sport like cross-country skiing or snowshoeing, you might find yourself snapping photos of ice formations or noticing winter wildlife for the very first time. In addition to new vocabulary, learning a new-to-you language can bring surprising discoveries about culture and history.\n When the Covid-19 pandemic paused some of his in-person learning, Vanderbilt took his skill-building online. His choir practice was called off indefinitely, so he signed up for the karaoke app Smule, which allowed him to sing with strangers across the globe.\n If you, like Vanderbilt, plan to pursue online learning this year, you'll have plenty of (virtual) company.\n People in the United Kingdom pursued twice as much adult learning in 2020 as they did in 2019, found one long-running survey about adult education by the United Kingdom's Learning and Work Institute. (The researchers noted that this year's survey, conducted by phone due to the pandemic, differs in methodology from previous years so it may not be precisely comparable.)\n Still, it's a broad phenomenon. Online learning has surged across the globe, reported the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n Newbies have enrolled in sessions including gourmet cooking, coding and dance. To enjoy the perks of learning, experts say you really can try just about anything.\n \"We see a broad range of benefits almost irrespective of what you learned,\" said Fiona Aldridge, director of policy and research at the Learning and Work Institute. \"The process of learning and achieving something \u2014 and being recognized for it \u2014 can build self-confidence, which enables you to go on and do many other things.\"\n Evidence from the UK shows inequities in access to online learning, as with so many things amid the pandemic. The people most likely to pursue adult learning are young, employed and relatively affluent, Aldridge said.\n Lack of internet access is a major issue, but Aldridge also pointed to something more personal.\n \"The biggest barrier is whether people feel that learning is for them, learning is relevant to them, learning is something they can do,\" she said. For people who struggled in school, learning might not seem particularly appealing. That's something for adult learning advocates to overcome, Aldridge explained.\n \"We need to do quite a lot of work to make sure people understand the benefits of learning, so it's seen as a positive choice that will make a difference,\" Aldridge said.\n Learning new skills is a hot topic amid an ongoing pandemic. The advantages of getting a renewed perspective, though, are timeless.\n The idea of a beginner's mindset is central to Zen Buddhism \u2014 practitioners use the Japanese term shoshin, which translates to \"beginner's mind\" in English. It's an ancient concept that hints at the very benefits Vanderbilt pointed to in his book.\n \"The beginner's mind has curiosity, it has no experience, it has purity,\" said Jakusho Kwong-roshi, the 85-year-old abbot of Sonoma Mountain Zen Center in California. \"In Zen, that's treasure.\"\n Kwong-roshi pointed to the 1970 book \"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\" by Shunry\u016b Suzuki, which explains that a beginner's mind isn't about being an actual beginner. Instead, it's a perspective you can strive for over the course of a lifetime.\n Even small, daily actions can go a long way toward refreshing your mindset and getting a new perspective on life, Kwong-roshi said. He recommended taking a few minutes twice a day to just sit quietly: first thing in the morning, and before you go to bed.\n Get comfortable in a cross-legged position, on your knees or in a chair, he said. The important thing is to feel stable and upright, so you can focus on your breath, starting with the exhalation.\n If it helps, Kwong-roshi said you can count slow breaths, numbering each exhalation from one to 10. (Kwong-roshi also invited would-be meditators interested in cultivating a \"beginner's mind\" to join the monastery's daily meditations by Zoom.)\n Of course, a change in mindset won't erase the terrible damage the pandemic has inflicted on communities across the globe. This is hard no matter what, especially if you've lost a loved one or gotten sick yourself, and the fallout will continue for years.\n But studies have shown that perspective and mindset are powerful factors in how we cope with the challenges we do face. Whether you're meditating with Zen monks or enrolling in dance classes, a new skill could be key to a badly needed mental tune-up.\n And despite all the loss we've faced, the pandemic offers real opportunities for prospective students. The availability of online resources has vastly increased since the beginning of 2020, and many online classes provide the chance to set your own pace of learning. It's an invitation to grow \u2014 and it's never too late to start.\n Jen Rose Smith is a writer based in Vermont. Find her work at jenrosesmith.com, or follow her on Twitter @jenrosesmithvt.",

        "title": "Why the longest-serving speaker in the country just admitted defeat",
        "body_text": "On Monday morning, Illinois State House Speaker Mike Madigan made a stunning announcement: He would no longer try to get the 60 votes he needs to be elected to the post he has held almost continually since he first won it in 1983. Madigan represents one of the last vestiges of the old party boss system -- a man not terribly well-known outside of the city of Chicago but someone who, arguably, wields more influence than any other single figure in this massive Midwestern state.\n In search of answers about how Madigan got here, I talked to Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson in December about Madigan -- and his future fate.\n Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n In 1969, he was elected the youngest ward boss in the city at the age of 27. That year, Daley also tapped him to become a delegate to the convention that wrote the state's 1970 Constitution \u2014 its current governing document \u2014 as well as to keep an eye on another delegate, Daley's son, the future Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n In 1970, Madigan was elected to the Illinois House, where he has served ever since. While city mayors came and went, Madigan continued to accumulate power and jobs through city and county allies, and in 1983 he became House speaker. He has held that post ever since, with the exception of 1995-1997 when Republicans took brief control of the chamber.\n The year Madigan first became speaker also was the first year of the \"Cutback Amendment,\" a voter-approved state constitutional amendment which created single-member House districts and reduced the size of the chamber by one-third. The real effect was to concentrate power -- and campaign money -- into the hands of the legislative leaders and Madigan proved to be a master fundraiser.\n Governors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics -- through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician's agenda. He would quash measures sought by Chicago mayors until he was able to extract concessions in return or punish them if they weren't offered. He made the local share of the state income tax temporary so that Mayor Richard M. Daley had to come back to him for help, allowing him to extract more from Daley.\n Madigan also is a property tax assessment attorney, which has proved to be a lucrative business. In addition to representing major city businesses in appealing property taxes, getting a cut of any reduction, business leaders also know of Madigan's clout and offer property tax business as recognition.\n Madigan also has further concentrated his power by holding the position of chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, a post he was elected to in 1998. But unlike other states' party organizations which strive to be publicly active and take a role in national affairs, Madigan cared little about national politics -- even before Illinois turned into a reliably Democratic state on the presidential scene. Instead, he used the party as a closed operation to help further his Democratic majorities in areas that had been traditionally Republican -- such as the suburban \"collar counties\" which surround Chicago and Cook County.\n But Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana.\n Progressive is still not a word used to describe Madigan. Madigan's primary goal [is] maintaining power and a Democratic legislative majority.\n Blagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state's economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich's ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children's hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich's eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction.\n Under Rauner, a wealthy equity investor, Madigan faced his toughest battles. Rauner used his cash to bankroll Republican legislative candidates, using ads calling Madigan \"corrupt\" and blaming Madigan for all of the perceived ills that had befallen Illinois. Rauner also backed a pro-business, anti-union agenda that sought to weaken one of Madigan's greatest sources of financial support \u2014 organized labor.\n The ideological clash between the two led to Illinois going two years without a state budget with government funded through court orders that far outstripped available cash. Ultimately, Madigan won support from some Republicans for a budget and income tax increase in an attempt to repair the wreckage caused to social service agencies and places like Illinois colleges and universities.\n Rauner lasted one term and lost to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2018.\n Though Rauner has departed the political scene, his heavy spending and daily criticisms of Madigan inflicted serious damage. Once a figure that everyday Illinoisans never knew, Madigan has become viewed as extremely unpopular -- even before the federal investigation in which he has been implicated.\n But frustration with Madigan has been building with a younger, more progressive caucus straining under an autocratic style which lets members advance only a few of their bills per session.\n Then in July, Commonwealth Edison, the state's largest electrical utility, agreed to pay a $200 million fine and cooperate with federal prosecutors in acknowledging its part of a near decade-long bribery and influence scheme, seeking to win Madigan's favor on legislation by giving jobs and contracts to Madigan's top allies.\n On Wednesday, the former CEO of ComEd and once one of the city's most powerful businesswomen, Anne Pramaggiore, two other utility players and Madigan's top private sector confidant, lobbyist and former lawmaker Michael McClain, pleaded not guilty to charges associated with the scheme.\n Rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the November 3 election said that as they tried to explain their positions on issues, voters repeatedly said their chief interest was what were they going to do about Madigan.\n Distrust of Madigan was also cited as a factor in the defeat of the governor's signature agenda item, a proposed state constitutional amendment to change Illinois from a flat-rate income tax to a graduated-rate tax that rises with income, a system similar to the federal government and used by more than 30 states. Opponents, largely funded by business interests, continually raised the question of \"do you trust politicians with more tax money?\" The amendment was rejected overwhelmingly by voters in a hugely expensive campaign.\n Pritzker contends the amendment's loss is in part due to Madigan and has said he should consider stepping down. US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber's leadership, also said the party paid a heavy price for Madigan's leadership after his favored local congressional candidate, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield, was defeated by four-term US Rep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville. Davis tarred Londrigan with ads associating her with Madigan.\n Madigan had always been viewed on the outside as smart enough to avoid being caught in the city and state's history of corruption. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He doesn't have a cell phone or use email. He said he retains sizable support in his caucus and will seek reelection as speaker and doesn't intend to step down.\n But in politics, perception caries a great deal of weight and the public perception of Madigan is now being joined by at least 19 members of his expected 73-member majority in the new General Assembly that convenes in January. Rather than a leader, the dissidents consider him a hindrance and a distraction.",

        "title": "Michigan State Capitol Commission bans open carry of firearms inside state Capitol building",
        "body_text": "The Michigan State Capitol Commission on Monday banned the open carry of firearms inside the state's Capitol building, effective immediately.\n The policy change only affects public areas inside the building and does not change policy on the Capitol grounds, nor does it prohibit licensed concealed pistol carry that follows state laws, according to the commission policy.\n Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, citing armed protests at the Michigan state Capitol building in April and the recent violence at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, said the commission should recognize the need for a ban on all weapons.\n \"The Capitol Commission's action to ban open carry guns at the Capitol is a good start, but more action is needed,\" Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday. \"On a normal day, hundreds of people walk through the Capitol, including groups of fourth graders, teachers and parents on school field trips to learn about state government.\"\n She added, \"That's why we must take action to ban all weapons at the Capitol to keep Michiganders safe. I am hopeful that the Capitol Commission will recognize the need for further action, and I stand ready to assist in implementing this policy to keep Michiganders safe.\"\n Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined the governor in calling for stricter measures.\n \"Though I appreciate the Commission's decision today to prohibit the open carry of firearms, it's only a single step down the long path of reforms that are necessary to make our legislators, state employees and visitors safe in our state Capitol,\" Nessel said in a statement released after the vote.\n Nessel advised in a May 2020 written legal opinion that the Capitol Commission does have the authority to amend policies upheld in the Capitol building without a legislative body passing legislation.\n Still, the commission rejected a proposal to ban firearms from the building in September.\n Commission Chair Gary Randall said during the proceedings Monday that he believes the commission took the issue as far as they could at this point. The commission has been looking at this for more than a year, Randall said during the televised public meeting.\n Lawmakers at different levels in the state have gone back and forth on the issue. Democratic state lawmakers have been pushing for months to ban firearms from the Capitol building after the spring protests.\n In the spring, Whitmer faced heated pushback over pandemic stay-at-home orders, and protesters -- some of whom were armed -- stormed the Michigan Capitol. Protesters in April jammed inside the building where the lawmakers were meeting and about 400 to 700 people stood on the Capitol grounds, according to Michigan State Police, and demanding an end to the state's state of emergency.\n Scores of demonstrators were allowed into the Capitol -- which has been closed to tourists -- but due to social distancing rules in place, only 275 people were allowed inside at a time, according to Lt. Brian Oleksyk, a spokesman for the state police. State Sen. Dayna Polehanki, a Democrat, tweeted at the time that protesters were directly above her -- \"men with rifles yelling at us.\"\n \"Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them. I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,\" she added, and a photo she included in her tweet showed four men, at least two of whom had rifles.\n In October, some Democratic state lawmakers demanded firearms be banned from the state Capitol building after the news that the FBI thwarted an alleged domestic terror plot to kidnap Whitmer. One of the accused plotters allegedly had initially discussed storming the state Capitol and taking hostages, according to court documents. Thirteen people were charged in the alleged domestic terrorism plot to kidnap Whitmer, federal and state officials announced that month.\n A bill was introduced in the Senate in the fall of last year but never gained traction.\n Additionally, \"credible threats of violence\" prompted Michigan authorities to close the state Capitol to the public and shutter House and Senate offices, a spokeswoman said, on the day the Electoral College formally declared Joe Biden the President-elect.\n CNN's Caroline Kelly, Veronica Stracqualursi, Chandelis Duster, Steve Almasy and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Armed men on Sunday killed at least six rangers and wounded several others in an ambush in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's Virunga National Park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas, the park said.\n The identity of the assailants was not immediately clear, said Olivier Mukisya, a Virunga spokesman. Previous attacks against the rangers have been blamed on various militias who fight to control land and natural resources in eastern Congo.\n \"We confirm this sad news. A group of armed men attacked our positions in the region of Nyamitwitwi in the middle of Virunga National Park,\" Mukisya told Reuters.\n More than 200 rangers have been killed in the past, including 12 last April in the deadliest such attack in recent memory.\n Dozens of armed groups operate in eastern Congo, many remnants of militias that fought in civil wars around the turn of the century that resulted in millions of deaths from conflict, hunger and disease.\n Virunga National Park sits on the forest-covered volcanoes of central Africa and is home to over half the global population of mountain gorillas.\n A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, it is Africa's oldest national park and largest tropical rainforest reserve, covering 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) with a varied landscape of active volcanoes, savannahs, mountains, lakes and forests.\n Its mountain gorillas, which live on the flanks of a dormant volcano in the park's southern sector, are perhaps the biggest draw for tourists who venture across the border from Rwanda.\n However, tourism has suffered badly as militant groups and criminal gangs continue to fund a long-running war by pillaging the park's resources.",

        "title": "Twitter's stock falls after Trump's account is suspended",
        "body_text": "Shares of Twitter fell Monday after the company announced late Friday that it had permanently banned President Donald Trump from the platform.\n Twitter (TWTR) joins a growing list of companies distancing themselves from Trump following the deadly attack at the Capitol last week by a mob of the president's supporters, many of whom believe Trump's false assertion that the election was stolen from him.\n From a financial perspective, investors may believe banning Trump could hurt Twitter because some former followers of his feed may decide to leave the platform due to their belief that the company is silencing conservative voices. There's also the fact that even before Trump's ban, advertisers may have decided they want to avoid sponsoring content on a platform that has become polarizing.\n Twitter shares fell as much as nearly 10% early Monday before paring some losses and trading down 6% by midday.\n Plus, Twitter and other social media companies may also come under more pressure from the Biden administration and Democrats who will soon control the House and Senate. They may seek to crack down further on the more incendiary content on the platform, not to mention the outright lies tweeted by politicians and other verified account holders.\n Even after Monday's big drop, though, shares of Twitter are still up about 45% over the past 12 months. That's a bigger return than Facebook's (FB) 20% gain during the same time period -- although it lags the more than 200% surge for Snapchat owner Snap (SNAP).\n Twitter reported a healthy jump in earnings for the third quarter but investors are worried about a slowdown in user growth. And the platform remains the preferred method for many users to share breaking news and commentary.\n \"I think we have an opportunity to show people a much broader aspect of Twitter than just what they see with news and politics,\" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a conference call with analysts in October.\n \"People are coming for one reason and staying because they find relevant topics that are interesting to them,\" Dorsey added.\n Many Twitter users have attracted massive followings, and their tweets are not just newsworthy. They can also move markets.\n Case in point: Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who has nearly 42 million followers, helped to inadvertently spark a significant rally in a tiny stock last week when he simply tweeted \"Use Signal,\" an endorsement of the encrypted messaging service.\n Shares of a health tech company named Signal Advance (SIGL), which is not the owner of the Signal app, soared more than 525% Thursday following Musk's tweet. It nearly doubled again Friday and was up another 400% Monday after a strategist at Deutsche Bank noted the increase in a report.",

        "body_text": "Joe Biden on Monday received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on camera, as part of an effort by the President-elect's incoming administration to reassure the country of the safety of the vaccines.\n Biden was administered the shot in his left arm by Ric Cuming, chief nurse executive at ChristianaCare's Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, according to Biden's transition team.\n The President-elect said he would be announcing his plan to \"get the entire Covid operation up and running,\" including the necessary costs, on Thursday. Biden said he had a meeting with members of his team later Monday afternoon.\n Biden said he was \"not afraid of taking the oath outside,\" and that his team has been getting briefed, when asked if he had any fears about taking the oath of office at the US Capitol, which was stormed and breached by supporters of President Donald Trump last week.\n \"I think it's critically important that there be a real, serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened people's lives, defaced public property, caused great damage, that they be held accountable,\" Biden said.\n Biden said he had a discussion earlier on Monday with members of the House of Representatives and Senate, the same day House Democrats formally introduced their resolution to impeach President Donald Trump, charging him with \"incitement of insurrection\" for his role in last week's riots at the US Capitol.\n If there is a Senate trial, Biden spoke about the possibility of the Senate going \"half day on dealing with the\u00a0impeachment, and half day getting\u00a0my people nominated and\u00a0confirmed in the Senate, as well\u00a0as moving on the package.\"\n \"That's my hope and expectation,\" Biden said.\n The President-elect said he was \"appalled\" to see Republican members of Congress refusing to take masks that were handed out to them when they were locked down during the riots.\n \"I think it's irresponsible,\" Biden said. He urged all Americans to listen to public health experts and wear masks, practice social distancing and wash their hands in order to stop the spread of the virus.\n Biden said he was confident in his coronavirus team that they would be able to administer vaccines to 50 million Americans in his first 100 days.\n \"I'm confident we can get done what we have to get done,\" Biden said. The President-elect said he had spoken to some Republican lawmakers about moving forward with a second coronavirus relief package \"sooner than later.\"\n The President-elect's vaccination comes the week before he is sworn in as the next president of the United States, and as the coronavirus pandemic continues to devastate the nation. More than 374,500 Americans have died of the virus as of Monday afternoon, and cases are rapidly climbing across the country.\n Biden received the first dose of the vaccine last month live on national television. The President-elect expressed his confidence in the vaccine and encouraged Americans to receive one as soon as it becomes available to them.\n The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, like the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Moderna, requires two doses administered several weeks apart in order to reach nearly 95% efficacy. Both vaccines have received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, and about 9 million people have received a first dose as of Monday afternoon, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities are the first in line for the coronavirus vaccines, as recommended by vaccine advisers to the CDC. Next in line are older adults, ages 75 and older, and \"frontline essential workers,\" including first responders, the advisers recommended.\n Biden's pick for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, told NBC last month that he believes the general population will likely be able to begin receiving the vaccine in \"mid-summer, early fall.\"\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on camera the week after Biden received his shot in December. Transition spokesperson Jen Psaki said Biden and Harris were staggering the vaccine at the recommendation of medical experts.\n Incoming first lady Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff, Harris' husband, have also both received the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively.\n Biden's most pressing priority when he takes office will be addressing the pandemic. The President-elect will aim to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, CNN reported last week, which is a break with the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available.\n He has pledged to distribute 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots, which is enough to cover 50 million Americans, in his first 100 days in office. Biden has also said he will pass a coronavirus economic relief package through Congress, a goal that was helped by Democrats winning control of the Senate earlier this month.\n Vice President Mike Pence was administered the first dose of the vaccine at an on-camera event the week prior to Biden. President Donald Trump has not yet received the vaccine and won't be administered one\u00a0until it is recommended by the White House medical team, a White House official previously told CNN.\n The official said at the time that Trump was still receiving the benefits of the monoclonal antibody cocktail he was given after he tested positive for Covid-19 in the fall but that the President was likely to get his shot once it was recommended by his medical team.\n In its\u00a0clinical guidance\u00a0for the coronavirus vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, the CDC said the vaccines should be offered to people previously infected with coronavirus, as Trump was in early October. It noted that vaccination could be delayed somewhat, since reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection.\n However, there's no safety or efficacy data for the vaccines in people who were treated for Covid-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma; Trump's treatment for Covid-19 included the monoclonal antibody cocktail made by Regeneron. The CDC's guidance said \"vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days, as a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid interference of the antibody treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses.\"",

        "title": "US sanctions Russia-linked disinformation network for involvement in attempts to influence US election",
        "body_text": "The US announced sanctions Monday against a group of Russian-linked Ukrainians, including two people who worked closely with Trump allies to discredit President-elect Joe Biden during the 2020 election campaign.\n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced sanctions against seven individuals and four entities \"that are part of a Russia-linked foreign influence network associated with\" accused Russian agent Andrii Derkach, designating them for their involvement in efforts to try to influence the election.\n \"Russian disinformation campaigns targeting American citizens are a threat to our democracy,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in his own statement. \"The United States will continue to aggressively defend the integrity of our election systems and processes.\"\n The Trump administration sanctioned Derkach in September, accusing him of being an \"active Russian agent\" who was part of Moscow's efforts to interfere in the 2020 campaign. Derkach has close ties to President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and was singled out earlier this summer by the US intelligence community for helping Moscow's ongoing efforts to weaken Biden.\n Monday's announcement again shows that some parts of the US government are cracking down on Russia's attempts to interfere in US elections and undermine Biden, even after Trump openly embraced the Russian effort, did not speak out against it and continues to make the baseless claim that Biden is not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election.\n Derkach was part of a small group of Ukrainian political figures who injected themselves into the 2020 election by promoting dubious claims of corruption against Biden and releasing alleged audiotapes from Biden's diplomatic work as vice president.\n \"Former Ukraine Government officials Konstantin Kulyk, Oleksandr Onyshchenko, Andriy Telizhenko, and current member of the Ukrainian parliament Oleksandr Dubinsky, have publicly appeared with or affiliated themselves with Derkach through the coordinated dissemination and promotion of fraudulent or unsubstantiated allegations involving a U.S. political candidate,\" Pompeo said in a statement Monday.\n Pompeo did not mention Biden by name in his statement of almost 300 words. Neither did Mnuchin, whose statement ran just over 800 words.\n Telizhenko's US visa was revoked in October of last year. Like Derkach, Telizhenko is also an ally of Giuliani.\n \"They have made repeated public statements advancing malicious narratives that U.S. Government officials have engaged in corrupt dealings in Ukraine,\" Pompeo said Monday.\n \"These efforts and narratives are consistent with or in support of Derkach's objectives to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election,\" he continued. \"As such, these individuals have been designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for having directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed, or otherwise been complicit in foreign influence in an attempt to undermine the 2020 U.S. elections.\"\n Monday's announcement once again shows how Trump and his most ardent GOP allies are out of step with official efforts by the President's administration to crack down on Russian meddling.\n Despite the September sanctions against Derkach and an earlier warning in August from the nation's top election official that Russia and Derkach were working to undermine Biden, Trump re-tweeted material from Derkach during the 2020 campaign.\n Giuliani repeatedly spread discredited information from Derkach. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson used his perch as the GOP chairman of a Senate committee to promote false allegations that Telizhenko levied against Biden and other Democrats.\n The new sanctions are also a serious rebuke for the pro-Trump network OANN, which featured a propaganda-style documentary series during Trump's first impeachment featuring Giuliani, Derkach and Telizhenko. The network gave these figures an unchecked platform to lie about the Biden family.\n The cleavages were even seen in the Treasury Department's press release on Monday. The release encouraged Americans to seek credible information about the election from the \"rumor control\" website run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Trump fired that agency's chief, Chris Krebs, after the election after Krebs used the agency's \"rumor control\" page to debunk Trump's conspiracy theories about voter fraud and election-rigging.\n Trump still refuses to unequivocally acknowledge Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help his campaign, an assessment long confirmed by US intelligence agencies and the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n On Monday, Pompeo outlined a few of the front companies Derkach and his associates used.\n \"NabuLeaks, Era-Media, Only News, and Skeptik TOV are media front companies in Ukraine that disseminate false narratives at the behest of Derkach's and his associates,\" he said.\n \"They are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13848 for being owned or controlled by Derkach or his media team. Today's action also includes the designation of Petro Zhuravel, Dmytro Kovalchuk, and Anton Simonenko for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Derkach.\"\n Monday's designations mean that all property and interests in property that belong to the men and are subject to US jurisdiction are frozen and that US citizens are \"generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,\" the Treasury Department said. Additionally, any entities that are majority-owned by one or more designated people are also blocked.",

Gavin Newsom said Monday.\n Three animals are currently showing symptoms of the virus, and it is suspected that they were infected by an asymptomatic staff member, according to a press release.\n This is the first known instance of coronavirus in great apes, the zoo said, though previous research has shown that some non-human primates are susceptible. The gorillas live as a family, so it is assumed that all members have been exposed, zoo officials say.\n It started last Wednesday, when two zoo gorillas began coughing. A preliminary test within the group showed presence of the virus on Friday, and the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the positive results Monday.\n It is unknown whether the gorillas will have any serious reaction, the zoo said, but they are being closely monitored.\n \"Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,\" said Lisa Peterson, executive director, San Diego Zoo Safari Park. \"The troop remains quarantined together and are eating and drinking. We are hopeful for a full recovery.\"\n San Diego Zoo has been closed to the public since early December.\n California has become an epicenter of Covid-19, with 4,971 patients in the ICU on Monday. Meanwhile, across the country, the total number of Americans with the virus surpassed 22 million over the weekend, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and more than 375,000 have died.",

Trump's term ended on 2021-01-11 19:40:07.\" The page for Pence showed a similar message: \"Michael R. Pence's term ended on 2021-01-11 19:45:15.\"\n The pages were later taken down and directed site visitors to an error page. It is unclear how long the erroneous pages were up. The President and vice president leave office on January 20.\n CNN has reached out to the State Department about the incident. Buzzfeed News was the first to report that a disgruntled employee appeared to be behind the changes.\n Those changes to Trump and Pence's biographies -- which set social media abuzz -- were made less than a week after violent insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol, incited by the President and his allies.\n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the riot in a series of tweets last week, but did not link them to Trump. US diplomats called on Pompeo to denounce Trump's role in the violent insurrection attempt in a dissent cable last week.\n \"It is critical that we communicate to the world that in our system, no one -- not even the President -- is above the law or immune from public criticism,\" the memo said.",

        "title": "Justice Democrats endorse top Sanders ally Nina Turner to fill Ohio House seat",
        "body_text": "The progressive group Justice Democrats is throwing their support behind former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a top ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in her campaign to succeed Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, who is poised to join President-elect Joe Biden's cabinet.\n Fudge was nominated by Biden in December to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Pending her confirmation, the heavily Democratic northeast Ohio district will hold a special election later this year.\n The race to fill Fudge's seat has already attracted two other candidates -- Cuyahoga County Democratic Party chairwoman Shontel Brown, who is also a member of the county council, and former Cleveland City Councilor Jeff Johnson -- and is shaping up as the first major test of the left's electoral power in the Biden era. Justice Democrats' endorsement will brighten the spotlight and add new grassroots fundraising might to Turner's bid, which already has the backing of Sanders and a number of leading progressive organizations.\n It could also help consolidate progressives behind Turner with former Ohio congressman and Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich, a two-time presidential candidate, saying he might consider a run. Justice Democrats, which recruited New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ahead of her 2018 victory and led the charge in 2020 for freshman Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Marie Newman of Illinois -- all of whom ousted Democratic incumbents on their way to Congress -- recently began recruiting candidates for the 2022 election cycle.\n \"We are so proud to support Nina Turner because she has stood with our progressive movement since Day 1,\" Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement. \"She has a strong public service record of fighting to uplift working-class people and deliver justice. We know Senator Turner will help create a mission-driven team in Congress to deliver relief during this pandemic and fight for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, and getting big money out of politics.\"\n In a video released Monday, Turner -- who has been allied with the group for years and addressed potential candidates, including Ocasio-Cortez, at an early gathering back in 2017 -- said she is \"proud to call myself a Justice Democrat\" and pledged to \"take this fight from Ohio's 11th District to the halls of Congress.\"\n A former Cleveland city councilor who was appointed to the state senate in 2008 and reelected in 2010 before losing a race for secretary of state four years later, Turner was endorsed by Sanders shortly after she entered the race.\n \"I've gotten to know Nina Turner over the last five years. She deeply cares for working families and she has the heart to be an effective, unwavering fighter for them in Congress,\" Sanders said in December.\n Turner led Our Revolution, the outside group that grew out of Sanders' 2016 campaign, before taking a leave of absence to become a co-chair of his 2020 run. She also served as a delegate for former President Barack Obama at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions.\n California Rep.

        "title": "Los Angeles ambulance ride-along shows the pandemic's grueling toll on EMTs",
        "body_text": "EMT Sadi Pope takes pride in her job, but the recent Covid-19 surge in Los Angeles County has made for some grueling 10-hour shifts.\n The mother of three and former stay-at-home mom has been running an ambulance for the last six months, but the call volume has grown so much in this latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic that \"we're running and running\" all day now, she said.\n \"A few months ago, there would be times where we'd sit for a couple hours just waiting for a call in our area, but now ... we're lucky if we sit for a half an hour,\" she said.\n To understand how Los Angeles' crushing Covid-19 surge has impacted first-responders, CNN spent a day with EMTs and at the emergency communication hub for Care Ambulance, the largest emergency ambulance service in Southern California. Over nearly eight hours, the group of hard-working yet harried workers tried to handle a large volume of calls and brought sick patients to hospitals so full that the patients were left waiting for hours for an available bed.\n Los Angeles has seen an overwhelming increase in coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths since November in what the county supervisor called a \"human disaster.\"\n On Sunday, the Department of Public Health reported 14,482 new cases and 166 new deaths. There are 7,964 people currently hospitalized with Covid-19 in the county, and 22% of those are in the ICU.\n The surge is so severe that ambulance crews in Los Angeles County have been told not to take patients who have little chance of survival.\n The contagious virus has radically changed their jobs, as the organization says it now daily responds to about 800 emergency calls a day and transports about 580 patients to emergency departments.\n Pope's partner on the job, Kyle Dojillo, has been an EMT for about a year, and he said the surge recently has been notable.\n \"Every time I come back to work every week, it just gets worse and worse,\" he said.\n Across LA, beds in the intensive care unit are hard to find, and some EMTs say they've waited outside hospitals with patients for six to eight hours.\n During CNN's time with EMTs on Thursday, a new 911 call came in for a Covid 19-positive patient. The EMTs quickly put on full personal protective equipment, rushed to the scene and then loaded the patient on a gurney into the ambulance.\n They raced to a nearby hospital but were then met with a backlog. Eight Care ambulances were already standing by with other patients, said ambulance supervisor Carolyn Carraway.\n The patient had to wait more than three hours before getting a hospital bed, Care Ambulance later told CNN.\n During those long waits, Carraway said, she often checks in with food or drinks to keep her staff going.\n \"I'm constantly talking to them, checking in on them,\" she said. \"My truck is full of snacks and Gatorades just to help get them through the day.\"\n Surrounded by death and sickness, the work has worn on EMT Matt Herman.\n \"A lot of times I'm just exhausted and I go straight home, eat dinner, and go to bed,\" he said. \"It's doing everything I can do to get my rest, eat as much as I can and then try to stay healthy so I can keep going.\"\n Transporting so many Covid-19-positive patients of course puts their own health at risk as well. In August, a 32-year-old EMT for Care Ambulance died after a month-long battle with the virus. The company is in the midst of vaccinating frontline personnel, but the risk remains.\n Hours into her shift, Pope had transported another patient with Covid-19, she later told CNN.\n She sprayed down the inside of her ambulance with disinfectant -- a reminder of the dangers of her vital work.\n \"I wasn't expecting anything like this, but yeah (disinfecting is) a big deal because I'm with these patients all day, and then I go home to my kids,\" she said, \"so I'm just definitely trying to be aware of the people around me and be smart about what I'm doing.\"\n CNN's Jenn Selva contributed to this report.",

        "title": "As the world begins its vaccination push, delayed rollouts draw criticism and concern",
        "body_text": "Political leaders are promising that mass vaccination campaigns will see life return to normal, as a more contagious variant of the coronavirus spreads across dozens of countries, adding urgency to the race to end the pandemic.\n But vaccination efforts are rolling out slower than promised, raising doubts about an imminent way out of the crisis.\n In nations where vaccines have been authorized, criticism is mounting over shortages and delays to getting shots into people's arms. And solutions devised to stretch supplies -- from administering half doses to spreading out the time between two doses -- have raised concerns from some experts.\n Some governments are pointing the finger at manufacturers for bottlenecks, while vaccine developers say it's an issue of supply. Others cite complications with distribution plans and a lack of trained staff to administer shots. But most public health experts say the slow pace is the inevitable consequence of creating a new vaccine rollout in real time.\n Just weeks after the United Kingdom became the world's first nation to begin vaccinating its citizens with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 shot, its government is facing questions over how many doses are available.\n The English city of Birmingham reported it was running out of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last week and doctors are demanding to know where deliveries are.\n \"The question in the UK is, is there a supply problem, or is there a problem with the infrastructure for rollout? And we don't actually know that. The manufacturers say there isn't a supply problem, but the government say there is,\" said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n A report from Britain's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), of which McKee is a member, urged the UK government to be transparent on supplies, noting evidence that \"some of those involved in implementing the vaccine strategy lack confidence in its organisation.\" Asked by CNN how many doses had been delivered, UK government officials said they were not able to provide detail about the size of supplies and future deliveries for security reasons.\n Some 2 million people have received at least one dose in the UK since the campaign started on December 8, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to ramp up vaccinations to 2 million per week. The UK trails Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the United States and Denmark in the rate of doses administered per 100 people, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University.\n McKee said European governments also must be clear about whether delays are down to a shortage of vaccine or an infrastructure issue, saying that it was \"simply unbelievable\" that countries like France seemed to be floundering. \"Many people are looking with incredulity at the failure of a number of European countries to have robust plans in place,\" he added.\n France has been under fire for its sluggish pace since the campaign started on December 27. Only 516 people were vaccinated in the first week, according to data from the French health authority on January 1. French Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters Saturday he expected 100,000 to be vaccinated by the end of the weekend. In his New Year's Eve address, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would not tolerate any \"unjustified slowness\" in the country's vaccination campaign, even as health officials argue the rollout is deliberately cautious to help convince the country's sizable population of vaccine skeptics to get it.\n Germany, which started its campaign on the same date as France, has administered over 500,000 shots (less than half of the doses delivered), but is still facing criticisms. Amid calls for the country to take control over purchases from European Union authorities, Health Minister Jens Spahn said there will be \"enough vaccine\" and urged patience.\n The Netherlands only started its campaign on Wednesday, making it the last European country to do so.\n Members of the EU vaccine procurement scheme, agreed in June, are reliant on European regulators granting authorization of Covid vaccines -- but the EU has taken longer than the UK, the US and Canada to give the green light. So far, the European Medicines Agency has authorized the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine and, last week, the Moderna vaccine -- with initial orders for 300 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine and 160 million of Moderna.\n Asked why it had not secured more vaccine doses last Monday, the European Commission defended its strategy -- pointing to the 2 billion doses from six producers already agreed. \"We're all judging this as if this campaign is over; in fact, it is just starting,\" EC spokesman Eric Mamer told reporters in Brussels.\n But the founder of BioNTech said the EU had been slow to secure doses and warned of possible gaps in supply amid surging demand. \"At the moment it doesn't look good -- a hole is appearing because there's a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine,\" Ugur Sahin told news weekly Spiegel. On Friday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had extended its contract with BioNTech/Pfizer for up to double the agreed doses.\n In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has admitted even he is frustrated to see vaccines in freezers and not in people's arms. As of Sunday, Canada had managed to administer around 315,000 doses since the campaign started on December 14 -- about half of the vaccine doses that have so far been delivered.\n Federal officials in the US, meanwhile, have been struggling to explain why only 6.7 million people had been vaccinated, when three times that number of doses have been distributed; they had promised 20 million people would have been inoculated by the end of 2020. The US also started its rollout on December 14.\n \"Clearly no excuses. We should have gotten 20 distributed, and 20 into the arms of people,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Economic Club of Washington. But Fauci said it should \"pick up momentum\" now the holiday period is over.\n President-elect Joe Biden said Friday he would aim to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, a break with the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available.\n US government officials have so far pinned the blame for initial delays on distribution issues at the state and local level. Without a federal mandate for how to administer the vaccine in the US, it's up to the states to decide who gets the vaccine and when, creating a confusing patchwork of rules that varies greatly across the country.\n When asked last week about the discrepancy between the number of vaccines distributed and those administered, Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the multi-agency effort to accelerate vaccine development and procurement, said: \"We agree that there is a lag. We'll work with the states. We need specific requests for help, frankly, it's not for me to decide whether stadiums should be used.\"\n Some states have acknowledged on-the-ground issues that delayed vaccinations, but many have said for months they need more federal funding to execute complex rollout plans.\n Gen. Gustave Perna, in charge of logistics for Operation Warp Speed, took responsibility for initial delays and confusion around the vaccine rollout in a number of states, after a misunderstanding over the approval process led to miscalculations in the doses that would be available in late December.\n Each individual batch of vaccine has to undergo independent testing before it can go into the distribution chain, a process that can take up to three weeks. The step, which is essential to assuring quality and safety, has also been referred to as the \"red tape\" hampering delivery in the UK.\n Another difficulty has been the vaccines' complicated ultracold storage and transport needs -- systems that have had to be set up from scratch. The BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius, or -94 Fahrenheit, far below the capacity of standard freezers. Establishing that infrastructure is easier in developed countries, but by no means simple.\n Much can go wrong in the complex chain from production to vialing, distribution and administration to patients but experts say the manufacturing side, which started before vaccines were even authorized, is going smoothly.\n \"There were going to be natural hiccups in the manufacturing, especially for vaccines that have never been produced at commercial scale. I think it's gone relatively well in fact. I actually would have expected more problems,\" said Robin Robinson, the founding director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a branch of the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n Ron Piervincenzi, chief executive officer of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), whose organization helps drugmakers meet quality standards, agreed that manufacturing has been relatively predictable so far -- just slightly delayed. But the delays feel more acute as the death toll climbs.\n \"It'll be messy, for you know, a couple months, it'll be messy as it rolls out to each new country and region as they go through. But they're not insolvable [problems]. This isn't a scientific challenge, like we can't make the vaccine. This is we have the vaccine, how do we get it to you,\" Piervincenzi said.\n \"In six months time we're going to be talking about the true bottlenecks rather than the messy stuff that's going to eventually be cleaned up.\"\n Grappling with a slower-than-expected pace, officials are rushing to find workarounds and solutions to the massive demand -- even lowering required dosages to stretch out supplies.\n Britain's medicines regulator is allowing second doses of coronavirus vaccines to be delayed by several weeks to inoculate more people (a move also being considered in Germany and the US). Separately, the UK government suggested that it was \"reasonable\" to use a different vaccine for the second dose if the same vaccine used for the first one was unavailable, or if a person was high-risk or unlikely to return to the doctor for a shot.\n In the US, the Food and Drug Administration has said it may be possible to yield six or even seven doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccines from the vials instead of the five indicated on the label, because the company overfills them. The FDA will consider giving half-doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine to people aged 18 to 55.\n But as countries try to eke out more doses, health experts say the focus should be on securing \"the last mile\" of the vaccination process -- the steps from when a vaccine is made to when doses are administered to people -- and ensuring no one is left out.\n An estimated 70-90% of the world's 7.8 billion people would need to receive the vaccine before achieving the so-called \"herd immunity\" required for people to return to normal life, Fauci has said. Most of the vaccines require two doses per person, that means distributing roughly 10 to 14 billion doses -- a logistical challenge the likes of which the world has never seen. Researchers at Duke Global Health Innovation Center estimate the last people in line may not receive vaccines until 2024.\n As the West frets over the speed of the vaccine rollout, countries are still scrambling to lock down supplies while others try to ring-fence doses. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been discussing with Russian President Vladimir Putin the \"possible prospects for joint production of vaccines,\" according to the Kremlin. And India's government has restricted vials of AstraZeneca's Covishield coronavirus vaccine for the domestic market until March or April, raising fears over vaccine nationalism.\n \"The higher income countries are grabbing what they can grab. And they're getting the first dibs on these vaccines, there's no question about it,\" Piervincenzi said. \"Given the delays that you see even in higher income countries, that's going to be a pretty long time off to have excess supplies of those same vaccines.\"\n COVAX, a partnership between Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization to promote global access to vaccines, is essential to getting doses to developing countries. But hedging by wealthy nations is leaving low- and middle-income nations in the lurch.\n Vaccine deliveries under the COVAX facility could start as early as this month, WHO immunization director Kate O'Brien said on Thursday. But the global scheme is reportedly struggling from a lack of funds, supply risks and contractual issues and faces a \"very high\" risk of failure, according to a leaked internal report obtained by Reuters.\n \"We need to move from somewhat piecemeal approaches to concerted multinational planning and implementation, with very thoughtful and respectful use of a scarce and incredibly valuable commodity,\" David Nabarro, WHO special envoy on Covid-19 and chair of global health at Imperial College London said, emphasizing collaboration over speed.\n \"The focus on numbers of arms being jabbed is missing the point.\"",

They spent every moment they could together, taking walks after church, stealing kisses in between classes, and attending concerts.\n Every night during the two years they were together, Paul would flicker his porch light before going to bed. It was his way of telling Harvey, who lived across the bay, good night and that he loved her.\n \"She was my first love. My first girlfriend and my first true love,\" Paul, now 84, told CNN.\n But when Paul turned 18, and Harvey was 15, the two went their separate ways. Paul moved to Toronto for work. A year later, when he came back to look for her, Harvey had moved to another town.\n Eventually, they both married other people and started families.\n But in 2017, Harvey found herself single again after her husband Len died of cancer. The couple, who were happily married for 57 years, had five children together.\n Two years later, Paul's wife of nearly 60 years, Helen, also died after suffering from multiple health issues, including dementia. They had two children together.\n It was the shared grief over losing their spouses that brought them back together.\n When Harvey heard that Paul's wife passed away, she called to reassure him that things would slowly get better.\n During that first conversation, which occurred a day after Valentine's Day, they spoke about their separate lives, their children and grandchildren and celebrated each other's happy memories.\n \"I never thought it would go past that,\" Harvey, 81, told CNN. \"But we went from talking once a week, to twice, to three times, to every day for hours. We had really reconnected even though we hadn't seen each other in all those years. I knew this was it.\"\n Months later on his birthday in July, Harvey surprised Paul by coming to Toronto where they were finally reunited.\n \"When I found out she was in town and was coming to me, it was 10:30 at night. I ran out of bed and got dressed and wrote 'Welcome Florence' in chalk on the driveway and when she arrived, I walked to the car, gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek, and I held her hand and I knew right away that she had taken my heart,\" Paul said.\n Just three days after reuniting, the couple were ready to get married. Their families questioned why they moved so fast, but Paul and Harvey had no doubts they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.\n Paul was also one month away from starting treatment for stomach cancer, but Harvey was committed to being by his side throughout the good and the bad, no matter what that meant.\n On August 8, Paul and Harvey exchanged vows in front of family and close friends at Norval United Church in Georgetown, Ontario. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, they kept the guest list small.\n \"You were the first young man to walk me home in my teens,\" Harvey told Paul during the ceremony. \"I guess you'll be the last man to walk me home.\"\n Their marriage was officiated by the church's lead minister, Paul Ivany, who conducted more than 500 wedding ceremonies in his career, but said this one was \"the most moving, most profound service\" he had ever been a part of.\n \"They both had been married for years and had created families and memories and wonderful lives. They both had truly fulfilled their vows to their first spouse 'In sickness and in health. In joy and in sorrow. To love and to cherish. As long as we both shall live',\" Ivany told CNN.\n \"And now, with all the wisdom they had gathered up in life, through all of life's joys and sorrows, life's ups and downs, they were ready to say those vows again. Not, with the naive emotionalism of young love but out of the depths of lived experience. They were willing to say those vows again. And mean them, again. It was so powerful.\"\n After exchanging vows, Paul brought out his accordion and sang a Ricky Skaggs song, \"I Wouldn't Change You If I Could,\" to his bride.\n \"There were tears in the eyes of all gathered. You couldn't help but feel you were watching a real, live miracle, that you were witness to an unimaginable love story,\" Ivany said.\n Now, Harvey said excitedly, the couple plans to retrace the first chapters of their story by visiting the childhood town where they met and fell in love all those years ago.",

        "body_text": "Calls for new protests in Washington, DC, and states across the country have law enforcement bracing for more possible violence in the coming days after rioters stormed the US Capitol last week leaving five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.\n Authorities are preparing for additional personnel to help secure the nation's capital in the coming days. A Department of Homeland Security official told CNN that the breach of the Capitol will sharpen the response and planning for inauguration.\n \"Now that it happened people will take it much more seriously,\" the official said, referring to last week's violence. \"Now, the planners, they are all going to take it much more seriously.\"\n Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, said in a statement Sunday that the Department of Defense is aware of \"further possible threats posed by would-be terrorists in the days up to and including Inauguration Day.\" Crow spoke with Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy about the January 6 events and planning for the coming days.\n Wednesday's riot has set off a shockwave of concern among federal, state and local officials for more possible bloodshed over the outcome of the 2020 election that ousted President Donald Trump from office. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has asked for additional security measures with 10 days to go before Inauguration Day and is asking people to avoid the city.\n At the Capitol Police's request, DHS helped install fencing, which was seen going up around Capitol Hill Thursday.\n At the Pentagon, officials are assessing what number of National Guard forces are needed for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, with 10,000 troops planning to be in the city by the end of the week and a possibility that a total of 13,000 might be activated for the event.\n More than 6,000 members have already been mobilized in the wake of the Capitol being stormed by pro-Trump rioters to work in 12-hour shifts on Capitol grounds and work traffic control points throughout the city.\n At the state level, security officials have been working closely with federal partners as they prepare for increasing online chatter calling for protests in all 50 states, plus Washington, DC, said one state law enforcement official with direct knowledge of conversations between federal and state partners.\n Plans for future armed protests, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, began proliferating on and off Twitter last week, the social media company said.\n Still, extremism experts are fearful of what will happen on and around January 20 when Biden is sworn into office, given surging calls for violence as many extremists see the Capitol incursion as a success.\n \"Trump WILL be sworn in for a second term on January 20th!!,\" said a commenter on thedonald.win, a pro-Trump online forum, on Thursday, the day after the siege. \"We must not let the communists win. Even if we have to burn DC to the ground.\"\n In response to Wednesday's security breach at the Capitol, authorities have arrested dozens of people connected to the unrest after pro-Trump rioters charged through barricades, assaulted police officers and shattered windows.\n The president's supporters were in Washington, DC, to protest Trump's election loss in response to Trump and his surrogates urging his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of electoral votes that confirmed Biden's win.\n \"Law enforcement was ill prepared for an event the entire country knew was coming, and one that POTUS had been signaling for weeks,\" said Brian Harrell, former DHS assistant secretary for infrastructure protection. \"The normal 'layers of security', with each inner layer being tougher to breach, was nearly non-existent. It's shocking, that in a post 9/11 world, we witnessed the 'people's house' be breached and ransacked with ease.\"\n Layers of security, standoff distancing and tactical teams on standby will be used to minimize violence near the inaugural events, he said, adding that the biggest concerns should be an active shooter scenario, vehicle ramming and the deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure.\n In light of the week's events, Bowser asked the Trump administration for an emergency declaration for DC and called on the Department of Homeland Security to extend their preparations. Intelligence suggesting further violence is likely during the Inaugural period, she wrote in a letter to Trump Sunday.\n \"I will tell you that given the events of this last week that this inauguration preparation has to be different than any other inauguration,\" Bowser said in an interview with CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n The Mayor asked DHS to extend the \"National Special Security Event\" period from January 11 to 24 in a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf -- an extension of the original plan from January 19 to 21.\n The inauguration is designated as a National Special Security Event, which allows for greater federal security cooperation and law enforcement resources.\n Additionally, Bowser asked Wolf for DHS to cooperate with the Department of Defense, Congress and the Supreme Court to establish a security perimeter with federal forces around federal property, freeing up the local Metropolitan Police Department to focus on its normal city duties.\n Bowser added that DC regularly works with federal partners on intelligence sharing but will work to improve that relationship ahead of the inauguration.\n The National Park Service announced Monday that it will close the Washington Monument to visitors for more than two weeks, a time period that includes the inauguration, in an effort to prevent potential violence from occurring there.\n NPS said it also \"may institute temporary closures of public access to roadways, parking areas and restrooms within the National Mall and Memorial Parks if conditions warrant, to protect public safety and park resources.\"\n DHS' second-in-command, Ken Cuccinelli, said that Wednesday's violence would be a \"one time event,\" and assured Americans that Inauguration Day would be safe.\n \"You're going to see immediate improvement, fully aggressive posture by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice as well, because we accept violence from no one,\" he said in an interview on Fox News Thursday.\n On Wednesday, the Capitol Police asked for additional law enforcement help from DHS, but by the time the request was made, \"it was just too close to when everything began to heat up,\" Cuccinelli said.\n Experts warn that the calls for violence, which circulated ahead of Wednesday's siege of the Capitol, have intensified ahead of Inauguration Day. Twitter said it was tracking the latest plans for armed protests when it announced the permanent suspension of Trump's account on Friday.\n White supremacists and far-right extremists feel emboldened in this moment, said Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks and counters hate. \"We fully expect that this violence could actually get worse before it gets better.\"\n A former DHS official told CNN that from the perspective of extremists, the purpose of an attack like last week's is not necessarily to destroy the Capitol. \"It's to show that a relatively small number of people can actually take over the system. It's supposed to be a rallying cry for -- 'join us, or you are now the enemy.'\"\n The former official pointed to images of members of the White power movement amid the crowd during the storming of the Capitol, adding that they were exploiting the election protest for their own purposes.\n \"We could start to see a lot of lives lost because of the moment that occurred on Wednesday, so very, very concerned about the cascading effects,\" the former official said. \"It's a very concerning moment.\"\n Outside of Washington, DC, local authorities have also had to grapple with threats and increased security needs.\n On Saturday afternoon, an unlawful assembly was declared in San Diego after protesters clashed and threw objects at police officers. According to tweets from the San Diego Police Department, protesters threw rocks, bottles and eggs at officers shortly after they were asked to leave the area. The tweets also said that pepper spray was being dispersed from the crowd toward the officers.\n The unlawful assembly was declared about an hour and a half after the pro-Trump and counter protesters gathered near the beach, according to CNN affiliate KGTV.\n On the same day as the siege in Washington, DC, the Texas State Capitol building and grounds were closed to the public \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to a statement from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Protesters took to the Capitol grounds after an \"Operation Occupy The Capitol Texas\" event was created on Facebook.\n Washington State Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee announced Friday that he was mobilizing up to 750 members of the National Guard to provide security for the beginning of the state's legislative session, which starts Monday.\n \"The actions we saw in both Washington, D.C. and Olympia earlier this week were completely unacceptable and will not be repeated in our state again,\" Inslee said in a written statement.\n Protesters occupied the steps of the state Capitol on Wednesday, and dozens of people broke through the outer grounds of the governor's mansion before being peacefully turned back by state troopers.\n \"In light of the most recent insurrection activity, the state cannot tolerate any actions that could result in harm, mayhem or interruption of function of democratic institutions,\" Inslee said Friday evening. In addition to Guardsmen, the governor says a \"large number of Washington State Patrol troopers will be on hand.\"\n In New Jersey, state homeland security officials are tracking planned events for both January 17 and January 20, as well as \"several one-off protests that we're still determining credibility,\" said a New Jersey law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the state's security efforts.\n \"Some of the online rhetoric has called for protests at all 50 capitols plus DC,\" the official said. \"FBI in particular has been continuing to put our threat assessments and we are at the state level as well.\"\n \"I think DC Is bracing for large scale protests and potential violence,\" the official said, adding that briefings state officials have received \"have outlined a much larger scale prevention and response to minimize a recurrence of last Wednesday.\"\n CNN's Pervaiz Shallwani, Patricia DiCarlo, Mark Morales, Nicky Robertson, Barbara Starr, Curt Devine, Kay Jones, Andy Rose and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "House Democrats on Monday pushed ahead with their effort to have President Donald Trump impeached, convicted in the Senate and disqualified from ever holding federal office again over last week's siege on the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n But even in the unlikely event that two-thirds of senators would agree to convict Trump, there's little to stop him from continuing to ask his supporters for money in the months and years ahead, campaign finance experts say.\n Disqualification \"has no bearing on the political committee money he already has raised, and it would have no bearing on his ability to continue to raise money into a political committee,\" said Paul S. Ryan, a top lawyer with the watchdog group Common Cause.\n \"He has a lot of options, and he has the infrastructure in place,\" added Larry Noble, a CNN contributor and former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission.\n In addition to his presidential campaign committee, Trump already has established a post-presidency vehicle -- the Save America political action committee -- that can help underwrite his expenses, fund travel and staff and support like-minded candidates.\n And experts say Trump, as a non-candidate, would be free to launch other fundraising arms with even fewer legal guardrails on his activity than his current committees. Running a super PAC, for instance, would give Trump the option to spend unlimited amounts of money and take contributions of any size, including an in-kind donation of his campaign's data about its donors.\n Although Twitter's decision Friday night to permanently ban Trump from its platform immediately cut the President off from his 88.7 million followers, Trump and his campaign committee still have \"an enormously valuable asset in their email list,\" Ryan said.\n The President has inundated his supporters with appeals for cash -- helping to raise more than $200 million between the election and early December alone as he falsely argued that the election against him was rigged. There was no evidence of widespread fraud.\n By CNN's count, the Trump campaign had sent 606 fundraising emails between 11 p.m. election night and Wednesday afternoon, shortly before the Capitol was breached.\n The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n But Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller has indicated the President intends to remain a fundraising force, telling The Washington Post over the weekend that Trump still is \"the biggest name in Republican politics\" and plans deploy millions of dollars to help GOP congressional candidates in the 2022 midterm elections.\n As the outrage over the insurrection at the Capitol mounted, the financial technology company Stripe joined the growing number of companies seeking to distance themselves from the President or his Republican allies on Capitol Hill who contested Trump's election defeat. The company decided to halt payment processing from Trump's campaign website, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The Wall Street Journal first reported the company's decision.\n Stripe, however, is just one payment company active in politics, leaving Trump's political operation with other options -- at least for now.\n CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden and his Covid-19 task force are treating the pandemic as a national security-level crisis, but with just days to go before inauguration, some major details of how they will ramp up vaccine distribution to the level promised are still being sorted out, multiple sources tell CNN.\n The Biden administration will inherit a public health emergency that is spiraling out of control -- overwhelming hospitals and breaking daily new cases and death records -- as new variants of the virus that appear to be more transmissible are showing up across the country. The incoming team has been hamstrung by a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration, which has so far failed to distribute vaccines at a rapid clip.\n Biden has laid out a timeline for 100 million shots in the first 100 days. As his January 20 swearing-in approaches, sources familiar with the task force's work tell CNN that specifics on everything from coordination between the federal and state governments, potential deployment of the National Guard and the role of private pharmacies are still actively being debated.\n CNN reported on Friday that the Biden administration's aim is to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office -- a break with the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available.\n Biden's team is confident that if they release nearly all available doses of Covid-19 vaccine immediately, people will be able to complete the two-dose regimen as planned, Dr. Celine Gounder, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board, said Saturday.\n \"I want to be very clear that we are not recommending that the second dose be delayed, so people should still get their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 21 days, of the Moderna vaccine at 28 days,\" Gounder told CNN's Ana Cabrera.\n Sources described the mood among Biden's senior-most advisers when it comes to the virus as one of absolute \"soberness.\" That sentiment comes directly from the top, according to a source familiar with the Biden team's thinking, with Biden himself deeply worried about the array of public health challenges his administration is about to acquire and asking transition aides to add more public health officials to the Covid team.\n Those working with the Biden Covid team said among the most urgent tasks for the task force has been trying to ensure that there are enough doses of the vaccine for distribution. One clear concern repeatedly expressed by the Biden team, sources said, is that Operation Warp Speed appeared to have been largely focused on the development of vaccines but neglected to develop a streamlined plan and process for actually getting vaccine shots into arms. There is also concern about vaccine hesitancy, which the Biden team has said it would try to tackle in part with an ongoing public education campaign.\n Democratic Rep. Andy Kim of New Jersey, who sits on the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis, said dealing with the Trump administration and the Biden Covid task force on matters related to the virus has presented a night and day contrast.\n \"They were constantly coming back to me and saying everything's fine, it's under control,\" Kim said of his communications with members of the Trump administration about Covid. \"The Biden team has a soberness of the moment and of understanding that this is one of the toughest and darkest times in American modern history.\"\n Both Kim and another Democrat in close touch with the Biden team on the virus said Covid-19 was being treated as a national security threat. Earlier in the transition process when the Trump administration was declining to share critical information about the virus with the transition team, \"they were putting access to Covid information just as high as national security,\" a Democratic member of Congress told CNN.\n \"I think they are incredibly cognizant of the fact this is a national security issue and it's a global health security issue,\" said Dr. Nicole Lurie, a volunteer adviser to Biden's team and a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n But if the incoming Biden team is preparing to tackle Covid-19 as one of its most urgent national crises, there is plenty of trepidation about its readiness -- particularly when it comes to the enormous challenge of accelerating the pace of vaccine distribution.\n \"It's like the California wildfire, and all you have is one firetruck,\" a source familiar with the Biden team's thinking said.\n Biden recently floated the idea of establishing thousands of federally run community vaccination centers \"located in high school gyms or NFL football stadiums\" with potential help from FEMA, the CDC, as well as the US military and the National Guard. The President-elect has also vowed to send in mobile units to vaccinate those in hard-to-reach communities, and use the Defense Production Act to speed up vaccine production.\n One source close to Biden's Covid task force and privy to the team's planning said a number of different ideas to accomplish mass vaccination are being discussed, though those plans remain in flux.\n The source said even with a lot more aid from the federal government, individual states would still call the shots depending on each of its vaccination needs and how they choose to utilize the serves of the government.\n Private pharmacies would also continue to have a large role to play, that source said. Some of the challenges on that front include simply having enough medical personnel on site to observe patients for 15 to 30 minutes after they've been vaccinated, which requires a lot of manpower and physical space.\n Biden's publicly stated goal of getting 100 million shots done in his first 100 days in office is seen as \"doable,\" this source said, but will require the federal government, individual states and private companies to work together seamlessly -- a dynamic that currently does not exist now, they said.\n The mutation of the Covid-19 virus is also something the Biden Covid task force is watching carefully, as scientists and researchers scramble to figure out what exactly the variants could mean in terms of spread of the virus and efficacy of the approved vaccines against them.\n \"They're worried\" is how one lawmaker simply described the outlook in the Biden world about the variants, though they emphasized that there is no reason right now to be pessimistic about whether the currently approved vaccines are effective against the mutated strains.\n The Biden transition team did not respond to CNN's questions about how the Covid task force is currently examining the virus variants and what they might mean for vaccinations, and whether the team views US hospitals being overwhelmed and record-breaking death tolls as a sign of a newly dire phase of the pandemic.\n Lurie, the volunteer adviser to the Biden Covid-19 team, told CNN she believes they will put a broader emphasis on supporting vaccination campaigns globally and using the national security infrastructure to help identify new variants emerging across the globe and look at the implications for treatments and vaccines.\n \"We could vaccinate everyone in this country and still have a real problem with coronavirus if new variants arrive,\" Lurie said.",

        "body_text": "As Ashlyn Atigre prepared to take her healthy son to the pediatrician for his 3-year-old well visit recently, a nagging concern was on her mind.\n \"I want to talk about the social impact of the pandemic with the doctor,\" said the Tampa, Florida, mother. \"I'm an introvert but clearly need people. And I'm seeing his shyness increase and wondering if it's Covid, if I'm just seeing my genes or if it's because he's almost three and at a new (stage) in life.\"\n The family has been social distancing from friends and relatives since taking their son out of day care back in March, said Atigre, 36, whose husband is a doctor and works in several local hospitals. (While they're taking all precautions at work and home, that's where they could potentially be exposed to the virus, said Atigre.)\n For months, she said, they've only really interacted closely with one set of neighbors who have a child slightly younger than her son in a shared social \"bubble.\"\n \"I have worried if he is learning emotions and empathy just being here with me,\" she said, as well as interpersonal skills like taking turns, sharing and learning to handle situations he doesn't like.\n Fewer playdates with friends, caregivers in masks that hide their smiles at day care and too much Zoom and screen time during the pandemic \u2014 parents of toddlers are worried about more than green poop right now.\n While these worries are valid, they're unlikely to bear longtime consequences on normally developing toddlers, said Amy Learmonth, a professor of psychology at William Paterson University of New Jersey.\n \"Toddlers' whole goal in life is to keep their caregiver close, which is why they do so many of the unattractive things they do,\" Learmonth said. \"So in some ways, the necessities of the pandemic have given them exactly what they want.\"\n The developmental task of toddlers \u2014 one of the age groups Learmonth said will best weather the pandemic \u2014 is to learn to be social beings. And that social development \"can really happen in the family,\" she said.\n Kids love being engaged in keeping someone safe, so tell them \"they can't see Grandma because we're going to keep her safe.\"\n \"We need to make sure when we talk to them about how we're not going to hug our neighbor \u2014 all these things we're restricting them from doing \u2014 we need to be really clear that it's because of the virus,\" she said. And not that other people are scary.\n The challenges of balancing working from home with toddler rearing are top of mind for many these days, including Karlee Vincent, a California Bay Area mother who says she has noticed behavioral changes in her 3-year-old daughter since taking her out of day care in March.\n \"My toddler has become a Velcro baby because of her need for a stronger emotional connection with me,\" said the 33-year-old founder of Traveling Milk Truck. \"She cries more frequently, pulls my arms away from the keyboard and begs me to stop working.\"\n Drawing a line between work and play may help.\n \"A preschooler's job is to play,\" said Scott D. McDaniel, a licensed professional counselor with Greater Rome Psychotherapy Services in Rome, Georgia.\n His advice? \"Really interact with your children, allow them to enlist you as a playmate and follow their lead. It is through play that they act out feelings and concerns, learn new skills and interact with others.\"\n Get away from screens and enter their pretend play world to get an idea of what kids are thinking, said clinical psychologist Robyn Koslowitz, director of the Targeted Parenting Institute and host of the \"Post-Traumatic Parenting\" podcast.\n \"I get it we're all looking for stress relief on our phones during this pandemic, but honestly, the oxytocin that is released when we lay on the carpet and belly laugh with a toddler is healthier than 'likes' on Instagram or another round of Candy Crush,\" she said.\n And if your kid wants to play \"pandemic\" and you wonder if they're scarred for life?\n \"He or she is just playing out what he's seeing,\" she said. \"It's so normal.\"\n Experts advise turning to local resources that address childhood development \u2014 many of which have gone online during the pandemic \u2014 for help, if you can find them.\n \"Early intervention is magic \u2014 and in most states, it's available,\" Learmonth said.\n Baby Bungalow \u2014 an early childhood learning and resource center run by Champions for Children in Tampa, Florida \u2014 currently offers 10 Zoom play groups weekly as well as \"playground appointments\" for family units to share time together in a safe outside environment, said Program Director Paula Wyne.\n Designed for kids ages newborn to age 5, the nonprofit's pandemic-spawned Zoom sessions \"sometimes fly in the face of what we're encouraging regarding being really play-based and about interaction \u2014 play being the foundation of learning from our perspective,\" she said.\n The online sessions, however, play an important role as \"support for families in retaining that connection to services,\" as well as helping to ensure that parents and caregivers have appropriate expectations of their children's behavior.\n \"Toddlers have what they need at home to weather this,\" Wyne said. \"We're keeping those connections, talking about the things that connect us to one another that one day we'll be able to do again.\"\n Tapping into our own resilience during these times can also benefit your children and make them more resilient, Koslowitz said.\n \"Toddlers take the world as they see it, they don't know any different.\"\n \"If we're modeling resilience, they will learn it. Can we manage our own big emotions? Do we do the commonsense things we need to do to keep ourselves resilient?\"\n Among those, she said, are getting enough sleep, eating healthy food, enjoying safe social connections and taking care of ourselves by doing things we enjoy.\n \"Do what you need to do to make yourself present,\" she said.\n The kids are going to be all right, Learmonth said.\n \"Toddlers are one of the age groups I worry about the least, but the parents are one I worry about the most,\" she said.\n \"It's not helpful for us to be so worried about this. Toddlers are incredibly good at reading our signals.\"\n And if you're worried that some of those signals are hidden behind masks by masked caregivers at day care (and other faces usually out in the open in non-pandemic times), that, too, she said, will pass.\n If toddlers don't see lips moving all day, just make time to talk to them when they come home from day care as normal, Learmonth said.\n \"For most kids who are typically developing and not having difficulties in general, this will be a blip.\"\n Terry Ward is freelance writer based in Tampa, Florida.",

        "title": "The last time America fired a president",
        "body_text": "Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\nIt doesn't happen very often, the firing of a president. In the last 100 years, the only elected presidents to be voted out were Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and, now, Donald Trump.\n Trump has announced he will not attend the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. Not a surprise. The outgoing president isn't exactly known for his class, grace or humility in accepting loss. Given Trump's role in inciting a crowd to attack the Capitol in a bid to stop Biden's victory from being certified, if he chose to attend, it would certainly make for an awkward occasion.\n But even for a president who is not a sore loser, surrendering power to the man who defeated you is tough. Hoover refused to speak to former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the chilly ride from the White House to the inaugural stand at the Capitol in 1933. And though Carter was more gracious, he later confessed he found former President Ronald Reagan's small talk about his Hollywood days \"remarkably pointless,\" especially since his 1981 Inauguration Day was also the day the American hostages in Iran were freed.\n Former President George H.W. Bush, on the other hand, was dignity personified. The campaign was spirited. Republicans accused former President Bill Clinton of somehow being politically compromised because of a student trip he took to the Soviet Union in 1969. Bush himself, in a campaign speech, called Clinton a \"bozo,\" a comment he said later he hadn't thought was all that offensive.\n And, as a strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, I can tell you we launched our fair share of attacks as well, taunting Bush for pledging \"read my lips, no new taxes\" and mocking Bush's seeming inaction in the face of a recession. Tame stuff compared to today, to be sure. But the potential for a deep and lasting rupture was real, and both men made a special point to unite the country.\n This is where Bush's amazing grace came in. He was a wounded politician, but more than that he was a patriot. \"Among the many memories from my first inauguration that I'll cherish for the rest of my life,\" Clinton recalled to me, \"is the extraordinary graciousness that President and Mrs. Bush showed to Hillary, Chelsea and me on what had to have been an incredibly difficult day for them.\"\n The outgoing president and incoming President-elect meet for coffee at the White House before the swearing-in, and one can imagine that the coffee comes with a quite a bit of tension -- especially when you must depart the White House for the last time in the company of the guy who kicked you out. But the Bushes cut through it, Clinton told me. \"They treated us with genuine kindness, and expressed a real hope that our country would be successful over the next four years, and that our family would be happy in the White House.\"\n Former first lady Barbara Bush, herself a fierce competitor, shifted into loving grandmother mode. \"I'll never forget Mrs. Bush praising Chelsea, who was 12 at the time,\" Clinton told me, \"for the way she handled herself so maturely through the crucible of the campaign. Chelsea replied, 'Thank you, Mrs. Bush, I tried.' And Mrs. Bush said, in her direct, classic way, 'Oh, we all try. But not everyone can do it.'\"\n I asked Clinton about the car ride from the White House to the Capitol. He declined to reveal specifics -- some secrets are, apparently, kept in the Presidents' Club -- but he told me, \"As we spent the final moments together before the peaceful transition of power, the theme that came out again and again was gratitude -- for the remarkable democracy in which we live, and for the chance to serve its people so well and so long.\"\n The choreography of an inauguration is precise. The Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court is called forward. The President-elect recites the oath, right hand raised, left hand on the Bible.  As the words, \"So help me God,\" leave his lips, the Army fires a 21-gun salute, a bracing signal that he now commands the most powerful military in human history.\n All went according to the script on that frigid January day in 1993.  After the oath, Clinton hugged his wife and daughter, and waved to the crowd. Then, in his first act as President, he strode across the platform and shook his predecessor's hand. The two former foes had a brief but warm public greeting. A deeply empathetic man, Clinton was profoundly attuned to the pain his predecessor felt, having been rejected himself in his first bid for reelection as governor of Arkansas in 1980 -- and did his best to acknowledge the difficulty of the moment.\n And just as Clinton's first act as President was a tribute to Bush, his first few words as President included this praise for the man he had defeated: \"On behalf of our Nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America. And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism, and communism.\"\n On that day, the presidency was in transition. But so, notably, was Clinton's relationship with Bush. Clinton never knew his father, who died in a car accident before he was born. Over the years, he and Bush formed a bond that was nearly familial. Bush himself suggested that perhaps he, two decades Clinton's senior, had been the father Clinton never had.\n After Clinton's term, the two teamed up for disaster relief efforts, and Clinton made regular pilgrimages to the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where the elder former president would impress the younger by slicing through the ocean at high speeds on his beloved boat. President George W. Bush has said his family's relationship with Clinton is so close that he is \"a brother with a different mother.\"\n For his part, Clinton clearly misses George H.W. and Barbara Bush. Thinking back on the warmth they showed him on that chilly January day, he said, \"President and Mrs. Bush were wonderful people and true patriots.  I'll always be grateful for their friendship and example -- and especially how warmly they treated us that day.\"\n Don't expect Trump to be teaming up with any of his predecessors to help the victims of a far-away tsunami, or even to join him for a round of golf. His absence from Biden's inauguration calls to mind one of the maxims George H.W. Bush loved to quote: \"Ninety percent of life is just showing up.\"",

        "body_text": "First lady Melania Trump mourned the lives lost -- first of the rioters and then the Capitol Police officers -- from last week's attack, cast herself as a victim of \"salacious gossip\" but placed no responsibility for the domestic terrorism on husband President Donald Trump or his rhetoric.\n She issued a statement on WhiteHouse.gov on Monday expressing her condolences to the four Trump supporters killed during the attacks before naming the US Capitol Police officers who died in the line of duty.\n \"Most recently, my heart goes out to: Air Force Veteran, Ashli (Babbitt), Benjamin (Phillips), Kevin Greeson, (Roseanne) Boyland, and Capitol Police Officers, Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood. I pray for their families comfort and strength during this difficult time,\" she said.\n Trump also lashed out at what she called \"salacious gossip and unwarranted personal attacks\" before condemning last Wednesday's violence, likely responding to CNN reporting she was engaged in a furniture photo shoot during the insurrection.\n \"I find it shameful that surrounding these tragic events there has been salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations on me -- from people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda. This time is solely about healing our country and its citizens. It should not be used for personal gain,\" the first lady, whose \"Be Best\" platform centers on civility and kindness, said in the post.\n Trump then condemned the events of last week: \"Make no mistake about it, I absolutely condemn the violence that has occurred on our Nation's Capitol. Violence is never acceptable,\" she wrote.\n Short of casting any responsibility on the President, the first lady instead euphemistically described what led to the events as \"passion and enthusiasm.\"\n \"It is inspiring to see that so many have found a passion and enthusiasm in participating in an election, but we must not allow that passion to turn to violence,\" she said.\n While images of the mob breaking into the Capitol consumed the airwaves, the first lady was focused -- with the White House chief usher, Timothy Harleth -- on getting the furniture shoot completed. Both the media, including CNN, and members of her staff were asking if Trump had plans to tweet a statement of calm, or a call to stop the violence -- something she had done a handful of times months earlier during the protests surrounding the police killing of George Floyd. She did not.\n Her disinterest in addressing the country was indicative of being \"checked out,\" said another White House source, who added, \"she just isn't in a place mentally or emotionally anymore where she wants to get involved.\"\n Later Wednesday evening, two of the first lady's top aides, chief of staff Stephanie Grisham -- who also served as Trump's closest adviser, speechwriter and spokesperson -- and Anna Cristina \"Rickie\" Niceta, White House social secretary, submitted their resignations effective immediately in the wake of the violence.\n With the absence of Grisham, who aided Trump in speechwriting and communications, it was not immediately clear how the statement came together, though there were multiple examples of striking similarities between passages of the post and Trump's August 2020 speech to the Republican National Committee.\n \"My husband and I have visited many places that have been affected by natural disasters and we are deeply moved by the strength of the people who have lost everything and the kindness of neighbors and communities. The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden during the Republican National Convention in August.\n On Monday, she wrote: \"Our country's strength and character have revealed themselves in the communities that have been impacted by natural disasters and throughout this terrible pandemic that has affected all of us. The common thread in all of these challenging situations is American's unwavering resolve to help one another.\"\n In August: \"It has been inspiring to see what the people of our great nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most fragile.\"\n And on Monday: \"As your First Lady, it has been inspiring to witness firsthand what the people of our great Nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most vulnerable.\"\n Those similarities come over four years after Trump was widely criticized for plagiarizing passages from then-first lady Michelle Obama during Trump's 2016 RNC remarks.\n This story has been updated with additional context on the first lady's statement.",
