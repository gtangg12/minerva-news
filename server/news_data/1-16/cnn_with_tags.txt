        "title": "L.A. inquest into a fatal police shooting of 18-year-old backs earlier conclusion that it was homicide",
        "body_text": "Following the first inquest in Los Angeles in more than 30 years, the Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office on Friday released its findings, which supported its earlier conclusion that the death of Andres Guardado -- shot five times in the back by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy in June -- was a homicide.\n In a four-page document, retired Justice Candace Cooper said that \"the medical cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds\" and \"the manner of death was by the hands of another person other than by accident.\"\n The death of the 18-year-old Latino man happened amid widespread protests across the country, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, racial injustice and the relationship between police and communities of color.\n On June 18, Guardado was pursued by sheriff's deputies after he reportedly displayed a handgun, looked toward the deputies and ran from an auto body shop, according to the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Attorneys representing the Guardado family have disputed those claims.\n In July, an independent autopsy ordered by Guardado's family found the teen was shot five times in the back. The county coroner's office came to the same conclusion. Guardado's manner of death was certified a homicide.\n On November 10, the county coroner's office called for an inquest \"in the interest of public transparency\" after questions arose about deputies' use of force. The inquest was held on November 30.\n \"In the nearly five months since Andres Guardado was killed, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has failed to be transparent in its investigation into the circumstances, manner and cause of Andres' death,\" Adam Shea, an attorney for the family, said in November.\n The inquest's findings will be forwarded to the sheriff's department as well as the Los Angeles district attorney, according to the report.\n The judge also noted in the findings that she will \"not pursue the Fifth Amendment issues\" raised during the inquest.\n Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy Miguel Vega, who fired the deadly shots, submitted a declaration \"indicating that if he were to appear and be questioned at the inquest, he would assert his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.\"\n Vega's attorney Adam Marangell previously told CNN that, \"Guardado refused multiple commands not to reach for a gun, forcing deputy Vega to fire his weapon in fear for his life.\"\n The sheriff's department in December announced that Vega was relieved of duties in response to an unrelated investigation into a traffic accident in April. A second officer was also relieved in connection with the same incident.\n \"Our hearts go out to the family and loved ones of Mr. Guardado. This investigation has been submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney- Justice System Integrity Division,\" the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told CNN in a statement Monday. \"The findings by Judge Cooper as to (the) cause and manner of death are consistent with the facts presented by the Department during the August 12, 2020, press conference.\"\n Marangell also released a statement to CNN on Monday about the investigation.\n \"The findings of the inquest are entirely consistent with the initial findings of the coroner, thus proving this proceeding was entirely unnecessary and, sadly, driven by politics rather than facts,\" Marangell's statement read. \"We look forward to the true facts of this matter being brought forward in an objective forum.\"\n CNN's Cheri Mossburg, Ralph Ellis, Stella Chan, Paul Vercammen, Madeline Holcombe and Travis Caldwell contributed to this report.",

        "title": "An audiobooks app will tell unheard African stories",
        "body_text": "African countries have a longstanding tradition of oral storytelling, used to entertain and educate younger generations about culture and history. Now, tech entrepreneur Herman Chinery-Hesse, known for establishing SOFTtribe, Ghana's largest software company, wants to to keep this tradition alive through a new audiobooks app.\n Afrikan Echoes is due to launch in March, featuring up to 50 original and unpublished African works that have been translated into multiple African languages, including Yoruba, Amharic and Swahili.\n The Ghanaian innovator says his platform will allow people from all walks of life to tell their untold tales on the international stage.\n African storytellers from across the continent will be able to pitch their stories to Afrikan Echoes by sending voice notes in their native language. These pitches will be evaluated by Chinery-Hesse's creative team before being recorded in their studio.\n Available on Android, with each story costing $1 to download, the app will feature a variety of styles, from action and autobiographies to history and romance.\n \"In today's world, the oral tradition can be translated into electronic audio,\" Chinery-Hesse tells CNN. \"So suddenly, we have Africa's oral tradition on steroids, which is what we are trying to achieve here.\"\n \"We would like a situation where non-Africans can listen to African stories told by Africans, in an African way,\" he adds.\n According to data released by the World Bank, around 65% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa are literate, compared to over 84% globally. Chinery-Hesse believes Afrikan Echoes will allow Africans who cannot read the opportunity to consume stories from the continent.\n His vision is that one day, \"if you drive into an African village, you'll be able to find everyone sitting at the back of the chief's house, speaker on, with an audiobook playing about some event in another African village, in another African country, and they're all listening attentively,\" he says.\n Read: How solar tech could help distribute Covid-19 vaccines in Africa\n Reaching customers living in rural areas without access to the internet or mobile data is one of Afrikan Echoes' biggest challenges. According to International Telecommunication Union estimates, in 2019 only 28% of Africans used the internet.\n That's why Chinery-Hesse is creating a model that allows people to share audiobooks while offline. He says this could work through an in-app button which will allow some people to bulk buy audiobooks and then distribute them to others via Bluetooth.\n Afrikan Echoes also uses SMS texts to alert registered customers to the latest audiobook releases.\n Funded by SOFTtribe, Afrikan Echoes currently runs out of Chinery-Hesse's home in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and is stocked with recording equipment that is used to record up to five stories a week.\n Chinery-Hesse says the startup has spent under $100,000 to launch and that he purposefully avoided fundraising to ensure the company remained entirely African-owned.\n Michala Mackay, the chief operating officer and director of the Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation in Sierra Leone, predicts the app will improve digitization in Africa, as well as educating children and giving people opportunities to tell stories the African way.\n \"One of the constraints in being able to sell our stories is the language barriers that we have,\" she tells CNN. \"Afrikan Echoes gives you the opportunity to tell your story as you know it, in another language that somebody else in another country whom you have no connection with, can understand, learn from, and be able to experience the same experiences that you have.\"\n In photos: These infrastructure megaprojects are reshaping Africa\n \"You could be a fisherman that's uneducated, has never gone through the doors of any schoolroom, but be able to tell your story,\" she adds.\n Among the unpublished authors telling their story on the app is Frank Karefa-Smart, whose story recounts his colorful life working in New York during the time of the civil rights movement, and across West Africa in the diamond trade.\n Chinery-Hesse hopes that stories such as these will connect the continent in a unique way.\n \"The stories we are going to produce are coming from all of Africa. It's not city to city. It's mobile phone to mobile, so village to village. The whole world gets to watch and hear African stories from Africans across the continent,\" he says.",

        "title": "Why you won't find Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson on British TV",
        "body_text": "The insurrection at the US Capitol has sparked a political firestorm and unnerved millions of Americans. It has also unleashed a wave of criticism over the role played by pro-Trump media outlets such as Fox News, which fed lies and conspiracy theories about the election to angry supporters of the president for weeks.\n \"The mob that stormed and desecrated the Capitol ... could not have existed in a country that hadn't been radicalized by the likes of [Fox News hosts] Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, and swayed by biased news coverage,\" wrote Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan.\n But are the airwaves of any democracy free of this kind of harmful propaganda and downright fiction? The United Kingdom, for one, comes pretty close.\n A big factor in this is media regulator Ofcom, which enforces rules on impartiality and accuracy for all news broadcasters. Those who breach the rules can be censured or fined \u2014 putting pressure on TV channels to play stories fairly straight.\n Russian state-funded news channel RT, for example, was slapped with a \u00a3200,000 ($272,000) penalty for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its 2018 coverage of the poisonings of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, as well as the conflict in Syria. It has not been fined since.\n \"What the impartiality rules do is ensure you cannot have the kind of shock jock culture \u2014 [a] far right, or indeed far left, one-sided interpretation of events,\" said Steven Barnett, a professor of media and communication at the University of Westminster.\n The UK system isn't perfect. A review of BBC coverage ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum found that its main news program was more negative on the European Union than Russian President Vladimir Putin. And two new media ventures expected to launch shortly could again push the limits of what's allowed. But according to experts, the framework has protected against the kind of disinformation peddled by Fox News in the United States.\n Ofcom, which was established in 2003, has two important standards that the news broadcasters it licenses must abide by \u2014 \"due impartiality\" and \"due accuracy.\"\n This does not mean that equal time needs to be given on television and radio to both sides of an issue. But broadcasters do have a responsibility at least to acknowledge opposing viewpoints, and to quickly correct \"significant mistakes.\"\n When Fox News was on the air in the United Kingdom, its top stars were found to have violated the regulator's rules.\n Ofcom said that a Hannity program about President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim countries didn't do enough to surface the viewpoints of those who opposed the order. Ofcom also said that a separate Carlson broadcast following the 2017 Manchester terror attack \u2014 which included claims that UK authorities had done nothing to stop terrorism or to protect \"thousands of underage girls\" from rape and abuse \u2014 did not adequately reflect alternate perspectives.\n Such warnings hint at the trouble Fox News could have faced had it stuck it out during the Trump era.\n Hefty penalties awarded to other channels, such as RT, have effectively communicated the consequences of slipping up to media executives, said Trevor Barnes, a TV and radio compliance consultant and former Ofcom official.\n \"They're aware that if they misbehave, they'll be hit with a fine,\" he said.\n The United States, meanwhile, doesn't have these kinds of rules \u2014 and hasn't since the Reagan era, when the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the so-called Fairness Doctrine for TV and radio stations. Historians believe the demise of this rule, which required broadcasters to present a variety of views on issues of public importance, paved the way for the explosion of conservative talk radio in the late 1980s and 1990s, which later served as a model for Fox. Those talk radio shows continue to be popular today.\n As a cable network, Fox News wouldn't have been bound by the doctrine, which only applied to broadcast channels. But Julian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University and CNN contributor, said its removal changed the rules of the game.\n \"It served as a kind of check,\" Zelizer said. \"It was always on the mind of everyone who was in the news business.\"\n Now, even members of the Murdoch family are reckoning with the role Fox News has played. James Murdoch, who made a dramatic break from his family last year when he resigned from the board of News Corp, said in a statement on Friday that \"spreading disinformation\" has \"real world consequences.\" While he did not mention Fox News by name, it was clear his focus was on the network controlled by his father and brother.\n \"Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies. We hope the awful scenes we have all been seeing will finally convince those enablers to repudiate the toxic politics they have promoted once and forever,\" James Murdoch and his wife, Kathryn Murdoch, said in a joint statement to the Financial Times.\n The United Kingdom has largely watched the Capitol riot and its aftermath in horror.\n \"The events ... have been the ultimate demonstration of what can happen when those fundamental pillars of democracy break down: accurate information [and] fair information,\" Barnett said.\n But two outlets expected to debut shortly in the United Kingdom could test the bounds of the regulatory system, including Ofcom's appetite for enforcement.\n Murdoch's UK operation, which still controls three big British newspapers \u2014 The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times \u2014 is working on a new video venture, having recently received a license under the name News UK TV. Details haven't been announced.\n Meanwhile, upstart competitor GB News, which recently secured \u00a360 million ($81 million) from investors, is hiring journalists as it prepares to launch a 24-hour news channel.\n \"Many British people are crying out for a news service that is more diverse and more representative of their values and concerns,\" former BBC host Andrew Neil, who will serve as the chairman of GB News, said in a statement last week. Neil was previously the editor of Murdoch's Sunday Times and executive chairman of Sky TV.\n Critics fear the News UK TV venture and GB News could move to take on the BBC and fill a perceived gap in right-wing broadcasting, sparking concerns about whether UK regulators are up to the task of maintaining due impartiality, or whether Britain could soon have its own Fox News-type problem.\n Both outlets may play things fairly safe at first, and Barnes noted that the rules will give them some latitude.\n \"There's no requirement under due impartiality for a channel not to have a bias,\" he said. \"All it requires is you reflect, to a pretty small degree, what the opposing viewpoint is.\"\n But Barnett is worried that over time, there could be a slow erosion of norms \u2014 combined with an anti-Ofcom push from Murdoch's powerful papers, who may level criticisms of a \"nanny state regulator telling us what we can and can't say.\" News Corp declined to comment.\n \"I will make a prediction that within a year we will see a concerted attack within the Murdoch press on Ofcom,\" he said. And if support for the regulator fades, all bets will be off.",

        "title": "How to serve on MLK Day while quarantining at home",
        "body_text": "Caught between colliding pressures of a pandemic, political unrest and outcries for social justice, this Martin Luther King Day of Service is unlike any other. But despite the limitations of the season, this federal holiday doesn't have to be any less impactful. Now more than ever, MLK Day of Service is enabling everyday people to roll up their sleeves and help their communities -- even while stuck at home. Here's how:\n Without the hassle of finding parking or forgetting your facemask at home, one way to spread goodwill on MLK Day is by making at-home care packages for those in need of cheer. Operation Gratitude is offering a number of virtual ways to spread joy to frontline workers and military members. With convenience in mind, this organization has set up an Amazon wish list through the Amazon Smile Program. After purchase, items like socks, sunscreen, and beef jerky are shipped to Operation Gratitude. From there, care packages are assembled and sent to those on the front lines.\n \"Volunteers are the heart and soul of Operation Gratitude,\" says Danielle Teconi, the organization's communications director.\n \"Anyone, from anywhere, can participate from home, as it's self-guided and self-paced,\" she explains.\n As an added perk, eligible purchases made through the organization's wish list will kick back a small donation to the charity.\n For crafty volunteers, Operation Gratitude also offers a step-by-step guide on how to make eye-catching letters of gratitude for military personnel and essential workers.\n And, for those who sew, volunteers can lend their talents on MLK Day to create knitted crafts as a part of the organization's Hand Made with Love initiative. Soft keepsakes like crochet hats, scarves and handmade bags can cheer up deployed troops when home feels far away.\n This year's day of service provides a timely opportunity to learn about existing public health disparities made worse for communities of color by Covid-19. In honor of Dr. King's commitment to public health access, Global Citizen 365 is hosting a national conversation on \"Justice and the Covid-19 Health Crisis.\" The online event will take place via Zoom at 3 pm Eastern on Martin Luther King Day.\n To teach the next generation of change agents, the organization is hosting a virtual read-aloud recording. Global Citizen 365 is seeking volunteers willing to film an animated selfie-video. Those interested are asked to record themselves reading a children's book about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights or civic engagement. Once submitted, the non-profit will post the videos online and share them with families.\n At a time when so many people are in pain, you can sustain life.\n To learn where to donate blood, enter your zip code into the search tool set up by the American Red Cross. According to its website, the American Red Cross has a special need for donations from fully-recovered coronavirus survivors. Those who have fully recovered from the virus are urged to consider donating convalescent plasma. The convalescent plasma of fully recovered coronavirus survivors may contain antibodies helpful to critically ill Covid patients.\n Another way to help sustain life on MLK Day is by volunteering to become a bone marrow donor with Be The Match. Bone marrow donations can save the lives of individuals battling blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, as well as blood disorders like sickle cell disease. Be The Match has an urgent plea for donations from communities of color\u2014especially Black and African-American individuals. Of the organization's more than 22 million member registry, only 4% identify as Black or African American.\n Due to the lack of representation, Be The Match says Black and African American patients are among the least likely to find a match. According to Kate McDermott, a public relations specialist at the organization, Black and African-American people only have a 23% chance of finding a suitable donor.\n \"That number is unacceptable to us. We want to make sure that all of our patients regardless of ethnic background are able to find the match that they need,\" she tells CNN. \"Our mission is equal outcomes for all.\"\n To encourage life-saving donations, Be The Match says it has created the Race Against Time campaign to urge communities of color to come forward to help sustain lives of color impacted by blood-related diseases.\n As the pandemic forced people to prioritize physical health over mental wellness, many elderly citizens have suffered in silence. Programs like the Selfhelp's Virtual Senior Center program are seeking volunteers eager to share meaningful moments and smiles with seniors. At-home volunteers are needed to facilitate hour-long virtual classes for their senior students based on interests, hobbies and expertise. Classes are diverse, covering topics like cooking, birding, seated exercise, art and music history. Selfhelp says it operates the oldest and largest program providing comprehensive services to Holocaust survivors in North America. It provides a special platform to accommodate the unique needs of these users as well.\n \"Just as the Virtual Senior Center offers emotional and physical health benefits to participants, volunteer facilitators become part of our community and learn from our clients as well,\" says Sandy Myers from Selfhelp Community Services. \"We've learned the importance of strong online communities and are grateful for the work of our volunteers to make the VSC a vibrant community, especially throughout Covid.\"\n Although based in New York, Selfhelp's virtual senior center is growing nationally. The team welcomes volunteers and senior students from across the country. And if individuals are interested in learning how to bring a virtual senior center to their neighborhood, Selfhelp can help.\n To learn more about the life of Dr. King and how to honor his legacy, The King Center is hosting its online Beloved Community Commemorative Service to honor the late global civil rights icon. The event will stream virtually on the organization's webpage and Facebook account at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The service will feature a keynote address from Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter's House Church in Texas.",

        "title": "Heading 'into a buzzsaw': Why extremism experts fear the Capitol attack is just the beginning ",
        "body_text": "The US Capitol is surrounded by fences and troops amid fear the January 6 riots could spark violence this weekend and leading up to Wednesday's inauguration.\n But experts worry the real threat may be what the attack unleashed for the long term.\n \"The plots of tomorrow are literally being hatched right now,\" Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told CNN.\n Experts shared growing concern about chatter around a unifying message of people who feel wronged -- by those in power, by the political system and by Big Tech.\n They're also worried that the numbers of potentially violent extremists are growing. Social media giants banned President Donald Trump and others over fears their posts would continue to spark violence, which the experts said has led to a sympathetic and growing audience at risk of radicalization.\n Some who had communicated via Facebook, Twitter or even Parler are now on other platforms. Those include Telegram, where extremists and White supremacist channels have existed and spewed hate for years in channels largely unmoderated until just days ago.\n On many of these channels, there is frequent praise of mass killers, tactical instructions and vile and disturbing radicalizing content being spread rapidly.\n \"Our moderators are reviewing an increased number of reports related to public posts with calls to violence, which are expressly forbidden by our Terms of Service,\" Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn told CNN in a statement on Wednesday. Vaughn added: \"We welcome peaceful discussion and peaceful protests, but routinely remove publicly available content that contains direct calls to violence.\"\n Segal calls the Capitol attack a seminal moment and says it will have a major impact, even more than the country's historically biggest catalysts for major anti-government activity.\n \"It ain't Waco, it's not Ruby Ridge, this is bigger than that,\" Segal explains comparing January 6 to past events that sparked calls to action and inspired deeper distrust and sometimes hatred against the government. \"This stuff impacts more people.\"\n In public and private chats there are common messages about plotting to \"take back America\" or rallying together against supposed censorship, according to Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America. Carusone and his team have been tracking extremist language and posting in a variety of media landscapes.\n \"We saw these mass migrations from traditional platforms like Twitter and Facebook to a surge of activity on Parler, and then a secondary surge of activity onto platforms like Telegram as these intermediate groups started to build up redundancy in their communications,\" he says.\n \"And that meant fresh blood,\" Carusone says.\n Fringe online spaces are now seeing far-right figures, hate-filled White supremacists, and racists who have clamored for civil war mix with QAnon conspiracists and ardent President Trump supporters who have listened to him for years and believe the election was stolen from them.  And many are figuring out what to do next -- and how to craft their messages.\n In one neo-Nazi-focused chat, a member urged restraint in language to avoid alienating newcomers, Carusone said.\n The FBI said in a statement to CNN that while some of the content may be disturbing, authorities cannot take action on that alone.\n \"The FBI cannot open an investigation without a threat of violence or alleged criminal activity. However, when that language does turn to a call for violence or criminal activity, the FBI is able to undertake investigative activity,\" the agency said.\n Investigators could face a tougher task of finding some people who have been removed from the bigger platforms.\n \"It is more and more important to know where they're going, especially if they're moving even further and further behind the veil,\" Carusone said. \"If you lose track of them entirely, you lose that that information pipeline, you lose the ability to identify those indicators, which means it's harder to prevent harm.\"\n Prevention efforts must go beyond mere barricades and officers, Carusone says.\n \"It's actually the mechanisms that are radicalizing these individuals,\" Carusone says. \"It's the algorithms that are helping connect people. It's the disinformation.\"\n None of the protests this weekend or at the inauguration will feature an actual Trump rally. Experts say that's a good sign, along with the increased law enforcement presence in Washington, DC.\n In many messaging apps and boards, some are calling for a boycott of events this weekend and the inauguration. Michael Edison Hayden, the Southern Poverty Law Center senior investigative reporter and spokesperson,  says high-profile names and  podcasters Mike Peinovich and Nick Fuentes have told their followers not to go to rallies. The ADL says that White supremacist Peinovich, known as Mike Enoch, and the far-right Fuentes have been rallying voices of discontent for years.\n Though there still are some concerning messages out there, Hayden says he believes the probability of violence in DC is not as high as it was on January 6 -- when there was a lot of online chatter, a major political event in the certifying of an election and a Trump rally.\n Federal authorities are also tracking dozens of people who pose potential concerns of violence who may be coming to Washington for events around the Inauguration, according to a source briefed on intelligence shared among federal and local law enforcement.\n Experts worry some people will turn to their state Capitols to express their anger. Hayden says posts of coordinates and maps of statehouses have been posted online. The FBI has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols in the days leading up to the inauguration, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN earlier this week.\n A bigger concern for experts tracking hate and extremism online? What may happen after this weekend and the inauguration.\n Segal said extremists might move cautiously in coming days, from both paranoia and knowing they're being watched.\n \"It's not before inauguration that we need to be concerned about them trying to spark another civil war -- it's after,\" Segal told CNN.\n Segal says it is helpful to look at the situation in Michigan last spring when thinking how things could unfold after the Capitol attack.\n \"The reopen protests ended up resulting in part in an attempt to kidnap the governor,\" Segal explains.\n Trump was very much a part of that, too. He repeatedly criticized Gov. Gretchen Whitmer about her Covid-19 restrictions before and after the news of the plot against her.\n Experts note that at the protests against her moves, there too was a cross-pollination of people who showed up -- self-declared militia members, anarchists, those with anti-government beliefs and anti-vaxxers.\n Now, take those existing grievances and add lies about the election being stolen and the Capitol attack. That kind of kinetic energy is hard to stop, experts fear.\n The extremism experts agree on several glaring points on how we got here and where we may be going. America is in the midst of a mass radicalization of sorts. The fire starter was not Trump, they say; he simply threw gas on the flames.\n Seeing Biden inaugurated, a Black and South Asian woman as his Vice President, and then realizing that Trump is gone will fan the flames for those who will falsely claim the Biden administration is illegitimate, Segal warns.\n Carusone says this is just the beginning of the country heading \"into a buzzsaw\" due to divisiveness, extremist actions and political rhetoric.\n \"Trump has gift-wrapped the narrative for the next four years,\" Segal explains.\n The experts worry about a false sense of security emerging if the country makes it through the inauguration without any violence. But what happens when the barricades come down? When National Guard troops leave? When tech platforms, the general public, and the media turn their attention to other issues?\n The threat will remain, the experts say.\n \"All of those new people being brought into these communities creates new opportunity for expanding the ranks,\" Carusone said. \"There's going to be a lot of new people ... organized and exposed to a set of prescriptions that ultimately bring us back to the same place ... leading up to the attack on the Capitol.\n \"Except in this case, it'll be more of them.\"\n CNN's Josh Campbell, Christina Carrega, Evan Perez, Geneva Sands and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump finishes with worst first term approval rating ever",
        "body_text": "An average of recent polls finds Trump with a 39% approval rating and 58% disapproval rating.\n Indeed, a number of non-Quinnipiac pollsters including CNN/SSRS (34%), Gallup (34%) and the Pew Research Center (29%) also show Trump hitting his lowest level of support during his presidency.\n The result is that Trump's final first term approval rating looks to be the lowest on record dating back since scientific polling began.\n Heading into January, Trump had an average 44% approval rating to 53% disapproval rating. That was not significantly different from his 45% approval rating going into the election. That type of decline at the end of a presidency is historically large. Most presidents actually gain ground, and none have lost the type of ground Trump has.\n With still a few days left in his presidency, Trump looks like his approval rating will end up below 40% -- a decline of more than 5 points since the election. That type of decline at the end of a presidency is historically large. Most presidents actually gain ground, and none have lost the type of ground Trump has.\n It means Trump will be the first president in the polling era to end his first term with an approval of below 40%, the first with a disapproval rating north of 50% and the first with a negative net (approval - disapproval) rating.\n Trump has even seen a decline among his once heralded base. His approval rating with Republicans has dropped into the mid-high 70s in the average poll taken over the last week. It's usually in the high 80s to mid-90s. It was 95% in the general election exit poll.\n He has certainly made Republican lawmakers less leery of distancing themselves from him.\n You can see that in real time with 10 House Republicans from the more moderate end (New York Rep. John Katko) to the more conservative end (South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice).\n Most presidents, unlike Trump, see their approval rating jump following their bid for a second term. Unlike Trump, the average president has ended his first term since Franklin D. Roosevelt with an approval rating of just south of 60%. Even the presidents who are unsuccessful in their tries for another term often get boosts .\n George H.W. Bush ended with an approval rating of about 56% and a disapproval rating of 40%, despite losing by 6 points to Bill Clinton.\n Before Trump, the previous lowest approval rating for a president at the end of his term belonged to Jimmy Carter. He remains the only president besides Trump to finish his first term with an approval rating below 50%.\n In a CBS News/New York Times poll taken the week following he left office, 44% approved of Carter's job as president. An identical 44% disapproved of his job as president. A Harris poll taken during the same time found that 42% of Americans rated Carter's job performance as excellent or very good.\n Carter, however, had gone into the 1980 election in far worse shape. His approval rating was south of 40% with a disapproval rating of around 55%.\n Carter received a bump so late in his presidency that most pollsters didn't catch it. The late Carter boost was tied to the successful Iranian hostage release on January 20, 1981, as recalled at the time by pollster Lou Harris. Carter spent the final days of his presidency working day and night to get those hostages released.\n Neither Bush nor Gerald Ford (the other president in the polling era denied another term) had as big of an achievement in their final days, but they did match Carter in an important way. They didn't get in the way of a peaceful transition of power and devoted the last two months of their presidency staying mostly above the partisan fray.\n Trump, of course, did the very opposite. He did not try to reach out to Democrats, nor did he try to achieve non-partisan or bipartisan goals in his final two months.\n Rather, Trump spent months refusing to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, despite crystal clear results. The months-long saga culminated with the insurrection at the US Capitol that Trump incited.\n The question now is just how much damage has been done to Trump's political brand. He's been impeached a second time. How many senators will vote to convict him? Will Trump's brand be so bad that he doesn't bother running in 2024?\n We'll just have to wait and see about those questions. What we do know is that Trump may have thought he could escape the post-election period without damage. He thought wrong.\n This story has been updated with more poll numbers released in Trump's final days as president.",

        "title": "When will Americans see the aid from Biden's relief proposal? It's up to Congress",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion relief package Thursday that included more stimulus payments and other direct aid, but don't expect to see those funds in your bank account anytime soon.\n The earliest the money could start flowing? Maybe mid- to late February, said Kevin Kosar, resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and co-editor of the book \"Congress Overwhelmed.\"\n Biden's massive plan includes several immediate relief items that are popular with a wide swath of Americans, including sending another $1,400 in direct stimulus payments, extending unemployment benefits and eviction protections, and offering more help for small businesses. It also would boost funding for vaccinations by $20 billion and for coronavirus testing by $50 billion.\n But it also calls for making some larger structural changes, such as mandating a $15 hourly minimum wage, expanding Obamacare premium subsidies and broadening tax credits for low-income Americans for a year.\n It's the first of two measures Biden has planned to right the nation's economy and fight the coronavirus. He intends to announce a recovery strategy at his first appearance before a joint session of Congress next month.\n Another factor that could determine the path and speed at which lawmakers act is the health of the economy, said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If the nation's jobs report in early February shows a continued deterioration of the labor market, for instance, Congress may be spurred to move faster and approve more assistance.\n Whatever leaders decide, the effort is expected to have an easier time passing in the House -- which approved a $3 trillion relief package last May that contained measures similar to those in Biden's plan -- even though Democrats now hold a slimmer majority there.\n Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, will have to maintain the support of nearly all of her party's members, including some progressive lawmakers who have already said they want to send even more help to Americans in need.\n Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told The Washington Post on Thursday that people should get an additional $2,000 in stimulus checks on top of the $600 they received as part of the $900 billion relief package lawmakers passed last month -- more than the $1,400 top-off payment Biden is suggesting.\n The Senate is where a multitude of hurdles lie. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York will soon take over as majority leader from Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, but the chamber will be split 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris available to break any tie votes.\n In coming weeks, senators will have their hands full with President Donald Trump's impeachment trial and with voting on the President-elect's Cabinet nominees, none of whom have been confirmed yet.\n In his speech Thursday night, Biden said he would like to work with members of both parties to enact his American Rescue Plan, indicating that he wants to go the traditional route, which would require the backing of at least 10 Republican senators.\n Biden will play an important role in the negotiations on Capitol Hill.\n \"A new president and a new tone from the White House can put some pretty significant pressure when pressure is needed,\" Hudak said. \"For this to happen in some expedited time, it's really going to require significant influence from the president, especially on key senators.\"\n One of those senators is Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia. He has recently expressed doubts over providing $2,000 in stimulus payments, preferring a more targeted approach.\n \"I'm on board by helping people that need help, people that really can't make it, people that don't have a job,\" Manchin told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. \"Sending checks to people that basically already have a check and aren't going to be able to spend that or are not going to spend it -- usually are putting it in their savings account right now -- that's not who we are.\"\n Securing support can be a laborious process.\n \"All the work of getting people lined up -- that's likely going to take a lot of time,\" Kosar said.",

        "title": "Capitol riot a stunning reminder of America's policing crisis",
        "body_text": "Cedric L. Alexander served some four decades in law enforcement and other areas of public service leadership. A CNN and MSNBC contributor, he is the author of \"In Defense of Public Service: How 22 Million Government Workers Will Save Our Republic.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nWhen DC Metropolitan Police officer Michael Fanone collapsed on the ground after he was repeatedly Tasered by Trump supporters who had stormed the US Capitol on January 6, his attackers started stripping him of his ammunition, police radio and badge.\n \"Some guys started getting a hold of my gun and they were screaming out, 'Kill him with his own gun,'\" Fanone later told CNN.\n \"Kill him with his own gun.\" That was one of many, many incriminating comments the insurgent mob shouted for the world to hear that day. Another was: \"We were invited here. We were invited by the President of the United States.\"\n It is not hard to connect these dots. In fact, Jacob Chansley, the so-called \"QAnon Shaman\" who was arrested and charged in connection with the riot, later told the FBI, according to a complaint, that \"he came as a part of a group effort, with other 'patriots' from Arizona, at the request of the President that all 'patriots' come to D.C. on January 6, 2021.\"\n Clearly, the rioters of January 6 believed they had been \"invited\" to the Capitol to stop Congress from the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral ballots in a desperate attempt to overturn the 2020 election. They took this invitation as license to stage a vicious insurrection.\n Throughout the last five years, President Donald Trump has embraced the police and repeatedly called himself the \"president of law and order,\" even though he consistently defied this both through his words and actions.\n In 2017, Trump endorsed police brutality, telling officers on Long Island, \"When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said: 'Please don't be too nice.'\" He went on the describe the act of shielding a suspect's head while putting them in the back of a police car and said, \"You can take the hand away, OK?\"\n In a March 13, 2019 interview, Trump told Breitbart News, \"I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump \u2014 I have the tough people...\"\n No wonder the insurgents of January 6 assumed the police were fellow members of the cult of Trump. Indeed, two Capitol Police officers have been suspended and at least 10 others are under investigation for their behavior during the riot.\n When the rioters encountered brave and honorable officers like Michael Fanone, who did not behave as they expected, they felt betrayed. These Trump supporters said so themselves when they chanted \"Traitors!\" at the police. One woman in a Trump 2020 sweatshirt said, \"You should be on our side.\"\n Despite the \"Blue Lives Matter\" flags many carried, they turned on Fanone, attacked Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died from his injuries, and injured more than 50 other officers.\n Sworn police officers are beholden to no president or other official. They get their authority from the Constitution. But they need more than legal authority. They need legitimacy, which is earned -- from the public -- by acting truthfully, transparently and justly.\n Even though the government may give police officers the legal rights to carry out their duties to enforce the law, they lose their credibility when the community no longer see them as trustworthy.\n Trump isn't the only one to blame when this erosion of legitimacy occurs. Those police officers, police leaders and police unions who have reciprocated the corrupt embrace of a lawless president have betrayed not only the public trust but the trust of their brothers and sisters in uniform.\n Never in American history has the legitimacy of police departments across the country been in greater peril. The killings of George Floyd and too many other unarmed, Black Americans, have already created a crisis in policing. This has been exacerbated by Trump, who has politicized his support for the police while chipping away at our institutions and undermining our faith in government as a whole.\n For many people, police officers are the government. When you are in enough trouble to dial 911, it isn't the president, Congress or the Supreme Court that comes running. It is a cop. Law enforcement is government taking direct action. But a lawless government cannot be a legitimate government, and police agencies acting in the name of this government cannot expect the people to grant them credibility.\n Any attempts to fix this crisis will require reestablishing trust between the police and the community they serve. Every officer on every patrol must speak truthfully and act justly.\n We in law enforcement must work to repair our reputation, both in the eyes of the public and among ourselves. But, as an operational arm of government, we can go only so far on our own. It also falls to President-elect Joe Biden to restore the legitimacy his predecessor imperiled, degraded and destroyed.\n President Biden must have the courage to go beyond police reforms, and push for a reimagining of law enforcement. He must task government and the nation with answering this radical yet basic question: What do we want from our police?\n President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, on which I served, has given Biden much to build on. It painted a picture of policing, in which officers should be professional, accountable, transparent and self-monitoring in order to learn from any mistakes.\n The incoming administration needs to restore and build upon this vision, which was flatly rejected by the Trump administration. It is urgent work President Biden must undertake beginning on January 20. We are running out of time -- and good will from the public -- to restore the police's legitimacy.",

Two devastating hurricanes struck the region late last year, exacerbating the economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Guatemala's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged Honduran authorities to do more to \"contain the massive departure of its inhabitants\" in a statement issued Saturday.\n While not responding directly to Guatemala's request, the National Institute of Migration in Honduras said on social media it has reinforced three border points between the two countries with immigration inspectors.\n A video captured by CNN on Saturday showed a large group of people pushing past a cordon of Guatemalan soldiers to gain access to highways traveling to Mexico. Authorities estimated nearly 3,500 people made it pass the cordon.\n Last October, the first major US-bound migrant caravan since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic left San Pedro Sula, Honduras and crossed into Guatemala with an estimated 1,500 to 2,800 people.\n Crossings at the US-Mexico border plunged during 2020 lockdowns. Apprehensions in the month of April hit the lowest mark in years, with approximately 17,100.\n Since then, apprehensions have steadily climbed, with roughly 70,000 each in the months of October, November and December, according to US Customs and Border Protection statistics.",

Board of Education Supreme Court decision mandating desegregation and the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the latter legislation passed just days after King's assassination in April of that year. This era represents America's Second Reconstruction, a post-World War II social movement for racial and economic justice.\n As that movement's leading political mobilizer and most celebrated figure, King routinely faced off against racist opponents in government, business, church hierarchy and all aspects of American society -- many of whom would probably have stood proudly alongside those who stormed the Capitol. The roots of the White supremacist tree that has flourished in the age of Trump are deep, and King combated these forces in his own time with a moral clarity that turned him into a radical political agitator who broke with his former political ally, President Lyndon B. Johnson, on the issue of Vietnam, and a revolutionary human rights leader who vowed to help end militarism, racism and materialism before it destroyed American society.\n Many Americans have rightfully expressed shock, horror and anger at images of White rioters at the US Capitol last week creating mayhem that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer, and the subsequent photos of National Guard troops sleeping on the marble floors of the Capitol rotunda to protect it from further insurrection as members of the House of Representatives debated and then impeached the US President for the second time.\n Yet it is important, as we approach the King holiday, to face up to the uglier aspects of our recent history, which we continue to ignore at our own national, political and moral peril.\n King's political courage in speaking out against racism, poverty, violence and American imperialism in foreign policy shows us a way forward. America needs the revolutionary King now more than ever. While always maintaining his commitment to non-violence, this King stalked the nation like a pillar of fire, an Old Testament prophet both recognized and shunned -- as he does even today, in a nation that has embraced him more in death than in life.\n During his last revelatory year of political activism and organizing, King demanded a maturity of Americans that we have yet to embrace. A mature nation, suggested King, possessed the grace to look inward, identify and assess its mistakes, and move forward through an examination of a past filled with troubling injustices and glorious instances of progress rooted in social movements that expanded the boundaries of democracy.\n This year calls us, once again, to seek renewal in what King characterized as \"those great wells of democracy,\" not by ignoring our past mistakes but embracing our messily complex history and all of its flaws. By doing so, we will never again be shocked, stunned or surprised at assaults on democracy that are deeply rooted in a failure to recognize how America's past continues to shape its present and to imagine that things can truly be different.\n King preached his last Sunday sermon in Washington, DC against a growing backdrop of racial and civil unrest that bears a striking resemblance to our own. In King's era, Richard Nixon, George Wallace and Barry Goldwater all vied to achieve political power by galvanizing White voters fearful that gains for Black Americans meant a loss of prestige, privilege and power for Whites.\n In his rise to power, President Trump turned racially based appeals directed at a long-simmering base of angry White voters into a political art, one that fueled a racially divisive movement that has threatened the very citadel of American democracy.\n There is a striking parallel between 1968 and 2021. In both instances the nation has found itself at a political crossroads defined by ongoing debate and struggle between building a beloved community or retaining a status quo grounded in racial injustice, economic inequality and the marginalization of groups lacking in privilege and power.\n In 1968, America chose Nixon's \"law and order\" over Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of multiracial democracy -- choosing to build systems of punishment that disproportionately undermined Black lives rather than investing in reforms that would promote justice and equity.\n The attempted coup at the Capitol, in profoundly disturbing ways, represents the bitter fruits of a harvest of racial division whose immediate historic antecedents were visible after King's death.\n Yet in modern America King's contemporary legacy abounds. On January 5, 2021 Reverend Raphael Warnock, who presides over King's former pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, became the first Black person elected to the US Senate from Georgia. Dr. King's call at the March on Washington for Georgia and the rest of the nation to look beyond the embarrassment of Stone Mountain's dedication to White supremacy and the Confederacy resonated clearly through Georgia in last year's presidential election and two Senate run-offs earlier this month.\n The revolutionary King bluntly confronted the challenges to his dream of transforming the nation into a beloved community. \"It is an unhappy truth that racism is a way of life for the vast majority of white Americans, spoken and unspoken, acknowledged and denied, subtle and sometimes not so subtle -- the disease of racism permeates and poisons the body politic,\" he observed during his brilliantly provocative Passion Sunday sermon at Washington's National Cathedral on March 31, 1968.\n This is the King many would rather conveniently forget, especially those conservatives who insist on using his words in defense of White supremacy.\n The White riot at the Capitol reminds us that King's warnings about racism's dangers to American democracy continue in our own time. This most recent assault on democracy has rightfully been compared to the rise of White supremacy during America's First Reconstruction, the fitful period following racial slavery and the Civil War, where efforts to guarantee Black citizenship, dignity, and voting rights existed uneasily alongside racial terror, voter suppression and Jim Crow laws that innovated racial segregation as a matter of local and state preferences, ungoverned by the Constitution.\n Yet last week's insurrection, which included the striking image of a rioter holding a Confederate flag in the Capitol, echoes large aspects of the violent opposition that King faced in his own era. The rise of White Citizens Councils comprised of leading Southern civic, clergy and business leaders, in the wake of court-ordered school desegregation sparked what came to be known as \"Massive Resistance\" against Black citizenship and dignity.\n Massive resistance became a euphemism for White supremacy, and the White Citizens Council put an officious image on racist sentiments that found common ground with the Ku Klux Klan and other more clandestine racial terror groups.\n This generation of Americans has an opportunity to choose a different path. It is one that may very well be more difficult than we would like to imagine, since it is a road the nation has yet to embark on.\n The greatest testament to Dr. King's legacy this year will be in the collective effort to reimagine an America that is mature enough to explain the events of the last year and this one, not as a mere pit stop on the road to democratic perfection or an aberration on an otherwise healthy body politic. King would surely shy away from using his holiday as an example of American exceptionalism -- and would instead push us toward the hard work of building, for the first time in our nation's history, a racially inclusive democracy that will ensure that this latest attack on the sacred citadel of American democracy will be the last.",

        "body_text": "Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert's communications director has resigned in the wake of the Capitol insurrection earlier this month, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n Ben Goldey had drafted his letter of resignation on January 6 due to discomfort with the way Boebert reacted to the insurrection and its aftermath, the source said, but he waited to officially resign until he could have an audience with the freshman congresswoman, which came on Friday. The source said Goldey wanted to fully explain his reasoning and resign in person.\n Jeff Small, Boebert's chief of staff, told CNN in a statement on Saturday that \"the office does not comment on internal personnel matters with individual employees.\"\n The resignation was first reported by Axios.\n This is the second top communications aide to a Republican lawmaker to resign following the riot at the US Capitol. The communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- one of the leading voices in the Senate who had objected to the Electoral College results -- resigned on Tuesday.\n Boebert was also one of many Republicans who voted against the counting of Electoral College votes for President-elect Joe Biden. The Colorado Republican has quickly made a name for herself on Capitol Hill, taping an ad saying she would be carrying a gun for protection in Washington, DC, which prompted a response from DC's acting police chief. Boebert, who defeated an incumbent in a surprising primary upset, ran in large part on a message emphasizing her commitment to Second Amendment rights.\n She has faced criticism from other lawmakers for tweeting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was evacuated from the House chamber during the insurrection and pushed back against the installation of metal detectors off the House floor earlier this week.\n \"It is a shame that Nancy Pelosi is trying to disarm Members of Congress in the very place that needed more protection on January 6,\" Boebert said in a statement earlier this week. \"It is clear metal detectors would not have deterred the violent acts we saw; this political stunt does nothing to improve the safety of Members in the Capitol complex.\"\n CNN's Annie Grayer, Kelly Mena, Jake Tapper, Chandelis Duster, Manu Raju and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Acting secretary of defense orders NSA chief to install Trump loyalist as agency's general counsel",
        "body_text": "The acting secretary of defense is trying to install a Trump loyalist as the top lawyer at the National Security Agency, according to three sources familiar.\n Christopher Miller, who just two days earlier said he couldn't wait to leave his job, ordered the head of the NSA to install Michael Ellis as general counsel by 6 p.m., Saturday, but NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone did not act by the given deadline, leaving it unclear what Miller or the White House would do.\n Ellis was first tapped for the position in early November, just two days after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election and in the midst of a political purge of different agencies, including the Department of Defense.\n The Pentagon declined to comment. This story was first reported by the Washington Post.\n But Ellis' installation stalled, according to the Washington Post, because of administrative procedures, including the need for a polygraph test, leaving Miller to push for it in the waning days of Trump's four years in office.\n Within days of Ellis' being picked for the job in November, which came shortly after President Donald Trump fired then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper via Twitter, Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Jack Reed requested an investigation from the Pentagon's acting inspector general, saying in a letter, \"The combination of timing, comparative lack of experience of the candidate, the reported qualifications of the other finalists, and press accounts of White House involvement create a perception that political influence or considerations may have played an undue role in a merit-based civil service selection process.\"\n Before joining the Trump administration, Ellis served as the head counsel to California Rep. Devin Nunes, one of Trump's staunchest supporters. Ellis then became a lawyer with the National Security Council, refusing to testify as part of the House's 2019 impeachment inquiry. In March 2020, Ellis became the senior director for intelligence on the NSC, joining other Trump loyalists in key intelligence positions.\n But the attempt to shift Ellis to the NSA is different, because the general counsel at the country's largest intelligence agency is a civil servant position, not a political appointee. This makes Ellis harder to fire once the Biden administration comes in, the sources said, adding that the strategy is called \"burrowing.\"\n Ellis said, \"I don't talk to the press, thank you,\" and hung up when reached by the Washington Post. CNN has been unable to reach Ellis.\n Susan Hennessey, a former NSA attorney and CNN legal and national security analyst, ripped the decision to install Ellis in the Trump administration's last weekend in power.\n \"At this point, no one should extend this selection process the benefit of the doubt. By all indication, the Trump admin is violating civil service rules and politicizing an apolitical role. If Ellis is installed tonight, Biden should remove him on Day One,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n The general counsel of the NSA is not a Senate-confirmed position, Hennessey explained on her Lawfare blog in November, which removes a step of Congressional oversight that exists for roles such as general counsel of the CIA, Pentagon, or Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The goal of this process was to remove any political bias in appointing a candidate to one of the key roles at the NSA.\n \"This is a really difficult, really important job and we have a process to ensure only qualified individuals are in the role *BECAUSE* it is necessary to the national security of the United States,\" Hennessey wrote Saturday on Twitter.",

CNN has reached out to The Temple and local authorities for additional information.\n The MLK Jr. Shabbat service is an annual event honoring King's legacy held by The Temple, the oldest Jewish congregation in the city, along with the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was a pastor from 1960 until his assassination in 1968.\n The Temple has its own historical ties to the civil rights movement. Its rabbi in the late 1950s was Jacob Rothschild, an outspoken advocate for racial equality. In October 1958, The Temple was bombed by suspected white supremacists in response to Rothschild's activism, though no one was ever convicted of the crime.\n Rothschild later befriended King, per The Temple and city of Atlanta's websites, and delivered a eulogy for King at a memorial service organized by Atlanta clergy members.\n CNN's Leslie Bentz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Why 1.2 billion people share the same 100 surnames in China",
        "body_text": "If you stop a random person on the street in China, there's a pretty good chance their surname would be either Wang, Li, Zhang, Liu or Chen.\n That's because those are the five most common surnames in China -- shared by more than 433 million people, or 30% of the population, according to government figures.\n With 1.37 billion citizens, China has the world's largest population, but has one of the smallest surname pools. Only about 6,000 surnames are in use, according to the Ministry of Public Security. And the vast majority of the population -- almost 86% -- share just 100 of those surnames.\n To put that in perspective, the United States -- with less than a quarter of China's population -- reported 6.3 million surnames in its 2010 census. The majority of those names were only reported once.\n There are a few reasons for this: China is less racially diverse than countries such as the US, where a wealth of minority groups increase surname diversity. It also has to do with language; you can't just add a random stroke to a Chinese character and create a new surname, the way you can add a letter to an English name.\n But there's also another factor at play: technology.\n China's digital revolution has transformed daily life, and many of these systems rely on a limited list of standardized Chinese characters.\n That means people with rare characters in their names, which aren't compatible with existing computer systems, can get left behind -- pushing many to change their names for the sake of convenience, even if it means abandoning centuries of heritage and language.\n It wasn't always this way. Throughout its long history, China has recorded more than 20,000 surnames, according to Chen Jiawei, an associate professor at Beijing Normal University, who has researched Chinese surname distribution. Some researchers place that estimate at up to 23,000 surnames.\n \"The culture of surnames has been passed down in our country for thousands of years, with a deep and broad influence,\" said the Ministry of Public Security in its 2019 annual nationwide survey on surnames. \"Throughout history, the surnames have developed and differentiated, forming more than 6,000 surnames in use today.\"\n The first records of Chinese surnames stretch back to \"the era of bronze, bamboo and silk script,\" according to the ministry -- referring to when people wrote on raw materials in the Shang and Zhou dynasties (1600-256 BC), before the invention of paper.\n By the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD), a book called the \"Hundred Family Surnames,\" listing several hundred of the most common surnames, had become a classic text taught to children.\n People sometimes changed their names for convenience, too -- for instance, simplifying complex characters by adopting similar-sounding ones with fewer strokes. Other times they did it out of superstition, abandoning a name believed to bring ill fortune, said Chen, the associate professor.\n Name extinction is also a naturally occurring phenomenon called the Galton-Watson process, which posits that in patrilineal societies, surnames are lost or die out over time with each new generation as women take on their husbands' surnames.\n For instance, if a surname was concentrated in a particular area and there weren't enough male descendants, the name could \"disappear naturally,\" said Chen. Meanwhile, large families with more resources were able to have more children, thus expanding and spreading the family surname.\n Researchers consider China a common example of this process -- partly because the country's long history means it has lost more names over time, compared to younger countries or countries where surnames didn't become common practice until more recently.\n \"The Chinese population uses fewer surnames and includes much larger isonymous groups than Caucasoids or Japanese because surnames appeared in China at least 3,000 years earlier than in Europe or Japan,\" said researchers from Stanford University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in a 1992 study. \"Since that time, when the population was much smaller than now, many surnames have become extinct.\"\n Rare or uncommon surnames have been dying out for centuries -- but they face an accelerated crisis in modern China.\n For many years, people with rare characters in their names could get by, since documents and letters were largely handwritten. But it became near-impossible to use these names in the written form with the rise of digital technology -- and a new digitized national ID system.\n The main problem is that not all Chinese characters have been coded into computer systems. In 2017, there were about 32,000 characters coded in the Chinese character database, according to state-run news agency Xinhua -- leaving out tens of thousands of characters.\n With China roaring into the digital age, nearly everything -- from making appointments to buying train tickets -- has moved online. That meant a world of trouble if you happened to have a rare character in your name, that might not be in the database. As of 2017, up to 60 million Chinese citizens faced this predicament, according to Xinhua.\n One such man, Zhong Weihua, originally had a rare character in his name that wasn't registered in digital systems and font libraries -- meaning he couldn't open online banking accounts, sign up for phone plans, use online payment, or complete other everyday tasks, Xinhua reported. Eventually, he felt he had no choice but to change his name to something more common.\n China's digitized ID cards made the problem even more pressing. The first generation of these cards allowed people to hand-write their names on -- but the second-generation cards, launched in 2004 and dubbed \"smart cards\" for their digital features, exclusively used computer-printed text.\n Ma Cheng, a woman from Beijing, was one of those unable to receive a digital ID card due to her rare surname. The character for \"ma\" in her name was particularly obscure; her grandfather had found it while looking through the dictionary, she told local media in 2008.\n Her first-generation ID card, with the character handwritten on, had expired -- but officials refused to grant her a second-generation card because the character wasn't in the government's computer database. They told her to change her name because it was \"troublesome,\" she told the New York Times in 2009.\n But she was reluctant to do so. For one, it would create a discrepancy between her ID card and other documents like her university diploma. Besides, she said, \"I can't think of another, better name.\"\n Another factor exacerbating the increasing commonness of Chinese names is the government's efforts to standardize and regulate the language.\n Various dialects of Mandarin are spoken between the provinces, with some so different that speakers are unintelligible to each other. Among these, the Beijing-based Standard Mandarin is the lingua franca -- and was formally declared the national spoken and written language in 2000.\n The result was the General Standard Chinese Character Table, published in 2013 and praised by the State Council as \"a new starting point\" for standardized Chinese.\n It also meant a smaller pool of characters that people were encouraged to choose from for their names.\n After the table was issued in 2013, the Ministry of Public Security ordered local police departments to \"limit the new names and changes in the population information management system to the General Standard Chinese Characters Table -- effectively solving the problem of computing rare characters in names,\" according to the Ministry.\n That declaration turned out to be premature. People faced issues of non-computable names long after the table was released -- one problem being the limited character database in computer systems across institutions and government agencies, which had forced Zhong Weihua to change his name.\n To try to address this, experts have increased the database from 32,000 characters to 70,000 characters, according to the government. They're still working to expand it to include more than 90,000 characters, said Chen, the associate professor.\n Even Chinese officials acknowledge there is more work to be done. Sometimes, even if the rare characters are in the table, they aren't supported by font libraries, operating systems, input methods, and other customized information systems.\n These limited systems \"cause inconvenience to people's lives\" and \"urgently need to be upgraded,\" according to the Ministry of Education. In a separate statement last year, the Ministry of Public Security agreed that \"we must solve the problem,\" noting \"people's work and life are more and more inseparably connected with the Internet.\"\n But it's not just a matter of inconvenience. Chinese surnames are central to people's identities; they hold origin stories, reveal historic patterns of migration, and represent a direct tie to a person's ancestry and heritage. To give up a surname is to sever a part of family history that can stretch back for centuries.\n This struggle, and the cost of adapting to the modern age, was exemplified in a village in the eastern Shandong province in the late 2000s. Many villagers shared the ancestral name \"Shan\" -- but when they began applying for the digitized ID cards, local officials advised them to change their surnames to \"Xian,\" a similar-sounding but more common character, according to state-owned news service CNTV.\n In the end, more than 200 villagers were forced to change their surnames, a source of sorrow for many.\n \"We don't want to lose the surnames our ancestors gave us in our lifetime,\" one villager said. \"Our generation still knows what our original surnames were, but our children have their names changed from an early age, and in a few years they will forget their (original) surnames.\"",

        "title": "Test fire of NASA's SLS moon rocket ends prematurely",
        "body_text": "NASA's Space Launch System rocket ignited its four main engines Saturday on a test stand in Mississippi, but the engines shut down earlier than the agency planned.\n The hot fire test was the last of eight tests that make up what NASA calls a \"green run,\" a series of ground tests aimed at ensuring the vehicle doesn't have any major structural or engineering issues before it is put on a launch pad. The rocket is the most powerful launch vehicle the space agency has ever constructed.\n The SLS was supposed to light its engines for about eight minutes, the length of time the engines will have to fire to propel the rocket on its orbital missions.\n It's not yet clear why the engines powered down after little more than a minute at NASA's Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The test was still useful for gathering data and \"teams are assessing the data on early engine shutdown,\" the space agency tweeted.\n During a Saturday night news conference, John Honeycutt, the SLS program manager, said NASA officials will go over the data gathered in the test to identify the issue.\n \"What we learned was -- is that we didn't have the pressurization valve modeled appropriately,\" Honeycutt said.\n Officials had hoped to run the test for at least 250 seconds, he said.\n During the hot fire test, engineers \"power up all the core stage systems, load more than 700,000 gallons of cryogenic, or supercold, propellant into the tanks and fire all four engines at the same time,\" according to NASA.\n It is unclear if another test will be needed before the rocket is shipped to Florida, the launch site where the rocket is expected to make its first journey into outer space.\n Rick Gilbrech, director of the Stennis Space Center, said his site would need at least four to five days to prepare the fuel for another test if the rocket is ready. He and his team aren't discouraged by Saturday's test and are proud of what they've accomplished this year, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.\n NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said the test was \"not a failure.\"\n \"This is not a failure. This is a test, and we tested today in a way that is meaningful where we're going to learn ... we're going to make adjustments, and we're going to fly to the moon,\" he said.\n \"This was a successful day. We didn't get everything we wanted and yes we're going to learn, we're going to have to make adjustments,\" he said. \"But again, this is a test. And this is why we test.\"\n SLS has been haunted by critiques of long delays and cost overruns, and with the premature end of the critical hot fire test, its launch may be delayed once again.\n \"We got lots of data that we're going to go through and be able to sort through and get to a point where we can make determinations as to whether or not, you know, launching in 2021 is a possibility or not,\" Bridenstine said.\n The rocket is a key part of NASA's Artemis lunar exploration program, which aims to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024. NASA officials also hope the SLS will be used to reach Mars and other \"deep space destinations.\"\n SLS has been under development for a decade. Under the Obama administration, NASA was already planning to use SLS to take astronauts back to the moon by 2028, and that remained the plan until Vice President Mike Pence directed the space agency to drastically accelerate its timeline in 2019.\n Boeing was contracted in 2012 to build SLS's main components, and the rocket was originally expected to start flying in December 2017. But Boeing has been blasted in several government oversight reports for \"poor performance,\" costly schedule slips and ballooning expenses. That made SLS a touchy political talking point, and many in the space industry remain suspicious that a 2024 moon landing is possible.\n At one point, Bridenstine reportedly considered skipping the green run test to expedite SLS's development. But more recently he has asserted that the tests are essential to ensuring the rocket is safe enough to carry humans into space and to work out any potential engineering problems before attempting an orbital launching.\n Bridenstine is expected to step down when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated next week. It's not clear if NASA will stick with the 2024 timeline under the new administration, though the official Democratic platform calls for \"continuity\" in NASA's space programs between presidential administrations.\n The SLS rocket stands taller than the Statue of Liberty and has about 15% more thrust at liftoff than the Saturn V rockets that powered the Apollo missions about 50 years ago.\n NASA's Artemis I mission is expected to launch by the end of 2021 with two test flights around the moon without astronauts.\n A crewed test mission, Artemis II, is set to launch in 2023 in preparation to have the Artemis III mission return astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2024 for the first time since the 1970s.\n Artemis is named after the Greek goddess of the moon and is the twin sister of Apollo, which was name NASA used for the missions and spacecraft that first took Americans to the moon in 1969.\n CNN's Katie Hunt and Hollie Silverman contributed to this report.",

        "title": "States look for more Covid-19 vaccine doses as the nation's death toll nears 400,000",
        "body_text": "States are racing to get Covid-19 vaccine supplies and distribution in order as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday of more contagious variants of coronavirus potentially exacerbating the spread.\n CDC officials implored Americans to continue with preventative measures against the coronavirus, while highlighting the variant first identified in Britain known as B.1.1.7.\n The B.1.1.7 variant appears to more readily infect human cells and one CDC simulation of its transmissibility raised concerns that it could become the United States' most dominant form of coronavirus by March.\n The variant has been identified in about a dozen states with Michigan being the latest state to detect a case. State health officials on Saturday identified the patient as a Washtenaw County woman who recently traveled to the UK.\n The CDC has called for aggressive vaccine distribution to try to stem the tide. \"Higher vaccination coverage might need to be achieved to protect the public,\" CDC researchers warned.\n On Friday, more than 3,400 Covid-19 deaths were reported in the US, as the total death toll from the pandemic edged closer to 400,000. The nation also recorded its 11th consecutive day of more than 200,000 infections, per Johns Hopkins University data.\n On Saturday, Los Angeles County became the first in the US to surpass 1 million cases -- more than Illinois' Cook County and Arizona's Maricopa County combined, according to Johns Hopkins data.\n At least 12.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US as of Friday, according to the CDC, as the federal vaccine rollout has received intense scrutiny and criticism from state officials.\n \"We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people, so we're not sitting on a reserve anymore,\" Azar told NBC News' Lester Holt. \"We've made that available to the states to order.\"\n Asked about the apparent lack of so-called reserve shots, CNN medical analyst and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen said, \"I honestly don't understand how we got to this point, because this is right now in the world the most precious commodity.\"\n \"These are doses that were promised to the states,\" she said. \"How are state health departments and local health departments supposed to plan vaccination campaigns when they don't know what's coming their way, or even if there is additional supply?\"\n \"We need answers from the federal government,\" she added. \"We need honesty and transparency.\"\n Governors across the country are also expressing frustration about the federal government's efforts to distribute vaccines.\n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday said the state expected to receive just 250,000 doses next week despite the fact 7 million New York residents are now eligible to receive a vaccine.\n \"We are in a footrace to get the vaccine into the arms of eligible New Yorkers as quickly and equitably as possible,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \"However, we now have 7 million New Yorkers vying for a fraction of doses made available to use by the federal government.\"\n \"We need Washington to step up and increase New York's supply to make sure everyone who wants the vaccine has the opportunity to get it,\" he said.\n Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Friday he is \"extremely disappointed that we were lied to\" about the reserve vaccines, and that the next vaccines \"will be delivered in the future of the supply chain.\"\n \"There is no influx of doses, contrary to a call we had with the Vice President (and) the Secretary of Health three days ago, where they informed us we would be getting an additional quantity available to the states,\" the governor said.\n Polis estimated that of the 58,000 remaining doses in Colorado, \"they will likely all or almost all be used by Sunday.\"\n Governors from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota wrote to Azar, critical of federal plans and hopeful they could purchase vaccines from manufacturers directly.\n \"Without additional supply or authorization to purchase directly, our states may be forced to cancel plans for public vaccination clinics in the coming weeks, which are expected to vaccinate tens of thousands. It's time for the Trump administration to do the right thing and help us end this pandemic,\" the letter states.\n Pfizer on Friday tried to reassure state leadership and the public about production of its vaccine, saying it didn't anticipate any interruptions in shipments.\n \"Operation Warp Speed has asked us to start shipping second doses only recently. As a result, we have on hand all the second doses of the previous shipments to the US. We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,\" Pfizer said in a statement to CNN.\n In some metropolitan areas, including Houston, Phoenix and Los Angeles, stadiums and theme parks are being used as mass vaccination sites for eligible recipients.\n In Los Angeles, about 2,200 people were vaccinated at the drive-through site outside Dodger Stadium on Friday, the first day vaccines were distributed there, Los Angeles fire spokesman David Ortiz said.\n That site generally is vaccinating only health care workers for now, adhering to Los Angeles County rules aiming to inoculate medical personnel before making more people eligible.\n A long line of vehicles snaked around the parking lot Saturday morning. The site eventually is expected to serve more than 12,000 per day, officials have said. The fire department partnered with other groups, including the CORE non-profit founded by actor Sean Penn, to establish and staff the site.\n \"(I) talked to a captain who had two hours of sleep, trying to ... set up the logistics part of this huge (undertaking) here. And ... he has a smile on his face because he's doing everything he possibly can, humanly, to make (this) a success, to make this efficient,\" Ortiz  said.\n Covid-19 hospitalizations nationwide are near record levels, pushing some medical centers past normal capacity and straining their ability to give immediate care.\n More than 127,200 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals Friday, just a few thousand short of the highest mark set nine days earlier, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n While December was the country's deadliest month of the pandemic, January is on pace to be worse.\n More than 46,240 US coronavirus deaths were reported in January's first 15 days. That's already more than half the roughly 77,500 recorded in all of December, according to Johns Hopkins data.\n A recent coronavirus projection from the University of Washington estimates 566,720 deaths by May 1 in the US.\n The university's Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) said the figure could be lowered by about 32,000 deaths with universal mask requirements.\n Mask requirements are strongly urged by health officials to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and its implementation is expected to have a direct effect on future infections and deaths. State and local responses have varied widely. Some states continue to maintain no mask directives, allowing businesses to set their own rules.\n On Friday, Mississippi extended its mask-wearing mandate in all but nine counties until February 3.\n \"It is important that we continue to take this virus seriously. We are working on getting Mississippians vaccinated, but continue to social distance, keep gatherings small and wear your mask,\" Gov. Tate Reeves said.\n North Dakota, however, said officials are seeing its Covid-19 numbers falling from an earlier outbreak and Gov. Doug Burgum said the mask mandate will be allowed to expire on Monday, reiterating at a news briefing, \"We must remain vigilant.\"\n North Dakota capacity limitations for bars, restaurants, and event venues will be modified from requirements to recommendations.\n CNN's Maggie Fox, Rob Frehse, Jason Hanna, Kay Jones, Devon Sayers, Amanda Sealy, Hollie Silverman and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.",

A big hug for the loved ones of this great athlete.\"\n K2, part of the Karakoram Range that straddles the Pakistan-China border, is the second highest mountain in the world at 8,611 meters (28,251 feet).\n A post on Mingote's official Instagram account said: \"Rest in peace Sergi. Today you start a new climb.\"\n Just a day earlier, the mountaineer had shared a post announcing that he was on day 27 of his climb and had reached 7,000 meters.\n Chhang Dawa Sherpa, a Nepalese mountaineer who is leading the K2 winter expedition, said on Instagram that Mingote \"suddenly fell down.\"\n \"We [were] informed by unexpected movement on his GPS tracker and could see he made a big fall, members at the site quickly confirmed the accident, but couldn't do much to help him anymore,\" Sherpa said.\n K2 is located within the Karakoram Range, home to the greatest concentration of high mountains in the world.\n The peak is renowned among mountaineers for its difficulty and has been bestowed the moniker \"Savage Mountain\" as an ode to its unforgiving nature.\n Compared to the more than 4,000 people that have climbed Mount Everest -- the world's tallest mountain at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) -- only 350 people had stood on K2's peak as of 2018 since it was first topped in 1954.\n While few have summited K2, at least 77 people have died attempting the climb.\n A team of 10 Nepali climbers on Saturday reached the top of K2 -- marking the first time the summit has been climbed during the winter seasons, according to the expedition organizer Seven Summit Treks.\n K2 was the only mountain over 8,000 meters that had not been summited in winter.\n \"The impossible is made possible,\" Nepali mountaineer Nirmal Purja, an ex-British Special Forces soldier, said on his official Instagram account after he and his team accomplished the rare feat. \"History made for mankind. History made for Nepal,\" he wrote.\n \"We are proud to have been a part of history for mankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible,\" Purja said.\n Sugam Pokharel and Rory Smith contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "The coalition comprises a broad range of health care and tech leaders including Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL), Cerner (CERN), Cigna's (CI) Evernorth, health care software firm Epic and the Mayo Clinic, among others.\n The announcement Thursday comes amid a rocky start to the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Of the 30.6 million doses of vaccines that have been distributed to US hospitals, health centers and pharmacies, only about 10.6 million people had received at least their first dose as of Friday morning, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \"A secure, convenient solution to verify Covid-19 vaccination will play an important role in accelerating a healthy and safe return to work, school and life in general,\" said Joan Harvey, president of care solutions at Evernorth, Cigna's health services business.\n \"It's not just for health care purposes that you will need this health data,\" Paul Meyer, CEO of nonprofit The Commons Project, told CNN Business. The Commons Project created an app called Common Pass, where people can store digital records of their Covid-19 test results and, eventually, their Covid-19 vaccination record.\n \"Now you are going to need either your lab results or vaccination data to get on an airplane, to go to school, go to work \u2014 real life, non-health-care use cases,\" Meyer said. \"And it needs to be in a standard form so when you're presenting it, people actually understand, 'Oh, it was the Pfizer vaccine that you got.'\"\n It's not the first time Big Tech has gotten involved in the effort to fight coronavirus. Early on in the pandemic, Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) joined forces to develop a bluetooth-based system to notify users if they'd been exposed to Covid-19. But the tool's success was challenged by slow and spotty adoption.\n With the Vaccine Credential Initiative, the tech companies involved in the effort will play a key role in ensuring widespread use. Firms like Microsoft and Oracle manage the tech infrastructure for many large health care systems, and can build in the standards for Covid-19 vaccine credentialing.\n \"That's why it's exciting to have partners like Epic and Cerner and Oracle and Microsoft that are the tech platforms that power, if you will, so much of health care,\" Meyer said. \"Them saying, 'We're going to implement the standards,\" is really them saying, 'We're going to help our customers issue these verifiable credentials.' And it starts to turn into something that's very scalable.\"\n \"Just as Covid-19 does not discriminate based on socio-economic status, we must ensure that convenient access to immunization records crosses the digital divide,\" Brian Anderson, chief digital health physician at nonprofit research organization MITRE, a member of the initiative, said in a statement.",

She was 107 years old.\n Cole, who was born in 1913 and grew up in Warren, Pennsylvania, suffered a heart attack in the home they shared in North Carolina, her daughter Beth Kluttz told CNN by phone Saturday\n Cole decided she would take a stance to support her country after Japanese forces launched a surprise attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii on December 7, 1941.\n \"There were women volunteering with the Red Cross and knitting while sitting in church, so I thought I had to do something,\" Cole told the Marine Corps Times in an interview in September. \"At the time, I didn't think I was doing anything great. I knew I was helping our country.\"\n She was 28 years old in 1943 when she became among the first wave of women to join the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, according to her daughter.\n Cole wanted to be like Amelia Earhart, Kluttz said, and had taken flying lessons in hopes of becoming a pilot.\n \"She thought she would impress the military by taking flying lessons. She had about 200 flying hours in, and flying a Piper Cub, and she thought that would impress the military and the Marine Corps,\" Kluttz said. \"But when she got in there, they just put her behind the desk.\"\n She attained the rank of sergeant before leaving the Marines. The Marine Corps paid tribute to Cole in a tweet that ended, \"Semper Fi, Marine.\"\n The US Naval Institute said in a tweet that Cole was the oldest living Marine, and \"like most women in the era,\" was given clerical work so men could fight in combat. Women became a permanent part of the Marine Corps in 1948, according to the Women Marines Association.\n The Marine Corps eventually saw its first female pilot in 1995, according to Military Times. All jobs in the military, including combat roles, were opened to women in 2016.\n Cole, also an artist who loved her family and church and highly respected all veterans and first responders, served in the Marines until 1945, Kluttz said.\n \"She would want to salute all of the veterans for all the service that they've done and also the police and firemen,\" Kluttz said.\n Cole spent her final years at her daughter's home in Kannapolis, North Carolina. She is survived by her daughter, two grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.",

        "title": "Biden to sign executive orders rejoining Paris climate accord and rescinding travel ban on first day ",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden plans to sign roughly a dozen executive orders, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and ending the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, on his first day in office, according to a memo from incoming chief of staff Ron Klain.\n He'll also sign orders halting evictions and student loan payments during the coronavirus pandemic and issuing a mask mandate on all federal property in an effort to either roll back moves made by the Trump administration or advance policy in a way that was impossible in the current administration.\n One of Biden's most common campaign trail promises was to tackle an issue on his first day in office -- a pledge he usually made to either contrast himself with President Donald Trump or highlight just how important he believed an issue to be. These promises were made on everything from climate change to immigration to foreign policy, and many are reflected in Klain's Saturday memo, which was first reported by the New York Times.\n \"During the campaign, President-elect Biden pledged to take immediate action to start addressing these crises and build back better,\" Klain writes. \"As president, he will keep those promises and sign dozens of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies in fulfillment of the promises he made.\"\n Beyond executive actions in his first days in office, the memo outlines that Biden plans to send Congress a large-scale immigration plan within his first 100 days in office. The plan would offer a pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrations currently in the United States.\n Biden rolled out his first legislative priority this week, announcing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that included direct payments to Americans. Biden made clear during a speech on the plan that he wanted it to be the first issue Congress takes up after he is inaugurated on January 20.\n The memo makes clear a key part of Biden's overall strategy includes getting Congress to act on his legislative priorities, something Biden ran on by highlighting his relationships with Republicans in the Senate. The focus is an acknowledgment that only so much can be done via executive order.\n \"Full achievement of the Biden-Harris Administration's policy objectives requires not just the executive actions the president-elect has promised to take, but also robust Congressional action,\" Klain wrote.\n The day after Biden is inaugurated, according to Klain, he will \"sign a number of executive actions to move aggressively to change the course of the COVID-19 crisis and safely re-open schools and businesses, including by taking action to mitigate spread through expanding testing, protecting workers, and establishing clear public health standards.\"\n And on January 22, Biden will direct his Cabinet agencies to \"take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families bearing the brunt of this crisis,\" Klain writes.\n The flurry of action is meant to show Americans that Biden is not wasting any time taking control of the coronavirus -- something the Biden transition has been intently focused on. But the scope and breadth of the topics Biden will address also highlights the extent to which Democrats believe the incoming administration will have to be focused on multiple issues at once to be successful.\n From January 25 to February 1, Klain writes that Biden will issue orders on everything from directing his government to buy American products to beginning to fulfill promises to reform the criminal justice system.\n During that week-long period, Biden will also order the federal government to determine how to reunite children separated from their families at the US-Mexico border, as well sign additional orders aimed at tackling climate change and expanding access to health care.\n \"Of course, these actions are just the start of our work,\" Klain writes. \"Much more will need to be done to fight COVID-19, build our economy back better, combat systemic racism and inequality, and address the existential threat of the climate crisis. But by February 1st, America will be moving in the right direction on all four of these challenges \u2014 and more \u2014 thanks to President-elect Joe Biden's leadership.\"\n Because Biden routinely promised to take action on \"Day One\" of his administration, hosts of interest groups and advocacy organization have put public pressure on Biden to live up to his promises.\n \"There is a lot riding on Biden ending the ban on the first day of his presidency because this is something he has campaigned on,\" said Iman Awad, national legislative director of Emgage Action, an advocacy organization for Muslim Americans. \"With that, we understand that we are facing so much during this political moment: A current president making this transition nearly impossible, the insurrection, and the pandemic. Nevertheless, Muslim American communities are hopeful that the Biden Administration will fulfill that promise, despite the crises happening.\"\n For climate change activists, Biden's promise to take swift action on an array of climate issues was a key part of why progressives rallied around Biden once he cleared the Democratic field, said Jared Leopold, co-founder of Evergreen Action, a group of former staffers to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who ran for president in 2020 focused almost entirely on climate change.\n \"Taking over the presidency from Donald Trump is like taking over the lease from a frat house: The cleanup task list is staggering,\" Leopold said. \"The task for Biden is two-fold: first, clean up Trump's damage, then take action on the bold climate plan that science demands. Biden ran on the strongest climate plan in American history, and he has a clear mandate to enact it immediately by executive and legislative action.\"\n And LGBTQ activists, like Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David, said it is critical for Biden to show clearly at the outset of his administration that he is committed to rewriting actions taken by the Trump administration.\n \"I do expect that the Biden-Harris administration will take affirmative steps within the first day or so of taking office to satisfy their campaign pledges,\" David said in an interview with CNN, highlighting the need to \"ensure that the rights of LGBTQ students are enforced under Title IX.\"\n \"My goal is to make sure that the civil rights of LGBTQ people are protected, that Joe Biden meets his campaign promises and fulfills his campaign promises to the community,\" said David. \"And all of my expectations lead me to conclude and based on conversations that I've had, that they are going to be taking those steps to make sure that they meet their campaign obligations and promises.\"\n This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "title": "LA County records more than 1 million coronavirus cases",
        "body_text": "Los Angeles has become the first US county to report more than 1 million coronavirus cases, according to state officials.\n Some 14,669 new cases were added Saturday taking the county's total to 1,003,923 cases and 13,741 confirmed virus-related deaths -- 253 reported on Saturday, Los Angeles County's Department of Public Health said in a news release.\n The department also announced its first confirmed case of the UK Covid-19 B.1.1.7 variant Saturday, in a male who had traveled to L.A. County but is now isolating in Oregon.\n The health department said it believed the more contagious UK variant was likely already spreading in the community and urged residents to \"more diligently\" follow safety measures.\n \"The presence of the UK variant in Los Angeles County is troubling, as our healthcare system is already severely strained with more than 7,500 people currently hospitalized,\" said health department director Barbara Ferrer said in a statement.\n \"Our community is bearing the brunt of the winter surge, experiencing huge numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, five-times what we experienced over the summer.\n \"This more contagious variant makes it easier for infections to spread at worksites, at stores, and in our homes. We are in the midst of a public health emergency so please do everything you can to protect yourselves and those you love,\" Ferrer said.\n L.A. County's case total surpasses that of Illinois' Cook County (429,270 cases) and Arizona's Maricopa County (407,631 cases) combined, according to John Hopkins University data.\n Cook and Maricopa counties currently have the nation's second and third highest tally of cases, respectively, JHU data shows.\n \"There are currently 7,597 people currently hospitalized with Covid-19, and 22% of these people are in the ICU,\"  L.A. County Public Health said in its release.\n The census bureau says L.A. County is the most populous county in the nation with about 10.1 million residents, followed by Cook County (5.2 million), Harris County in Texas (4.5 million) and Maricopa County (4.2 million).\n Los Angeles City Fire spokesman David Ortiz spoke to CNN at the Dodger Stadium where vaccines were being administered Saturday.\n Ortiz said the situation in Los Angeles was \"surreal.\"\n \"It feels like you're waking up to a nightmare, every day. We are trying to make a dent in this huge pandemic of people that are getting sick, hearing how many people are dying every day, it's, it's unfathomable,\" he said.\n \"We on our fire department have lost two of our members -- two valuable members -- to this disease, and so it hits home watching the nurses pleading with people to stay home, to not have these parties.\n \"It's, it's heartbreaking to see them work themselves to exhaustion and continue to come in every day -- every day -- and put on their game face and go to work on all these people -- taking care of all these people.\"\n Ortiz said a lot of the deaths from Covid-19 were unnecessary but that the vaccination program provided hope.\n \"Because every person that gets vaccinated, that's an opportunity of a person that may be saved by that vaccine. And that's one less person that's going to become a victim to this virus,\" he said.\n Coronavirus has already infected and killed more people in the US than in any other country.\n There were 198,218 new cases of Covid-19 and 3,286 new deaths from the virus reported in the US on Saturday, according to John Hopkins University, taking the US totals to at least 23.7 million cases and 395,785 deaths.\n At least 31.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been distributed across the US and at least 12.2 million of them have been administered, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "'Armed protests' warning puts officials on alert this weekend ahead of Biden inauguration",
        "body_text": "Law enforcement and state officials are on high alert for potentially violent protests in the lead-up to Inauguration Day, with some state capitols boarded up and others temporarily closed ahead of Wednesday's ceremony.\n Domestic extremists pose the most likely threat to the inauguration, particularly those who believe the incoming administration is illegitimate, according to a joint bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and eight other agencies and obtained by CNN.\n The assessment, dated January 14, provides a breakdown of additional concerns leading up to Tuesday,  including possible violence.\n \"In light of the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January, planned events in Washington, DC, in the lead up to and day of Inauguration Day offer continued opportunities for violence targeting public officials, government buildings, and federal and local law enforcement,\" it reads.\n The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that Biden's inauguration rehearsal would be delayed one day to Monday due to online chatter about Sunday, but said there are \"no specific credible threats.\"\n \"It is going to take place on Monday is the current schedule. Secret Service is in charge of running that schedule, but that's done in partnership with Biden team. And it was their decision to delay a day,\" Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli told CNN's \"New Day.\"\n \"The decision was made to delay a day and leave the Secret Service in a position, and the whole team across the Washington metro area, to be prepared to respond on that day if needed,\" he said.\n Biden said \"yes\" when asked if he felt safe about Inauguration Day, based on the intelligence he has seen, when exiting a televised address to the country Friday afternoon.\n Washington police said they were receiving daily FBI briefings on internet \"chatter\" of possible protests around the inauguration.\n \"I can assure the residents of the District of Columbia that the Metropolitan Police Department and federal partners are in a posture to respond to the information that's out there thus far that we've heard,\" Metropolitan Police Department Acting Chief Robert Contee said.\n MPD is coordinating with the FBI and briefing DC Mayor Muriel Bowser daily on all threats, Contee said.\n On Friday evening, US Capitol Police arrested a Virginia man as he attempted to pass through a police checkpoint in downtown Washington, DC with unauthorized inaugural credentials, an unregistered handgun and more than 500 rounds of ammunition, according to court documents.\n The man, identified as Wesley Allen Beeler, pulled his pickup to a police checkpoint just north of the Capitol, according to a law enforcement source briefed on the situation. Beeler, from Front Royal, Virginia, presented officers with what was described as an unauthorized inauguration credential.\n When police asked Beeler if he was carrying any weapons, he told them he had a semi-automatic pistol in the center armrest, according to the court document.\n Police recovered the pistol, as well as 509 rounds of ammunition, shotgun shells and a magazine for the handgun, according to an incident report from the Metropolitan Police Department. Beeler was arrested and charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of unregistered ammunition, among other offenses, the report said.\n In an interview with the Washington Post, Beeler said he'd been working security in downtown DC for the past week for MVP Protective Services and had been given credentials to \"guard media equipment located at Seventh Street and Constitution Avenue NW. He said the credential he was given had previously been enough to enter that area,\" the paper reported.\n Beeler said he'd forgotten that he had his weapon in his vehicle, and he has a license to carry in Virginia.\n \"It was just me forgetting to take it out of my truck before I left for work. I don't know what the D.C. laws are. It still comes back on me, but I'm not a criminal,\" he said, according to the Washington Post.\n Bowser said she did not expect the continued presence of visiting National Guard troops after the inauguration but the city will have to take on a \"new posture.\"\n She again urged Americans to enjoy the inauguration from home and asked anyone who does not need to be out to avoid restricted areas.\n The National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day, the National Park Service (NPS) announced Friday.\n The temporary closure began Friday morning and will extend through at least Thursday, January 21. The NPS says protests will be allowed in designated locations and will be limited to those with permits.\n The US Postal Service, as it did four years ago, has removed or locked many blue street mailboxes in the nation's capital. But this year the Postal Service has taken similar measures in cities in almost 20 other states, the agency said.\n The House Oversight Committee sent letters Thursday to more than two dozen operators of bus lines, rental car companies, and hotels asking for assistance \"identifying and preventing the ongoing and extreme threat of further violent attacks in Washington, DC, and elsewhere, over the coming days.\"\n The letter asks the companies to increase security and screening of guests and keep business records available for future investigations, as well as provide Congress with records of any policies \"currently in place or being developed to ensure that your services are not used to facilitate violence or domestic terrorism.\"\n The letter cited Airbnb's cancellation of all DC reservations around the inauguration Wednesday as an example of a company that had \"voluntarily taken action to prevent domestic terrorists from using their services to support further violence.\"\n One of the companies sent the letter, Megabus, said Friday on Facebook that it was canceling service to Washington until after the inauguration.\n Facebook said Friday evening that it would prevent repeat violators of its policies from streaming live videos or creating events, groups or pages through Inauguration Day.\n In addition, Facebook is banning the creation of new event pages tied geographically to Washington and state capitols, the company announced in a blog post.\n The move is intended to \"further prevent people from trying to use our services to incite violence,\" Facebook said.\n The Pentagon has authorized up to 25,000 National Guard members for the inauguration, the National Guard Bureau said in a news release Friday. That's an increase from the 21,000 troops authorized a day earlier.\n \"Every state, territory and the District of Columbia will have National Guard men and women supporting the inauguration,\" the statement said.\n As of Thursday, there were 7,000 Guardsmen in DC from more than a dozen states and the DC National Guard. That number will more than triple in the next few days.\n Major Gen. William J. Walker, Commanding General for the District of Columbia National Guard, said  guardsmen on duty knew they would be in the capital city until at least January 24.\n \"Now, if conditions change, they'll stay here longer. So, the bottom line is, the National Guard will be here as long as we're required to be here, as long as we're needed,\" he told CNN Friday.\n Walker dismissed suggestions that the guardsmen's presence at the Capitol made it look like a war zone.\n \"This is not a war zone, and anybody who's been in a war knows that this is not a war zone. What you have here is a community-based organization, it's part of the United States military, the Guard, but we are citizen soldiers and airmen, and we represent the communities we serve in,\" he said.\n \"But most of all, Americans should be assured that the Guard is out here in support of the lead federal agency -- the United States Secret Service -- and that the 59th Presidential Inauguration will be peaceful,\" he said.\n The FBI warning that armed protests are planned in all 50 states has prompted governors and police chiefs to deploy thousands of officers and equipment at capitols around the country.\n The FBI bulletin noted that extremists could zero in on government officials and institutions, as well as racial and religious minorities, journalists, and the LGBTQ community.\n States are enhancing security and calling up the National Guard in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.\n Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, will not be in Washington for the inauguration, citing warnings from the FBI and other agencies of \"credible threats of potential domestic violence and terrorism\" in his home state, Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for the governor, said via email Saturday.\n Florida and Maine have also activated the National Guard to work with state law enforcement.\n States are using heavy fencing and additional crowd control measures, including in Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington, while Pennsylvania has built barriers and increased security.\n Kentucky and Texas Friday announced that the grounds around their capitols will be closed temporarily.\n The Michigan State Police is mobilizing personnel from across the state to secure the Capitol ahead of planned protests, including one on Sunday, the agency said in a statement Friday.\n Lansing Mayor Andy Schor urged people to \"avoid coming to the Capitol and surrounding area\" because of demonstrations expected on Sunday.\n \"Downtown Lansing residents should consider planning ahead to stay inside and avoid this demonstration,\" the mayor said in a statement.\n \"I am asking residents and those who live in the Lansing area to stay out of the downtown area and to not engage with demonstrators who come to our city with ill intentions.\"\n Michigan's attorney general has warned that the Capitol was not safe due to the expected presence of armed militia members. It is legal to carry firearms in the open in the state.\n Michigan's state Senate and House have canceled legislative sessions over \"credible threats.\"\n In Virginia, a state of emergency has been declared in Richmond and Capitol Square will be closed. The state is anticipating a gathering Monday for \"Lobby Day,\" an annual protest that last year brought thousands of gun rights advocates to the Capitol.\n Governors in Maryland, New Mexico and Utah also declared states of emergency.\n In Oregon, the FBI has set up a command post to gather and share intelligence with law enforcement.\n In Florida and Oklahoma, lawmakers and staff are being told to work from home this weekend. Pennsylvania, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah are closing their capitols altogether.\n The first-floor windows of the state capitols in Illinois, Michigan, Virginia and Wisconsin have been boarded up.\n New Jersey has told state employees to work from home Tuesday. The New Jersey National Guard will have a \"quick reaction force\" of 100 standing by Sunday, Lt. Col. Barbara Brown told CNN on Friday.\n Several large states are on high alert. In New York, state police have taken steps \"to harden security in and around the State Capitol in Albany.\" And in California, more than 1,000 National Guard troops have been deployed and fencing has been erected around the Capitol after what the governor called an \"unconscionable assault on our Republic.\"\n Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the reason police arrested Wesley Allen Beeler. He was arrested as he attempted to pass through a police checkpoint in downtown Washington, DC, with unauthorized inaugural credentials, an unregistered handgun and more than 500 rounds of ammunition.\n CNN's Mirna Alsharif, Priscilla Alvarez, Brian Fung, Ellie Kaufman, MJ Lee, Oren Liebermann, Peter Morris, Artemis Moshtaghian, Peter Nickeas, Evan Perez, Manu Raju, Nicky Robertson, Geneva Sands, David Shortell, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Alta Spells, Carolyn Sung and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California said Saturday he has tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration while isolating.\n \"Yesterday, I tested positive for COVID-19,\" Correa said in a statement provided by his office. \"I will be responsible and self-quarantine \u2014 away from my family \u2014 for the recommended time.\"\n The diagnosis, he said, will cause him to miss Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' inauguration on Wednesday.\n \"While this diagnosis will prevent me from attending the much-anticipated inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, I look forward to working with the new administration to unite our country and help the millions of people devastated by the pandemic,\" he said.\n Correa is symptom free, feels well, and focused on continuing to work for his constituents, his spokesperson Andrew Scibetta told CNN.\n The congressman tested positive after undergoing a routine Covid-19 test when he returned home from Washington, according to his office's statement.\n Correa had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on December 19, his office said.\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says building immunity to Covid-19 \"typically takes a few weeks\" after vaccination and that it's possible a person could be infected before or after being vaccinated \"and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection.\"\n Correa is among several dozen House members and senators who have contracted the virus in recent months, as the Covid-19 pandemic has raged across the country.\n Three Democrats early this week said they tested positive for Covid-19 after sheltering in place with other members of Congress who did not wear masks during the January 6 violent attack on the US Capitol. Correa was not among the group who sheltered in the designated safe zone during the Capitol attack, his office confirmed to CNN.\n CNN reported earlier this week that Correa was accosted by President Donald Trump supporters at Dulles International Airport following the Pro-Trump insurrection at the Capitol.\n This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

        "title": "Terrifying scope of Capitol attack becoming clearer as Washington locks down for Biden's inauguration",
        "body_text": "Federal authorities are piecing together a chilling picture of the January 6 insurrection that reveals major security and intelligence failures, underscores profound fissures in American society and hints at the political challenges ahead for President-elect Joe Biden, even as they race to ensure the safety of US leaders and next week's inauguration.\n Emerging details paint an even grimmer picture than the shocking images of violence broadcast live around the world last week. Evidence suggests planning by the insurrectionists, and there are concerns that they may have received support from some Capitol Police, current and former members of the military, and even some members of Congress.\n As rioters broke into the Capitol building and some chanted \"hang Mike Pence,\" the seditious mob ripped through the \"thin blue line\" many claim to revere, kicking and beating police with their own batons, spraying them with chemical irritants, threatening to kill them. One policeman and four others died that day.\n Once inside the building, The Washington Post reports the insurrectionists came within minutes of reaching the vice president, who was whisked to safety with his wife and daughter. Some had driven to the Capitol days earlier, others had filled their vehicles with guns, ammunition, crossbows, machetes and, in one case, a note listing a congressman by name.\n Days after the attack, even as security reinforcements arrive, some lawmakers tell CNN they now fear for their safety.\n While some Republicans argued President Donald Trump's unprecedented second impeachment will only inflame divisions, federal officials warned that extremists, after seeing the results of last week's attack on the US Capitol, are now likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on the January 20 inauguration and throughout 2021.\n An internal FBI bulletin disseminated to law enforcement this week warned that \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington in the days leading up to Biden's swearing in. Federal law enforcement agencies issued urgent bulletins calling for assistance securing the nation's capital, which now bristles with road blocks and steel barriers to wall off the \"People's House\" and will host as many as 25,000 National Guard -- a stronger military footprint than the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined.\n By Friday, the FBI had received 140,000 digital tips regarding the attack, including photos and video, federal officials had opened 275 criminal investigations, charged roughly 98 individuals, and taken 100 individuals into custody.\n As senior administration leaders who would normally take the lead remained silent for days -- including the heads of the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the President himself -- federal officials launched the most extensive counterterrorism probe since September 11, 2001, and continued planning to fortify Washington.\n \"Our posture is aggressive. It's going to stay that way through the inauguration,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a Thursday briefing on inauguration security. He added that the agency was monitoring \"extensive\" online chatter about further potential armed protests and issued a warning to the men and woman who wreaked havoc on the Capitol.\n \"We know who you are, if you're out there,\" Wray said, \"and FBI agents are coming to find you.\"\n The domestic terrorists struck at a time when the US government is confronting the worst known cyberattack by a foreign adversary in its history, with Russia suspected of penetrating hundreds of businesses and numerous federal agencies. Their bloodshed and destruction come as Covid-19 claims record daily death tolls and a jobs crisis is brewing, with nearly 1 million people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time last week.\n The insurrection, fueled by Trump's lies about his definitive election loss, exposed the reach of baseless conspiracy theories that have radicalized Americans to the point that they laid siege to their own Capitol.\n The events of that day raise questions about intelligence failures, the military's lethargic response as panicked lawmakers pleaded by telephone for help, and law enforcement's potential blind spots or willful ignorance about the dangers posed by white supremacists and right-wing nativists.\n Those groups formed a combustible mix with the anti-Semites and QAnon conspiracists rampaging on January 6 to create an existential crisis for the Republican Party, which faces the choice of remaining in thrall to Trump and his more toxic supporters or breaking away.\n It creates a challenge for the larger country as well, according to CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein, who said the trajectory of Trump's \"white nationalist extremism has been very clear\" for the last four years, as are the potential costs to US security if it is left unchecked.\n \"President Trump has provided an enormous amount of oxygen to this very dangerous ideology,\" Brownstein told Jake Tapper on Thursday. \"And unless everyone involved, the Justice Department, law enforcement, Congress, is very serious about imposing consequences and taking the threat seriously, this could become a steady drumbeat through the Biden presidency.\"\n \"The question is, can we more broadly send a signal that says we are not going to tolerate and look the other way as this metastasizes,\" Brownstein said.\n Already, thousands of armed pro-Trump extremists are plotting to surround the US Capitol ahead of Biden's inauguration, according to a lawmaker briefed by security officials Monday.\n A joint US government intelligence bulletin said the January 6 attack, meant to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory, may have given extremists of differing ideological stripes a way to connect. The bulletin warned that the insurrection \"is very likely part of an ongoing trend in which (extremists) exploit lawful protests, rallies, and demonstrations, and other gatherings to carry out ideologically motivated violence and criminal activity.\"\n Multiple defense officials have told CNN that the National Guard and law enforcement expect explosives like pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to be used in any coming unrest. They are assuming perpetrators will come with high \"aggression,\" said one senior defense official, who added, \"their intentions are very serious.\"\n Pipe bombs that could have done serious damage were planted outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington last week but didn't go off.\n The expertise behind the bombs and the ease with which the raucous crowd seemed to mill about the Capitol complex with little resistance raised concerns participants had insider help and military expertise.\n At least two US Capitol Police officers were suspended and at least 10 more are under investigation for allegedly playing some sort of role, CNN reported. Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, confirmed Friday that \"we're seeing indications that law enforcement officers, both former and current, maybe who have been off duty, participating in this riot activity.\"\n \"We don't care what your profession is, who you are, who you are affiliated with, if you are conducting or engaged in criminal activity, we will charge you and you will be arrested,\" Sherwin said.\n Part of that hunt is for \"several\" people possibly involved in the killing of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, according to two law enforcement officials. On Friday, Steven D'Antuono of the FBI's Washington Field Office said his investigators are \"making progress\" on the investigation and are looking at \"anyone and everyone\" who may be involved. He did not give specifics on the scope of the investigation.\n In the days after the attack, court records and news reports also confirmed that current and former US military members participated in the insurrection. The news triggered unprecedented statements from the leaders of major security agencies who felt the need to remind their men and women their loyalty is to the Constitution.\n On Tuesday, the America's most senior military leaders condemned the violent invasion and reminded service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism. The Defense Department has observed an increase in white supremacist ideology amongst active-duty service members and veterans, a senior defense official told CNN.\n The next day, US Secret Service Director James Murray sent agency employees a message urging them to remember their mission and remain professional during the upcoming inauguration. \"We are expected to behave in a non-partisan manner,\" his memo said.\n Video images of a Capitol Police officer wearing a MAGA hat during the invasion and of another taking selfies with rioters left lawmakers deeply shaken. According to the Wall Street Journal, the officer seen wearing the trademark red cap put it on as part of a ruse to rescue more than a dozen trapped police officers during the riot. The officer has been suspended and an investigation is underway.\n \"There were those acts of heroism, but next to that, there were also attacks of betrayal,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York said Tuesday on Instagram Live. \"And to run in the nation's Capitol and not know if an officer is there to help you or to harm you is also quite traumatizing.\"\n \"I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that many, many members of the House were nearly assassinated.\"\n Some members are asking for bulletproof vests, considering getting their own security and taking other steps, such as changing their routes to work, lawmakers told CNN. Meanwhile, some Republicans expressed outrage at metal detectors installed at the entrance to the House chamber.\n Many House lawmakers are considering another appalling possibility: that the mob got assistance from some of their colleagues.\n Thirty-one members of Congress sent a letter to the acting House Sergeant at Arms, acting Senate Sergeant at Arms, and the acting chief of the US Capitol Police asking them to investigate \"unusual\" and \"concerning\" tours they saw and reported to the Sergeant at Arms on January 5.\n \"Many of the Members who signed this letter, including those of us who have served in the military and are trained to recognize suspicious activity, as well as various members of our staff, witnessed an extremely high number of outside groups in the complex on Tuesday, January 5,\" the letter states.\n The groups of six to eight, who wore MAGA apparel, according to Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, \"could only have gained access to the Capitol Complex from a Member of Congress or a member of their staff,\" the letter said.\n \"I kind of assumed it must be a new member who didn't know the rules or something,\" Scanlon of Pennsylvania, one of the co-signers, told CNN. \"There were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff\" at a time when tours have been canceled due to Covid.\n At least one right-wing conspiracist said he coordinated the rally where Trump spoke before the riot with three House Republicans: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke before the President took the stage and urged the crowd to \"start taking down names and kicking ass.\" Brooks, Gosar and several other House GOP lawmakers are facing criticism for their incendiary language in the hours, days and weeks before the siege.\n Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who is affiliated with the QAnon movement and regularly spreads right-wing conspiracy theories, has also come under scrutiny for tweeting about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's whereabouts as the attack was unfolding.\n On Friday, Pelosi announced retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9, a former vice director with the Joint Chiefs of staff, would lead a review of the Capitol's security. She added that, \"if, in fact, it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecution for that.\"\n Later that day, when asked if they are investigating allegations that Capitol Police and lawmakers were involved in the riot, D'Antuono of the FBI's Washington Field Office said they will \"leave no stone unturned\" and are \"looking at every piece of the puzzle.\"\n Sherwin, the acting US attorney for Washington, DC, told reporters earlier in the week that \"we're looking at significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy.\"\n Evidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests a level of planning, a federal law enforcement official said. And court filings are offering shocking new details.\n One memo in a filing Friday seeks to extend the detention of Jacob Anthony Chansley, the face-painted QAnon believer who rallied people inside the Capitol wearing a horned headdress and carrying a six-foot spear and a bullhorn.\n Prosecutors describe those who took over the Capitol as \"insurrectionists\" and offer new details about Chansley's role in the violent siege last week, including that Chansley left a note on the dais where Vice President Pence had stood that morning saying, \"It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"\n Chansley later told the FBI he did not mean the note as a threat but said the vice president was a \"child-trafficking traitor.\"\n Before he was arrested, Chansley also told the FBI he wanted to return to Washington for the inauguration to protest.\n In a separate case, prosecutors in Texas alleged that a retired Air Force reservist who carried plastic zip tie-like restraints on the Senate floor may have intended to restrain lawmakers. It was one of the many chilling details to emerge as investigators tracked down some of the most recognizable faces from the riot.\n Authorities apprehended the man in widely circulated photos carrying a Confederate flag inside Capitol Hill, another who had worn a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt and the Olympic gold medalist swimmer Klete Keller.\n Federal officials also charged Peter Stager, a burly bearded man, with beating a DC police officer with a flagpole that had an American flag on it. \"Everybody in there is a treasonous traitor,\" Stager said in a video obtained by the FBI. \"Death is the only remedy for what's in that building.\"\n A few arrests suggest the apparent murderous intent of some in the crowd.\n One man from Alabama faces 17 criminal counts, largely for possession of multiple weapons, including a shotgun, a rifle, three pistols and 11 Molotov cocktails, as well as ammunition and shotgun shells without registration, according to an indictment.\n After living in his truck in DC for about a week, the man parked it about a block from the Capitol on January 6, according to court documents. Police started searching the truck after spotting a firearm handle and found the weapons, as well as a stun gun, several machetes, a crossbow; several large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices; and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to a memorandum that prosecutors filed January 12 in support of his detention.\n Also in the truck: the handwritten note with Indiana Rep. Andre Carson's name and an added observation that he is \"one of two Muslims in House of Reps.\"\n The second man is alleged to have driven from Colorado to Washington, DC, a day before Trump's rally with more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition and an assault rifle. He is said to have texted acquaintances that he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and shoot DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, according to court records.\n \"If I had a more concerning threats case come before me, I don't remember it,\" Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey of the DC District Court said Thursday.\n Some lawmakers' experiences made them worry that the rioters had a level of careful preparation that belies the narrative of a protest that wheeled out of control.\n Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN that someone removed panic buttons installed throughout her office that had been regularly tested and maintained. An investigation is underway, said Pressley, who said the discovery was \"certainly unnerving.\"\n Carson, whose name was on the note found in the car filled with weaponry and ammunition, is among a growing list of lawmakers critical of law enforcement's handling of the insurgency.\n \"It is extremely disturbing to learn from press reports that I was one of several individuals identified in a list of 'good guys' and 'bad guys' targeted for attacks,\" Carson said in a statement provided to CNN. \"As a former law enforcement officer, it is especially disappointing to see the failure of law enforcement officials, including the U.S. Capitol Police, to notify individuals like myself that we were targeted and at risk from the indicted terrorist and his co-conspirators.\"\n Investigators will be asking how federal authorities missed so many red flags, why they were so underprepared and slow to react.\n The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security failed to issue threat assessments about the potential of violence at the US Capitol ahead of last week's deadly attack, according to a source familiar with the matter and a senior DHS official. Typically, the FBI and DHS will produce a joint threat assessment for high-profile events and send it to law enforcement officials and relevant stakeholders. But no such report was compiled by either agency for the January 6 certification of Biden's victory, a controversial event for the President's followers.\n The Washington Post reported Friday that three days before the attack, an internal Capitol Police intelligence report warned that angry Trump supporters could attack \"Congress itself.\" The 12-page report describes a scenario eerily like the one that unfolded, with the President's enraged backers trying to stop Biden's certification and overturn the election results.\n A day before the chaos erupted, an FBI outpost in Virginia issued an internal warning that extremists were coming to Washington prepared to commit violence.\n The Post also reported that dozens of people on a terrorist watch list came to Washington for the January 6 events. The majority of them were suspected white supremacists with track records so disturbing they were put on the national Terrorist Screening Database as potential security risks.\n Four federal agencies announced Friday they are opening investigations into their own roles on January 6. The Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the Interior Department will all examine their preparations for the events in Washington that day that may have played a part in allowing rioters to breach the Capitol.\n These agencies and others are now preparing for rioters to descend on the Capitol again.\n The Secret Service is taking the lead on Biden's inauguration security planning. The National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day, according to an official familiar with discussions.\n There will be no big screens, no toilets and the public will not be able to get down to the Mall where traditionally thousands gather to watch the new president be sworn in, the official said.\n The President-elect and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol during a significantly scaled-down event. Biden said this week that his team had been receiving briefings in the wake of the violence and that he was \"not afraid of taking the oath outside.\"\n CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Christina Carrega, David Shortell, Marshall Cohen, Nicky Robertson, Ellie Kaufman, Geneva Sands, Zachary Cohen, Oren Liebermann, Barbara Starr, Jamie Crawford, Jamie Gangel, Jake Tapper, Alex Marquardt, Jeff Zeleny, Kate Sullivan, Ryan Nobles, Annie Grayer, and Brian Todd contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Justice Horn was in broad daylight, but he could not see as he rose from the ground and blindly stumbled through darkness and pain.\n The pain was the fire the community activist felt in his face and eyes in June 2020, as he had just been pepper-sprayed by a Kansas City police officer while peacefully protesting the death of George Floyd. \"I've never felt any pain like that before,\" Horn said. \"Just to be standing there with no weapons \u2014 I don't own a gun \u2014 but with a sign and just to turn and get Maced.\"\n At the protest, attendees chanted and held signs. They were standing on the sidewalks, not antagonizing the police, when hundreds of protesters were pepper-sprayed, pushed down, shoved into cop cars or shot with rubber bullets, he said.\n A fellow activist called an Uber for Horn, who \"remained blind for the rest of the day\" and went to bed because he couldn't see anything. \"You hear stories and have family that have run-ins with law enforcement, but it's another thing when you have personal experience,\" Horn said. \"Even if that cop's gone, you're always going to remember that.\"\n As shocked Americans watched a predominantly White insurrection at the US Capitol lead to domestic terrorists storming the building, many decried the threat to safety and democracy. But for some people of color \u2014 Black, Native American and Latinx \u2014 these events amid an international reckoning of racial injustice were also another infuriating, sobering reminder of White supremacy and privilege. As Horn watched the insurrection unfold, he remembered the aggression he and other activists experienced last summer.\n Their fight was the \"bare minimum Black Lives Matter,\" Horn said. \"And the fact that that gets challenged, that we get beaten ... and then seeing people ... get grace, get escorts, get selfies and don't get the back end of a police stick for a protest or for a mask mandate shows that there are two different Americas.\"\n \"I'm just asking for police to give us grace,\" he added, \"the same way they do with Trump supporters.\"\n If witnessing the insurrection took a toll on your mental health, there are ways you can try to manage alone and with others.\n What might also be disturbing and stressful for people of color to hear are statements that equate the Capitol insurrection to protests for racial justice. The fundamental differences lie within the motivations of the movements.\n \"Black Lives Matter protesters are protesting for justice and equality,\" said clinical psychologist Monnica Williams, a Canada research chair in mental health disparities and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. \"If your candidate doesn't win in a society where you do have an ability to assert yourself ... OK, sorry. You try again next time. That's very different from protesting a situation where your voice doesn't matter.\"\n One movement \"is to protect our rights and to push for democracy,\" said Helen Neville, a professor of educational psychology and African American studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"The other is to dismantle democracy.\"\n The boldness of those who stormed the Capitol with weapons and lived likely would have been a \"death sentence\" for Black and brown people, Williams said, and that may have happened on the front steps, not inside the building. \"It really reinforces what we as a Black community have known all along, that rather than being respected and valued members of our society, we're mostly hated and feared.\"\n The potential impact of witnessing the imagery of the noose and gallows, Confederate flags and anti-Semitic garb on the mental health of people of color is not yet measurable, Williams said. She and her colleagues, however, have seen how shaken, emotional and depressed many of their clients are from observing those historical symbols of hate and violence.\n \"The images are painful because they're intended to be painful. They're symbols of hate,\" Neville said. \"They can have a visceral effect on people, whether it makes them feel physically ill as they look at it\" or whether that adds to their trauma.\n Many Americans who care about the function, race relations and leaders of this nation were affected by what happened that day, but \"a lot of White people seem to be surprised and shocked,\" Williams said. \"A lot of people of color are not so surprised as much as disappointed and maybe feeling a little more defeated than they did before.\"\n Some people cope by ignoring events or numbing their emotions while others become fearful. As Inauguration Day and threats of riots draw closer, Williams worries for her children's safety. \"A lot of us feel worried like, what if this doesn't settle down?\" she said. \"You hear rumors about other protests that are planned (and) being organized regionally. Does this mean that law enforcement is going to take such a lax approach when people like this act out? It's scary.\"\n What both ignites these fears and potentially had underlain the inadequate police response at the Capitol was \"a combination of White-skin privilege and ideological coherence,\" meaning that some police shared the beliefs of the insurgents, said Sundiata Cha-Jua, an associate professor in the department of history and in African American studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n \"Now they're unleashed,\" said Luis Zayas, the dean of the Steve Hicks School of Social Work at The University of Texas at Austin. \"If they could do that to a fortified place like the Capitol, what it would be for a small community. You could be subject to being attacked by a much larger group that's unruly and even the police could not control them.\"\n One of the most important ways of coping with prejudice-based trauma is social support, these experts said. That includes from people with whom you can share your feelings and fears, and receive validation, Williams said. \"There's a lot of really strange things that have been going on these last four years that have become normal, but they shouldn't be normal,\" she added. \"It's almost like noise in the background,\" but acknowledging these abnormalities is part of not dismissing fears.\n \"A cultural way of coping could be to talk to an older community member ... to hear stories about how they have dealt with racial oppression and discrimination,\" Neville said. \"People have lived through Jim Crow in the South. Hearing those stories about resilience and about resistance can also be helpful.\"\n Stay informed as you need to but limit your news exposure if it becomes too much to handle, Williams said. When you are checking in, read clear analyses from credible sources, Neville said, so that \"we are not buying in to analyses that blame us.\"\n Also try to set aside time to engage in spiritual comfort or relaxing activities as temporary distractions, which can be healthy if balanced with social awareness. Horn, the community activist, puts his phone on do not disturb while he exercises for at least an hour daily. When he's feeling exhausted or defeated, he talks with his family and is honest about his struggles.\n As you distance yourself from news, try not to log into social media feeds inundated with the same content. Social media can be a source of support, Williams said, or a black hole of contention, negativity and hate. Limit the time you spend in online conflict zones unless you have the capacity for constructive debate, and limit your viewing of visuals depicting police violence, which can be traumatizing.\n Educating yourself on your heritage and the trailblazers in your history can help you heal from any internalized White supremacy you may be dealing with, Neville said.\n Also, create safe spaces with others. \"What we've seen in the past is that communities like this will create their own means of communication, where the safe places are, where to walk, where not to walk,\" Zayas said. That could be via phone, text or Facebook group.\n When President-elect Joe Biden was projected the winner of the 2020 US presidential election, some people of color celebrated, finding hope in the fact that there is a new, more diverse administration coming at the end of another challenging few years for racial justice.\n At the same time, there are caveats. \"Realistically, our country has been controlled by White men since its inception,\" Williams said. \"So, although yes, Trump's reign has been traumatic, Joe Biden's not a savior. And I think that we will be setting ourselves up for disappointment if we think that he's going to fix everything that's broken, because our country has been broken for maybe 300 years.\n \"Yes, we celebrate the end of the Trump trauma, but keep in mind we still have a lot of work to do.\"\n That work could be spurred by radical hope, which is the belief that our collective future will be better than it is now, Neville said. It requires reimagining what a \"multiracial democracy\" looks like.\n \"The ways in which democracy is working is not working for Black, Indigenous and people of color,\" Neville added. \"This radical hope incorporates our critical understanding of our past oppression and our resistance to that oppression. ... We, as BIPOC folks, are going to have to carry on the traditions of our ancestors (and) work incredibly hard so that we can leave this country better.\"\n \"Then people can feel like they're taking the bad things that have happened and are using that energy for good,\" Williams said. \"That's really important that people can make meaning from their pain.\"\n CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed to this story.",

        "title": "2020 lightning and tornado numbers were down -- but not tornado fatalities",
        "body_text": "There was some good news to come out of 2020: fewer tornadoes and fewer lightning strikes across the United States. But sadly, fewer tornadoes did not mean fewer fatalities -- a stark reminder that the timing and location of such storms can be critical.\n With a preliminary tally of 1,053, 2020 saw the lowest annual number of tornadoes since 2015, when 971 were recorded, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center.\n Still, tornadoes last year killed 78 people, the highest count since 2011, when a super outbreak in late April led to 553 deaths.\n Similarly, two events in 2020 contributed to the majority of last year's fatalities. In the first -- March 2 into 3 -- 10 tornadoes rolled through Tennessee, including Nashville, killing 24 people.\n \"Tornadoes that occur in more populated regions, such as in or near cities, are much more likely to result in deaths due to the sheer number of people in the path,\" says Brandon Miller, CNN meteorologist.\n \"The time of day also plays a role,\" he says. \"Nocturnal tornadoes, which occur at night while most are sleeping and unaware of warnings and changing conditions, are much more likely to result in deaths compared to tornadoes that occur during daylight hours.\"\n The following month ended up being the second-most active April on record for tornadoes, behind only 2011 for total number. Every day in April but one -- April 5 -- saw at least a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5) for severe storms  somewhere across the contiguous US, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n 2020's second significant outbreak -- on April 12 and 13 -- produced more than 140 tornadoes. It was also the deadliest tornado outbreak in six years, with 32 fatalities across Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina.\n \"In a lot of ways, tornadoes are like hurricanes, with the damage and fatalities related to where they strike,\" says Dave Hennen, CNN meteorologist. \"Think of Hurricane Andrew in 1992: the first storm, the A storm, that didn't occur until late August. But because it was so strong and hit a densely populated area of South Florida, that year will always be remembered.\n \"Tornadoes are the same way. Some of the strongest tornadoes every year occur in rural parts of the country, so damage can be limited, but if a tornado, even a weaker one, strikes a major metro area, damage and fatalities can be extensive,\" he says. \"So, it's not number that is most important but where it hits.\"\n There were 14 killer tornadoes in April 2020. Then, into May 2020, a shift in the weather pattern began to favor development of strong troughs in the eastern US.\n \"The end result is that the central United States never had an extended period of time where we had all four primary ingredients for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in place for any extended length of time, during what is normally the most favorable time period for severe hail,\" says Patrick Marsh, science support branch chief for the Storm Prediction Center.\n Another potentially deadly weather phenomenon -- lightning strikes -- also saw tallies drop in 2020. There were about 170 million lightning events last year across the continental US, down about 52 million from 2019, according to Vaisala's 2020 Annual Lightning Report.\n \"The decrease in counts from 2019 to 2020 is the greatest change year-over-year in our data, and 39 (of the) 48 (states) saw below-average lightning,\" says Chris Vagasky, meteorologist and lightning applications manager at Vaisala, which specializes in weather, environmental and industrial measurements on Earth and Mars.\n Unsurprisingly, Texas ranks No. 1 in total lightning strikes, due in part to its huge land area, Vaisala reports. By square kilometer, though, Florida tops the list, with Texas sixth.\n Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming all saw far fewer lightning strikes in 2020.\n Sometimes a single event can account for a large number of lightning strikes. An example is the Midwestern derecho event last summer. It spawned 8% of all Iowa lightning strikes in 2020, with over 27,000 cloud-to-ground strikes. Despite this, Iowa -- which based off the average from 2010-2019 places 13th for most strikes -- actually dropped to the No. 22 spot last year.\n Preliminary numbers show lightning killed 17 people across the US in 2020, the second-lowest total since 2010, according to the National Weather Service.\n While California's tally of lightning was below average last year, the impact of lightning there in 2020 was tremendous, sparking wildfires that burned the largest portion of the state in history.\n \"Unfortunately, much of the lightning that occurred was during a four-day period in August (15 to 18) that was accompanied by very little rainfall,\" Vagasky says.\n Lightning in some Western states can be especially concerning in the summer months due to the potential for sparking wildfires. But not all lightning is created equal.\n A factor called \"continuing current\" is very important. (Scientists sometimes use the term \"stroke\" when referring to lightning.)\n \"The scientific consensus is that around 10% of cloud-to-ground strokes contain continuing current.\"\n And lightning frequency isn't the only consideration for fire weather.\n \"Other factors, including drought conditions, the amount of precipitation with the thunderstorms and whether the lightning contains continuing current ... help dictate whether lightning will trigger wildfires,\" says Vagasky.\n Oftentimes as thunderstorms develop out West, the surrounding air is so dry that any rain that falls actually gets evaporated before it reaches the ground, a phenomena called \"virga.\" Lightning can still occur within these storms, which don't have the benefit of moisture to extinguish any fires a strike might set.",

Since then, each day has been filled with revelations about how it was plotted and carried out. Many are still trying to process the initial shock.\n While seeing Confederate and Trump 2020 flags draped all over the Capitol was a shocking sight for some, others were not surprised.\n \"It was simply the culmination of the past four years under Trump's presidency,\" said librarian Djaz Zulida.\n Zulida is a job information resource librarian for the Brooklyn Public Library system. Soon after the riot, the library set out to compile books that would help put this insurrection into perspective.\n \"While a book list is not the end all, be all as far as resources, this felt like a place where we could begin, a place where we could encourage a conversation, and to filter out some of the noise and give people a little bit of a framework, focusing on a number of different issues,\" Zulida said.\n Zulida combed through the library's resources and learned that the library could use more books that discuss the 25th Amendment, which lays out a process for orderly transition of power in the case of death, disability, or resignation of the President. They included \"Birch Bayh: Making a Difference,\" a book about the man that authored the amendment.\n \"I assumed, of course, that the amendments are written by politicians,\" Zulida said. \"But I had no idea that there was one person so specifically, wrapped up in the details of putting together the language and the idea and turning that into a constitutional amendment.\"\n This is the list of more 30 books they compiled and a description of the book's relevance to the subject.\n A humorous look at epic fails in historical upheavals, putsches, and coups.

        "title": "Trump's 'pro-law enforcement' image crumbles in his final days",
        "body_text": "A President who has repeatedly touted himself as pro-law enforcement is now being accused of fueling a growing threat of extremists that has law enforcement officials across the nation on high alert.\n As the presidency of Donald Trump draws to an end, the recent Trump-inspired attacks on law enforcement officers, his refusal to take the steps necessary to defuse violent elements of his base and the President's years-long assault on agencies such as the FBI and Justice Department, are all casting serious doubt on the sincerity of his self-described support for those who wear the badge.\n On January 6, the nation watched with horror as a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol Building following a rally near the White House. The deadly attack was in part the result of Trump's efforts to whip up fear and anger among his base with false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n Among the five people who died in the attack was a US Capitol Police officer who had been attempting to defend the building. Eyewitness video from the insurgence shows numerous rioters assaulting law enforcement officers, including gruesome images of a Metropolitan Police Department officer being crushed in a doorway as he screamed in agony.\n Trump was silent for much of the day, offering tepid condemnation of his supporters who committed violence against police in his name. The President later released a stronger video denouncing the incident, but sources told CNN that Trump later appeared to regret making the video.\n In addition to the recent violence against law enforcement officers at the Capitol by Trump supporters, intelligence officials suggest the mob attack did not happen in a vacuum.\n According to a US intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN, extremists view the domestic terrorist attack by the pro-Trump mob as a success and a motivator to conduct future violence.\n Just as troubling, the intelligence bulletin indicated that many of the extremists' grievances that could fuel follow-on attacks against government and law enforcement officials closely mirror the baseless claims frequently repeated by Trump. For example, FBI and Department of Homeland Security intelligence analysts said conspiracy theories such as the existence of a \"deep state\" in government, as well as the baseless belief among extremists that mass voter fraud tipped the 2020 presidential election in Biden's favor, are fueling domestic extremists.\n Although Trump has enjoyed widespread support from police unions in the run up to the 2020 election, even law enforcement organizations that endorsed him for reelection -- such as the powerful Fraternal Order of Police -- were appalled at the Trump-fueled January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n In a strongly worded statement imploring the President to speak out against the Capitol violence, the group said, \"the images coming in from the United State Capitol Building today are heartbreaking to every American. We call on President Trump to forcefully urge these demonstrators to stop their unlawful activity, to stand down, and to disperse.\"\n The recent Trump-inspired assault on police officers is not the only controversial period Trump has faced when it came to his relationship with law enforcement.\n While addressing a group of police officers early in his presidency, Trump encouraged those in attendance to be \"rough\" with suspects.\n \"When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon. You see them thrown in rough,\" Trump said, adding, \"Please don't be too nice.\"\n The President's comments praising the excessive use of force were met with widespread condemnation by some law enforcement agencies, including the head of the New York City Police Department, who said that to \"suggest that police officers apply any standard in the use of force other than what is reasonable and necessary is irresponsible, unprofessional and sends the wrong message to law enforcement as well as the public.\"\n The Gainesville, Florida, police department said Trump had \"no business endorsing or condoning cops being rough with arrestees and suggesting that we should slam their heads onto the car while putting them in.\" The department added that Trump's remarks \"set modern policing back and erased a lot of the strides we have made to build trust in our community.\"\n Perhaps Trump's most notorious contradiction in his alleged full-throated support for law enforcement was his endless clashing with agencies such as the FBI and Justice Department as they worked to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n Launched in July 2016, the FBI's Russia investigation, code named Crossfire Hurricane, probed four members of Trump's campaign and their suspected ties to the Kremlin, and was frequently the target of Trump's ire. The investigation was later taken over by veteran prosecutor Robert Mueller, whom Trump constantly attacked and worked to undermine throughout the course of the investigation.\n One of the subjects of the investigation, retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russians and was fired from his position as Trump's national security adviser. Trump later pardoned Flynn, claiming without evidence that Flynn was a victim in an attempt by federal investigators to undermine the Trump presidency.\n Two other Trump allies, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, were similarly pardoned by Trump after they were convicted of committing federal crimes. Similar to the Flynn pardon, Trump blasted the federal law enforcement officers who investigated Stone and Manafort, calling them corrupt and partisan.\n Trump's caustic comments about the investigators working to uncover Russian influence stood at odds with his attempted \"pro-law enforcement\" image, as did comments made by the President's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, when he compared career FBI agents to murderous Nazis.\n With less than a week remaining as president, Trump's ceaseless false claims of mass voter fraud continue to threaten and make life more difficult for law enforcement in America.\n As the nation prepares to inaugurate Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States, federal law enforcement agencies have transformed the nation's capital into a veritable fortress -- fearful that pro-Trump supporters could stage an attack along the lines of the Trump-inspired violent insurgence at the US Capitol on January 6.\n FBI field offices across the nation are spinning up command posts to monitor potential violence in their regions by those who believe Trump's lies about the 2020 election results, and in places such as Michigan, law enforcement officers across the state are being mobilized to protect life and property.\n The potential threats on the horizon place America's law enforcement officers squarely in harm's way. And with Trump still refusing to accept the legitimacy of the election and forcefully tell his supporters to back down, police in America remain on high alert, and potential targets for more Trump-inspired violence.",

        "title": "Youth poet laureate crafting 'message of joining together' for inauguration",
        "body_text": "Amanda Gorman was about halfway through writing the poem that she'll deliver at President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next week when she watched in horror the deadly siege on the US Capitol.\n Typically, it takes the nation's first-ever youth poet laureate days to craft a new poem. She finished this one immediately.\n \"It was like someone pressed the on-switch in my brain,\" Gorman told CNN Friday. \"I finished the rest at home that night.\"\n Come Wednesday, Gorman will participate in a ceremony whose theme has long been billed as a call to national unity -- a plea made ever more urgent after last week's violence and a nation riven by political divisions and struggling with the ongoing pandemic. Those thoughts will be with the 22-year-old Gorman as she speaks.\n \"As I was crafting this piece, it was really trying to communicate a message of joining together and crossing divides,\" Gorman said. She believes Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will \"spearhead a new chapter in America, which we so desperately need -- one of dignity, and integrity, and hope and unity, because there's a lot that needs to get done and a lot that needs to be fixed. And I think that they're the people to do it.\"\n Though the inauguration will look different and be vastly pared down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Gorman will be among the few performers, including Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez, to join Biden and Harris for their swearing-in ceremony.\n Millions of Americans will hear from Gorman, who is Black, ahead of Harris taking the oath of office to become America's first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president.\n The inauguration is a \"huge step for me to be part of a moment that has such historicity in it,\" Gorman said. \"And for me, just trying to do justice for the moment, trying to do justice to the incredible inaugural poets who've come before me.\"\n Gorman is no stranger to grand stages. She's recited her poetry at the Library of Congress, Boston's Symphony Hall, the Empire State Building's observation deck and all across the country, performing for such luminaries as Hillary Clinton, Al Gore and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n For Wednesday's work, she drew inspiration from the two poems read at Barack Obama's inauguration -- Richard Blanco's 2013 \"One Today\" and Elizabeth Alexander's 2009 \"Praise Song for the Day\" -- and writers, like Walt Whitman and Frederick Douglass, whom she feels have spoken to the ideals of a nation.\n Born and raised in Los Angeles by a single-mother who was a 6th-grade English teacher, Gorman started writing poems when she was a child, but found it terrifying to perform due to a speech impediment. Biden has struggled with a stutter, Gorman said, and another inauguration poet Maya Angelou -- who delivered the poetry reading for Bill Clinton's first inauguration -- was mute for several years when she was a child.\n Gorman pushed herself to overcome the fear of speaking in public by drawing confidence from great orators like Obama and Martin Luther King Jr., and she practices songs from the Broadway musical \"Hamilton.\"\n She also recites a mantra to herself before every poetry performance to gather herself: \"I am the daughter of Black writers, who are descended from Freedom Fighters, who broke the chains who changed the world. They call me.\"\n Gorman told CNN she'll rehearse her inaugural poem \"back to front\" several times in her bathroom mirror and practice performing over \"discorded music\" to prepare for possible distractions.\n Her poems often focus on political issues, such as inequality and climate change, tuned to the tenor of the times.\n She wrote \"We Rise\" after watching Christine Blasey Ford's moving testimony on Capitol Hill during the Senate confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\"We the People\" was conceived after what she described as the \"big emotional, psychological political shock\" she went through after Trump was elected. And \"The Miracle of Morning,\" performed on CBS's \"This Morning\" last year, addressed the loss and grief Americans felt from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Now, she's set to address an especially traumatic moment in American history in the wake of the domestic terror attack on the Capitol.\n She continued, \"It's really sitting in the wounds and the scars that we have, so that we can then move onto healing and move on the progress that needs to happen.\"\n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Maya Angelou's childhood speech impediment. She was mute.",

        "title": "Ugandan President Museveni wins re-election in vote his rival says was rigged",
        "body_text": "Bobi Wine -- a singer-turned-politician, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi -- came a far second in the vote, according to the country's election commission.\n Wine said his team was considering all peaceful, nonviolent and legal options to contest the results, as fears of post-election unrest surfaces, following deadly violence in the months leading up to the vote.\n \"We are the real winners of this election and therefore what the electoral commission announced has nothing to do with the real election that took place,\" Wine told CNN immediately after the announcement.\n \"I can call on all Ugandans to reject the announcement that has been made by the electoral commission ... to reject them with the contempt with which it deserves.\"\n Wine said he had evidence of fraud and intimidation, but he did not provide details of that alleged evidence, saying his team would share it when communications lines were restored. He had earlier accused the electoral commission of vote rigging.\n The internet in Uganda has been shut down for days under a government order. Wine said that he was struggling to get hold of his leadership team after being placed under house arrest on Friday.\n Museveni, 76, has been in power for more than three decades and, ahead of this vote, outside observers believed there was little chance he would relinquish his position.\n Saturday's results follow months of campaigning that marred by heavy-handed state security responses to anti-Museveni protests, as well as the arrests of civil society members.\n Dozens of people were killed in the months running up to the vote, including 45 who died in protests in November alone, after Wine was arrested for allegedly breaking Covid-19 restrictions.\n \"It is clear that the violence has not been coming from the people of Uganda, the violence has been coming from the police and the military,\" Wine said, when asked whether he feared his call to reject the results would lead to violence.\n Ugandans voted in the poll on Thursday amid the internet shutdown. In a speech Tuesday, Museveni confirmed his government had ordered internet providers block Facebook and other social media, accusing the platforms of \"arrogance.\" By morning of election day, the order was extended.\n Wine had campaigned heavily on social media as some traditional outlets refused to include him in their election coverage.\n The internet blackout has raised questions around the integrity of the vote count and also meant biometric machines failed to register ballots, forcing many polling stations to use manual voting and checks.\n There were reports of late delivery of voting material and insufficient material at numerous polling locations. Journalists traveling to Wine's residence for a press conference were turned back by security forces before reaching his home. Many were also forced to leave the national election tally center, despite having accreditation.\n Museveni made a victory speech on Saturday evening, in which he said he believed the vote was carried out fairly.\n \"I think this may turn out to be the most 'cheating-free' election since 1962,\" he said, referring to elections that ushered in independence for the country.\n \"And I'm told that some people were maybe disabling the machines so that they allowed the cheating. But I'm told the machines were rectified and in many cases people voted by the machines.\"\n There were a few isolated celebrations on the streets of Kampala, but the city has been largely quiet since election day, with movements restricted and checkpoints set up by security personnel.\n But many Ugandans have expressed frustration with the leader who has held onto power for 34 years.\n \"I'm a supporter of Museveni and have been throughout my life, but what has been happening over time has made him unpopular. It's only wise for him now to groom a successor. I know he has a lifelong mission to die as president, but that is a recipe for trouble,\" 34-year-old Susan Rukari said.\n Jocelyne Karare, 65, said: \"It was not fair right from the beginning. It's no wonder of 18 million, over seven million people didn't turn up. People are tired.\"\n Before casting his ballot on Thursday, Wine addressed the media and complained that the majority of his polling agents across the country had been prevented from observing the election by police. Ugandan law guarantees that every candidate is allowed representation at polling locations.\n He reiterated his calls for the United States and European Union to hold Museveni and his government \"accountable to free and fair elections,\" accusing the leader of forcing the country to \"carry out elections in the dark\" with his internet blackout.\n US Ambassador to Uganda Natalie E. Brown said in a statement Wednesday that US monitors would not observe the vote as hoped after the election commission denied 75% of the country's accreditation requests.\n The EU's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the commission rejected its offer of monitors, despite having observed three elections between 2006 and 2016.\n \"The excessive use of force by law enforcement and security agencies has seriously tarnished this electoral process,\" Borrell added.\n Museveni told CNN on Tuesday that he would \"accept the results\" if he lost.\n \"If I lost a fair election, I will accept the results, of course, because Uganda is not my house,\" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\n \"If the people of Uganda don't want me to help them with their issues, I go and deal with my personal issues very happily.\"\n On Friday, Wine told CNN his life was in danger as his home was taken \"under siege\" by the military.\n Wine said his phone was blocked and his internet connection cut for some time as security forces burst into his home the day after polls opened.\n Appearing on NTV, Kampala Police spokesperson Luke Owoyesigire said Wine was not under arrest.\n \"We have just provided security in the area, nothing much,\" he said.\n Owoyesigire said state security was responding in an effort to secure Wine's residence and protect the candidate after two individuals were seen trying to gain access to the house by jumping the fence, adding one of the individuals had been arrested.\n But  a reporter for CNN near Wine's residence on Saturday said there was still a large military presence around the compound, as well as military helicopters and drones circling above.\n Wine's lawyer, David Lewis Rubongoya, told CNN that Wine was still under house arrest.\n \"The military is not allowing people to go in. They are just reading whatever results that they want. This election was just rigged in such a blatant way,\" he said.\n \"It is a sign of intimidation of the regime, but also they are very scared of the people. They lost this election in a very bad way. Bobi Wine is such a uniting factor, so they fear that the people might rise up, so that is why they are keeping him under a kind of house arrest. It is illegal and unconstitutional.\"\n He added Wine's team were looking at all legal options to challenge the results once they are all released.",

        "body_text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nWith the drama of Donald Trump's last presidential gasps -- and the urgency of his pending post-presidential impeachment trial for inciting insurrection -- it's been easy to gloss over the fact that in four days there will be a new president with very different priorities.\n The latest in the Trump drama is his aggravation at comparisons to Richard Nixon.\n Joe Biden is looking to move on.\n He gave a prime-time address from Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday and laid out the first of his relief plans: a $1.9 trillion package of temporary measures and help for the unemployed attached to a permanent hike in the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n A second speech on Friday outlined his plan to ramp up the production and distribution of vaccines. He'll rebrand the troubled Covid vaccine effort and promises a national strategy to combat the disease, a 180-degree turn from Trump's Covid denial, and he'll hire 100,000 federal health professionals to help build up the country's capacity.\n He'll need Congress to help with that and other plans. He's also inheriting some headaches, especially when it comes to foreign policy. On Taiwan and China, Cuba and Yemen, the Trump administration is handing Biden major policy changes he doesn't agree with but that he'll have trouble undoing.\n What Matters talked to CNN's Dan Merica, who covers Biden for CNN, about what we can expect in the days and weeks after Biden takes office. The email conversation, lightly edited, is below:\n The list of promises is long and ranges from climate change policy and union rights to trust in government and foreign policy issues like rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding Trump's targeted travel bans. Right now, it's a little unclear what exactly Biden will sign on Day One. What is clear: He made a lot of promises, so January 20 could be a very busy day.\n There are clear political ramifications to all this. Biden promised to administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days and his team knows they will be swiftly judged by their ability to hit that target.\n Biden has mentioned wanting to prioritize something that could receive bipartisan agreement near the start of his term -- making something like a sweeping infrastructure measure more likely. But with slim majorities in the Senate and House, what Biden prioritizes beyond coronavirus will be a space to watch.\n This plan is only for the first half of Biden's coronavirus response -- focused on rescuing the nation. During his speech on Thursday, Biden said he would unveil his \"Build Back Better\" recovery plan during his first joint session of Congress address in February. That will likely have more permanent changes.\n This stood out as a very un-Trumpian thing for Biden to say: \"There will be stumbles,\" Biden said on Thursday of his Covid plan. \"But I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet.\" Trump would never admit to failings of his own administration.\n So it appears that being the anti-Trump -- at least in tone and tenor -- will likely be one of the easiest promises for Biden to deliver on.\n Getting his Cabinet into place is going to be a major undertaking. Splitting the day is a big lift for the Senate and would surely slow the process of getting Biden's team confirmed. And the Biden team has made clear they want impeachment to get done quickly -- \"Hopefully the trial won't be a lengthy trial,\" incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told The Washington Post today. The subtext is that they want to get this done and move on.",

        "body_text": "The storm system responsible for blizzard conditions across the Plains is headed east as a weaker but still significant weather maker for the long holiday weekend. Meanwhile, record heat and critical fire conditions top the weather headlines for Southern California.\n A Saturday soaker is in store for coastal New England.\n Although there will be enough cold air for high country snowfall across Upstate New York, Northern Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, the major coastal cities from New York to Boston will stay all rain. This could impact driving conditions and your travel time across Interstate 95 as slick spots and slowdowns may be present. Enough cold air could bring a rain and snow mix to DC, but the skies will quickly clear by Sunday morning.\n Colder and dryer air will filter in for the remainder of the extended weekend. However, significant Lake Effect snowfall will be possible in the favored areas downwind from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\n A breezy winter chill is likely for MLK Weekend across the Southeast.\n Light snow showers will blanket the spine of the Appalachians through Monday, but most locations from Atlanta to Charleston will stay dry and cool with plenty of sunshine to enjoy. Get outside and enjoy the pleasant conditions, just be sure to pack a warm jacket and gloves.\n Scattered light snow showers will be possible Saturday and Sunday across the Midwest as an upper level low pressure system slides by and provides just enough moisture to create wintry weather. The Indianapolis National Weather Service warns that motorists should \"take it slow on the roads today as visibilities can change rapidly\" within these snow showers.\n The flurries will gradually come to end through the weekend in places like Chicago and Detroit. Mostly cloudy skies will greet you outside, with just enough breaks in the clouds to keep your sunglasses handy throughout the extended weekend.\n Fortunately, the extreme wind event that blasted the Plains earlier this week has come to an end. A steady northwest breeze will keep wind chills in the teens and single digits for the remainder of your weekend.\n A stubborn area of high pressure anchored across the Great Basin will continue to pump dry and warm air across the Southwest.\n Santa Ana winds will be prevalent in Southern California once again Saturday and will remain gusty through Monday. Red Flag warnings are in effect from Ventura County to Orange County, including the interior valleys and mountains. The Los Angeles National Weather Service warns of \"extreme fire behavior with the potential for rapid fire spread.\"\n A vastly different weather pattern will impact the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies during the holiday weekend. Winter precipitation with mountain snows and cold, valley rains will be prevalent as yet another low pressure system crosses the region by Sunday. Fortunately, it won't rain all weekend in Seattle as a clearing trend should take over as you return from your outdoor adventures on Monday.\n Temperature contrasts will be felt across the country: As the Southwest boils under abnormally warm weather, the Northeast will feel the brunt of winter's coldest month.\n Numerous high temperature records where broken across Southern California on Friday and this will likely happen again through the weekend as offshore winds funnel warm air into the region. Los Angeles set a new record high temperature of 87 degrees on Friday, which it has held since 1976 when the temperature reached 86 degrees at LAX airport.\n Expect temperatures across Southern California to remain in the mid 80's to lower 90's. This will feel like a dream compared to the chilly high temperatures forecast from the mid-Atlantic to New England, where you'll be lucky to see the mercury in the thermometer climb out of the 40's.",

        "title": "Key lines from the unveiling of Biden's science team",
        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday introduced key members of his White House science team, including his nominee for director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n \"These are among the brightest, most dedicated people not only in the country but the world,\" Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware.\n Eric Lander is the President-elect's nominee to lead the OSTP and will serve as a presidential science adviser.\n \"For the first time in history, I'm going to be elevating the presidential science adviser to a Cabinet rank, because we think it's that important,\" Biden said.\n Biden has picked Alondra Nelson as the OSTP deputy director for science and society. He has also chosen Maria Zuber and Frances H. Arnold to serve as co-chairs of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Kei Koizumi will be OSTP chief of staff, while Narda Jones will serve as OSTP legislative affairs director.\n Dr. Francis Collins will stay on as director of the National Institutes of Health.\n Biden described the OSTP and the president's council as \"two of the most extraordinary, least-known departments, especially the last four years, at the White House.\" He said they are \"composed of some of the most brilliant scientific minds in the world.\"\n Biden said when he served as vice president he had an \"intense interest\" in what these departments were working on, \"and I paid enormous attention, and I was like the kid going back to school. I would sit down and say, can you explain to me, and they were, they'd be very patient with me.\"\n Biden said his picks to lead these departments \"represent enormous\u00a0possibilities.\"\n \"They're the ones asking the most\u00a0American of questions: What next?\u00a0What next?\u00a0Never satisfied.\u00a0What next? And what's next is big and\u00a0breathtaking.\u00a0How can, how can we make the impossible possible,\" Biden said.\n Biden said when he announced in 2015 that he would not run for president in the 2016 cycle he had only one regret: \"That I\u00a0wouldn't get to be the president\u00a0to preside over cancer as we\u00a0know it.\"\n \"As president, I'm going to do\u00a0everything I can to get that\u00a0done,\" he said. Biden's son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.\n Biden said addressing cancer would be a priority of his and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and would be a signature issue for incoming first lady Jill Biden.\n Here are key lines from the event introducing key members of Biden's science team:\n \"The President-elect knows that science and technology will be crucial in meeting this moment. And he has tasked us in this letter, I don't mean just his scientific advisers, I mean the whole scientific community and the American public with answering important questions about how science and technology can best be used to advance our health, our economic welfare and our national security. He's asked us to rise to this moment, to draw lessons from the pandemic, to seek bold new climate solutions, to propel technologies that'll create new industries and new jobs, to ensure that the benefits of progress are shared broadly among all Americans, and to nurture, replenish and strengthen the scientific community.\"\n \"For an academic whose work stands at the intersection of technology, science and our social fabric, there is no mistaking the power and meaning of the moment we are living through today. Of course science and technology have permeated nearly every aspect of our lives throughout the course of human history. But perhaps never before in living memory have the connections between our scientific world and our social world been quite so stark as they are today. The Covid-19 crisis has inflicted extraordinary suffering but it has also held up a mirror to our society, reflecting in its deadly wake resource gaps and medical disparities.\"\n \"As a pandemic rages, taking so much and threatening all that we love, we look to science and technology for answers. Technology to stay connected to one another, science to find vaccines and light our path out of darkness. As climate change looms, we look to science and technology once more to save this precious jewel of our planet so that we might pass it on to future generations intact and in good health, as it was passed to us.\"\n \"I am thrilled with the challenge and the opportunity to work together with the scientific leadership of this administration to restore trust in science and pursue breakthroughs that benefit all people. That work is especially critical today as the pandemic continues to rage. Throughout this difficult chapter my colleagues in the life sciences have proven through extraordinary sacrifice and resolve that science and scientists are part of the solution.\"\n Lander served as external co-chair of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology during the Obama administration. He helped lead the Human Genome Project and has been a pioneer in the field of genomic medicine, according to the transition team. He is the president and founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a non-profit biomedical research institute.\n Nelson is the president of the Social Science Research Council and a Harold F. Linder Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study. She serves on the boards of trustees of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Russell Sage Foundation and is on the board of directors of the Teagle Foundation and the Data & Society Research Institute, according to the transition team.\n Arnold was the first American woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018, according to the transition team. She is the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry and is the director of the Rosen Bioengineering Center at the California Institute of Technology.\n Jones served as the senior technology policy adviser and counsel for the Democratic staff of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. She started working in the Senate in 2014 after holding senior roles at the Federal Communications Commission for more than a decade.\n Koizumi serves on the Biden-Harris transition team and previously served as senior adviser for science policy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also worked in the Obama administration as the assistant director for federal research and development and senior adviser to the National Science and Technology Council at OSTP.\n This story has been updated with details from the event.",

At least 14 post offices in the nation's capital will be temporarily closed as well on Inauguration Day.\n The Postal Service removed mailboxes in Washington, DC, during the inauguration of President Trump in 2017 as a safety measure, Partenheimer said.\n The expansion of security measures to other locations across the nation is based on the Postal Service's awareness of \"planned protests or other situations involving large crowds\" in key cities and areas, Partenheimer said.\n States and cities around the country are preparing for unrest ahead of the January 20 inauguration. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has received information indicating \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington, DC, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN.\n CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "Dustin John Higgs was executed in the early hours of Saturday morning becoming the 13th and last federal death row inmate to be executed since the Justice Department restarted federal executions in July 2019. He had been convicted of kidnapping and murdering three women in 1996.\n Higgs maintained his innocence until his death, according to a pool report.\n The tone of his voice was calm but defiant as he said his last words, \"I'd like to say I am an innocent man,\" he said, mentioning the three women by name. \"I did not order the murders,\" the report said.\n Higgs' victims were Tamika Black, 19; Tanji Jackson, 21; and Mishann Chinn, 23.\n Higgs' execution went forward despite his attorney, Shawn Nolan's appeal to delay the proceeding because of Higgs' Covid-19 diagnosis. Nolan also argued that Higgs was unfairly sentenced, since the actual gunman is serving a life sentence.\n Higgs' execution was initially scheduled for the 92nd birthday of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n King's oldest son, Martin Luther King III, wrote an op-ed on Thursday in The Washington Post calling for the end to executions by invoking his father's words from 1957 when asked if God approves of the death penalty. \"I do not think that God approves the death penalty for any crime ... capital punishment is against the better judgment of modern criminology and, above all, against the highest expression of love in the nature of God,\" King said.\n In January 1996, Higgs and two friends drove to Washington, DC, to pick up Black, Jackson, and Chinn, whom Higgs had invited to his apartment in Laurel, Maryland, according to a Department of Justice statement. At the apartment, Jackson rebuffed an advance by Higgs and the women left. Higgs offered the women a ride back to DC, but instead drove to a secluded area in the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge, the statement added.\n He ordered the women out of the vehicle, gave a gun to one of the friends, and said, \"better make sure they're dead.\" The other man shot Black and Jackson in the chest and back, and shot Chinn in the back of the head, killing all three women, the statement said.\n In 2000, a Maryland jury found Higgs guilty of numerous federal offenses, including three counts of first-degree premeditated murder, three counts of first-degree felony murder, and three counts of kidnapping resulting in death, and unanimously recommended nine death sentences, which the court imposed, the statement said.\n Higgs' convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal nearly 17 years ago, and his initial round of collateral challenges failed nearly eight years ago, the statement added.\n Attorney General William Barr resumed federal executions in July 2019 after a 17-year hiatus to bring \"justice to victims of the most horrific crimes.\" The federal government has authorized the executions of 13 federal death row inmates in about six months. While executions are carried out every year on the state level, federal executions have been extremely rare until last year.\n The Biden campaign has spoken out against the federal death penalty, due in part to the amount of wrongfully convicted inmates who have been given these sentences.\n While President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to abolish the federal death penalty and to give incentives to states to stop seeking death sentences as a part of his criminal justice plan, 40 members of Congress want to make sure the practice ends on his first day in office.",

        "title": "Ponsetto is much more representative of America than we care to admit",
        "body_text": "Elliot Williams is a CNN legal analyst. He is a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and a principal at The Raben Group, a national public affairs and strategic communications firm. Follow him on Twitter @elliotcwilliams. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\"How is one girl accusing a guy about a phone a crime?\"\n It's not. But the question, posed by Miya Ponsetto in a rambling CBS \"This Morning\" interview, which aired in two parts last week and on Monday, offers a window into the ways Black people -- even children -- still have to fight for our humanity every day.\n Ms. Ponsetto, 22, falsely accused 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. of stealing her iPhone in a New York City boutique hotel lobby in December. The teenager's father, a Black jazz musician, captured the confrontation in a cell phone video that went viral, and security footage from the hotel showed Ponsetto trying to tackle the teenager. Last week, according to a Ventura County Sheriff's Office news release, Ponsetto was arrested in California on a \"fugitive warrant in connection with a recent assault at a New York City hotel.\"  She has been charged with two counts of attempted assault, New York police said. (A lawyer representing Ponsetto said in a statement that Ponsetto is innocent.)\n She did herself no favors during the interview. In it, she meandered, failed to take responsibility for her actions, rudely cut host Gayle King off, claimed she could not be racist because she, too, is a woman of color, and also cast herself as a victim. (Her attorney at the time noted that she is concerned about Ponsetto's mental health, saying, \"Miya is emotionally unwell, mentally unfit and lacking stability to pursue these interviews.\")  The performance earned her a fair amount of criticism online. Ponsetto is an easy target, but she is little more than a symptom of a bigger problem: the society that produced her and enables dangerous behavior like hers.\n Even if she was not aware of it, her statement about \"one girl accusing a guy about a phone\" is dripping with the racial bias that Black people face daily. Yes, according to Ponsetto, she did approach others at the hotel regarding her phone, and yes, the New York Police Department is not treating this as a case of racial bias. But one cannot look at the video or her explanation of the scene and come away thinking she had any reasoned basis for believing Harrold was a thief or attaching him based on unfounded suspicion. (To be more direct: It's always most natural to blame the Black kid.) She created scenarios that Black people have feared since time immemorial and confront daily: Of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, of being accused of crimes we didn't commit, of our freedom hinging on our word against someone else's.\n Her use of the words \"guy\" and \"girl\" also creates a false equivalence. It's important to remember that she and the victim are not peers: She is a grown woman, speaking about a 14-year-old boy. It's telling that she later minimizes her status, saying \"I'm a 22-year-old girl,\" while elevating his.\n In doing so, she carried on a timeless American tradition. Research published by the American Psychological Association in 2017 found that people see Black men as bigger, stronger, scarier, and more deserving of force than White men, even when they are the same size. In 2014, a study also found that  that they see Black boys as young as 10 as older and less innocent than White boys. Who can forget that terms like \"menacing\" were used to describe 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was gunned down by a police officer at a playground in Cleveland in 2014?\n Thankfully, no one was seriously injured at the hotel in December. But it escalated to physical violence, and there is far less space between a scuffle in a hotel lobby and tragic police shootings than many people might think (or be willing to accept).\n In a way, I envy her brazenness. When deputies tried to pull her over, she continued driving home and refused to get out of the car when they told her they were arresting her -- behavior that would be unthinkable for many Black people. In addition, in the CBS interview, she said that she felt she needed to approach and apprehend the victim because she wanted \"to do [her] part as best as [she] could\" while the hotel manager was checking footage  -- as if a mere hunch that a Black child had wronged her gave her license to put her hands, quite viciously, on him as he tried to get away from her.\n It must be an enormous luxury to go through life with the belief that you are entitled to use violent force when it suits you, and that the law and social order will shield you when you do. May the world never forget that Ahmaud Arbery, 25, is no longer alive because three White men, two of whom were heavily armed, felt empowered to get into their pickup trucks and hunt him down while he was jogging near his home. One of them thought Arbery looked like a Black man suspected of break-ins in the area, and their decision to take the law into their own hands cost Arbery his life. (All three men face malice and felony murder charges and have pleaded not guilty.)\n Though the events took place on a vastly different scale, Ponsetto's behavior also makes total sense with the backdrop of riot at the US Capitol Building last week. It takes a profound sense of entitlement and invincibility to seize the presiding officer's chair in the United States Senate, smile for photos when stealing the Speaker of the House's lectern, or prop a foot up on her desk and leave a threatening note. Even worse -- multiple state elected officials participated in the riot.\n It is an inhumanly unfair world we live in in which people, often White ones, can be so confident that they will face no consequences for such behavior, either from legal authorities or, more tragically, from voters. Their nonchalance and entitlement are as striking as their criminality.\n I live blocks from the Capitol Building. Despite a decade working in law enforcement -- even prosecuting cases for a period on behalf of the US Capitol Police -- I still tense up sometimes when jogging past officers there. I was raised from a young age to keep my hands on the wheel and not make any sudden moves during traffic stops. The various incidents of last week, in different ways, make vividly clear that our society does not force every one of its members into proceeding through their days with such terror and caution.\n It might be easy to mock or discount Ms. Ponsetto. Much about her interview, down to her baseball cap with the word \"Daddy\" embroidered on it, was cringeworthy at best.  But she is far more a representative of America than we might care to admit.",

        "title": "As Trump leaves the stage, Republicans grapple with new conspiracy caucus",
        "body_text": "Donald Trump may be leaving the White House in a few days, but the umbrella of conspiracy theories he inspired is only just arriving in Washington.\n The chief theory known as QAnon -- that the US government is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles only Trump can expose -- began nearly four years ago as a fringe movement in the dark corners of the internet. Now QAnon has adherents in positions of power within the Republican Party and in the halls of Congress.\n The January 6 domestic terror attack on the US Capitol was the violent manifestation of that movement and its attendant theories -- including that the 2020 election was stolen. Thousands of its adherents, steeped in years of conspiracy theories espoused by Trump, stormed the Capitol ready for violence -- seemingly certain they were the ones liberating the country. Many displayed clothing and paraphernalia associated with the movement. One of the more conspicuous rioters, wearing a horned helmet and carrying a six-foot spear, is known online as the \"QAnon Shaman.\"\n \"There is a violent anarchy to QAnon that is baked into it,\" said Mike Rothschild, the author of a book examining and debunking some of the most prominent conspiracy theories.\n How deep into the GOP's infrastructure QAnon has penetrated is an open question. So too is how Trump's departure from the presidency and banishment from most social media will affect the reach of conspiracy within the Republican Party.\n \"This stuff has always been part of the stew,\" said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist in Washington. \"Trump just turned up the heat and brought it to the surface.\"\n The value of courting QAnon, to the extent Republican leaders like Trump considered it, was in delivering votes from a disaffected, passionate base of support. The risk of doing so was that they'd get a seat at the table.\n The House Republican conference now includes two QAnon adherents, freshman Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. While Greene has walked back her support and said the QAnon candidate label \"doesn't represent me,\" she has praised \"Q\" as a patriot and spread baseless conspiracy theories linked to the movement. And though Boebert has claimed she's not a follower and worked to distance herself from the conspiracy theorists, she has said of QAnon, \"I hope that this is real.\"\n Now that they're there, it's going to be much harder to dislodge them.\n \"You can't just push QAnon followers away,\" said Rothschild. \"We've seen, certainly in the Georgia runoff, where these margins are thin, you can't piss off 1 or 2% of your constituents.\"\n QAnon devotion will linger within the GOP long after Trump leaves office.\n For one thing, it's already in the party's farm system. In the 2020 election, dozens of Republican candidates for local races all over the country flirted with the conspiracy theory. Dozens more held adjacent views and carried on other Trump-inspired conspiracy theories, from railing against the alleged fraud of mail-in ballots to wearing masks. Many of these candidates lost races in Democratic-leaning districts, but others, such as the Q-curious Dave Armstrong of the Wisconsin state assembly, won comfortably.\n And now, some of these conspiracy-minded politicians have moved up to the major leagues in Washington.\n \"It's like Trump looked for the most gullible members, found the Freedom Caucus, and decided even they weren't up for the job so he cooked up this mutated QAnon caucus,\" said one GOP operative.\n So far, there's been close to zero pushback against QAnon candidates from national party leaders -- no denial of campaign funding or threats to revoke committee assignments. There's recent precedent for doing so, when House Republicans in 2019 stripped Iowa Rep. Steve King of his committee assignments over his defense of white nationalism. King lost the GOP primary in 2020 in large part because of his banishment by the GOP conference.\n No such fate yet awaits Greene and Boebert. In fact, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, defended both of his new members after their elections in November.\n \"Give them an opportunity before you claim what you believe they have done, and what they will do,\" McCarthy, the top-ranking House Republican, said to reporters. (The GOP operative described McCarthy as \"playing footsie\" with the QAnon-supporting politicians.)\n Others, including Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, have voted against official condemnations of the conspiracy theory. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona has dabbled in conspiracy theories that have been interpreted by QAnon supporters as signals of his allegiance, which he has denied. A staff member for newly-elected Rep. Bob Good of Virginia was among those in Washington on January 6 -- along with her husband, a local Republican Party chairman.\n There are plenty of Republicans in the conference disturbed by the prominence of \"fellow travelers\" of these conspiracy theorists and the long-term impact this will have on the party.\n \"If leadership doesn't hold certain members accountable, there's going to be a real problem,\" one Republican House member told CNN this week.\n Mia Love, a former Republican representative from Utah and a CNN contributor, said failure to deal decisively with toxic members puts the unity of the GOP conference at risk.\n \"Kevin, who I adore, who I have a lot of respect for, the only advice I can give him, if he wants to preserve the conference, he needs to deal with this,\" Love said.\n While the actual members of Congress who are aligned with QAnon is relatively small, the influence of the broader conspiratorial mindset is not. In the end, 147 Republican members in both the House and the Senate, including McCarthy, voted to object and overturn the election results following the assault on the Capitol. That's 56% of all Republicans in Congress.\n \"It's not just that there are some voters that get into this theory and so politicians don't push back. People who are in power embrace it,\" said Seth Masket, a professor of political science at the University of Denver. \"It seems to be a path to success in the Republican Party.\"\n The centrality of Trump to the QAnon theory cannot be overstated, which is why it's an open question as to the movement's staying power. As long as he was the President, however, party leaders have essentially welcomed conspiracy theorists into the coalition.\n Across the GOP, the emergence of QAnon candidates was either gently condemned or tolerated. While Republican House leaders opposed Greene in the competitive GOP primary in Georgia and condemned offensive comments she made about Black people and Jewish donors to the Democratic Party, the National Republican Campaign Committee ended up spending thousands of dollars to support her election. The NRCC also backed Boebert's general election campaign, and both were supported by Trump.\n Whether the conspiracy survives in the next few years as a force in the party depends in part on how much Trump remains on the scene. For years, the President has been a crucial actor in the narrative of QAnon, and experts say it's not certain how believers will factor him in once he's no longer President.\n Emerging in far-right online forums in mid-2017, QAnon presented itself as an outlet for Trump supporters seeking a unifying explanation for setbacks or disappointments in the administration. By the time the coronavirus pandemic was in full swing, QAnon had absorbed much of the far-right conspiracy theories and concerns, says Rothschild.\n \"With the pandemic, everything became about everything,\" he told CNN. \"It turns into Bill Gates, it turns into China, it turns into 5G. This all sort of mushes together and it becomes impossible to separate.\"\n Once Trump began ramping up in his own false conspiracy theorizing about a \"stolen election,\" there was a ready and willing community of people online ready to subsume those lies and act on them. Republican and conservative allies of the President amplifying his false election claims gave more legitimacy to a movement of people who did not just believe in a conspiracy -- they were preparing to fight against it.\n But the January 6 assault on the Capitol showed Republicans and the country the consequences of tolerating conspiracy theories without fully understanding them or justifying the threat of danger from them. For some, it was a wake-up call that the contagion had spread and could not be contained.\n But enough of a wake-up call? The slipperiness of \"support\" for QAnon means politicians -- even Greene and Boebert -- maintain the plausible deniability that they aren't aligned with the violent end of QAnon.\n \"To the extent it shows up in Congress, it's mostly in the form of 'just asking questions' or 'providing a voice' on behalf of constituents,\" said Donovan. \"For those where this is a vocal constituency there's little incentive to confront the people who are voting for you. So I suspect it will be laissez-faire in most cases until another instance where it rears its head and can't be ignored.\"",

        "body_text": "Rescue workers on Indonesia's Sulawesi island continued the grim search for survivors trapped in rubble on Saturday, after a 6.2-magnitude earthquake flattened buildings -- including a hospital -- and left at least 46 people dead.\n The island continues to be rattled by aftershocks, including a 5.0-magnitude quake early Saturday, with authorities warning more are expected.\n Officers from Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are being sent to the island to monitor seismic activity, the agency's head Daryono -- who uses only one name -- told CNN.\n \"This area is really fragile and risky in terms of earthquakes and tsunamis,\" he said.\n Thirty-seven people died in Friday's quake in the city of Mamuju, to the north of the epicenter, while another nine were killed in Majene, a city about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mamuju. Thousands of residents fled their homes to seek safety, but many are still trapped under collapsed buildings, according to local search and rescue teams.\n At least 189 people were seriously hurt and another 637 suffered minor injuries, said Raditya Jati, from Indonesia's National Board for Disaster Management. The quake also triggered a power outage and caused three landslides along the main road connecting Majene and Mamuju.\n Ariyanto Ardi, section head of the local disaster management department, said teams are now working to free people trapped under collapsed buildings in multiple locations across Mamuju -- including two hotels and a hospital. \"People reporting that their family members are trapped under collapsed houses and asking for our help,\" he told CNN.\n \"We still have no details how many people are buried under those flattened buildings,\" he added.\n One woman -- who gave her name as Angel -- was freed from the rubble Friday and taken to hospital, Ardi said.\n The quake has created an additional headache for a nation already battling a serious coronavirus outbreak, with more than 882,000 reported Covid-19 cases nationwide, and at least 25,000 related deaths.\n Dr. Indahwati Nursyamsi, director of West Sulawesi Central Hospital, told CNN the hospital's 19 severe Covid-19 patients were moved to a local mosque to keep them separate from those hurt in the quake.\n The hospital also erected a large tent and tarpaulin to accommodate those displaced or too scared to go back to their homes, she said Friday.\n Straddling the so-called Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" Indonesia -- a nation of high tectonic activity -- is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2018, a 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands of people.\n CNN's Nectar Gan contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "David Hasselhoff is auctioning off his personal K.I.T.T. car, a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am styled after the iconic car used in his 1980s television series \"Knight Rider.\"\n The vehicle is similar to the K.I.T.T. car used by his character Michael Knight, but it was not used in television production, according to the auction site. Unfortunately, this version of the car does not talk.\n \"The sleek, black K.I.T.T. car is fully functional with the brilliantly colorful illuminated dash and console that would be immediately identifiable to Knight Rider fans,\" according to Diligent Auctions, which is handling the sale.\n The current bid for the car is nearly $500,000, exceeding the predicted estimate of $175,000 to $300,000. As an added bonus, if the winning bid is 25% over the reserve price, the 68-year-old actor will personally deliver the car to the new owner.\n If car is out of your price range, also up for auction is a toy pedal version of the car autographed by Hasselhoff. It is currently listed for more than $1,000, above the $400-$500 pre-auction estimate. The auction site notes that it \"needs a little TLC to work properly.\"\n The car is part of an auction of memorabilia by Hasselhoff that includes wardrobe, awards, scripts, toys and autographed items from his acting career. The auction ends on January 23.\n \"Knight Rider\" aired on NBC for four seasons from 1982-1986. Hasselhoff was the main character but  the car was as much a star of the show as he was. In the series, K.I.T.T. was a supercomputer-powered car that was voice-activated, autonomous and equipped with advanced surveillance technology that helped it detect nearby obstacles.\n K.I.T.T. stood for Knight Industries Two Thousand and helped Hasselhoff's character hunt down criminals for a group called the Foundation for Law and Government. Actor William Daniels was the voice of the car.",

        "title": "A former White supremacist store and Ku Klux Klan meeting space is being turned into a community center to promote healing",
        "body_text": "A South Carolina preacher and local resident are turning what once was a Ku Klux Klan meeting place into a community center dedicated to educating and fighting against racial injustice.\n Deep in Laurens stands the historic Echo Theater, perched in between diners and cafes bustling with customers and '50s music that can be heard from the street.\n But that building carries a history much darker than the cheerful life that surrounds it.\n In 1996, the once segregated movie theater became home to the Redneck Shop, a White supremacist store that sold White nationalist and neo-Nazi paraphernalia, Klans robes and Confederate memorabilia up until its forced closure in 2012.\n Owned by KKK members John Howard and Michael Burden, the building also became the self-proclaimed \"World's Only Klan Museum\" and the meeting spot for several white nationalist groups, including the National Socialist Movement (NSM), the largest neo-Nazi organization in the country, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n Now, the theater is being renovated by the Echo Project, an organization founded in 2019 by Laurens-area resident Regan Freeman and local Black preacher, Rev. David Kennedy. The organization plans to turn the theater into a community center and racial reconciliation museum.\n \"We don't want to just have a museum to tell this story, the struggle for justice, and the fight against the Klan, but we also want to detail what happened here to make sure it never happens again,\" Freeman told CNN.\n \"The Echo Theater went from being a segregated movie theater to a literal Klan's store to being in the possession of a Black minister, and it is about to become a place for reconciliation, justice and healing.\"\n When the Redneck Shop opened, Kennedy, the leader of the New Beginnings Missionary Baptist Church, chose to stand against the KKK and demand for the store to be closed.\n \"To be a Black person in America, I have too many stories to share that people wouldn't believe,\" Kennedy, 67, told CNN. \"Once you choose to speak out, people become fearful of us, and you have to be ready to sacrifice your mind, your heart, your soul, to tell the truth about history and what they did to our people. I was ready to make that sacrifice.\"\n When Kennedy began his fight against the Redneck Shop, the preacher became a target by the KKK, who considered killing him for a period of time.\n But when Howard and Burden had a falling out, Kennedy said he protected Burden, even though he was a Klansman, by providing him and his family with food, shelter, a place to worship.\n And so an unexpected friendship was born -- and their story was made into a 2018 film called \"Burden.\"\n However, Burden's agreement required that Howard would be allowed to run the Redneck Shop until he died -- a deal Kennedy fought in the courts for 15 years.\n \"The shop closed in 2012 because a judge ruled that New Beginnings was the official owner of the Redneck Shop because of that deed the Klansman gave to Rev. Kennedy,\" Freeman said. \"And it was all because Kennedy.\"\n Freeman grew up in Clinton, just 15 miles away from the notorious Redneck Shop, which he passed by frequently without questioning what went on behind its closed doors.\n In 2018, while he was completing his last year at the University of South Carolina, Freeman began to wonder what the shop really was.\n For months, he said he dug through records, photographs and archives from the past two decades, desperate to discover the truth behind the store that attracted hooded Klan members and Neo-Nazis for all those years.\n Eventually he got his hands on piles of Howard's belongings, which included posters of Adolf Hitler and a Klans business card they would give to Black families to scare them. The card said the KKK was making a social visit and warned them not to \"make the next visit a business call.\"\n \"What's really horrifying is that what happened in that building isn't even ancient news,\" Freeman said. \"The Redneck Shop was the meeting hall and recruitment center of the American Nazi party from 2007 to 2012, when the shop closed. The White supremacists that resided in this shop were promoting hatred and evil, things that bring to tears to my eyes just thinking about it, and it was all in the past decade or two.\"\n Now the executive director of the Echo Project, Freeman has raised over $375,000 from thousands of donors to begin renovating and transforming the former home of White supremacy and racism into a shrine of remembrance and reconciliation.\n The museum will display artifacts from the Redneck Shop, and Howard's belongings that Freeman uncovered. The center will also have classroom to engage with the community.\n \"You have to stand up for what is right regardless of what the consequences are, how long it takes, or who stands in your way,\" Kennedy said. \"We are warriors, full of love and full of forgiveness, but we will always fight, even if it means dying for our communities.\"",

        "title": "Trump's final full week in office ends with the nation in disarray ",
        "body_text": "The final full week of Donald Trump's presidency ended with a nation in disarray -- fearful about the threats surrounding Inauguration Day in a capital city that has become a fortress; unsettled by new details of the harm that rioters could have inflicted on lawmakers during last week's insurrection; and angry at the revelation that the administration's pledge to release a reserve of Covid-19 vaccine doses was hollow.\n In the midst of those grave security threats and the frustrating news that there is no such vaccine reserve, the President was still conspicuously missing in action at the White House Friday. It was Vice President Mike Pence who was seen doing the work normally required of a commander-in-chief -- from visiting the National Guard troops guarding the Capitol to making the long-delayed phone call to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to offer assistance in the presidential transition.\n The President met on Friday with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who was captured by a Washington Post photographer outside the West Wing carrying notes with references to the lie that the election was stolen and the possible implementation of martial law -- which Trump has discussed while indulging his fantasy that he could overturn the election. Trump also drilled his staff about the 20 House Republicans who voted to impeach him this week, inquiring about whether they could be challenged during the midterm primaries in 2022, according to CNN's Jim Acosta.\n Trump's narcissistic detachment from the grief and fear gripping the nation, while all too familiar, was no less breathtaking in his final days after four years in which he has shirked the most solemn duties of the presidency. After these last days characterized by incompetence, poor planning, negligence and Trump's utter lack of contrition for the mob he incited to attack the Capitol, America finally seems ready to see him head for the exits.\n His political capital has cratered. A Pew Research Center poll released Friday showed that 54% of Americans want to see Trump removed from office and 68% said they don't want to see him continue to be a major national political figure in the years to come. His overall approval rating fell to 29%, the lowest it has ebbed during his presidency in the Pew poll.\n As Trump makes little effort to quiet the nerves of a rattled nation, details of what unfolded during last week's Capitol siege have become more unsettling by the day as federal authorities have raced to apprehend the most dangerous rioters while warning of plots for more violence next week when President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated.\n Chilling new video shows the threats that rioters hurled at a Black Capitol Police officer as they chased him up the stairs on the Senate side of the US Capitol, while he skillfully diverted them away from the doors of the chamber where lawmakers were huddled in fear for their lives.\n The Washington Post was the first to report Friday that Pence and his family were whisked to safety in a nearby room mere seconds before Eugene Goodman led the mob away from some of the nation's top elected officials to another corridor where other officers arrived as backup. Pence was clearly a top target in the riot; widely circulated video has shown the rioters chanting \"hang Mike Pence\" as they stormed the Capitol after Trump turned on his vice president by erroneously suggesting that he could have abandoned his duties and changed the outcome of the presidential election.\n In a new court filing, federal prosecutors said rioter Jacob Anthony Chansley \u2014 who was recognizable in pictures because of his face paint, headdress and the six-foot spear that he carried into the Capitol -- stood at the dais where Pence had been that morning and then ominously wrote a note that said, \"It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"\n Friday also brought unnerving new accounts from the police officers of the attacks they endured as they faced down the mob. DC Metropolitan Officer Michael Fanone recounted to CNN how rioters grabbed for his gear as he was down on the ground injured after being Tasered several times in the back of the neck.\n \"Some guys started getting a hold of my gun and they were screaming out, 'Kill him with his own gun,'\" Fanone, an officer for nearly two decades, told CNN.\n Officer Daniel Hodges, who was captured on camera during the riot getting crushed by a door as rioters surrounded him, described how a guy ripped off his mask, wrested his baton away and beat him with it.\n \"He was practically foaming at the mouth so just, these people were true believers in the worst way,\" Hodges told CNN.\n On Friday, Justice Department prosecutors formally walked back their assertion in a court filing from the day before that said Capitol rioters sought to \"capture and assassinate elected officials.\"\n But authorities continue to investigate hundreds of people in connection with the riot as they try to stave off possible violence next week.\n In response to DOJ's initial assertion, GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska called on the American people Friday to pay attention to the dangers that the insurrectionists posed, noting that \"rage-peddlers\" are trying \"to whitewash the attack on the Capitol, saying that a few bad apples got out of control.\"\n \"These men weren't drunks who got rowdy \u2014 they were terrorists attacking this country's constitutionally-mandated transfer of power,\" Sasse said in a statement. \"They failed, but they came dangerously close to starting a bloody constitutional crisis. They must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The FBI is investigating widespread calls for violence across the country and every American has an obligation to lower the temperature.\"\n While Americans are still trying to come to terms with the terrifying attack on their democracy, hopes of quickly stamping out the coronavirus pandemic are fading as governors across the country struggle to get the vaccine to those who need it most, hamstrung by the absence of a national plan, an insufficient number of doses to meet the demand, and a lack of resources from the federal government to distribute it.\n Biden outlined his own plan to accelerate distribution of the Covid-19 vaccines on Friday. Though his proposal was short on details, he said he would expand eligibility for those 65 and up to get vaccinated -- a step the Trump administration also encouraged this week. He also said his administration would create more sites such as community vaccination centers and mobile vaccination clinics, expand the workforce of health care workers and offer more transparency to states about how many doses they will be receiving.\n But several governors said they were furious Friday after learning that the federal government has no reserve of additional Covid-19 vaccine doses to distribute -- days after Trump administration officials announced with much fanfare that they planned to release a reserve of second doses to make more vaccine available to those 65 and older.\n Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said on Twitter that governors were told repeatedly by the Department of Health and Human Services that there was \"a strategic reserve of vaccines, and this week, the American people were told it'd be released to increase supply of the vaccine.\"\n \"It appears now that no reserve exists. The Trump administration must answer immediately for this deception,\" Inslee tweeted.\n During a news conference, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown -- also a Democrat -- said she was \"shocked and appalled\" that the Trump administration set an expectation earlier this week, knowing that they could not deliver on it.\n \"Their empty promises are literally playing with people's lives,\" Brown said. \"While the Trump administration pulled the rug out from under us like a cruel joke, let me assure you that Oregon's priorities, and my priorities have not changed. ... I remain committed to vaccinating our seniors quickly. But this failure by the Trump administration will unfortunately cause a two-week delay in beginning vaccinations for seniors quickly.\"\n Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, noted at a news conference that he has \"been frustrated at times beyond belief\" at the Trump administration during the course of the pandemic, but the revelation about the lack of a reserve is \"so far beyond the pale\" that it is \"almost unimaginable,\" he said.\n \"Where did they go?\" he said of the doses that were to be held in reserve. \"Who is going to be prosecuted for this?\"\n \"I have 2.1 million of you in line, and they gave us 60,000 (vaccine doses),\" Walz said Friday. \"I can't go and buy (vaccine doses) somewhere. I can't beg them from somewhere. I can't even have them shipped directly to me.\"\n \"It's a catastrophe -- what they've done,\" he said.\n Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- who submitted his resignation letter this week without mentioning the nearly 400,000 US Covid deaths \u2014 confirmed in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt Friday that there is no \"reserve stockpile\" of doses available to send out.\n \"We now have enough confidence that our ongoing production will be quality and available to provide the second dose for people, so we're not sitting on a reserve anymore,\" Azar said. \"We've made that available to the states to order.\"\n Pfizer has told CNN it has vaccine doses on hand to ship when they are requested by the federal government. \"We are working around the clock to produce millions more each day,\" the company said in a statement.",

        "body_text": "President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have dropped a playlist to keep your at-home celebration in tune with the upcoming inauguration's \"America United\" theme.\n The 46 songs feature artists from across the music spectrum to honor the 46th President taking the oath of office.\n The playlist is part of the Presidential Inaugural Committee's push to provide opportunities for Americans to participate in the inauguration from home after the Covid-19 pandemic forced them to scale back traditional events, like the parade.\n \"During a tumultuous year that has kept so many loved ones apart, music has been a consistent vehicle that has kept us connected. Whether you are a country soul, a jazz enthusiast, a hip hop head, a classical sort, or just love that old-time rock and roll, music clarifies, inspires, unites, and heals,\" Presidential Inaugural Committee CEO Tony Allen said.\n You can listen to the playlist on streaming services Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. There's also a special mix of the playlist on SoundCloud.\n The inaugural committee teamed with DJ D-Nice and Raedio -- actress, writer, producer Issa Rae's record label -- to curate the collection of songs.\n The result is an eclectic mix of artists, from Led Zeppelin and The Doobie Brothers to Kendrick Lamar, Sza and Major Lazer.\n The Biden-Harris campaign's celebratory theme song, \"Higher Love\" by Kygo and Whitney Houston, is also in the mix.\n \"These songs and artists reflect the relentless spirit and rich diversity of America. They are the score to a new chapter and will help bring people together as the Biden-Harris Administration begins its important work to unite our country,\" Allen said.\n Raedio President Benoni Tagoe said the company was honored to create the playlist. \"We know that music has the power to bring people together, and after a year of national challenges and division, we hope this collection serves as an indication of a new beginning, positive change and a reminder that music of all types is a common language.\"\n The Presidential Inaugural Committee is also producing a prime-time television special the night of the inauguration.\n The special, hosted by Tom Hanks, is set to air live on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC from 8:30 to 10 p.m. EST on January 20. It will feature performances from Jon Bon Jovi, who campaigned with Biden in Pennsylvania, Demi Lovato, Justin Timberlake and Ant Clemons.\n The 90-minute program, titled, \"Celebrating America,\" will also feature remarks from Biden and Harris and will celebrate \"American heroes\" like frontline workers, teachers and health care workers.\n CNN's Arlette Saenz, Sarah Mucha and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Supreme Court's liberal justices lash out at unprecedented 'rush' of executions as Trump leaves office",
        "body_text": "As the country focused on the aftermath of riots in the US Capitol and the unprecedented second impeachment of President Donald Trump, the liberal justices of the Supreme Court spent Trump's last full week in office battling his administration's long-term objective to execute 13 federal death row inmates in six months.\n Late Friday night, over the fiery objection of two Supreme Court justices, Dustin John Higgs became the 13th federal inmate to be put to death. It marked the last federal execution to take place under the Trump administration that announced in July 2019 that it was reinstating the federal death penalty after a nearly two-decade pause. Then-Attorney General William Barr said that his office owed it to the victims and their families to carry forward sentences imposed by the justice system.\n But Justice Stephen Breyer -- the only sitting justice who believes the court should reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty -- and Justice Sonia Sotomayor lashed out in a late-night order that recounted details of all the executions.\n \"This is not justice,\" Sotomayor wrote, noting that Higgs was the third federal execution in a week and the 13th overall.\n Turning her attention to all of the executions Sotomayor wrote: \"To put that in historical context, the Federal Government will have executed more than three times as many people in the last six months than it had in the previous six decades.\"\n She said the government should have proceeded with \"some measure of restraint\" instead of moving with an \"unprecedented rush\" amid questions concerning the Justice Department's drug protocol, the Federal Death Penalty Act and other disputes.\n She also turned her attention to her conservative colleagues who she said have \"repeatedly sidestepped\" their usual deliberative processes, allowing the government \"to push forward with an unprecedented, breakneck timetable of executions.\"\n She walked through many of the claims presented and how lower court judges had at times ruled in favor of the inmates only to be overturned. She noted particularly that back in December both inmate Corey Johnson and Higgs, both executed this week, tested positive for Covid-19.\n \"There can be no 'justice on the fly' in matters of life and death,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"Yet the Court has allowed the United States to execute thirteen people in six months under a statutory scheme and regulatory protocol that have received inadequate scrutiny, without resolving the serious claims the condemned individuals raised,\" she said.\n While saying she \"respectfully\" dissented, she added, \"Those whom the Government executed during this endeavor deserved more from this Court.\"\n As for Breyer, now the most senior liberal on the court, he named each of the inmates. He noted that a lower court judge held that Higgs had significant lung damage and executing him by injection of pentobarbital would \"subject him to a sensation of drowning akin to waterboarding\" because of his Covid-19 infection.\n Breyer said the court needed to address a myriad of questions including whether the government's protocol risks extreme pain and needless suffering. He said that all of the claims brought -- many last-minute -- were not frivolous.\n \"What are courts to do when faced with legal questions of this kind?\" he asked. \"Are they supposed to 'hurry up, hurry up?\" He again called for a reconsideration of the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.\n Justice Elena Kagan also dissented but chose not to join Sotomayor or Breyer or explain her thinking separately.\n Late Friday the conservative justices chose not to write, although the issue concerning the death penalty, in general, has triggered vigorous debates between the justices in the past.\n In December 2019, the court denied an appeal by the government when a District Court judge temporarily blocked the federal government from carrying out executions. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, agreed to deny the emergency application but said he thought the government was \"very likely\" to ultimately prevail in what Alito called \"exceptionally heinous murders.\" He urged the appeals court to proceed with \"appropriate dispatch\" to move forward with the case.\n In its final appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall told the justices that Higgs had received nine sentences of death in 2001 \"in connection with the cold-blooded murder of three women on federal land near the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.\" He said that a lower court that had put the execution on hold was \"unprecedented and untenable\" and that the execution should be allowed to go forward.\n \"As this Court has repeatedly emphasized,\" Wall wrote,\" both the government and the victims of crime have an important interest in the timely enforcement of a death sentence.\"",

        "title": "CES is a fantasyland of futuristic products. This year it was dominated by our bleak present",
        "body_text": "CES, the closely-watched annual consumer electronics show, often sets the tone for the tech trends of the year \u2014 but little did I realize how true that would be last year.\n On the flight home from Las Vegas in January 2020, I wrote a piece for CNN Business about how the technology of the future paints a very lonely picture for all of us. I had just seen robots who call 911 when you fall down, mechanical companion cats that keep you company and \"artificial humans\" from startup Neon able to do the same.\n Two months later, my New York neighborhood became one of the first in the country to go into lockdown; and it's been just as long since I've been able to hug some of the people I love the most. A virtual reality trip to the Amalfi Coast with them would be a welcomed change to our routine FaceTime check-ins, not quite the unusual concept I thought it was just a year ago.\n If loneliness was the unspoken theme of CES 2020, this year's all-digital event was rife with anxiety and stress, both the everyday variety and the kind specific to the current health crisis. At the event, which took place online this week, there was the wearable for the ears that claims its gentle vibrations regulate stress; the small smart storage box with a fingerprint scanner to lock up your pill supply or credit cards; the bigger lock box that keeps porch pirates from stealing your Amazon packages; a pad for the car seat that sends an alert if you forget your child in the backseat; and the robot that loads your dishwasher.\n The robot, Samsung's Bot Handy, is only in development for now, but it's the company's vision for \"a better new normal,\" as more people work, cook, eat and drown in dishes at home than ever during the global pandemic. As seen in a video, Bot Handy sets the table, pours wine and reminds you of upcoming meetings.\n \"The technologies in your home need to work harder to help you adjust to this new normal,\" the company said in its session description on the CES website.\n And then there were the masks. There was one with built-in earbuds and microphones to make calls, and another to monitor air quality. AirPop Active+ Smart Mask monitors and filters the air around you, blocking dust, allergens and microbial particles. It lets you know when you need a new filter and tracks your breathing with its sensors.\n Perhaps the harrowing takeaway from CES this year is that we're not okay, but maybe technology can help.\n Executives and thought leaders met virtually to offer solutions to the challenges many industries currently face. A session on the future of contactless payments, with a description on the website that led with \"The less you touch, the safer you'll be,\" discussed how retailers can ride the momentum of the booming trend far past the pandemic. Another on the challenges of remote learning debated what's next for future classrooms, and whether certain tech tools could make telemedicine visits more meaningful.\n \"We live in a time when most of the things we once took for granted now seem like distant memories,\" said Brian Kwon, CEO of LG Electronics, in a video ahead of the company's presentation. \"Life has changed in so many unexpected ways. While our approach to life may be different now, we persevere.\"\n Not exactly the upbeat speech you normally expect to hear at a product launch.\n Apple, which often makes headlines at CES without actually attending, used this week to reveal more details about its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. Launched in June following the news and protests around the death of George Floyd, the company announced where more of its funds will go to help address systemic racism and create more opportunities for communities of color.\n CES 2021 still had its share of fun innovation: the rollable phone, the transparent TV, Cadillac's self-driving party bus concept, to name only a few. But the tech that resonated most reflected our current bleak world, at a time when many of us are trying to just get through the day.\n The self-driving party bus will be an excellent way to celebrate the end of the pandemic whenever that time finally comes, but for now, all I really want is that Keurig-like machine for soft-serve ice cream to soothe my soul while I wait things out at home.",

        "body_text": "A group of middle school students in Pennsylvania is sending appreciation notes to workers and officers on Capitol Hill to thank them for their service in the aftermath of the violent attack last week.\n The students, who attend Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy in Bryn Mawr, asked their teachers if there was anything they could do to help the Capitol officers who protected lawmakers and the maintenance workers who cleaned up in the aftermath of the insurrection on January 6.\n The idea came to the students as they reflected on the events and tried to make sense of the headlines and video footage that gripped the nation, said Chris Farrell, director of the middle school.\n School administrators told CNN that teachers at the Jewish day school -- which is for students in grades 6-12 -- encouraged students to ask questions and helped guide discussion around the event.\n \"Middle school students reflected on prayers in our liturgy that are said daily and weekly for our country and our government,\" Farrell told CNN. \"They were encouraged to think about a personal prayer or note of thanks for our government leaders, those protecting the Capitol and our democracy, as well as the workers who had to restore order in the aftermath, as a beginning of a call to action.\"\n The middle schoolers discussed the insurrection through its historical and political context in their history and civics classes. But they also reflected on the crucial moment using Jewish tradition, Farrell said.\n \"Seeing this kind of racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism on display during the Capitol riots really stirred some of our students up as a call to action to spread kindness and appreciation,\" Rabbi Judd Levingston, director of Jewish Studies at Barrack, told CNN.\n Although students were concerned about seeing photographs of rioters in shirts with messages such as \"Camp Auschwitz,\" Farrell said that they \"faced that head on and spoke to how that has to change.\"\n \"I am so gratified that in a time of pandemic, protest and what happened at the Capitol, our students (at Barrack) still have faith in working toward justice,\u00a0gratitude and 'tikkun olam,' helping to repair the world,\" Farrell added. \"There is work still to be done. They recognize and acknowledge that and are willing to take that on.\"\n Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean, who represents many of the students and their families, will deliver the prayers and notes of gratitude to Capitol officers and maintenance workers at the Capitol building next week, school administrators said.",

        "title": "Harris to be sworn in as vice president by Justice Sonia Sotomayor",
        "body_text": "Kamala Harris will be sworn in Wednesday as the next vice president of the United States by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, according to a Harris aide.\n Harris will make history as the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president, and she will be sworn in by the first Hispanic and third female justice in US Supreme Court history. Sotomayor was nominated by President Barack Obama to the high court and has served since 2009.\n The vice president-elect will take her oath of office using two Bibles; one that previously belong to a former neighbor and family friend of Harris,' Regina Shelton, and another that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court, the aide said.\n ABC News was first to report the Bibles and that Sotomayor would swear Harris in.\n Harris has described Shelton as a second mother to her, and she and her sister Maya often visited Shelton's house after school while their mother, the late Shyamala Gopalan, was still at work as a breast cancer researcher. Shelton lived two doors down from Harris' home. Harris used Shelton's Bible to take the oath of office to be attorney general of California and later to become a United States senator.\n \"In office and into the fight, I carry Mrs. Shelton with me always,\" Harris wrote in an op-ed for Bustle about Shelton titled, \"Without This Woman, I Wouldn't Be The Senator I Am Today.\"\n \"Mrs. Shelton would bring her Bible to church every Sunday,\" Harris wrote. \"Sitting alongside her, I was introduced to the teachings of that Bible. My earliest memories were of a loving God, a God who asked us to 'speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves' and to 'defend the rights of the poor and needy.' This is where I learned that 'faith' is a verb, something we must live and demonstrate through our actions.\"\n Harris has often said that Marshall was one of the inspirations for her legal career and has described him as a \"childhood hero of mine.\"\n The vice president-elect said in a video posted to Twitter in July, \"Thurgood Marshall and the work that he did is ... really one of the main reasons I wanted to be a lawyer. Thurgood was a fighter, he was a boxer in the courtroom.\"\n \"As a daughter of parents who were active in the civil rights movement, I knew that the fight for civil rights, the fight for equality, the fight for justice is going to take place in many ways, but one of the most significant ways (is) by lawyers understanding the power of their advocacy to make change and to make reform happen,\" Harris continued.\n President-elect Joe Biden and Harris will take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol during a significantly scaled-down event on January 20.\n Authorities are bracing for more extremist violence in the coming days after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed and breached the US Capitol on January 6 in a violent riot that left five people dead. The National Park Service announced Friday that the National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day due to security concerns.\n Asked about the safety concerns taking the oath outside, Harris told NPR in an interview: \"I think we cannot yield to those who would try and make us afraid of who we are.\"\n Biden's inaugural committee will be hosting several virtual events surrounding the inauguration, including a virtual parade after the swearing-in ceremony on Inauguration Day in part to keep crowds to a minimum amid the coronavirus pandemic.",

        "title": "University of Maryland reaches $3.5 million settlement with football player Jordan McNair's family",
        "body_text": "The University of Maryland has reached a $3.5 million settlement with the family of Jordan McNair, the offensive lineman who died after suffering heatstroke during a team workout in 2018.\n The details of the settlement became known Friday as part of the meeting agenda for the Maryland Board of Public Works, which is expected to approve the agreement on January 27.\n \"This has been a long and painful fight, but we will attempt to find closure even though this is a wound that will never, ever fully heal,\" Jordan's parents, Marty McNair and Tonya Wilson, said in a joint statement, according to ESPN.\n McNair, 19, died on June 13, weeks after taking part in an off-season conditioning session at Maryland's turf outdoor practice field in late May.\n An independent medical report found several issues with his treatment, including failure to assess his vital signs, not having proper cooling devices and failure to recognize quickly he was having heat illness. More than an hour passed before a football trainer called 911 after McNair first showed symptoms of heatstroke.\n \"We are focused on honoring Jordan's legacy so that his death was not in vain. This includes protecting student athletes of all levels of competition, increasing awareness, education, and prevention of all heat-related illnesses, empowering student athletes, and introducing legislation nationwide so that no parent should have to wait this long for closure where their child has been treated unfairly or unjustly,\" the parents' statement to ESPN added.\n On May 29, 2018, McNair was taken from the field, where the air temperature was 81 degrees, at 5:22 p.m. That was 34 minutes after he said he was having cramps and was bending over at the waist, according to the report.\n About 28 minutes after he was taken from the field, McNair's mood dramatically worsened -- a sign of heatstroke -- and a trainer called the team doctor, who advised calling 911, the report said.\n In August 2018, Athletic Director Damon Evans and then-university President Wallace D. Loh apologized to McNair's family during a meeting in Baltimore. Loh had said he told the family the \"university accepts legal and moral responsibility for the mistakes that our training staff made on that fateful workout day.\"\n \"The university owes you an apology. You entrusted Jordan to our care, and he is never returning home,\" he added.\n And D.J. Durkin, who was the head coach at Maryland when McNair died was fired in October 2018 by Loh.\n \"This is not at all a reflection of my opinion of Coach Durkin as a person. However, a departure is in the best interest of the university,\" Loh had said.\n Since McNair's death, the university has added cooling stations, started testing players' hydration at practice, increased the length of breaks, put more trainers and doctors at events. Staff have also received more training.\n CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report",

        "title": "How Joe Biden was Donald Trump's kryptonite",
        "body_text": "President Donald Trump seemed to be a teflon president. It didn't matter how big things seem to get  -- Trump's political career seemed to be impermeable. That was until Trump ran into President-elect Joe Biden.\n Now, Trump is just days away from leaving office and Biden is about to be inaugurated.\n Biden proved to be Trump's kryptonite and helped himself tremendously by doing something very simple: allowing Trump to be Trump. The President hogged the spotlight as he worried about Biden potentially defeating him.\n Some of the lowest points for Trump over the last two years revolved around Biden.\n First, there was the 2019 impeachment of Trump. It largely stemmed from him wanting Ukraine's president to investigate Biden ahead of the 2020 election.\n Biden didn't do anything directly to cause Trump to commit the actions that led to his impeachment. Biden had merely announced he was running for president earlier that year.\n Trump likely was looking at polling data that showed Biden, among the top contenders in the Democratic primary, was beating Trump in a general election matchup by the most and was better liked than Trump's 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n What perhaps Trump didn't realize was that he was playing right into Biden's hands. His efforts seem to prove an important point for Biden: Biden was the Democrat Trump feared most at a time when Democrats were more likely than ever to prioritize electability over issue agreement.\n Democrats got the message Trump was sending and nominated Biden.\n Second, Biden defeated Trump in his re-election attempt. Biden did so by doing minimal campaigning, as Trump seemingly went everywhere during the coronavirus pandemic.\n Trump appeared in the top paragraph of stories nearly 80% of the time that had either Biden or Trump in them during the general election campaign, according to NewsLibrary.com. Inversely, Biden was in a little more than 20%. The same measurement found Trump was only in about 60% of them during the 2016 general election campaign in a similar reading of Clinton vs. Trump media mentions.\n (Note: Barack Obama outpaced Mitt Romney in media mentions during the 2012 general election campaign by a similar margin to Trump's 2016 ratio.)\n Biden seemed to learn the lesson of Clinton's campaign. Studies showed that Trump polled best when the media spotlight was not on him because he is not a popular politician. His best path to winning was by making the contest a lesser of two evils in the eyes of voters, which he failed to do in 2020.\n Third, Trump was impeached a second time after an insurrection that he incited last week over outrage of the 2020 election results. Trump just couldn't seem to believe that he lost the election to Biden, which many of his supporters couldn't as well.\n During the transition period, Biden has been actively planning his presidency and not spending too much time publicly worrying about Trump's false claims of voter fraud.\n Trump hasn't taken a backseat like most outgoing presidents during the transition timeframe. Instead, his false diatribes of voter fraud dominated the media landscape in the post-election period, despite the fact that his term as president is over on January 20.\n Trump it seems, couldn't stand not to be the center of attention, which is unusual for an outgoing president.\n For example, so far since December 20, Trump got about 70% of the news mentions. To give you an idea of how unusual that is, every single outgoing president in the internet era (since Bill Clinton in 2001) had gotten fewer media mentions than the president-elect in the month leading up to inauguration.\n The end result of all of this is that Biden goes into his administration this week with the vast majority of voters approving of Biden's handling of the transition.\n Meanwhile, Trump's overall approval rating has dropped below 40%, the worst for any president after one term and his approval rating among Republicans has dipped below the 80% mark for the first time in a long time.\n Biden, it seems, not only won the election, but he won the transition period as well.",

        "body_text": "Colorado health officials will resume their review of a program allowing ketamine to be administered outside of hospital settings, an investigation initially announced after the death of Elijah McClain in police custody.\n The 23-year-old Black man died in August 2019 after paramedics administered the powerful anesthetic during a confrontation with police. A grand jury investigation into McClain's death was announced earlier this month.\n The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) first announced the ketamine program review last summer, about a year after McClain's death, before \"pausing activities to reassess the scope, in deference to other investigations,\" the agency said in a news release Friday.\n Without reviewing individual cases, the CDPHE said it would evaluate authorization for \"ketamine use in Colorado, in the prehospital setting and associated outcomes at a statewide level.\"\n \"This more clearly defined scope will allow us to do a review that examines the health outcomes of ketamine administration by EMS providers in the field, broadly,\" CDPHE Executive Director Jill Hunsaker Ryan said. \"We will focus on the program as a whole rather than any individual incidents involving the use of ketamine administered in the field.\"\n Ketamine has been used illegally as a club drug. The medication, which is used in hospitals primarily as an anesthetic, generates an intense high and dissociative effects.\n EMS providers in Colorado need a waiver from the CDPHE to use ketamine in the field.\n The drug is allowed to be administered for patients \"with a presumptive diagnosis or excited delirium,\" a condition doctors have described to CNN as one in which a person is so violently agitated they can essentially exercise themselves to death.\n Paramedics administered ketamine to McClain after he was stopped one night in August 2019 by three White Aurora police officers as he walked home from a convenience store.\n A 911 called had reported a \"suspicious person,\" according to a police news release that said McClain \"resisted contact\" with officers before a struggle ensued.\n McClain is heard in footage from an officer's body camera telling the officers, \"I'm an introvert, please respect the boundaries that I am speaking.\"\n At one point, one officer is heard telling another, \"He just grabbed your gun dude.\" One officer tells McClain that he will \"bring my dog out and he's going to bite you\" if McClain keeps \"messing around.\"\n Video shows an officer wrestle McClain to the ground. A letter from the Adams County District Attorney said an officer placed McClain in a carotid hold, which restricts blood flow to the brain. McClain briefly lost consciousness, the letter said, but continued struggling after officers released the hold.\n Paramedics arrived and administered ketamine, the letter said. McClain was taken to a hospital but suffered a heart attack on the way, and he was declared brain dead three days later, the letter said.\n The autopsy conducted by the county coroner did not determine the cause of death but noted \"intense physical exertion and a narrow left coronary artery\" were contributing factors.\n The report noted McClain's history of asthma and the carotid hold, though the autopsy did not determine whether it contributed to McClain's death. The concentration of ketamine in his system was at a \"therapeutic level,\" the report said.\n The district attorney declined to file criminal charges at the time, but the case attracted renewed attention last summer after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.\n As protests took place across the country, demonstrations in the Denver suburb focused on McClain and his family's calls for justice, and Gov. Jared Polis tapped Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser to review the case.\n Weiser announced this month he was opening a grand jury investigation into McClain's death, \"an investigative tool that has the power to compel testimony from witnesses and require production of documents and other relevant information.\"\n CNN's Leslie Perrot, Alta Spells, Ray Sanchez, Steve Almasy and Melissa Alonso contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "For happy couples, Valentine's Day is an excuse for romance, often celebrated with extravagant dinners and thoughtful gifts.\n But on February 14, unhappy couples remember all the reasons they can't stand each other.\n That's why a Tennessee law firm is giving away free divorce representation to one lucky (unlucky?) client who just can't wait to say goodbye to a partner.\n The Powers Law Firm in Crossville will choose one person seeking a divorce to offer free legal services, including the court filing fees.\n \"There's a lot of people that stay married just because they can't afford it. Divorces are really expensive. Usually the cost starts from $1,150, and not everyone has that kind of money to drop off the bat,\" Timothy Sexton, a paralegal at the law firm, told CNN.\n \"After we've endured the coronavirus pandemic, lockdowns, a nation divided during election season, some people may have reached their breaking point and they need a way out so we are offering them an opportunity to move on with their lives,\" he said.\n Only Tennessee residents are eligible. Interested people should email their stories explaining why they want a divorce by February 15 -- the day after Valentine's Day. The winner will be selected February 19.\n The Powers Law Firm says the divorce must be agreed to by both parties and involve little or no child custody issues. The only cost not covered is a parent education class required for divorces involving minors.\n Among those who've already applied is a disabled elderly couple separated for 20 years who haven't been able to afford a divorce due to their limited income, Sexton said.\n \"We are a tight-knit community here and we don't like seeing people suffer, so if there's something we can do to help someone, we want to do it,\" he said.",

        "title": "Analysis: TV news is realigning, with Fox's ratings sagging and CNN's soaring",
        "body_text": "A realignment in TV news is under way. Fox News Channel's ratings have sagged ever since Election Day. And CNN's ratings have surged to historic levels.\n These shifts are related, but complicated. It's not as simple as \"X is up so Y is down.\" People who don't normally watch a lot of cable news are looking for reliable information about the pandemic, the presidential transition and the terror threat. CNN is benefiting and Fox is not.\n Furthermore, a big chunk of Fox's base audience was demoralized by Trump's loss in November and disheartened by the pro-Trump riot last week. Fox's average viewership levels are about 20% lower than they were before the election, even though overall TV news viewership is elevated due to the current combination of crises.\n A certain amount of short-lived audience erosion was expected for Fox in the event of a Biden victory, since the channel and its viewers were rooting for Trump.\n Fox is also under pressure from the right like never before, with channels like Newsmax and One America News chipping away at Fox's core audience.\n But this shift is bigger than Newsmax -- and it's longer-lasting than many TV observers anticipated.\n For Fox, it's extremely discomfiting not to be No. 1 all day, every day. Fox's lineup of right-wing talk shows -- a rage-fueled alternative to CNN, MSNBC and nightly newscasts -- has made the network all but untouchable for most of the last two decades. Fox has wielded its No. 1 status the way a controversial head coach touts a championship.\n But now, all of a sudden, it can't point to the scoreboard anymore. Since the day after the election, CNN has been No. 1 in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that the cable news business is built on.\n Fox's audience has always skewed older, so Fox has always had total viewer bragging rights, even when CNN notched victories in younger demographics. But for the past nine straight days, CNN has also been No. 1 in the total viewer race.\n This surge has been driven by the big news out of Washington, from the insurrection to the impeachment vote. January 6, which began with Senate runoff news and continued with the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol, was CNN's most-watched day in its history.\n MSNBC has been No. 2 many days, benefiting from some of the same factors but not nearly to the same extent.\n This month to date, CNN has averaged 2.08 million viewers throughout the day; MSNBC has averaged 1.74 million; and Fox has averaged 1.41 million. Even in prime time, when Fox is at its strongest, it has been stuck in third place. Already, CNN's post-election victories have enhanced CNN's position in the marketplace. The network has been running \"MOST WATCHED CABLE NEWS NETWORK\" ads on the air this week.\n So when you read about Rupert Murdoch reasserting himself at Fox, when you hear about schedule changes, when you see far-right rhetoric overtaking news coverage, the context is Fox's sudden fall.\n Where have Fox's fans gone? Networks frequently conduct audience research, so Fox probably has a pretty solid answer to that question. Fox sources say that some viewers have sampled Newsmax, yes, but many have just chosen to turn off the news altogether. They're watching Hallmark, HGTV or Netflix instead.\n I asked Hofstra communications school dean Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News and MSNBC executive, for his analysis on what has happened to the Fox base. He wrote back: \"Tristan Harris famously said that social networks are about 'affirmation, not information' -- and the same can be said about cable news, especially in prime time. But for the conservative media ecosystem, just what should be affirmed has suddenly become an existential question.\"\n \"The unified wall of support for Trump has splintered after last week's assault on the Capitol,\" Lukasiewicz said. \"Republicans are disagreeing with Republicans on the most basic questions: Should Trump be impeached? Should he be convicted? Does he bear responsibility for what happened? I suspect traditionally conservative audiences are bewildered and confused. Confusion is certainly apparent among many conservative media producers and commentators -- trying to find their footing as the story of the Capitol assault, and the President's reaction, keeps getting worse.\"\n True -- and let me just add, Fox is covering the daily revelations about the scale of the attack a whole lot less extensively than CNN or MSNBC. Fox is focusing on what it calls \"Big Tech censorship\" instead, but I strongly suspect that most people want news about the terror threat right now, not Twitter. Frankly, many Fox shows are running away from the news rather than reporting on it.\n Colby Hall listed his theories in this new Mediaite story. First: \"A historic news cycle \u2014 for the competition.\" Second: Fox's decision to de-emphasize the news division \"in favor of more opinion programming.\" Third: The opinion shows going \"all-in on conspiracies.\" Fourth: Fox being \"outflanked on the fringe right by OANN and Newsmax.\" Fifth: \"Message fatigue.\"\n No doubt some Fox fanatics will come home in the coming weeks, as Fox will serve up a steady diet of anti-Democrat stories. Historically, when crazed news cycles calm down, so do CNN's ratings. But the ratings data could also portend a more permanent shift in audience habits. That's one of the big questions in TV news circles right now: How long will CNN remain ahead of Fox?\n Another question: Is this realignment bigger than cable? CNN has also out-rated the broadcast networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) during across-the-board special coverage of the Georgia runoff races, the Capitol riot and the impeachment debate. During Wednesday's floor debate and vote, CNN was easily No. 1, with 3.8 million viewers in the afternoon, while the other networks each had 2.6 million viewers or fewer. It is a striking thing to see at the tail end of the Trump era, after four years of \"fake news\" slings and arrows, many of them directed at CNN.",

        "body_text": "Fighting institutions of power is as American as it gets.\n Throughout the history of this country, many have taken action in the form of demonstration to fight real and/or perceived injustice. However, until 2020, no demonstrator ever had to take to the streets with Covid-19 threatening them.\n Gathering in large groups, sometimes mask-free, isn't as big of a deal to some Americans if it means they will be able to vocalize their beliefs. It's a scene that's played out across the US in protests, riots and clashes with police throughout the pandemic.\n Psychologically, people identify with the issues they are fighting for and if they feel targeted or victimized, it causes them to want to act on that, according to Jay Van Bavel, an associate professor of psychology and neural science at New York University.\n \"(The) two big ingredients are transgression of a core moral values and the idea that your core identity group feels attacked, that's makes one hell of a cocktail,\" he said. \"Then you add one or two more ingredients in it and then you explode.\"\n The catalyst for these explosions may be different for groups depending on political leanings, identity and culture.\n Researchers who have studied morality have found people are willing to incur costs to take a stance, Van Bavel told CNN.\n \"What happens when we see something that's morally wrong, we see what's called a moral imperative, which means we feel compelled to do something about it,\" Van Bavel said. \"This isn't just an American thing, look at Gandhi in India and Nelson Mandela. When people think something is morally unjust people are willing to go to incredible lengths to put themselves in harms way to do something about it.\"\n Activists who spoke to CNN often said police brutality and racism were issues long before Covid-19 hit the US, so their motivation to fight said injustices were not swayed by the virus.\n People took to the streets last summer calling for police reform after the repeated deaths of Black people -- like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor -- at the hands of police.\n \"What's a bigger threat? Us getting killed as African American men or just the cold or the flu?\" said Gregory Bennett Jr., a Wisconsin activist and founder of Peace in the Streets Kenosha Inc. \"Covid-19 has been around before, but race has been around way longer.\"\n It's been proven that Covid-19 is more lethal than the cold or flu.\n Bennett was very outspoken during demonstrations following the shooting of Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed after being shot in the back seven times on August 23, 2020.\n Fighting for what's to be heard right was not just limited to last summer's protesters, either. Another group of people recently gathered in Washington, DC, last week to protest the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's election victory. The protest eventually turned into a very violent riot that left five dead.\n \"We're losing our freedoms,\" one man told CNN January 6 during the riots at the Capitol.\n Many who spoke to CNN that day said they believed the election was stolen.\n \"Even if they're there for different moral reasons, they're still there for a moral reason and that's what the same,\" Van Bavel said on the protests last summer and the riots in DC.\n He emphasized the stark difference between the motivations of both movements and what participants in each thought was moral.\n Van Bavel added researchers have found that when people harm others in the sake of morality, they often do not believe they are doing anything wrong.\n \"A lot of time people think they're doing it for a virtuous reason,\" he said.\n Some activists told CNN they were very cognizant of social distancing and wearing masks.\n A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that during the summer protests against police brutality didn't lead to a jump in coronavirus cases.\n Bennett, of Peace in the Streets Kenosha Inc., told CNN his organization does educate people on the risks of Covid-19.\n \"We educated people on Covid and we had them social distanced while protesting,\" he said. \"We are all conscience of Covid-19, but Covid-19 hasn't been hanging us in trees, killing our children and women and murdering us.\"\n Vaun Mayes, a Wisconsin-based activist with Community Task Force MKE, told CNN his organization takes Covid-19 as seriously as it does police shootings.\n His organization led a number of initiatives to get food and Covid-19 testing to citizens.\n \"As an activist, our everyday work has been trying to hold people up and support families throughout the Covid epidemic as well,\" he said.\n Some who gather don't see Covid-19 as a real threat to their safety.\n \"A lot of people who are out there risking don't believe they're risking their lives,\" said Howard Lavine, the associate dean of social sciences at the the University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts.\n \"Most people are aware of the reality and death toll of Covid, somehow they are not ranking it as a very serious worry.\"\n But during the recent riots in Washington, many were seen not wearing masks. Because of this, the event was likely a \"surge event,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield said in a January 8 interview with McClatchy new service.\n \"I do think you have to anticipate that this is another surge event. You had largely unmasked individuals in a non-distanced fashion, who were all through the Capitol,\" Redfield said.\n Last summer, Redfield expressed similar concerns over Covid spreading amid nationwide protests.\n Anyone who participated in protests should \"highly consider\" getting tested, he said in June of 2020.\n \"I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,\" Redfield said during a June hearing on the coronavirus response. He said the risk of infection is higher in major cities where there's been significant transmission.\n To prevent transmission, Redfield suggested at the time that people who attend protests tell their loved ones that they were out in public and get tested within three to seven days.\n Outside of protests and riots, many people have just missed the feeling of being around others.\n \"We have strong needs to be with other people,\" Lavine said. \"For many of us that has been interrupted because we've been told the virus spreads from person to person.\"\n That was apparent during the summer holidays last year, when there were spikes after Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day.\n Winter holidays -- when people held gatherings for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve -- also led to a surge in Covid-19 cases.\n Then there's just the overall celebrations -- there were many times over the last year revelers took to the streets and celebrated without wearing masks or social distancing.\n Back in October, after the Los Angeles Dodgers and Lakers won championships, Los Angeles Health Director Barbara Ferrer said anyone who celebrated with others without wearing a face covering or practicing social distancing should take precautions.\n She attributed an increase in cases partly to gatherings for sports events and celebrations for the two teams. One member of the Dodgers even contracted Covid-19.\n More recently, after Alabama defeated Ohio State in the college football national championship, hundreds of revelers packed several blocks of University Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, celebrating the win on a strip known for its bars and restaurants near the western edge of campus.\n Many of the postgame revelers were not wearing face coverings, images on social media showed.\n CNN's Jill Martin and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.",

        "title": "The 15 most notable lies of Donald Trump's presidency",
        "body_text": "Trying to pick the most notable lies from Donald Trump's presidency is like trying to pick the most notable pieces of junk from the town dump.\n There's just so much ugly garbage to sift through before you can make a decision.\n But I'm qualified for the dirty job. I fact checked every word uttered by this President from his inauguration day in January 2017 until September 2020 -- when the daily number of lies got so unmanageably high that I had to start taking a pass on some of his remarks to preserve my health.\n Trump got even worse after November 3. Since then, he has spent the final months of what has been a wildly dishonest presidency on a relentless and dangerous lying spree about the election he lost.\n As the country grapples with the deadly consequences of this deception, I've selected the 15 Trump lies that stand out to me from his four years in power -- for their importance, for their egregiousness, for their absurdity, or for what they say about the man.\n Trump began his presidency by lying about the weather.\n It rained during Trump's inaugural address. Then, at a celebratory ball later that day, Trump told the crowd that the rain \"just never came\" until he finished talking and went inside, at which point \"it poured.\"\n This was the first lie of Trump's presidency. Like his lies that same week about his inauguration crowd, it hinted at what would come next.\n The President would say things that we could see with our own eyes were not true. And he would often do this brazen lying for no apparent strategic reason.\n This was more like a family of lies than a single lie. But each one -- the lie that the virus was equivalent to the flu; the lie that the situation was \"totally under control\"; the lie that the virus was \"disappearing\" -- suggested to Americans that they didn't have to change much about their usual behavior.\n A year into the crisis, more than 386,000 Americans have died from the virus.\n We can't say with precision how the crisis would have unfolded differently if Trump had been more truthful. But it's reasonable to venture that his dishonesty led to a significant number of deaths.\n Trump tweeted in 2019 that Alabama was one of the states at greater risk from Hurricane Dorian than had been initially forecast. The federal weather office in Birmingham then tweeted that, actually, Alabama would be unaffected by the storm.\n Not great, but fixable fast with a simple White House correction. Trump, however, is so congenitally unwilling to admit error that he embarked on an increasingly farcical campaign to prove that his incorrect Alabama tweet was actually correct, eventually showcasing a hurricane map that was crudely altered with a Sharpie.\n The slapstick might have been funny had White House officials not leaped into action behind the scenes to try to pressure federal weather experts into saying he was right and they were wrong. The saga proved that Trump was not some lone liar: he was backed by an entire powerful apparatus willing to fight for his fabrications.\n When I emailed the Boy Scouts of America in 2017 about Trump's claim that \"the head of the Boy Scouts\" had called him to say that his bizarrely political address to the Scouts' National Jamboree was \"the greatest speech that was ever made to them,\" I didn't expect a reply. One of the hardest things about fact checking Trump was that a lot of people he lied about did not think it was in their interest to be quoted publicly contradicting a vengeful president.\n The Boy Scouts did. A senior Scouts source -- a phrase I never expected to have to type as a political reporter in Washington, DC -- confirmed to me that no call ever happened.\n Yep, the President of the United States was lying about the Boy Scouts.\n At a White House event in 2019, Trump grossly distorted a 2013 quote from Rep. Ilhan Omar to try to get his supporters to believe that the Minnesota Democrat had expressed support for the terrorist group al Qaeda.\n Trump went on to deliver additional bigoted attacks against Omar in the following months. But it's hard to imagine a more vile lie for the President to tell about a Muslim official -- who had already been getting death threats -- than a smear that makes her sound pro-terrorist.\n Trump, an incorrigible exaggerator, rarely chose to use an accurate number when he could instead use an inaccurate bigger number. So he said well over 100 times that, before his presidency, the US for years had a $500 billion annual trade deficit with China -- though the actual pre-Trump deficit never even reached $400 billion.\n Trump made versions of the \"$500 billion\" claim so many times that it became almost physically painful for me to fact check it any more.\n They were almost always male. They were almost always large. They were almost always blue-collar. And, according to the President, they kept walking up to him crying tears of gratitude -- even though they had almost always not previously cried for years.\n Trump's series of Tears Stories -- which sometimes doubled as \"Sir\" Stories -- helped me understand his lying as a kind of performance art.\n The stories were oddly grandiose, like something you'd hear from a two-bit foreign strongman. They were also pure shtick. Trump was like a touring stand-up comic, refining and re-using his favored dishonesty bits until they stopped working for him.\n We've established that Trump was not your traditional political liar. One of his distinguishing features is that he lied pointlessly, dissembling about trivial subjects for trivial reasons.\n But he also lied when he needed to. When he told reporters on Air Force One in 2018 that he did not know about a $130,000 payment to porn performer Stormy Daniels and that he did not know where his then-attorney Michael Cohen got the money for the payment, it was both audacious -- Trump knew, because he had personally reimbursed Cohen -- and kind of conventional: the President was lying to try to get himself out of a tawdry scandal.\n Much of Trump's lying was clumsy, half-baked. Some of it was almost art. Here's what he told NBC's Chuck Todd in 2019 about his widely controversial policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border: \"You know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it.\"\n Yes, Trump signed a 2018 order to end the family separation policy. What he did not mention to Todd is that what he had ended was his own policy -- a plan announced by his own attorney general that had made family separation standard rather than occasional, as it had been under Obama.\n All of Trump's words in those two sentences to Todd were accurate in themselves. But he was lying because of what he left out.\n Trump's re-election campaign was consistently and consciously dishonest, especially in its attempts to cast Joe Biden as a frightening radical.  When Trump claimed in September that Biden would destroy protections for people with pre-existing health conditions -- though the Obama-Biden administration created the protections, though the protections were overwhelmingly popular, though Biden was running on preserving them, and though Trump himself had tried repeatedly to weaken them -- Trump was not merely lying but turning reality upside down.\n Trump could have told a perfectly good factual story about the Veterans Choice health care program Obama signed into law in 2014: it wasn't good enough, so he replaced it with a more expansive program he signed into law in 2018.\n That's not the story he did tell -- whether out of policy ignorance, a desire to erase Obama's legacy, or simply because he is a liar. Instead, he claimed over and over -- more than 160 times before I lost count -- that he is the one who got the Veterans Choice program passed after other presidents tried and failed for years.\n And why not stretch? He knew he probably wouldn't be challenged by a press corps drowning in other Trump drama. It wasn't until August 2020 that he was asked about the lie to his face.\n He promptly left the room.\n It was a problem for the country that the President was not only a conspiracy theorist himself but immersed in conspiracy culture, regularly stumbling upon ludicrous claims and then sharing them as fact.\n For such a fierce critic of the media's use of anonymous sources, Trump sure liked to use a lot of unnamed sources himself. His stories were full of nonsense he attributed to \"people\" or that he claimed \"they\" say. One of the most bonkers \"they say\" items: his 2019 declaration that \"they say\" the noise from windmills \"causes cancer.\"\n After Trump amplified another conspiracy lie in 2020, NBC's Savannah Guthrie admonished him by saying that \"you're not, like, someone's crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever.\"\n Except he was, until Twitter took down his account.\n Trump's big health care plan was eternally coming in \"two weeks.\" So were a bunch of other plans and announcements.\n Trump is, at his core, a huckster. Every moment of his presidency was a chance for him to sell someone on something, whether or not that something actually existed. And if they asked when they could actually see the magic elixir he said was being brewed just over there behind the curtain, he would just have to delay them until they forgot about it.\n Trump has never lived in Michigan. Why would he have been named Michigan's Man of the Year years before his presidency?\n He wouldn't have been. He wasn't. And yet this lie he appeared to have invented in the final week of his 2016 campaign became a staple of his 2020 campaign, repeated at Michigan rally after rally.\n It's so illustrative because it makes so little sense.\n Trump's long White House campaign against verifiable reality has culminated with his lie that he is the true winner of the 2020 presidential election he clearly, certifiably and fairly lost.\n To many of us, it's ludicrous nonsense. But to millions of deluded Americans, it's the truth. And it has now gotten people killed.\n The nation's truth problem, clearly, isn't just a Trump problem. With this last blizzard of deception and the Capitol insurrection it fomented, Trump has shown us, once more, just how detached from reality much of his political base has become -- or always was.",

        "title": "'Batwoman' gets a new lead, but Season 2 looks like the same flawed show",
        "body_text": "After a first season that never quite got off the ground creatively, \"Batwoman\" announced that original star Ruby Rose would be leaving but that the series would hang around without her. The contortions necessary to arrange that baton (or Batarang) pass mostly fizzle in the opening episodes, fueling a sense that this CW drama might be flying on fumes.\n Without giving anything away, the premiere must account for the sudden absence of Rose's Kate Kane. Instead of recasting or starting from scratch, the producers opted to put the batsuit on a new character, Ryan Wilder (Javicia Leslie), shoehorning her into the show's existing world.\n Passing the cape to an African-American star adds to the series' trailblazing, after introducing the first lesbian lead in a DC superhero program. But incorporating a new Batwoman while keeping the rest of the show intact proves a difficult juggling act.\n During a conference call with reporters on Friday, executive producer Caroline Dries said the challenge was to integrate the Ryan character in a way that \"feels organic\" while maintaining the show's other qualities.\n Still, becoming Batwoman really ought to be about more than the outfit, inasmuch as the big guy himself underwent rigorous preparation before taking his vigilante act into the Gotham streets. Given the need to maintain some semblance of action while breaking in a replacement, the first two episodes basically race through those steps.\n Ryan does come with a back story that includes a motivation for taking down the show's main villain, the psychotic Alice (Rachel Skarsten). Yet that still requires rather hasty on-the-job training while dealing with the emotional fallout from Kate's absence.\n On the plus side, the novelty of a new star does offer the chance of earning a second look from viewers who sampled the show and were unimpressed. Who knows, the storytelling might settle down as the season progresses.\n The Batman franchise obviously remains one of DC's crown jewels, so discarding a series associated with it isn't a decision made lightly. Warner Bros. (like CNN, part of WarnerMedia) has become more aggressive about bringing Superman and Batman offshoots to TV, including \"Supergirl\" and \"Superman & Lois,\" which will make its debut in February.\n At the very least, continuing the story creates the prospect of not leaving the show's fans dangling. But more than anything, the second season of \"Batwoman\" feels like an on-the-fly salvage project because that's easier -- or perhaps less risky -- than the alternatives.\n \"The city's gonna need a Batwoman,\" one of Kate's cohort says early on.\n Whether TV needs one could be another matter. Because even with a new caped crusader, \"Batwoman,\" for better or worse, basically looks like the same old show.\n \"Batwoman\" returns Jan. 17 at 8 p.m. on the CW. The network is part-owned by WarnerMedia.",
